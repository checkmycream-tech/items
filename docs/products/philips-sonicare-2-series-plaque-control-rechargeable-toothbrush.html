            <li>My wife loved it and she got one for herself</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush does do a good job of cleaning your teeth.</li>

            <li>Don&#x27;t know if the unit is good because I am not the one using it</li>
            <li>and it does a good job on my teeth.</li>

            <li>Over all good product no problems.</li>

            <li>the performance was good, dentist recommended it</li>
            <li>and he thinks the performance is superior than Oral B.</li>

            <li>When I went for my routine cleaning, the dentist noted how great my teeth looked, and asked if I&#x27;d been flossing more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  </li>

            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>This brush is amazing...</li>
            <li>It is nice.</li>
            <li>It does have a 2 minute timer which is nice.</li>
            <li>I also own an E-series Sonicare, and the Series 2 seems to be lower quality.</li>
            <li>i own it</li>
            <li>Not as nice as the newer numbers, 69 series.</li>
            <li>I have no intentions of paying my own money to return a $40 product, and I&#x27;m DONE with Sonicare.    </li>
            <li>I looked for something affordable and effective.</li>
            <li>I saw the Sonicare HX6211/30 2 Series on Amazon, and liked what I read about the item</li>
            <li>And I also have the Quadpacer which is kind of helpful</li>
            <li>Nice, works as stated.</li>
            <li>I am returning it, but will get another Phillips Sonicare toothbrush because I have always liked them.</li>
            <li>it is nice ,and I like it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it .</li>
            <li>Nice effective cleaning</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with how fast and vigorous it is.  </li>
            <li>However, it lasts forever and it makes my teeth feel very clean!</li>
            <li>It gives a more thorough and better clean, especially good for removing tartar.  </li>
            <li>DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>My mouth never felt so clean and my lady checkup wad great.</li>
            <li>After using is for 1 full week I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Very pleased :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with my recent purchase of this item, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality toothbrush at a great price.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a wonderful job scrubbing my teeth super clean.  </li>
            <li>Works great and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to change heads if you want to share with family members.</li>
            <li>Very strong and hurt.  </li>
            <li>It is very good and keeps the charge very well.</li>
            <li>Some I&#x27;ve liked better that others.  </li>
            <li>Funtion is nice and delivery is ok</li>
            <li>I am old school and always thought a hand brush was the best.</li>
            <li>It is an interesting process, but my dentist assures me it is an effective one.</li>
            <li>I had not come from a better toothbrush, I might think this one was amazing.  </li>
            <li>Experience so far is awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any kind of electric toothbrush and wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it, but a friend just raved about hers.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush, easy to handle, does a good job.</li>
            <li>Easy fix, I thought!  </li>
            <li>The price is fair and I just needed it to clean my teeth &amp; gums.</li>
            <li>So, it took me a good 4 minutes of brushing before I felt properly clean.</li>
            <li>Great experience all around and delivery was very expeditious!</li>
            <li>and I was happy with the first two.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>Works Great,  And The Price Was More Than Reasonable!</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t come a part as easy and doesn&#x27;t have the handy travel case.</li>
            <li>I notice the cleaner feel to my teeth after brushing, which tends to make me want to brush more</li>
            <li>RECEIVED MY PHILLIPS SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH, I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>In this age I think most people should have access to a powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Sonicare has been my favorite teeth cleaning instrument for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>It feels more like the battery operated models from Sonicare&#x27;s competitors.  </li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t like the 14 day mode, that is able to be shut off.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the best dental checkups  since starting to use the Sonicare</li>
            <li>Have most of my extended family now using Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with some practice, I&#x27;ll quit doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And have been using for more than 9 months now</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>* Most of the vibration is concentrated towards the bottom of the handle rather than at the brush head.  </li>
            <li>I really love this thing.</li>
            <li>Love love..</li>
            <li>Have not been able to find another one like it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>your hands/body doesn’t absorb most of the vibrations, rather it goes where it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>This model is so much better.</li>
            <li>My gums are better than ever</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok - had others that made my mouth feel cleaner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I was going to spend more on an Oral B power brush, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Oral B has outstanding warranty service if anything happens to your brush as well.</li>
            <li>This version of the toothbrush is way better than the e-series.</li>
            <li>I enjoy every time I use this amazing toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it --</li>
            <li>I am also very happy with the smaller gum care brush head that came with it.</li>
            <li>In fact, I may order a couple more</li>
            <li>I love how you can keep using it for a couple of weeks even before it needs another charge too.</li>
            <li>So of course I wanted to get it and rub it in his face that mine was much better than his, BUT that was not the</li>
            <li>the price is ok, i like it</li>
            <li>It probably cost them more money to NOT put this feature in that it does to add it.</li>
            <li>Love.  </li>
            <li>Okay...</li>
            <li>there are so many options</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, way better than manual brushing.</li>
            <li>My friends told me it would be better then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>My breath smells better 4.</li>
            <li>My teeth def look better, and that&#x27;s coming from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>Two months later I had the best dentist appointment of my life--no cavities, increased gum health, and</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied with the Sonicare I ordered.  </li>
            <li>We love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush, after getting use to the vibration.  </li>
            <li>It had a better brush head and more vigorous brushing.</li>
            <li>It feels like it can remove plaque, but I&#x27;ll have to wait until I visit the dentist to be sure.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>I AM PLEASED WITH MY PHILIPS SONICARE PURCHASE.  </li>
            <li>Was pleased with the price.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>Love the tooth brush  </li>
            <li>That should be longer or you should be able to change it.</li>
            <li>His is still working OK.  </li>
            <li>So have to order more.</li>
            <li>I love Sonicare toothbrushes, and have bought Phillips brand ones for years.</li>
            <li>Also, the charger is so cheap and lightweight, the toothbrush falls out of the charger onto the floor!</li>
            <li>Wonderful brush, this is my third one.</li>
            <li>Had Sonicare for many years</li>
            <li>The model numbers are changed when they add more bells and whistles to the charger or stand or cleaner or....  </li>
            <li>Have been a sonicare customer for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>Hope it does a better job with my gums and teeth than the rotary electric that I had been using.</li>
            <li>Brushing effect is good, worth having</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for over 10 years and love them....</li>
            <li>The product came in a regular box but I am still very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I also love the automatic cut off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>GREAT &#x27;BASIC&#x27; electric toothbrush, which is really ALL that is needed for great dental hygiene!</li>
            <li>Did my research on all SonicCare models before buying and this one does the job and had the most flexibility for brush head replacements.</li>
            <li>Probably best overall value in a Sonicare</li>
            <li>Cleans my teeth much better than a brush.</li>
            <li>I ordered this newer model and could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>There are much better options in the Sonicare line.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love my sonic.....</li>
            <li>I do like the job it does cleaning my teeth, much better than brushing alone.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s ok for me.</li>
            <li>It does the cleaning better than by hand.</li>
            <li>Cavities cost more than this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;NOT SURE</li>
            <li>The price is much more competitive.</li>
            <li>One more thing, I remove my glasses when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>I really love my Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Does a much better job of cleaning etc.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This feels a bit like it is vibrating your insides, but does an amazingly good job of leaving my teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It is not as nice as my original</li>
            <li>sonic vibration that is amazingly efficive in getting teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li>but want results brush that tung  nice and clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an experienced sonicare user - having had a high end model for about 5 years.  </li>
            <li>The brush is perfect for teens because it only has the on/off button, and a thicker handle that is easy to grip.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush, strong and powerful.</li>
            <li>Very clean feeling mouth &amp; teeth;</li>
            <li>Very clean and efficient brushing.</li>
            <li>And my tooth is very clean after use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This seems to do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>I have long used Sonicare toothbrushes, and this one is the best value yet.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job and holds a charge for a long time so it travels well.  </li>
            <li>Who would ever think a person could get excited about a toothbrush?!  </li>
            <li>It works very nicely, but it sure is loud!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use, cleaning is better than with a manual toothbrush, and I have gotten used to the &amp;#34;mosquito-mouth&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Love the styling of this brush, makes it easy to turn while brushing the gum line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay; my oral b toothbrush was just as good with much lower cost.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Sonicare brush, which was great &amp; lasted for many years.</li>
            <li>I finally found a fantastic electric toothbrush &amp; it works great!</li>
            <li>noise is very small,not like the others said it very loud,it a happy order on amazon!</li>
            <li>Better than expected and great price!</li>
            <li>Makes your&lt;br /&gt;teeth feel so clean and helps with gum care!</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth tingly clean!</li>
            <li>My teeth have never been so clean!  </li>
            <li>Teeth look  and feel really clean!</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is fine, although I haven&#x27;t been able to notice the timing feature.</li>
            <li>a great gift for a 14 year old</li>
            <li>Great brush but way too loud and brush</li>
            <li>there is some better deals available</li>
            <li>When I got it and began to use it, I really enjoyed how light weight it was to use and</li>
            <li>came to think it would fit better ...</li>
            <li>Powerful and effective.  </li>
            <li>good product but more cheaply made than the older one I had</li>
            <li>The model I&#x27;m reviewing had a good promotion ($10 off the normal price), so I figured this was a great time to replace my old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will update my review when or if any significant changes occur for me with he brush.</li>
            <li>These turned out to be better than the one that came with the original toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very appreciative of the preset ramp up period too, no thinking, just brushing, while it slowly takes 10 fully brush cycles to hit max sonicare cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, and this gets my teeth sparkling clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate, but covering one&#x27;s mouth when using saves spraying all over self and mirrors.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and improved brushing.</li>
            <li>Perhaps that&#x27;s why it has such great reviews, since it&#x27;s an entry level Sonicare and most people buying this came from a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love how clean my teeth and gums feel.</li>
            <li>It feels more powerful and better quality than those battery powered toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to recharge</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now, and love the way it makes my mouth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that I just have a defective one, but since the easy start feature does not seem to be working on mine, I&#x27;m returning it.  </li>
            <li>The package was great to open, nothing to swear at or cut apart, they came charged and just recommended a 2 hour charge to top off before I started to use.  </li>
            <li>her teeth are more clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>my teeth feel so clean :)</li>
            <li>It gives me a much better clean then a manual one.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning power not as good as older unit.</li>
            <li>The vibrations are SO strong, I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>The ultrasonic brush vibrations are not too strong, so no worries that he will knock off a bracket while using this brush.</li>
            <li>the vibrator is too strong</li>
            <li>Vibration strong</li>
            <li>The vibration was too strong - hurt my teeth to use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t just make a cheap one to reach more people, make sure it stands up to functionality first!</li>
            <li>Some fine stains even clean off better with this brush off and used as a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sonicare is a fine product</li>
            <li>Called it&#x27;s customer service and be told they won&#x27;t replace it if it&#x27;s still working fine.</li>
            <li>If I remove the brush, it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I like it just fine.</li>
            <li>This tooth brush works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I also use this in the shower, and it works fine.</li>
            <li>Everything is fine about the toothbrush</li>
            <li>I got the economy model, and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>The product is fine, I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years.</li>
            <li>Cleans fine.</li>
            <li>It is strong, so it isn&#x27;t so comfortable, but can be accept.</li>
            <li>However, this deal, especially with Amazon Prime&#x27;s free shipping, is better than what I can get in my own office!</li>
            <li>Easy to charge, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush but not as good as my previous Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It seems to work fine just a louder buzzing sound.  </li>
            <li>It does not come with a travelling case, but fortunately it fits just fine in the one I already had.  </li>
            <li>I will be happy since I only paid $50 for it.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush head on mine doesn&#x27;t fit all the way.</li>
            <li>Plus, I have that &amp;#34;fresh from the hygienist&amp;#34; smooth teeth feel.</li>
            <li>Overall great deal and product</li>
            <li>fabulous.</li>
            <li>Cost was 39.99 plus there was a $10.00 coupon so 29.99 plus free shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;E-Cron around $10.00 Free delivery</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>and my teeth feel sooo smooth after&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s better at brushing now, but it still doesn&#x27;t feel as effective as the Healthy White.</li>
            <li>I confirmed this with Philips Customer Service.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH TRANSACTION.</li>
            <li>Light and I like the fact that gives you a built in timer.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and cheaply performs.  </li>
            <li>Works great and is very quiet.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Go with the Easy Clean Hx/6511/34 if you want a quieter toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So I go to purchase this unit at Walgreens, great packaging and such....</li>
            <li>Light weight and get the job done.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap for a</li>
            <li>well.. it was cheap and it does work.</li>
            <li>You can take off the brush portion easily and clean out any tooth paste etc from the handle/brush connection point.</li>
            <li>This is a really cheaply made toothbrush.</li>
            <li>light don;t always come on when charging</li>
            <li>Please, folks, do not base your opinion of Sonicare on this model.....</li>
            <li>This model is noisey, buzzy, slippey, and has a cheap plastic</li>
            <li>I have a 67xx series and enjoy that one.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Philips Sonicare and it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with no inaccessible areas.  </li>
            <li>Just feels and sounds really cheap.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend $50 on something so seemingly trivial as a toothbrush I could get for free from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li>while better than a non mechanic toothbrush, very noticeable drop-off vs the better Sonicare products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>and so far is just as good.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t care about the loud noise, this model might be good for you if you are looking for a low-cost entry</li>
            <li>In the end, it&#x27;s not as good as the old model.  </li>
            <li>The build quality is good but the brushing action feels &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2, 1 would not charge after 3 month, amazon replaced it and so far so good.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels super clean!</li>
            <li>Been using Sonicare for years and this version is lighter, more comfortable - just right.</li>
            <li>The easystart feature did not work on mine, even after working with customer support from Philips to make sure I was doing it right.</li>
            <li>I turned off the \\&quot;Easy Start\\&quot; feature so the toothbrush would be brushing at full speed.</li>
            <li>; THERE IS NO WAY that you can ever come close to getting your teeth as clean as can be quickly done with a Philips Sonicare electric tooth brush!  </li>
            <li>Very powerful toothbrush</li>
            <li>Super strong sonic power.  </li>
            <li>He is enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very useful for me to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>My original Sonicare toothbrush went kaput</li>
            <li>I picked this up for 40 dollars and it is worth it!</li>
            <li>Pleased with the first one; bought another.</li>
            <li>My original was a version with 4 speed settings that cost over $100.</li>
            <li>I pretty sure it was defective.</li>
            <li>I was sure it was going to be awesome, but now I&#x27;ve realized that Sonicare is like all other companies and most likely has people making 5-star bogus reviews that are lies.</li>
            <li>would recommend if you want a toothbrush that can significantly reduce plaque build up.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is much lighter in weight, is more quiet, and does a great job cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>This ToothBrush is in fact unique.</li>
            <li>my original E-Series did.</li>
            <li>Not as hefty as the original SONICARE, so will have to see how well it holds up.</li>
            <li>Takes practice, but worth it!</li>
            <li>Works great and holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth wonderfully clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>Leaves teeth clean and mouth fresh!  </li>
            <li>New one solved the problem I was having and now it stands up on its own.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the squeaky clean feel like the diamond model or</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Sonicare without all the bells and whistles that just does what a toothbrush should do:  clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>Leaves teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Works quite and teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>my teeth do not feel thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to take apart to clean....</li>
            <li>I keep running my tongue over my teeth because they feel so clean, even on the backsides.</li>
            <li>Easier to clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after brushing with a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Dentist clean.</li>
            <li>the pilot lamp is useless.and my tooth are not cleared as clean as description</li>
            <li>My teeth and tongue feel so clean after brushing with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>brush doesn&#x27;t mount cleanly with unit, thus causing noisy vibration  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never been this clean with my d manu brush.  </li>
            <li>My teeth look and feel extremely clean after each use.</li>
            <li>My teeth always feel so clean.</li>
            <li>However I missed the Sonicare because the Oral B just doesn&#x27;t seem to get my teeth or gum line as clean.</li>
            <li>teeth feel clean again along with my gums.  </li>
            <li>Good, easy to use, long battery life.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to use, and it is economic and affordable</li>
            <li>Dad was right!</li>
            <li>Works great as expected.</li>
            <li>JUST CAN&#x27;T SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT IT.  </li>
            <li>but we just have not had good luck with them lasting longer than a year or two...</li>
            <li>i love how fast it removes plaque.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>The E-series cleans better and is much quieter.  </li>
            <li>Battery started not taking a full charge about a month ago.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>But it is good for the extra bathroom.</li>
            <li>but my teeth never felt this good after being brushed.</li>
            <li>This is a good basic brush.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this toothbrush so much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need all the features of the Flexcare and the reviews indicated this was a good basic sonicare technology.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, and I don&#x27;t feel the tingling too much.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I have it because I wasn&#x27;t convinced a sonic would make that much of a difference</li>
            <li>Good brush, my 2nd one.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much I got one for my boyfriend</li>
            <li>I like the feeling of clean teeth which is much better than the older toothbrush gave.</li>
            <li>, my old one gave an audible beep every 30 seconds during the 2 minute brushing time, so it was easy to brush top front/back &amp; bottom front/back sections of my mouth for 30 seconds each.</li>
            <li>Changing the brush is easy peezy, and it&#x27;s proven to be pretty durable along with effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>much prefer the older unit which was bought many many years ago.  </li>
            <li>This is for first time users that aren&#x27;t used to strong vibrations in their mouth.  </li>
            <li>This brush just does so much more than normal brushing can, it makes your teeth so clean they feel squeaky.</li>
            <li>Great price without all the bells and whistles like other models.  </li>
            <li>I have not tried any other electric toothbrushes, but this one works great</li>
            <li>my teeth have never been cleaner with no tarter buildup after hygienist cleaned them; #2 it forces me to brush for 2 minutes before it turns off; #3 it removes virtually all the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; between teeth - flossing rarely gets anything more; #4 took on a week trip but forgot charger - no problem as it lasted all week with 2 brushings per day; #5 use briefly on tongue and it feels much more refreshed and clean afterward.  </li>
            <li>It makes my teeth so fresh and clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an older stye Sonicare essence toothbrush for many years.  </li>
            <li>But again, I love my HX6530 model and will most likely just get another one of those.</li>
            <li>With the older model, the brush heads vibrate with a slightly greater amplitude.  </li>
            <li>The older \\&quot;screw on cap with magnets suspended in air\\&quot; is more quite.    </li>
            <li>went away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I replaced an older model, and this is better.  </li>
            <li>And unbelievably quick shipping.</li>
            <li>the head is soft and very easy to replace the head.</li>
            <li>My old toothbrush had a very strong vibration that did not stop once in contact with my teeth.  </li>
            <li>(yes, she still has most of her own teeth, other than a couple she had implanted) cleaner than they&#x27;ve felt in months.  </li>
            <li>Both toothbrushes worked great, and the only difference between this version and the healthy white are the &amp;#34;features&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>One rep suggested the Easy Clean or Healthy White products as quieter than the 2 Series.  </li>
            <li>After about a week I was pretty much comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li>Much more gentle and effective than brushing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I did brush with it once and the noise went away as long as you applied a good amount of pressure on the brush.</li>
            <li>Love it, my mouth feels extra clean!</li>
            <li>A new improved , more stream-lined model</li>
            <li>I love how my teeth feel after brushing with my new Philips Sonicare tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It seems to me that they decided to make more profit by making the new design cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Like this model much better than the old e-series!</li>
            <li>My oral b was higher quality but this item still gets the job done!</li>
            <li>Price was very competitive!!</li>
            <li>First time using an electric toothbrush, I&#x27;m not using a manual one ever again!</li>
            <li>Overall, happy with this new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so I ordered 8 replacement brushes that work fine and are much cheaper in price than the philips heads.</li>
            <li>Everything worked fine  but the vibration tickled my tongue so much when I accidentally touched it, I gave it to my wife.</li>
            <li>When working at the case of a large resonant sound</li>
            <li>meet and exceeded all my expectation , great little toothbrush</li>
            <li>Great brush, though takes a little while to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>This little powerhouse of a toothbrush does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Very good, to brush cleaner than ordinary toothbrush, it is suitable for my kind of late &amp;#34;lazy cancer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>However, it shares the central and most important feature with the pricier Philips models:</li>
            <li>Also, consider that the old style Elites still remains to provide the most vibration intensity for your teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li>So far I love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Better than old brush.  </li>
            <li>As a dental professional, I am able to get a discount on the toothbrushes my office sells.</li>
            <li>An older person will find this brush easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>All in all, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>For what I payed for it I am not unhappy.  </li>
            <li>Most likely too much pressure for safe brushing.</li>
            <li>Simple and highly effective.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what they did with this latest version, but it&#x27;s LOUD, obnoxiously so, and vibrates uncontrollably.</li>
            <li>The cycle is 2 minutes which is plenty of time to leave you with a fresh mouth and teeth that feel just as though you came from the dentist after a cleaning.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and effective.  </li>
            <li>i loved it so much I ordered again for my teen!</li>
            <li>but it is worth every penny</li>
            <li>It does an even better job than my old one.</li>
            <li>It is so powerful it can rattle my teeth if I bump my teeth with the handle.  </li>
            <li>Not too powerful as to feel as if your mouth has been assaulted after use from the vibration.</li>
            <li>The payoff is worth the patience.</li>
            <li>Works well, but even after a couple months of use doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful.</li>
            <li>Its way powerful than what the teeth can handle.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as powerful as it is</li>
            <li>Vibrates a lot more than my old version.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased, as well.  </li>
            <li>very effective, a little noisy,</li>
            <li>They are MUCH louder than the other Sonicares I&#x27;ve experienced.  </li>
            <li>I thought it didn&#x27;t clean as well as the Healthy White model</li>
            <li>tooth brush has as much power as the older models perhaps a bit more.  </li>
            <li>The lithium battery powered ones are better at cleaning since the battery voltage and current lasts in terms of keeping the oscillation at an acceptable level to actually clean</li>
            <li>I really like this design better than the older one I had.</li>
            <li>Works well, vibration is very strong, might be to much if you have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>The head on it is a more compact head than many are and is extremely important when you have a small mouth.</li>
            <li>The sonicare does not eliminate flossing and other good dental hygine.</li>
            <li>it came in without boxes, the other brushes we bought from the store are good.</li>
            <li>As of this writing Amazon is selling a Special Pack of the Healthy White that includes a Diamond brush, whitening pen and travel case.      </li>
            <li>I purchased this one on right before Christmas and paid around $30 for it.  </li>
            <li>Everything about it was right...</li>
            <li>Boy were they right.  </li>
            <li>considering pricing, 3.5 seems about right.  </li>
            <li>Something isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li>All right.</li>
            <li>The sonicare 2 series wasn&#x27;t the right choice for our family.  </li>
            <li>I felt like I had to just use it like a normal toothbrush because the top and bottom don&#x27;t really connect and</li>
            <li>Your teeth and mouth really feel clean after using this.  </li>
            <li>The Healthy White is the sweet spot in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I compared the normal mode it to the way my roommate&#x27;s sonicare worked (she has the clean white model), and hers seems to run much more smoothly, with just the brush vibrating.  </li>
            <li>clean the teeth very well</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a bad thing, just a reminder of how powerful it really is.  </li>
            <li>Wow, does it clean well!</li>
            <li>I like bare bones appliances without too many features to learn so brushing in the morning before coffee amounts to putting some toothpaste on the brush and pushing the button.</li>
            <li>So if you need a toothbrush with a small head this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>My breath was always pretty fresh</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth and the head fits great.</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with it although the handle is harder to hold because it is round while our older brush was more triangular.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old Sonicare elite HX7800 is still working and w a y more quite, even with new brush heads and full charge.    </li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get a better model.</li>
            <li>Pay a little more and get a better sonicare, lasts longer and cleans better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new one is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>right from the first brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly more gentle while giving me the same clean</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and is very lightweight and portable.</li>
            <li>Not as good as my old one that beeped at the 30 second mark.</li>
            <li>Several weeks later still working great.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel especially strong at full intensity, but it&#x27;s a completely different sensation than my previous brush.  </li>
            <li>After getting used to the &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; (which took several brushings),  thereafter, it was/is fine.!</li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush very much.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush hurts my teeth very much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d very much recommend this to someone looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>3rd Sonicare product; always the best; highly recommend over any other brand.</li>
            <li>Works fine so far.</li>
            <li>good but a little noisy</li>
            <li>It eventually does seem to get my teeth smooth and clean, but I end up brushing for somewhat longer to get the same effect.  </li>
            <li>Discovered this after trying it and finding that it was very noisy with a high pitched sound.</li>
            <li>It vibrates a little more then my old screw on brush head model but its just as effective in cleaning</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the original for MANY years and they&#x27;re still working; bought this to keep in a second home, as the new price is so much lower!</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt as clean after brushing (either with a battery operated Spinbrush or a manual brush) as they do with my new Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have all the fancy options the higher models offer.</li>
            <li>The flush fit of the actual brush as it mounts onto the handle is very desirable, The flush fit allows for better cleaning and maintenance of the actual  toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I opted to turn it off for my first use, since I figured I was already accustomed to an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Only wish I had not been so cheap and bought one years ago!</li>
            <li>I never had comment like that while using the Healthy White model so this one is going in the trash</li>
            <li>my teeth feel so much cleaner after using this product!</li>
            <li>this purchase shakes and does not brush as fast!</li>
            <li>I payed much more a while back for the healthy white version of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Using it results in a much more thorough teeth cleaning experience than I got with my former electric tooth brush .</li>
            <li>I have not felt a difference in strength since the first time until now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several higher-end models, and they really don&#x27;t do much more than you can do with this brush.</li>
            <li>Your Sonicare will break after 2 years, regardless, so why spend triple or quadruple on a higher end model?</li>
            <li>I love having the convenience of notification when the battery is running low!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be returning this and purchasing another Healthy White model.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be exchanging for the Healthy White.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Will know more at next cleaning!!</li>
            <li>Warning: make sure to charge it fully before using for the first time, otherwise, its battery will last for shorter than it is intended for.</li>
            <li>Do not purchase this product if you expect it to last more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>first I was struggling with the tickling sensation but as soon as I got used to it</li>
            <li>I knew it wouldn&#x27;t work for me the first moment I tried it out.</li>
            <li>Just got and used for the first time.</li>
            <li>I charged it overnight and then used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Higher models simply have more features.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are more expensive toothbrushes with more movement</li>
            <li>I returned the first one, thinking it was defective.  </li>
            <li>The narrower brush helps me get to my back teeth area much better.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a defect</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Most likely 8 years or so.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>Have used Sonicare products for over ten years and dental check ups are always better than they ever were before electronic tooth brushing.</li>
            <li>So went for my first cleaning 6 months post using sonicare (I should use it 2x/day)</li>
            <li>I truly love the smaller brush size.  </li>
            <li>They are of a quality that is fairly similar to the Philips heads, at a much more affordable price.</li>
            <li>My first sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My wife and I bought this to replace a higher end Sonicare 6731 that was lost while we were traveling.  </li>
            <li>Should have bought a larger one with more brushes</li>
            <li>Should have gone for the higher priced one.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>A better deal than larger retailer even with coupon.</li>
            <li>At first, I could not stand the feel of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know after the first time if I could stand to use it again, but I figured I would give it a chance.  </li>
            <li>Hope that one will not fail me as well.</li>
            <li>I did not expect it to sound so loud.  </li>
            <li>Overall is okay.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve only got $50 to spend, it&#x27;s still better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The price was a concern at first</li>
            <li>Rather pay more and get three brushes at same time.  </li>
            <li>She likes using this electric toothbrush better than a regular as she feels</li>
            <li>It is very noisy!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, and functioned just as described.</li>
            <li>I think much better than last!</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes will last a lot longer and the brushing is more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and the motor is the same as most of the higher priced Sonicare models, it just doesn&#x27;t have any of the frills.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li>Gd quality with reasonable price!</li>
            <li>While the Oral B/Braun unit did little more than simulate a circular rotation of a manual toothbrush (albeit, very quickly,)</li>
            <li>I have used a previous sonicare that was very good, thorough, quiet, until it would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li>Surprised the first time I put this in my mouth - felt like it was about to vibrate my teeth loose - an exaggeration, but it was really surprising.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box it was fully charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li>The interval timer is very helpful in getting the right amount of brushing for each tooth.</li>
            <li>It works ok, but the brushes don&#x27;t fit exactly, and its a little buzzy.</li>
            <li>It feels \\&quot;cheap.\\&quot; I can&#x27;t really explain what it lacks, but I feel better brushed after 2 minutes with the Healthy White than I do after 2 minutes with this model.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not in the best shape these days; I need to open it up once in a while to clean it because a little bit of moisture can get inside due to the old gasket on top.  </li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel clean, but it is very noisy and I wonder if it is refurbished rather then brand new.</li>
            <li>My teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean after using this like they do with my old toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>think it does just as good a job cleaning as the more expensive models.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, and I will keep it because it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to pack it up and ship it back.</li>
            <li>Good basic Sonicare brush, not thirty second indicator to allow you to change brush positions.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to brush your teeth because of the tiny head but it does seem to do a good job cleaning teeth once you finally finish.</li>
            <li>Works as good as more expensive units.</li>
            <li>Works well good price and don&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles as more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>This particular model wasn&#x27;t nearly as powerful vibration wise as past Sonicares I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>so I returned it and spent more to get the Healthy White.</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare for a long time, and love it.</li>
            <li>My whole mouth vibrated at first.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have all the settings in the higher models but who really uses them anyway.</li>
            <li>Powerful, smaller, easier to clean.</li>
            <li>I would prefer the larger brush as the older models were like, but this is okay.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of time to get used to the vibrations (particularly when touching a tooth by mistake), but once you get used to using them, there is not going back to manual brushes.</li>
            <li>This is very bare bones but does the job, a well-priced replacement for my original sonicare toothbrush that went haywire.</li>
            <li>Super loud - everyone in my house hates this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It gets to the back teeth easily.</li>
            <li>The generic replacements fit well, and are pretty inezpens</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s progressively getting more and more intense, to a ridiculous degree, and if I accidentally hit my teeth with the toothbrush head</li>
            <li>The only problem was that the easy start feather doesn&#x27;t turn on/off as said in the product manual.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t leave it on the counter, but the charge is still going strong after 14 uses so not a big deal to charge up once in a while.  </li>
            <li>It is not as strong of a vibration as my last one or my kid&#x27;s Sonicare which I dislike.</li>
            <li>So I get on Amazon and see that there is a new and improved one that is only $10 more...</li>
            <li>but I think my mouth is on the smaller size and feel as though I can reach harder to reach areas more easily.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Sonicare and it never fails to keep my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Loved my other one and used it for many years;  Expect this one to last a long time as well.  </li>
            <li>but it is very noisy and vibrates a lot.</li>
            <li>This sonicare starts with a gentle cycle that builds gradually over two weeks, so there was never any pain or gum bleeding and my gums are healing.</li>
            <li>Hold the brush gently so</li>
            <li>I very like it.it can use convenience</li>
            <li>Electric toothbrushes don&#x27;t get much simpler than this.</li>
            <li>It times the cycle, and all I have to do it gently move it around.</li>
            <li>Only someone who has never had a Sonicare before would enjoy this model.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works really well.</li>
            <li>brush component to mine obviously didn&#x27;t fit the body.</li>
            <li>I was so infuriated with Phillips over this cheap junk that I&#x27;m gonna give Oral b&#x27;s electric toothbrush a try as our second unit</li>
            <li>I only needed one brush and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very noisy and vibrates a lot; but I think for the price it does the job.</li>
            <li>My father&#x27;s FlexCare is much quieter.  </li>
            <li>Really like this brush.</li>
            <li>I have a EasyClean that I spent a lot more for.</li>
            <li>Really, this gets zero stars.</li>
            <li>Why would anyone (!!!) who has made so much money off electric toothbrushes want to stop this feature?</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews, because this model is very noisy - much louder that the one I&#x27;m replacing.  </li>
            <li>I ran into this one on sale at Walmart, took the plunge, and very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>its bulkier and its really noisy.</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>but I could never justify spending this much on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You really adjust to the noise.   </li>
            <li>That much money for a toothbrush?</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the 14 day time frame for adjusting your teeth to the vibrations.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a very aggressive spin cycle, which is what was wanted.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to buy 7.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I really like this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I have saved so much money and pain over the years by using a sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Fast Forward 7 days.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying one of these!</li>
            <li>return Only available for around 2 months</li>
            <li>Thanks, Faraj</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner as opposed to brushing with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Absolutely does not work, will not charge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to go into too much detail because there are plenty of reviews that do that.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s important to note that the head is tiny.</li>
            <li>they work very well.</li>
            <li>THE DIRE THREATS OF ELECTROCUTION WERE VERY OFF-PUTTING.</li>
            <li>the HX6511 instead, its a much nicer unit.</li>
            <li>What I do notice is my teeth and gums feel much cleaner, and I like the timer because I brush much longer now.</li>
            <li>~ HIGHLY RECOMENDED!</li>
            <li>Really like this brush.</li>
            <li>and it really does.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like my whole head rattles.</li>
            <li>Too much having to continually push buttons to get it do anything</li>
            <li>Not too much a fan.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the quad timer, which is REALLY convenient</li>
            <li>seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li>much smoother/faster operation than the Oral B we had been using.</li>
            <li>the rest have features that I really don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>The one basic principle of this toothbrush is light pressure.</li>
            <li>very much!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have issues with my gums and this does a great job without irritating my gums.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve returned the 2 Series in favor of another Healthy White and will probably try soldering a replacement battery on my old unit on a rainy day.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t vibrate like my old Phillips Sonicare toothbrush and it has a louder sound like my old toothbrush had</li>
            <li>Always considered electric toothbrushes to be kind of gimmicky.  </li>
            <li>THIS THING IS SOOO LOUD!!!</li>
            <li>I mean for the price it does a good job</li>
            <li>The first time I used the new brush</li>
            <li>other issue that might not matter to most is that it seems much louder than the e-series.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush likely does a good job, but it&#x27;s extremely noisy.</li>
            <li>I liked my first Sonicare toothbrush, that died, but this model does not vibrate as fast or as hard, and won&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li>Target has a special edition model with various colors and free travel case for the same price.</li>
            <li>My middle schooler thinks it is fun to use!</li>
            <li>Cleans my teeth better than any other toothbrush I have used</li>
            <li>It is so unique and different from any that are out there.</li>
            <li>It remains to be seen how long the heads last, but so far so good the 2 minute timer feature is helpful.</li>
            <li>On the original package,which I did not get, it says &amp;#34;additional brush&amp;#34; I only recieved one brush.</li>
            <li>Well, my original Sonicare finally died so I was in the market to buy another.  </li>
            <li>so I can deal with the increased loudness due to more vibration of the brush head on the unit.  </li>
            <li>Excited to see how the next dental cleaning goes............</li>
            <li>I am so dissapointed and disatisfied with Phillips Sonicare for producing a toothbrush of such cheap quality and high price.</li>
            <li>shakes my teeth and my mouth doesnt feel clean anymore , a regular tooth brush leaves you with a cleaner feeling .</li>
            <li>it uses the same technology that my dental hygienist uses to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>This the 2nd sonicare purchased, I have been using one for over 3 yrs and have GREAT dental cleanings, where use to be stains and tartar are NO MORE.</li>
            <li>My entire mouth now feels wonderfully clean after using my Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li>feels clean and gets all the way to the back of my mouth!  </li>
            <li>Sound really cheap, unlike the Sonicare toothbrushs I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because my fiancée and I shared a single sonicare brush handle (using our own heads, of course) and wanted a second one.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the more expensive models, such as the Easy Clean and/or Healthy White, this Plaque Control model rattles loudly during usage.</li>
            <li>the light keeps flashing no matter how long it&#x27;s been charged.</li>
            <li>Packing sound Without damage.&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush is bigger than imagine, instead of small brush head is suitable for brushing your teeth to reduce resonance</li>
            <li>Louder than my Oral-B Professional Care 3000; loud enough to hurt my ears without touching the brush to my teeth.  </li>
            <li>A full charge only lasts about five days.</li>
            <li>…I soon realized that my model has the &amp;#34;Easy Start&amp;#34; mode that starts the power level low and gradually increases until full power (after 14 uses).</li>
            <li>and it was much quieter, no high pitched sound.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, quick to charge and fits nicely on small bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>Really gets your teeth clean, and has an automatic shut-off feature that tells you how long to brush.</li>
            <li>if you only charge when the indicator shows low batt., plus a full charge every time, this one&#x27;s NiMH battery deteriorates so quickly that brushing leaves visible stains on my teeth</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting use too, but makes your teeth feel super clean</li>
            <li>Turns out, this model uses some other vibration mechanism which seems not as strong or fast as the Flexcare.  </li>
            <li>I really do like my new tooth brush.</li>
            <li>The quadpacer to tell you when to switch to a new section of your mouth, and the clean and white setting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s ok for over half the price</li>
            <li>brushes are a bit flimsy... make more noise than previous models.</li>
            <li>;, I called Sonicare customer service to find out if it is any better at removing plaque than previous Sonicare models.  </li>
            <li>The handle seems to vibrate much more than previous model.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often say that about products; I tend to be critical of any compromises in quality and am quick to find them.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older Sonicare that stopped working after 8 yrs.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for an older electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be going back to the Healthy White version.</li>
            <li>Older model Sonicare died and replaced with this one.  </li>
            <li>The motor that drives this toothbrush is not the same as most others (except for the 6631 which is the same).  </li>
            <li>Overall, the charging is a bit slow, but all-in-all, this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So I was going to buy the the older Sonicare toothbrush, the HX5630/50 I believe, because my boyfriend uses that one</li>
            <li>We have an older model that is slightly better built and less noisy.  </li>
            <li>If pricing was not taken in consideration, I would give 3 starts to this model and 4 starts to the older model, but</li>
            <li>This sonicare does not become a mold farm like the thicker older model.</li>
            <li>Terrific price (frustration free packing) and makes your teeth feel cleaner than my old spin brush.</li>
            <li>I returned it and ordered a more expensive one with better feature.</li>
            <li>If I bought again I would get e series as internal works different and better in my estimation.</li>
            <li>Also, my older model came with a stand for the brush heads while this one did not.</li>
            <li>This model is identical in power, quality, and mechanical functionality in cleaning your teeth as the much higher priced models which in my opinion have overrated, unnecessary bells and whistles that make little if any difference in your brushing outcome-which is an excellent job of cleaning your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;8</li>
            <li>The shaft felt loosely attached and produced unbearable jarring metallic sound when working.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>In my view this is a well-made, high quality product.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t seem like it was a well thought out, tested, high quality unit.</li>
            <li>buzz rate is too high.</li>
            <li>but ive used this one for almost two months on its high setting and have no issues, even with brushing my lips.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Because of the high price I changed to Oral</li>
            <li>I will say that the manufacturers suggested retail price is rather high.  </li>
            <li>Though it is a little bit noisy and use Ni-Hm battery rather than Li-ion battery, it cleans much much better than hand tooth-brushes.</li>
            <li>I have arthritis and sensitive teeth, and this toothbrush vibrates (the toothbrush, not the bristles!!)</li>
            <li>However, it seems to be a little more noisy.</li>
            <li>While half the price of the Healthy White they feel half as effective.  </li>
            <li>Bad design of charger, excellent brush.</li>
            <li>The brush on this is much stiffer that the ones on my old Philips toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My old one was fast and felt like my teeth were being cleaned.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to maintain than the old style sonicare which I just switched from.  </li>
            <li>So far working really well.</li>
            <li>It is loud and rattles so much it hurts your lips if they happen to touch any part of the brush.</li>
            <li>As an aside, there are instructions on youtube on how to replace a dead battery on the Healthy Whites which requires some soldering if you&#x27;re so inclined.  </li>
            <li>I use a normal, non mechanic toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use everyday and am pleased with its performance</li>
            <li>The replacement is exactly the same - very noisy.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to have the Quadpacer, but not worth the extra $30!</li>
            <li>e series worth extra price.</li>
            <li>and she prefers the shape of the brush which was more round.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a Sonicare Flexcare which I loved but it had broken after 5 years.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend going through the &amp;#34;Easystart&amp;#34; process for anyone new to the Sonicare line of products.  </li>
            <li>Good for the price--although mine is much noisier than my more expensive version I previously had.</li>
            <li>Works even better than my previous electric tooth brush!</li>
            <li>It works fine, but is extremely noisy.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended Sonicare and said they all clean the same (the expensive ones just have more bells &amp; whistles), so I bought the 2 Series, the most basic Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT IT DOES NOT COME WITH A TRAVEL CASE, BUT I DEFINITELY LIKE THE EASILY RECYCLABLE CARDBOARD WRAPPING OFFERED BY AMAZON.</li>
            <li>The packing of the Sonicare was so that I could get right into all the parts without having to get a sledge hammer to open the package.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is cheaply made, It is so loud and the brushead fits loose against the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of shocked that it got such good reviews with how loud it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s replacing the Sonicare Diamond I had, which had several different speeds and times.</li>
            <li>My hope is that a good quality generic head becomes available or that Phillips comes down on the excessive cost.</li>
            <li>There is nothing new and improved about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I think I can live with that.</li>
            <li>But when I use this new (Phillips Sonicare 2 series plaque control)</li>
            <li>New unused product.  </li>
            <li>, it pauses every 30 seconds to tell you to move to a new part of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Did not feel like spending $80 on a new one.</li>
            <li>Once in a while the back of the brush would go against my teeth and chatter like crazy while I was trying to figure out the best way to orient it.  </li>
            <li>The older one was difficult to clean and had many areas where germs could accumulate.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud when used.</li>
            <li>However, it is very loud.</li>
            <li>I have a very old Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush, model HX6950, that I bought in 2008.  </li>
            <li>VERY VERY LOUD AND VIBRATING IN YOUR HAND......</li>
            <li>Also very loud.</li>
            <li>damage to my gums, made them very sensitive</li>
            <li>the  toothbrush  is  very  soft  </li>
            <li>It is very loud which is obnoxious.</li>
            <li>My daughter has had one for several months and likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>So far not impressed , I&#x27;m sure it operates fine</li>
            <li>Easy to use, holds a charge well enough that I could take it along for long weekends (never tried any longer) with plenty of power.  </li>
            <li>I chose this model because I&#x27;d had something similar for a much higher cost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep this model for travel and stick with my higher end models for daily use.</li>
            <li>I turned Easystart back on, and had a better experience the next time I brushed.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite get the slick feeling on the teeth and gums as I do with the Healthy Whites.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item several months ago as a replacement for my Philips Healthy White model (that finally died after almost 5 yrs).  </li>
            <li>HX6211/30 2 Series Plaque control because it was rated #1 and because of my satisfied past experience with a Sonicare series 6.</li>
            <li>Better than the ones I used in the past</li>
            <li>He has had many problems with gum disease but possibly due to not enough flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li>Replacing our old Sonicare!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not sure why you would spend more on an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This one buzzes as loud as a saw!</li>
            <li>It would have saved me some aggravation if they had said that the beep feature comes on the next higher model...</li>
            <li>Better than ordinary sonic brushes.</li>
            <li>Was told today by a different Philips agent that the vibration is caused by aftermarket brush heads (even though I&#x27;ve told them both times I&#x27;ve talked to them that both the head it originally came with did the same thing).</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t accumulate water &amp; gunk inside the unit, like my old electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li>No cons so far with this one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned/used a 6500 series before and didn&#x27;t really like the low setting because I felt it was too gentle, and I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>LOUD!</li>
            <li>This rating represents the satisfaction of our first one and the expectation of our second one.</li>
            <li>On receiving the first unit, thought it was just a simple manufacturing defect.</li>
            <li>Activating and deactivating it resulted in the exact same power output.</li>
            <li>it sounds like something is loose and vibrating or loose on top of the normal vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Those little pauses made it easy to spend about 30 seconds on each quadrant of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I can now clean my back teeth without the larger heads activating a gag response.</li>
            <li>He is in braces, and this brush cleans his teeth much better, due to the ultrasonic action that will not only remove plaque &amp; stains but also helps to reduce bacterial biofilm.</li>
            <li>I used my old brush attachment and not the new one that came with the product.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is a different model or not, but wasn&#x27;t as effective as before.</li>
            <li>It seems to be lesser quality than the older model?&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s still good but not great.</li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t fit all the way down on the holder, and it vibrates loudly.  </li>
            <li>I had a Sonicare Healthy White toothbrush for a long time and it finally started to quit.</li>
            <li>The intensity of the vibration is about half that of the Healthy White version.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Because the head isn&#x27;t rotating really fast in small circles, the Sonicare feels more natural in my mouth, but the vibrations definitely took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>It has a single beep and light to let you know the battery is low.</li>
            <li>This is our second Philip Sonicare and they certainly seem to have cheapened up their product.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush was bought for my wife, but a little brushing sound</li>
            <li>Works well, my mother states that it does the job she is looking for...keeping the plaque down and her teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>It does the job but spend a little more and get the next model up.  </li>
            <li>My other Sonicares had a two minute timer that had a quick pause and restart after 30 seconds, 60 seconds, and 90 seconds and shut off after 120 seconds.  </li>
            <li>so surprise！comfortable and clear</li>
            <li>Gets the job done but not quite as powerful as the more expensive model I owned and used before it broke.</li>
            <li>and  clear</li>
            <li>I am replacing my old Philips Sonicare that I wore out and damaged while traveling.  </li>
            <li>The feeling can be compared to a professional dental polisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is so loud</li>
            <li>TO MY OLD SONICARE.  </li>
            <li>My old Sonicare toothbrush sonicare 6 series went out.</li>
            <li>The two-minute timer doesn&#x27;t include the 30-second intervals like my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, stay away.  </li>
            <li>I reverted to using my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Working wonders for my 12 years old.</li>
            <li>It is not even 4 months old.</li>
            <li>The old toothbrush had an adjustable gap between the coil and the magnet that would affect the strength of the vibration.  </li>
            <li>None thought it should be as loud as what they heard over the phone.  </li>
            <li>Loud and bulky.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel so much cleaner than regular brushing.</li>
            <li>toothbrush is so loud, it scares the life out of my 2-year old pitbull.</li>
            <li>/&gt; a side to side brushing action  seems ever one wemt to&lt;br</li>
            <li>old sonicare started turning on by itself so it was time to replace it.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t make a loud vibrating noise when used.  </li>
            <li>This thing is LOUD, but you DO adjust and to me</li>
            <li>Thing is still just as loud as the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the soft, sensitive bristle heads.  </li>
            <li>Cleans &amp; polishes teeth well, giving them the feel of a professional cleaning after each brushing..</li>
            <li>I just assumed it did, but it just runs straight for 2 minutes, so now I have to guess when to move to the next area.</li>
            <li>Too loud.</li>
            <li>Purchased this to replace the one that wore out early.</li>
            <li>So I have to remove frequently the brush to flush out the space from contaminants.</li>
            <li>It is loud and havemy teech some pain, while it is accepable.</li>
            <li>but it is marked</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit loud, but acceptable.</li>
            <li>It is also really loud.</li>
            <li>I replaced an old Sonicare toothbrush with this one and it seems to operate at a faster rate.  </li>
            <li>so much, it is loud and it knocks against my teeth and hurts.</li>
            <li>Phillips won&#x27;t tell me the model number of replacement brushes, even though I&#x27;ve used their chat service and have called directly.  </li>
            <li>the handle vibrates a lot and is loud.  </li>
            <li>then my adult sized sonicare ...</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth or just don&#x27;t like the feeling of a drill in your mouth, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>My old one has an door opening on the bottom for the battery.</li>
            <li>So, so loud.</li>
            <li>and I decided to try the basic much cheaper model.  </li>
            <li>It works well, but is really LOUD.</li>
            <li>My old one died and I was in a pinch and just picked one off Amazon.</li>
            <li>This thing is so loud it wakes my wife in another room with the door</li>
            <li>Product arrived early.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t compare the two since they brush the teeth differently.</li>
            <li>The old one I just replaced I have had since 2003.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, I’ve definitely noticed a difference am glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li>Good but expensive replacement heads</li>
            <li>The charger is really nice on this accept there is alot of extra cord that is annoying and does not fold up nicely</li>
            <li>No little spaces for funky stuff to grow.</li>
            <li>This is not even close to the older model, it is EXTREMELY loud compared to my last one.</li>
            <li>Nice toothbursh and improvement over older sonicare&#x27;s but the replacement heads are REALLY expensive.</li>
            <li>I did try to use generic replacement heads with the first Eilte model they sold and they didn&#x27;t work; they turned on yes, but the vibrating brushing sensation was off, was loud and it just wasn&#x27;t the same.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the other Sonicare toothbrushes I&#x27;ve had, this one is not as powerful.  </li>
            <li>Motor works strong and cleans teeth the same, but it seems as though the plastic housing does not have the same build quality as the more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth do not feel as clean, and it is messy, somehow causing one to have drool....</li>
            <li>I bought this unit to replace an older one that used the e-series heads when the battery finally gave out after 5 years or so.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace another older Sonicare whose battery is starting to give out.  </li>
            <li>My only complaints are the &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; and charge time -- it supposedly takes a whopping 48 hours to charge from empty to full.</li>
            <li>Definitely cleans much better than an ordinary tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t have the same cleaning power of the older E-series.  </li>
            <li>My old Sonicare was really not much good any more even though I had it for over 5 years.  </li>
            <li>used to the older larger brush</li>
            <li>My niece gave me my first Sonicare toothbrush for a Christmas present almost ten years ago.  </li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare products since they first came out about 15 years ago, going thru the various generations until the current one.  </li>
            <li>However, my wife prefers our older one because it vibrated differently</li>
            <li>Every other one/two star review is right.</li>
            <li>but if they are all like this, then I would highly recommend that you look at a different model.</li>
            <li>only difference is this has one speed setting (high).</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with this toothbrush is the high cost of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>Whether it was in easy start mode or not, it ran at the same intensity, which was too harsh for</li>
            <li>Finally feel like a real professional cleaning</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go back to a normal toothbrush now.</li>
            <li>Unit will beep once and &amp;#34;Easy Start&amp;#34; feature is disabled and you go to full power.  </li>
            <li>people, beginning with the time will be struggling to master a bad time, but got used to it after a few used, overall the toothbrush is very good, worth buying, only to determine that the voice is a bit large.</li>
            <li>The body is a little more thicker but not really noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I do enjoy the fact that the heads can be switched between the other, more expensive bases.  </li>
            <li>I sent it back and ordered another new E-series unit.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush as it does all of the hard work!  </li>
            <li>The cleaning is very intense compared to any other manual or electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The power of this particular model is much lower that ones previously tried.  </li>
            <li>This model is no where near the same as my 10 year old Sonicare Elite.    </li>
            <li>~ My previous Sonic was the one with all the bells &amp; whistles features along with an ultra-violet brush sterilizer, all of which were rarely needed or used!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only noticeable difference between this one and the much more expensive model is that the higher priced one beeped  every 30 seconds while it ran for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for my next dental appointment, will my hygienist be surprised!</li>
            <li>Works likes no other battery operated tooth brush I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I have two major complaints about this toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The customer service rep told me that the basic motor and the brushes are exactly the same as all the recent models.  </li>
            <li>All the clean and white setting does is turn the timer a little longer.  </li>
            <li>After using it, there was literally little to clean when I went in for my regular 6-month cleaning and check-up at the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this specific model and suggested that you don&#x27;t need to spend big bucks to get a high quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This has very little power on full charge.</li>
            <li>Teeth are cleaner and generally whiter</li>
            <li>but I do like Sonicare toothbrushes in general - just not defective ones.</li>
            <li>My only con is that the charger is small and light and I have to wiggle it around when plugged in to keep the brush upright.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable buzzing so loudly after quiet hours, although no one has complained.  </li>
            <li>It works but just barely.</li>
            <li>Bare bones model.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare was very quiet and did the job well.  </li>
            <li>The handle vibrates a lot, but the brush bristles barely vibrate.</li>
            <li>However, what I found was a completely different design from my old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>When my last E-series started getting old, (6 years of use)</li>
            <li>The only thing is, my old one had a timer which let you know when each 30 seconds went by, and then when it was at 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I need to actually &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; with this unit where my old one literally did all the work for you.</li>
            <li>Replaced an almost ten year old Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Barely got used.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good enough to me ，but 2days after i bought it， the one which take 2 brush head be the same price like this。。。i feel so sad</li>
            <li>I would much rather spend less on a toothbrush for my teen as he is hard on them, and this will make sure he doesn&#x27;t have plaque issues while he is in braces.</li>
            <li>The head is small enough to get in those little corners of your mouth and cleans one tooth at a time, which I love!  </li>
            <li>actually opened up my new toothbrush last night to see if there was something I could do.  </li>
            <li>It is somewhat noisier than my first Sonicare, and the detachable brush is easy to put on and replace; however, there is a very small and barely noticeable gap between the brush attachment and unit that bothers me a little because I would rather see no space that might allow water, toothpaste, etc.</li>
            <li>You can hear it VERY clearly from across my house, through closed doors, while completely unconscious.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps just right for a three-year-old with just a few teeth.  </li>
            <li>Some brush head replacements on other Sonicare models run as high as $30.00!</li>
            <li>It also seems to be much louder due to the increased vibration.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace the older version of it that I have had for several years because the older version was getting water trapped inbetween the handle and brush head and causing mold.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, works very well but little annoying</li>
            <li>My previous Phillps tooth brush which I had for several years was much nicer than the new smaller one (only one tooth brush).  </li>
            <li>I love sonicare but this style hardly had any vibration compared to other ones I&#x27;ve had..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud enough to hear all over the house, doesn&#x27;t clean nearly as well as other models (even the older base models), and feels cheap and plastic.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll send the replacement back and start looking at buying a different model - they apparently don&#x27;t want to admit an apparent design fault with this model.</li>
            <li>I like Sonicare since I need them for my gum disease condition, but apparently this is not a model to utilize further</li>
            <li>My higher end Sonicare died a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>that even a medium bristle manual brush can remove while this one does not until you pretty much destroy the brush head.</li>
            <li>Overall, my teeth FEEL so much cleaner, and since I hate to floss, the sonic care is a good substitute.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, no matter how much I cleaned it), and then my partner&#x27;s brush broke down, and I replaced it with...</li>
            <li>I have gone back to my old model even though it does not hold a charge for long.</li>
            <li>Could have had a few speeds, pretty basic</li>
            <li>The first few brushes are extremely rough and uncomfortable but now I love this brush!</li>
            <li>The price of these electric toothbrushes have really come down in price but the quality seems about the same.  </li>
            <li>the voice is  a little large.</li>
            <li>The customers who have rated your toothbrush (Phillips Sonicare 2 series Plaque control) with high scores have obviously not experience any other electric toothbrushes before.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare 2 Series is an excellent toothbrush but with a base that makes the product less than desirable.  </li>
            <li>I like the timer (a little pulse hesitation) after a minute to help you know that you have brushed for a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li>It mainly vibrates with very little action.</li>
            <li>Good brush, can&#x27;t say one bad thing bout it.</li>
            <li>Overall is good, is the toothbrush head is bad to buy</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Over all good product no problems.</li>

            <li> When I went for my routine cleaning, the dentist noted how great my teeth looked, and asked if I&#x27;d been flossing more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush you can get, and totally worth every penny.</li>

            <li> Really love it!</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> His teeth and gums already look much better!</li>
            <li> Shame on me for not looking at the options more thoroughly!</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> great product and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> great for the price and easy to use</li>
            <li> They feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> This brush is amazing...</li>
            <li> It is nice.</li>
            <li> It does have a 2 minute timer which is nice.</li>
            <li> I also own an E-series Sonicare, and the Series 2 seems to be lower quality.</li>
            <li> i own it</li>
            <li> Not as nice as the newer numbers, 69 series.</li>
            <li> I have no intentions of paying my own money to return a $40 product, and I&#x27;m DONE with Sonicare.    </li>
            <li> I looked for something affordable and effective.</li>
            <li> I saw the Sonicare HX6211/30 2 Series on Amazon, and liked what I read about the item</li>
            <li> And I also have the Quadpacer which is kind of helpful</li>
            <li> Nice, works as stated.</li>
            <li> I am returning it, but will get another Phillips Sonicare toothbrush because I have always liked them.</li>
            <li> it is nice ,and I like it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it .</li>
            <li> Nice effective cleaning</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with how fast and vigorous it is.  </li>
            <li> However, it lasts forever and it makes my teeth feel very clean!</li>
            <li> It gives a more thorough and better clean, especially good for removing tartar.  </li>
            <li> DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> My mouth never felt so clean and my lady checkup wad great.</li>
            <li> After using is for 1 full week I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Very pleased :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with my recent purchase of this item, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality toothbrush at a great price.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a wonderful job scrubbing my teeth super clean.  </li>
            <li> Works great and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to change heads if you want to share with family members.</li>
            <li> Very strong and hurt.  </li>
            <li> It is very good and keeps the charge very well.</li>
            <li> Some I&#x27;ve liked better that others.  </li>
            <li> Funtion is nice and delivery is ok</li>
            <li> I am old school and always thought a hand brush was the best.</li>
            <li> It is an interesting process, but my dentist assures me it is an effective one.</li>
            <li> I had not come from a better toothbrush, I might think this one was amazing.  </li>
            <li> Experience so far is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any kind of electric toothbrush and wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it, but a friend just raved about hers.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush, easy to handle, does a good job.</li>
            <li> Easy fix, I thought!  </li>
            <li> The price is fair and I just needed it to clean my teeth &amp; gums.</li>
            <li> So, it took me a good 4 minutes of brushing before I felt properly clean.</li>
            <li> Great experience all around and delivery was very expeditious!</li>
            <li> and I was happy with the first two.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> Works Great,  And The Price Was More Than Reasonable!</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t come a part as easy and doesn&#x27;t have the handy travel case.</li>
            <li> I notice the cleaner feel to my teeth after brushing, which tends to make me want to brush more</li>
            <li> RECEIVED MY PHILLIPS SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH, I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> In this age I think most people should have access to a powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has been my favorite teeth cleaning instrument for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> It feels more like the battery operated models from Sonicare&#x27;s competitors.  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like the 14 day mode, that is able to be shut off.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the best dental checkups  since starting to use the Sonicare</li>
            <li> Have most of my extended family now using Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with some practice, I&#x27;ll quit doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And have been using for more than 9 months now</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> * Most of the vibration is concentrated towards the bottom of the handle rather than at the brush head.  </li>
            <li> I really love this thing.</li>
            <li> Love love..</li>
            <li> Have not been able to find another one like it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> your hands/body doesn’t absorb most of the vibrations, rather it goes where it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> This model is so much better.</li>
            <li> My gums are better than ever</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok - had others that made my mouth feel cleaner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I was going to spend more on an Oral B power brush, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Oral B has outstanding warranty service if anything happens to your brush as well.</li>
            <li> This version of the toothbrush is way better than the e-series.</li>
            <li> I enjoy every time I use this amazing toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it --</li>
            <li> I am also very happy with the smaller gum care brush head that came with it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I may order a couple more</li>
            <li> I love how you can keep using it for a couple of weeks even before it needs another charge too.</li>
            <li> So of course I wanted to get it and rub it in his face that mine was much better than his, BUT that was not the</li>
            <li> the price is ok, i like it</li>
            <li> It probably cost them more money to NOT put this feature in that it does to add it.</li>
            <li> Love.  </li>
            <li> Okay...</li>
            <li> there are so many options</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, way better than manual brushing.</li>
            <li> My friends told me it would be better then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> My breath smells better 4.</li>
            <li> My teeth def look better, and that&#x27;s coming from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> Two months later I had the best dentist appointment of my life--no cavities, increased gum health, and</li>
            <li> I am more than satisfied with the Sonicare I ordered.  </li>
            <li> We love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush, after getting use to the vibration.  </li>
            <li> It had a better brush head and more vigorous brushing.</li>
            <li> It feels like it can remove plaque, but I&#x27;ll have to wait until I visit the dentist to be sure.</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> I AM PLEASED WITH MY PHILIPS SONICARE PURCHASE.  </li>
            <li> Was pleased with the price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> Love the tooth brush  </li>
            <li> That should be longer or you should be able to change it.</li>
            <li> His is still working OK.  </li>
            <li> So have to order more.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare toothbrushes, and have bought Phillips brand ones for years.</li>
            <li> Also, the charger is so cheap and lightweight, the toothbrush falls out of the charger onto the floor!</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush, this is my third one.</li>
            <li> Had Sonicare for many years</li>
            <li> The model numbers are changed when they add more bells and whistles to the charger or stand or cleaner or....  </li>
            <li> Have been a sonicare customer for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> Hope it does a better job with my gums and teeth than the rotary electric that I had been using.</li>
            <li> Brushing effect is good, worth having</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for over 10 years and love them....</li>
            <li> The product came in a regular box but I am still very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I also love the automatic cut off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> GREAT &#x27;BASIC&#x27; electric toothbrush, which is really ALL that is needed for great dental hygiene!</li>
            <li> Did my research on all SonicCare models before buying and this one does the job and had the most flexibility for brush head replacements.</li>
            <li> Probably best overall value in a Sonicare</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth much better than a brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this newer model and could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> There are much better options in the Sonicare line.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love my sonic.....</li>
            <li> I do like the job it does cleaning my teeth, much better than brushing alone.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s ok for me.</li>
            <li> It does the cleaning better than by hand.</li>
            <li> Cavities cost more than this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;NOT SURE</li>
            <li> The price is much more competitive.</li>
            <li> One more thing, I remove my glasses when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> I really love my Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Does a much better job of cleaning etc.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This feels a bit like it is vibrating your insides, but does an amazingly good job of leaving my teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It is not as nice as my original</li>
            <li> sonic vibration that is amazingly efficive in getting teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li> but want results brush that tung  nice and clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an experienced sonicare user - having had a high end model for about 5 years.  </li>
            <li> The brush is perfect for teens because it only has the on/off button, and a thicker handle that is easy to grip.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, strong and powerful.</li>
            <li> Very clean feeling mouth &amp; teeth;</li>
            <li> Very clean and efficient brushing.</li>
            <li> And my tooth is very clean after use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This seems to do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> I have long used Sonicare toothbrushes, and this one is the best value yet.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job and holds a charge for a long time so it travels well.  </li>
            <li> Who would ever think a person could get excited about a toothbrush?!  </li>
            <li> It works very nicely, but it sure is loud!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use, cleaning is better than with a manual toothbrush, and I have gotten used to the &amp;#34;mosquito-mouth&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Love the styling of this brush, makes it easy to turn while brushing the gum line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay; my oral b toothbrush was just as good with much lower cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Sonicare brush, which was great &amp; lasted for many years.</li>
            <li> I finally found a fantastic electric toothbrush &amp; it works great!</li>
            <li> noise is very small,not like the others said it very loud,it a happy order on amazon!</li>
            <li> Better than expected and great price!</li>
            <li> Makes your&lt;br /&gt;teeth feel so clean and helps with gum care!</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth tingly clean!</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been so clean!  </li>
            <li> Teeth look  and feel really clean!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is fine, although I haven&#x27;t been able to notice the timing feature.</li>
            <li> a great gift for a 14 year old</li>
            <li> Great brush but way too loud and brush</li>
            <li> there is some better deals available</li>
            <li> When I got it and began to use it, I really enjoyed how light weight it was to use and</li>
            <li> came to think it would fit better ...</li>
            <li> Powerful and effective.  </li>
            <li> good product but more cheaply made than the older one I had</li>
            <li> The model I&#x27;m reviewing had a good promotion ($10 off the normal price), so I figured this was a great time to replace my old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will update my review when or if any significant changes occur for me with he brush.</li>
            <li> These turned out to be better than the one that came with the original toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very appreciative of the preset ramp up period too, no thinking, just brushing, while it slowly takes 10 fully brush cycles to hit max sonicare cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, and this gets my teeth sparkling clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate, but covering one&#x27;s mouth when using saves spraying all over self and mirrors.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and improved brushing.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that&#x27;s why it has such great reviews, since it&#x27;s an entry level Sonicare and most people buying this came from a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love how clean my teeth and gums feel.</li>
            <li> It feels more powerful and better quality than those battery powered toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to recharge</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now, and love the way it makes my mouth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that I just have a defective one, but since the easy start feature does not seem to be working on mine, I&#x27;m returning it.  </li>
            <li> The package was great to open, nothing to swear at or cut apart, they came charged and just recommended a 2 hour charge to top off before I started to use.  </li>
            <li> her teeth are more clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel so clean :)</li>
            <li> It gives me a much better clean then a manual one.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning power not as good as older unit.</li>
            <li> The vibrations are SO strong, I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The ultrasonic brush vibrations are not too strong, so no worries that he will knock off a bracket while using this brush.</li>
            <li> the vibrator is too strong</li>
            <li> Vibration strong</li>
            <li> The vibration was too strong - hurt my teeth to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t just make a cheap one to reach more people, make sure it stands up to functionality first!</li>
            <li> Some fine stains even clean off better with this brush off and used as a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a fine product</li>
            <li> Called it&#x27;s customer service and be told they won&#x27;t replace it if it&#x27;s still working fine.</li>
            <li> If I remove the brush, it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I like it just fine.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush works just fine.  </li>
            <li> I also use this in the shower, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Everything is fine about the toothbrush</li>
            <li> I got the economy model, and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> The product is fine, I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years.</li>
            <li> Cleans fine.</li>
            <li> It is strong, so it isn&#x27;t so comfortable, but can be accept.</li>
            <li> However, this deal, especially with Amazon Prime&#x27;s free shipping, is better than what I can get in my own office!</li>
            <li> Easy to charge, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush but not as good as my previous Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It seems to work fine just a louder buzzing sound.  </li>
            <li> It does not come with a travelling case, but fortunately it fits just fine in the one I already had.  </li>
            <li> I will be happy since I only paid $50 for it.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head on mine doesn&#x27;t fit all the way.</li>
            <li> Plus, I have that &amp;#34;fresh from the hygienist&amp;#34; smooth teeth feel.</li>
            <li> Overall great deal and product</li>
            <li> fabulous.</li>
            <li> Cost was 39.99 plus there was a $10.00 coupon so 29.99 plus free shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;E-Cron around $10.00 Free delivery</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> and my teeth feel sooo smooth after&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s better at brushing now, but it still doesn&#x27;t feel as effective as the Healthy White.</li>
            <li> I confirmed this with Philips Customer Service.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH TRANSACTION.</li>
            <li> Light and I like the fact that gives you a built in timer.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and cheaply performs.  </li>
            <li> Works great and is very quiet.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Go with the Easy Clean Hx/6511/34 if you want a quieter toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So I go to purchase this unit at Walgreens, great packaging and such....</li>
            <li> Light weight and get the job done.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap for a</li>
            <li> well.. it was cheap and it does work.</li>
            <li> You can take off the brush portion easily and clean out any tooth paste etc from the handle/brush connection point.</li>
            <li> This is a really cheaply made toothbrush.</li>
            <li> light don;t always come on when charging</li>
            <li> Please, folks, do not base your opinion of Sonicare on this model.....</li>
            <li> This model is noisey, buzzy, slippey, and has a cheap plastic</li>
            <li> I have a 67xx series and enjoy that one.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with no inaccessible areas.  </li>
            <li> Just feels and sounds really cheap.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend $50 on something so seemingly trivial as a toothbrush I could get for free from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li> while better than a non mechanic toothbrush, very noticeable drop-off vs the better Sonicare products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> and so far is just as good.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t care about the loud noise, this model might be good for you if you are looking for a low-cost entry</li>
            <li> In the end, it&#x27;s not as good as the old model.  </li>
            <li> The build quality is good but the brushing action feels &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2, 1 would not charge after 3 month, amazon replaced it and so far so good.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels super clean!</li>
            <li> Been using Sonicare for years and this version is lighter, more comfortable - just right.</li>
            <li> The easystart feature did not work on mine, even after working with customer support from Philips to make sure I was doing it right.</li>
            <li> I turned off the \\&quot;Easy Start\\&quot; feature so the toothbrush would be brushing at full speed.</li>
            <li> ; THERE IS NO WAY that you can ever come close to getting your teeth as clean as can be quickly done with a Philips Sonicare electric tooth brush!  </li>
            <li> Very powerful toothbrush</li>
            <li> Super strong sonic power.  </li>
            <li> He is enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very useful for me to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> My original Sonicare toothbrush went kaput</li>
            <li> I picked this up for 40 dollars and it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Pleased with the first one; bought another.</li>
            <li> My original was a version with 4 speed settings that cost over $100.</li>
            <li> I pretty sure it was defective.</li>
            <li> I was sure it was going to be awesome, but now I&#x27;ve realized that Sonicare is like all other companies and most likely has people making 5-star bogus reviews that are lies.</li>
            <li> would recommend if you want a toothbrush that can significantly reduce plaque build up.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is much lighter in weight, is more quiet, and does a great job cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This ToothBrush is in fact unique.</li>
            <li> my original E-Series did.</li>
            <li> Not as hefty as the original SONICARE, so will have to see how well it holds up.</li>
            <li> Takes practice, but worth it!</li>
            <li> Works great and holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth wonderfully clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Leaves teeth clean and mouth fresh!  </li>
            <li> New one solved the problem I was having and now it stands up on its own.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the squeaky clean feel like the diamond model or</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Sonicare without all the bells and whistles that just does what a toothbrush should do:  clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> Leaves teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Works quite and teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> my teeth do not feel thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to take apart to clean....</li>
            <li> I keep running my tongue over my teeth because they feel so clean, even on the backsides.</li>
            <li> Easier to clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after brushing with a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Dentist clean.</li>
            <li> the pilot lamp is useless.and my tooth are not cleared as clean as description</li>
            <li> My teeth and tongue feel so clean after brushing with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> brush doesn&#x27;t mount cleanly with unit, thus causing noisy vibration  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never been this clean with my d manu brush.  </li>
            <li> My teeth look and feel extremely clean after each use.</li>
            <li> My teeth always feel so clean.</li>
            <li> However I missed the Sonicare because the Oral B just doesn&#x27;t seem to get my teeth or gum line as clean.</li>
            <li> teeth feel clean again along with my gums.  </li>
            <li> Good, easy to use, long battery life.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to use, and it is economic and affordable</li>
            <li> Dad was right!</li>
            <li> Works great as expected.</li>
            <li> JUST CAN&#x27;T SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT IT.  </li>
            <li> but we just have not had good luck with them lasting longer than a year or two...</li>
            <li> i love how fast it removes plaque.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> The E-series cleans better and is much quieter.  </li>
            <li> Battery started not taking a full charge about a month ago.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> But it is good for the extra bathroom.</li>
            <li> but my teeth never felt this good after being brushed.</li>
            <li> This is a good basic brush.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this toothbrush so much.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need all the features of the Flexcare and the reviews indicated this was a good basic sonicare technology.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, and I don&#x27;t feel the tingling too much.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I have it because I wasn&#x27;t convinced a sonic would make that much of a difference</li>
            <li> Good brush, my 2nd one.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much I got one for my boyfriend</li>
            <li> I like the feeling of clean teeth which is much better than the older toothbrush gave.</li>
            <li> , my old one gave an audible beep every 30 seconds during the 2 minute brushing time, so it was easy to brush top front/back &amp; bottom front/back sections of my mouth for 30 seconds each.</li>
            <li> Changing the brush is easy peezy, and it&#x27;s proven to be pretty durable along with effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> much prefer the older unit which was bought many many years ago.  </li>
            <li> This is for first time users that aren&#x27;t used to strong vibrations in their mouth.  </li>
            <li> This brush just does so much more than normal brushing can, it makes your teeth so clean they feel squeaky.</li>
            <li> Great price without all the bells and whistles like other models.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried any other electric toothbrushes, but this one works great</li>
            <li> my teeth have never been cleaner with no tarter buildup after hygienist cleaned them; #2 it forces me to brush for 2 minutes before it turns off; #3 it removes virtually all the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; between teeth - flossing rarely gets anything more; #4 took on a week trip but forgot charger - no problem as it lasted all week with 2 brushings per day; #5 use briefly on tongue and it feels much more refreshed and clean afterward.  </li>
            <li> It makes my teeth so fresh and clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older stye Sonicare essence toothbrush for many years.  </li>
            <li> But again, I love my HX6530 model and will most likely just get another one of those.</li>
            <li> With the older model, the brush heads vibrate with a slightly greater amplitude.  </li>
            <li> The older \\&quot;screw on cap with magnets suspended in air\\&quot; is more quite.    </li>
            <li> went away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I replaced an older model, and this is better.  </li>
            <li> And unbelievably quick shipping.</li>
            <li> the head is soft and very easy to replace the head.</li>
            <li> My old toothbrush had a very strong vibration that did not stop once in contact with my teeth.  </li>
            <li> (yes, she still has most of her own teeth, other than a couple she had implanted) cleaner than they&#x27;ve felt in months.  </li>
            <li> Both toothbrushes worked great, and the only difference between this version and the healthy white are the &amp;#34;features&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> One rep suggested the Easy Clean or Healthy White products as quieter than the 2 Series.  </li>
            <li> After about a week I was pretty much comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li> Much more gentle and effective than brushing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I did brush with it once and the noise went away as long as you applied a good amount of pressure on the brush.</li>
            <li> Love it, my mouth feels extra clean!</li>
            <li> A new improved , more stream-lined model</li>
            <li> I love how my teeth feel after brushing with my new Philips Sonicare tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It seems to me that they decided to make more profit by making the new design cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Like this model much better than the old e-series!</li>
            <li> My oral b was higher quality but this item still gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Price was very competitive!!</li>
            <li> First time using an electric toothbrush, I&#x27;m not using a manual one ever again!</li>
            <li> Overall, happy with this new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so I ordered 8 replacement brushes that work fine and are much cheaper in price than the philips heads.</li>
            <li> Everything worked fine  but the vibration tickled my tongue so much when I accidentally touched it, I gave it to my wife.</li>
            <li> When working at the case of a large resonant sound</li>
            <li> meet and exceeded all my expectation , great little toothbrush</li>
            <li> Great brush, though takes a little while to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> This little powerhouse of a toothbrush does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Very good, to brush cleaner than ordinary toothbrush, it is suitable for my kind of late &amp;#34;lazy cancer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> However, it shares the central and most important feature with the pricier Philips models:</li>
            <li> Also, consider that the old style Elites still remains to provide the most vibration intensity for your teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> So far I love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Better than old brush.  </li>
            <li> As a dental professional, I am able to get a discount on the toothbrushes my office sells.</li>
            <li> An older person will find this brush easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> All in all, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> For what I payed for it I am not unhappy.  </li>
            <li> Most likely too much pressure for safe brushing.</li>
            <li> Simple and highly effective.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they did with this latest version, but it&#x27;s LOUD, obnoxiously so, and vibrates uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> The cycle is 2 minutes which is plenty of time to leave you with a fresh mouth and teeth that feel just as though you came from the dentist after a cleaning.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and effective.  </li>
            <li> i loved it so much I ordered again for my teen!</li>
            <li> but it is worth every penny</li>
            <li> It does an even better job than my old one.</li>
            <li> It is so powerful it can rattle my teeth if I bump my teeth with the handle.  </li>
            <li> Not too powerful as to feel as if your mouth has been assaulted after use from the vibration.</li>
            <li> The payoff is worth the patience.</li>
            <li> Works well, but even after a couple months of use doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful.</li>
            <li> Its way powerful than what the teeth can handle.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as powerful as it is</li>
            <li> Vibrates a lot more than my old version.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pleased, as well.  </li>
            <li> very effective, a little noisy,</li>
            <li> They are MUCH louder than the other Sonicares I&#x27;ve experienced.  </li>
            <li> I thought it didn&#x27;t clean as well as the Healthy White model</li>
            <li> tooth brush has as much power as the older models perhaps a bit more.  </li>
            <li> The lithium battery powered ones are better at cleaning since the battery voltage and current lasts in terms of keeping the oscillation at an acceptable level to actually clean</li>
            <li> I really like this design better than the older one I had.</li>
            <li> Works well, vibration is very strong, might be to much if you have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> The head on it is a more compact head than many are and is extremely important when you have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> The sonicare does not eliminate flossing and other good dental hygine.</li>
            <li> it came in without boxes, the other brushes we bought from the store are good.</li>
            <li> As of this writing Amazon is selling a Special Pack of the Healthy White that includes a Diamond brush, whitening pen and travel case.      </li>
            <li> I purchased this one on right before Christmas and paid around $30 for it.  </li>
            <li> Everything about it was right...</li>
            <li> Boy were they right.  </li>
            <li> considering pricing, 3.5 seems about right.  </li>
            <li> Something isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li> All right.</li>
            <li> The sonicare 2 series wasn&#x27;t the right choice for our family.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I had to just use it like a normal toothbrush because the top and bottom don&#x27;t really connect and</li>
            <li> Your teeth and mouth really feel clean after using this.  </li>
            <li> The Healthy White is the sweet spot in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I compared the normal mode it to the way my roommate&#x27;s sonicare worked (she has the clean white model), and hers seems to run much more smoothly, with just the brush vibrating.  </li>
            <li> clean the teeth very well</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a bad thing, just a reminder of how powerful it really is.  </li>
            <li> Wow, does it clean well!</li>
            <li> I like bare bones appliances without too many features to learn so brushing in the morning before coffee amounts to putting some toothpaste on the brush and pushing the button.</li>
            <li> So if you need a toothbrush with a small head this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> My breath was always pretty fresh</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and the head fits great.</li>
            <li> and I am very happy with it although the handle is harder to hold because it is round while our older brush was more triangular.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old Sonicare elite HX7800 is still working and w a y more quite, even with new brush heads and full charge.    </li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get a better model.</li>
            <li> Pay a little more and get a better sonicare, lasts longer and cleans better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new one is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> right from the first brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly more gentle while giving me the same clean</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and is very lightweight and portable.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old one that beeped at the 30 second mark.</li>
            <li> Several weeks later still working great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel especially strong at full intensity, but it&#x27;s a completely different sensation than my previous brush.  </li>
            <li> After getting used to the &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; (which took several brushings),  thereafter, it was/is fine.!</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush very much.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush hurts my teeth very much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d very much recommend this to someone looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> 3rd Sonicare product; always the best; highly recommend over any other brand.</li>
            <li> Works fine so far.</li>
            <li> good but a little noisy</li>
            <li> It eventually does seem to get my teeth smooth and clean, but I end up brushing for somewhat longer to get the same effect.  </li>
            <li> Discovered this after trying it and finding that it was very noisy with a high pitched sound.</li>
            <li> It vibrates a little more then my old screw on brush head model but its just as effective in cleaning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the original for MANY years and they&#x27;re still working; bought this to keep in a second home, as the new price is so much lower!</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt as clean after brushing (either with a battery operated Spinbrush or a manual brush) as they do with my new Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have all the fancy options the higher models offer.</li>
            <li> The flush fit of the actual brush as it mounts onto the handle is very desirable, The flush fit allows for better cleaning and maintenance of the actual  toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I opted to turn it off for my first use, since I figured I was already accustomed to an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Only wish I had not been so cheap and bought one years ago!</li>
            <li> I never had comment like that while using the Healthy White model so this one is going in the trash</li>
            <li> my teeth feel so much cleaner after using this product!</li>
            <li> this purchase shakes and does not brush as fast!</li>
            <li> I payed much more a while back for the healthy white version of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Using it results in a much more thorough teeth cleaning experience than I got with my former electric tooth brush .</li>
            <li> I have not felt a difference in strength since the first time until now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several higher-end models, and they really don&#x27;t do much more than you can do with this brush.</li>
            <li> Your Sonicare will break after 2 years, regardless, so why spend triple or quadruple on a higher end model?</li>
            <li> I love having the convenience of notification when the battery is running low!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be returning this and purchasing another Healthy White model.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be exchanging for the Healthy White.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Will know more at next cleaning!!</li>
            <li> Warning: make sure to charge it fully before using for the first time, otherwise, its battery will last for shorter than it is intended for.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this product if you expect it to last more than 3 months.</li>
            <li> first I was struggling with the tickling sensation but as soon as I got used to it</li>
            <li> I knew it wouldn&#x27;t work for me the first moment I tried it out.</li>
            <li> Just got and used for the first time.</li>
            <li> I charged it overnight and then used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Higher models simply have more features.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are more expensive toothbrushes with more movement</li>
            <li> I returned the first one, thinking it was defective.  </li>
            <li> The narrower brush helps me get to my back teeth area much better.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a defect</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Most likely 8 years or so.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> Have used Sonicare products for over ten years and dental check ups are always better than they ever were before electronic tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> So went for my first cleaning 6 months post using sonicare (I should use it 2x/day)</li>
            <li> I truly love the smaller brush size.  </li>
            <li> They are of a quality that is fairly similar to the Philips heads, at a much more affordable price.</li>
            <li> My first sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought this to replace a higher end Sonicare 6731 that was lost while we were traveling.  </li>
            <li> Should have bought a larger one with more brushes</li>
            <li> Should have gone for the higher priced one.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> A better deal than larger retailer even with coupon.</li>
            <li> At first, I could not stand the feel of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know after the first time if I could stand to use it again, but I figured I would give it a chance.  </li>
            <li> Hope that one will not fail me as well.</li>
            <li> I did not expect it to sound so loud.  </li>
            <li> Overall is okay.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve only got $50 to spend, it&#x27;s still better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The price was a concern at first</li>
            <li> Rather pay more and get three brushes at same time.  </li>
            <li> She likes using this electric toothbrush better than a regular as she feels</li>
            <li> It is very noisy!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, and functioned just as described.</li>
            <li> I think much better than last!</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes will last a lot longer and the brushing is more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and the motor is the same as most of the higher priced Sonicare models, it just doesn&#x27;t have any of the frills.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> Gd quality with reasonable price!</li>
            <li> While the Oral B/Braun unit did little more than simulate a circular rotation of a manual toothbrush (albeit, very quickly,)</li>
            <li> I have used a previous sonicare that was very good, thorough, quiet, until it would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Surprised the first time I put this in my mouth - felt like it was about to vibrate my teeth loose - an exaggeration, but it was really surprising.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box it was fully charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li> The interval timer is very helpful in getting the right amount of brushing for each tooth.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but the brushes don&#x27;t fit exactly, and its a little buzzy.</li>
            <li> It feels \\&quot;cheap.\\&quot; I can&#x27;t really explain what it lacks, but I feel better brushed after 2 minutes with the Healthy White than I do after 2 minutes with this model.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not in the best shape these days; I need to open it up once in a while to clean it because a little bit of moisture can get inside due to the old gasket on top.  </li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel clean, but it is very noisy and I wonder if it is refurbished rather then brand new.</li>
            <li> My teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean after using this like they do with my old toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> think it does just as good a job cleaning as the more expensive models.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, and I will keep it because it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to pack it up and ship it back.</li>
            <li> Good basic Sonicare brush, not thirty second indicator to allow you to change brush positions.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to brush your teeth because of the tiny head but it does seem to do a good job cleaning teeth once you finally finish.</li>
            <li> Works as good as more expensive units.</li>
            <li> Works well good price and don&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles as more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> This particular model wasn&#x27;t nearly as powerful vibration wise as past Sonicares I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> so I returned it and spent more to get the Healthy White.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for a long time, and love it.</li>
            <li> My whole mouth vibrated at first.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have all the settings in the higher models but who really uses them anyway.</li>
            <li> Powerful, smaller, easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I would prefer the larger brush as the older models were like, but this is okay.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of time to get used to the vibrations (particularly when touching a tooth by mistake), but once you get used to using them, there is not going back to manual brushes.</li>
            <li> This is very bare bones but does the job, a well-priced replacement for my original sonicare toothbrush that went haywire.</li>
            <li> Super loud - everyone in my house hates this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It gets to the back teeth easily.</li>
            <li> The generic replacements fit well, and are pretty inezpens</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s progressively getting more and more intense, to a ridiculous degree, and if I accidentally hit my teeth with the toothbrush head</li>
            <li> The only problem was that the easy start feather doesn&#x27;t turn on/off as said in the product manual.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t leave it on the counter, but the charge is still going strong after 14 uses so not a big deal to charge up once in a while.  </li>
            <li> It is not as strong of a vibration as my last one or my kid&#x27;s Sonicare which I dislike.</li>
            <li> So I get on Amazon and see that there is a new and improved one that is only $10 more...</li>
            <li> but I think my mouth is on the smaller size and feel as though I can reach harder to reach areas more easily.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare and it never fails to keep my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> Loved my other one and used it for many years;  Expect this one to last a long time as well.  </li>
            <li> but it is very noisy and vibrates a lot.</li>
            <li> This sonicare starts with a gentle cycle that builds gradually over two weeks, so there was never any pain or gum bleeding and my gums are healing.</li>
            <li> Hold the brush gently so</li>
            <li> I very like it.it can use convenience</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes don&#x27;t get much simpler than this.</li>
            <li> It times the cycle, and all I have to do it gently move it around.</li>
            <li> Only someone who has never had a Sonicare before would enjoy this model.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works really well.</li>
            <li> brush component to mine obviously didn&#x27;t fit the body.</li>
            <li> I was so infuriated with Phillips over this cheap junk that I&#x27;m gonna give Oral b&#x27;s electric toothbrush a try as our second unit</li>
            <li> I only needed one brush and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very noisy and vibrates a lot; but I think for the price it does the job.</li>
            <li> My father&#x27;s FlexCare is much quieter.  </li>
            <li> Really like this brush.</li>
            <li> I have a EasyClean that I spent a lot more for.</li>
            <li> Really, this gets zero stars.</li>
            <li> Why would anyone (!!!) who has made so much money off electric toothbrushes want to stop this feature?</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews, because this model is very noisy - much louder that the one I&#x27;m replacing.  </li>
            <li> I ran into this one on sale at Walmart, took the plunge, and very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> its bulkier and its really noisy.</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> but I could never justify spending this much on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You really adjust to the noise.   </li>
            <li> That much money for a toothbrush?</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I also appreciated the 14 day time frame for adjusting your teeth to the vibrations.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a very aggressive spin cycle, which is what was wanted.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to buy 7.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I really like this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I have saved so much money and pain over the years by using a sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Fast Forward 7 days.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying one of these!</li>
            <li> return Only available for around 2 months</li>
            <li> Thanks, Faraj</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner as opposed to brushing with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely does not work, will not charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to go into too much detail because there are plenty of reviews that do that.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s important to note that the head is tiny.</li>
            <li> they work very well.</li>
            <li> THE DIRE THREATS OF ELECTROCUTION WERE VERY OFF-PUTTING.</li>
            <li> the HX6511 instead, its a much nicer unit.</li>
            <li> What I do notice is my teeth and gums feel much cleaner, and I like the timer because I brush much longer now.</li>
            <li> ~ HIGHLY RECOMENDED!</li>
            <li> Really like this brush.</li>
            <li> and it really does.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like my whole head rattles.</li>
            <li> Too much having to continually push buttons to get it do anything</li>
            <li> Not too much a fan.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the quad timer, which is REALLY convenient</li>
            <li> seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li> much smoother/faster operation than the Oral B we had been using.</li>
            <li> the rest have features that I really don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> The one basic principle of this toothbrush is light pressure.</li>
            <li> very much!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have issues with my gums and this does a great job without irritating my gums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve returned the 2 Series in favor of another Healthy White and will probably try soldering a replacement battery on my old unit on a rainy day.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t vibrate like my old Phillips Sonicare toothbrush and it has a louder sound like my old toothbrush had</li>
            <li> Always considered electric toothbrushes to be kind of gimmicky.  </li>
            <li> THIS THING IS SOOO LOUD!!!</li>
            <li> I mean for the price it does a good job</li>
            <li> The first time I used the new brush</li>
            <li> other issue that might not matter to most is that it seems much louder than the e-series.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush likely does a good job, but it&#x27;s extremely noisy.</li>
            <li> I liked my first Sonicare toothbrush, that died, but this model does not vibrate as fast or as hard, and won&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> Target has a special edition model with various colors and free travel case for the same price.</li>
            <li> My middle schooler thinks it is fun to use!</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth better than any other toothbrush I have used</li>
            <li> It is so unique and different from any that are out there.</li>
            <li> It remains to be seen how long the heads last, but so far so good the 2 minute timer feature is helpful.</li>
            <li> On the original package,which I did not get, it says &amp;#34;additional brush&amp;#34; I only recieved one brush.</li>
            <li> Well, my original Sonicare finally died so I was in the market to buy another.  </li>
            <li> so I can deal with the increased loudness due to more vibration of the brush head on the unit.  </li>
            <li> Excited to see how the next dental cleaning goes............</li>
            <li> I am so dissapointed and disatisfied with Phillips Sonicare for producing a toothbrush of such cheap quality and high price.</li>
            <li> shakes my teeth and my mouth doesnt feel clean anymore , a regular tooth brush leaves you with a cleaner feeling .</li>
            <li> it uses the same technology that my dental hygienist uses to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> This the 2nd sonicare purchased, I have been using one for over 3 yrs and have GREAT dental cleanings, where use to be stains and tartar are NO MORE.</li>
            <li> My entire mouth now feels wonderfully clean after using my Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> feels clean and gets all the way to the back of my mouth!  </li>
            <li> Sound really cheap, unlike the Sonicare toothbrushs I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because my fiancée and I shared a single sonicare brush handle (using our own heads, of course) and wanted a second one.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the more expensive models, such as the Easy Clean and/or Healthy White, this Plaque Control model rattles loudly during usage.</li>
            <li> the light keeps flashing no matter how long it&#x27;s been charged.</li>
            <li> Packing sound Without damage.&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush is bigger than imagine, instead of small brush head is suitable for brushing your teeth to reduce resonance</li>
            <li> Louder than my Oral-B Professional Care 3000; loud enough to hurt my ears without touching the brush to my teeth.  </li>
            <li> A full charge only lasts about five days.</li>
            <li> …I soon realized that my model has the &amp;#34;Easy Start&amp;#34; mode that starts the power level low and gradually increases until full power (after 14 uses).</li>
            <li> and it was much quieter, no high pitched sound.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quick to charge and fits nicely on small bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Really gets your teeth clean, and has an automatic shut-off feature that tells you how long to brush.</li>
            <li> if you only charge when the indicator shows low batt., plus a full charge every time, this one&#x27;s NiMH battery deteriorates so quickly that brushing leaves visible stains on my teeth</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting use too, but makes your teeth feel super clean</li>
            <li> Turns out, this model uses some other vibration mechanism which seems not as strong or fast as the Flexcare.  </li>
            <li> I really do like my new tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The quadpacer to tell you when to switch to a new section of your mouth, and the clean and white setting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s ok for over half the price</li>
            <li> brushes are a bit flimsy... make more noise than previous models.</li>
            <li> ;, I called Sonicare customer service to find out if it is any better at removing plaque than previous Sonicare models.  </li>
            <li> The handle seems to vibrate much more than previous model.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often say that about products; I tend to be critical of any compromises in quality and am quick to find them.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Sonicare that stopped working after 8 yrs.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an older electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be going back to the Healthy White version.</li>
            <li> Older model Sonicare died and replaced with this one.  </li>
            <li> The motor that drives this toothbrush is not the same as most others (except for the 6631 which is the same).  </li>
            <li> Overall, the charging is a bit slow, but all-in-all, this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So I was going to buy the the older Sonicare toothbrush, the HX5630/50 I believe, because my boyfriend uses that one</li>
            <li> We have an older model that is slightly better built and less noisy.  </li>
            <li> If pricing was not taken in consideration, I would give 3 starts to this model and 4 starts to the older model, but</li>
            <li> This sonicare does not become a mold farm like the thicker older model.</li>
            <li> Terrific price (frustration free packing) and makes your teeth feel cleaner than my old spin brush.</li>
            <li> I returned it and ordered a more expensive one with better feature.</li>
            <li> If I bought again I would get e series as internal works different and better in my estimation.</li>
            <li> Also, my older model came with a stand for the brush heads while this one did not.</li>
            <li> This model is identical in power, quality, and mechanical functionality in cleaning your teeth as the much higher priced models which in my opinion have overrated, unnecessary bells and whistles that make little if any difference in your brushing outcome-which is an excellent job of cleaning your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;8</li>
            <li> The shaft felt loosely attached and produced unbearable jarring metallic sound when working.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> In my view this is a well-made, high quality product.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t seem like it was a well thought out, tested, high quality unit.</li>
            <li> buzz rate is too high.</li>
            <li> but ive used this one for almost two months on its high setting and have no issues, even with brushing my lips.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Because of the high price I changed to Oral</li>
            <li> I will say that the manufacturers suggested retail price is rather high.  </li>
            <li> Though it is a little bit noisy and use Ni-Hm battery rather than Li-ion battery, it cleans much much better than hand tooth-brushes.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and sensitive teeth, and this toothbrush vibrates (the toothbrush, not the bristles!!)</li>
            <li> However, it seems to be a little more noisy.</li>
            <li> While half the price of the Healthy White they feel half as effective.  </li>
            <li> Bad design of charger, excellent brush.</li>
            <li> The brush on this is much stiffer that the ones on my old Philips toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My old one was fast and felt like my teeth were being cleaned.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to maintain than the old style sonicare which I just switched from.  </li>
            <li> So far working really well.</li>
            <li> It is loud and rattles so much it hurts your lips if they happen to touch any part of the brush.</li>
            <li> As an aside, there are instructions on youtube on how to replace a dead battery on the Healthy Whites which requires some soldering if you&#x27;re so inclined.  </li>
            <li> I use a normal, non mechanic toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use everyday and am pleased with its performance</li>
            <li> The replacement is exactly the same - very noisy.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to have the Quadpacer, but not worth the extra $30!</li>
            <li> e series worth extra price.</li>
            <li> and she prefers the shape of the brush which was more round.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Sonicare Flexcare which I loved but it had broken after 5 years.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend going through the &amp;#34;Easystart&amp;#34; process for anyone new to the Sonicare line of products.  </li>
            <li> Good for the price--although mine is much noisier than my more expensive version I previously had.</li>
            <li> Works even better than my previous electric tooth brush!</li>
            <li> It works fine, but is extremely noisy.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Sonicare and said they all clean the same (the expensive ones just have more bells &amp; whistles), so I bought the 2 Series, the most basic Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT IT DOES NOT COME WITH A TRAVEL CASE, BUT I DEFINITELY LIKE THE EASILY RECYCLABLE CARDBOARD WRAPPING OFFERED BY AMAZON.</li>
            <li> The packing of the Sonicare was so that I could get right into all the parts without having to get a sledge hammer to open the package.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is cheaply made, It is so loud and the brushead fits loose against the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of shocked that it got such good reviews with how loud it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s replacing the Sonicare Diamond I had, which had several different speeds and times.</li>
            <li> My hope is that a good quality generic head becomes available or that Phillips comes down on the excessive cost.</li>
            <li> There is nothing new and improved about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I think I can live with that.</li>
            <li> But when I use this new (Phillips Sonicare 2 series plaque control)</li>
            <li> New unused product.  </li>
            <li> , it pauses every 30 seconds to tell you to move to a new part of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Did not feel like spending $80 on a new one.</li>
            <li> Once in a while the back of the brush would go against my teeth and chatter like crazy while I was trying to figure out the best way to orient it.  </li>
            <li> The older one was difficult to clean and had many areas where germs could accumulate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud when used.</li>
            <li> However, it is very loud.</li>
            <li> I have a very old Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush, model HX6950, that I bought in 2008.  </li>
            <li> VERY VERY LOUD AND VIBRATING IN YOUR HAND......</li>
            <li> Also very loud.</li>
            <li> damage to my gums, made them very sensitive</li>
            <li> the  toothbrush  is  very  soft  </li>
            <li> It is very loud which is obnoxious.</li>
            <li> My daughter has had one for several months and likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> So far not impressed , I&#x27;m sure it operates fine</li>
            <li> Easy to use, holds a charge well enough that I could take it along for long weekends (never tried any longer) with plenty of power.  </li>
            <li> I chose this model because I&#x27;d had something similar for a much higher cost.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this model for travel and stick with my higher end models for daily use.</li>
            <li> I turned Easystart back on, and had a better experience the next time I brushed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite get the slick feeling on the teeth and gums as I do with the Healthy Whites.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item several months ago as a replacement for my Philips Healthy White model (that finally died after almost 5 yrs).  </li>
            <li> HX6211/30 2 Series Plaque control because it was rated #1 and because of my satisfied past experience with a Sonicare series 6.</li>
            <li> Better than the ones I used in the past</li>
            <li> He has had many problems with gum disease but possibly due to not enough flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li> Replacing our old Sonicare!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure why you would spend more on an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This one buzzes as loud as a saw!</li>
            <li> It would have saved me some aggravation if they had said that the beep feature comes on the next higher model...</li>
            <li> Better than ordinary sonic brushes.</li>
            <li> Was told today by a different Philips agent that the vibration is caused by aftermarket brush heads (even though I&#x27;ve told them both times I&#x27;ve talked to them that both the head it originally came with did the same thing).</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t accumulate water &amp; gunk inside the unit, like my old electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> No cons so far with this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned/used a 6500 series before and didn&#x27;t really like the low setting because I felt it was too gentle, and I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> LOUD!</li>
            <li> This rating represents the satisfaction of our first one and the expectation of our second one.</li>
            <li> On receiving the first unit, thought it was just a simple manufacturing defect.</li>
            <li> Activating and deactivating it resulted in the exact same power output.</li>
            <li> it sounds like something is loose and vibrating or loose on top of the normal vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those little pauses made it easy to spend about 30 seconds on each quadrant of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I can now clean my back teeth without the larger heads activating a gag response.</li>
            <li> He is in braces, and this brush cleans his teeth much better, due to the ultrasonic action that will not only remove plaque &amp; stains but also helps to reduce bacterial biofilm.</li>
            <li> I used my old brush attachment and not the new one that came with the product.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is a different model or not, but wasn&#x27;t as effective as before.</li>
            <li> It seems to be lesser quality than the older model?&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s still good but not great.</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t fit all the way down on the holder, and it vibrates loudly.  </li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare Healthy White toothbrush for a long time and it finally started to quit.</li>
            <li> The intensity of the vibration is about half that of the Healthy White version.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because the head isn&#x27;t rotating really fast in small circles, the Sonicare feels more natural in my mouth, but the vibrations definitely took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> It has a single beep and light to let you know the battery is low.</li>
            <li> This is our second Philip Sonicare and they certainly seem to have cheapened up their product.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush was bought for my wife, but a little brushing sound</li>
            <li> Works well, my mother states that it does the job she is looking for...keeping the plaque down and her teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> It does the job but spend a little more and get the next model up.  </li>
            <li> My other Sonicares had a two minute timer that had a quick pause and restart after 30 seconds, 60 seconds, and 90 seconds and shut off after 120 seconds.  </li>
            <li> so surprise！comfortable and clear</li>
            <li> Gets the job done but not quite as powerful as the more expensive model I owned and used before it broke.</li>
            <li> and  clear</li>
            <li> I am replacing my old Philips Sonicare that I wore out and damaged while traveling.  </li>
            <li> The feeling can be compared to a professional dental polisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is so loud</li>
            <li> TO MY OLD SONICARE.  </li>
            <li> My old Sonicare toothbrush sonicare 6 series went out.</li>
            <li> The two-minute timer doesn&#x27;t include the 30-second intervals like my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, stay away.  </li>
            <li> I reverted to using my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Working wonders for my 12 years old.</li>
            <li> It is not even 4 months old.</li>
            <li> The old toothbrush had an adjustable gap between the coil and the magnet that would affect the strength of the vibration.  </li>
            <li> None thought it should be as loud as what they heard over the phone.  </li>
            <li> Loud and bulky.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel so much cleaner than regular brushing.</li>
            <li> toothbrush is so loud, it scares the life out of my 2-year old pitbull.</li>
            <li> /&gt; a side to side brushing action  seems ever one wemt to&lt;br</li>
            <li> old sonicare started turning on by itself so it was time to replace it.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t make a loud vibrating noise when used.  </li>
            <li> This thing is LOUD, but you DO adjust and to me</li>
            <li> Thing is still just as loud as the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the soft, sensitive bristle heads.  </li>
            <li> Cleans &amp; polishes teeth well, giving them the feel of a professional cleaning after each brushing..</li>
            <li> I just assumed it did, but it just runs straight for 2 minutes, so now I have to guess when to move to the next area.</li>
            <li> Too loud.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace the one that wore out early.</li>
            <li> So I have to remove frequently the brush to flush out the space from contaminants.</li>
            <li> It is loud and havemy teech some pain, while it is accepable.</li>
            <li> but it is marked</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud, but acceptable.</li>
            <li> It is also really loud.</li>
            <li> I replaced an old Sonicare toothbrush with this one and it seems to operate at a faster rate.  </li>
            <li> so much, it is loud and it knocks against my teeth and hurts.</li>
            <li> Phillips won&#x27;t tell me the model number of replacement brushes, even though I&#x27;ve used their chat service and have called directly.  </li>
            <li> the handle vibrates a lot and is loud.  </li>
            <li> then my adult sized sonicare ...</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth or just don&#x27;t like the feeling of a drill in your mouth, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> My old one has an door opening on the bottom for the battery.</li>
            <li> So, so loud.</li>
            <li> and I decided to try the basic much cheaper model.  </li>
            <li> It works well, but is really LOUD.</li>
            <li> My old one died and I was in a pinch and just picked one off Amazon.</li>
            <li> This thing is so loud it wakes my wife in another room with the door</li>
            <li> Product arrived early.</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t compare the two since they brush the teeth differently.</li>
            <li> The old one I just replaced I have had since 2003.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I’ve definitely noticed a difference am glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> Good but expensive replacement heads</li>
            <li> The charger is really nice on this accept there is alot of extra cord that is annoying and does not fold up nicely</li>
            <li> No little spaces for funky stuff to grow.</li>
            <li> This is not even close to the older model, it is EXTREMELY loud compared to my last one.</li>
            <li> Nice toothbursh and improvement over older sonicare&#x27;s but the replacement heads are REALLY expensive.</li>
            <li> I did try to use generic replacement heads with the first Eilte model they sold and they didn&#x27;t work; they turned on yes, but the vibrating brushing sensation was off, was loud and it just wasn&#x27;t the same.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the other Sonicare toothbrushes I&#x27;ve had, this one is not as powerful.  </li>
            <li> Motor works strong and cleans teeth the same, but it seems as though the plastic housing does not have the same build quality as the more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth do not feel as clean, and it is messy, somehow causing one to have drool....</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace an older one that used the e-series heads when the battery finally gave out after 5 years or so.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another older Sonicare whose battery is starting to give out.  </li>
            <li> My only complaints are the &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; and charge time -- it supposedly takes a whopping 48 hours to charge from empty to full.</li>
            <li> Definitely cleans much better than an ordinary tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t have the same cleaning power of the older E-series.  </li>
            <li> My old Sonicare was really not much good any more even though I had it for over 5 years.  </li>
            <li> used to the older larger brush</li>
            <li> My niece gave me my first Sonicare toothbrush for a Christmas present almost ten years ago.  </li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare products since they first came out about 15 years ago, going thru the various generations until the current one.  </li>
            <li> However, my wife prefers our older one because it vibrated differently</li>
            <li> Every other one/two star review is right.</li>
            <li> but if they are all like this, then I would highly recommend that you look at a different model.</li>
            <li> only difference is this has one speed setting (high).</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this toothbrush is the high cost of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Whether it was in easy start mode or not, it ran at the same intensity, which was too harsh for</li>
            <li> Finally feel like a real professional cleaning</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to a normal toothbrush now.</li>
            <li> Unit will beep once and &amp;#34;Easy Start&amp;#34; feature is disabled and you go to full power.  </li>
            <li> people, beginning with the time will be struggling to master a bad time, but got used to it after a few used, overall the toothbrush is very good, worth buying, only to determine that the voice is a bit large.</li>
            <li> The body is a little more thicker but not really noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I do enjoy the fact that the heads can be switched between the other, more expensive bases.  </li>
            <li> I sent it back and ordered another new E-series unit.  </li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush as it does all of the hard work!  </li>
            <li> The cleaning is very intense compared to any other manual or electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The power of this particular model is much lower that ones previously tried.  </li>
            <li> This model is no where near the same as my 10 year old Sonicare Elite.    </li>
            <li> ~ My previous Sonic was the one with all the bells &amp; whistles features along with an ultra-violet brush sterilizer, all of which were rarely needed or used!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only noticeable difference between this one and the much more expensive model is that the higher priced one beeped  every 30 seconds while it ran for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for my next dental appointment, will my hygienist be surprised!</li>
            <li> Works likes no other battery operated tooth brush I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I have two major complaints about this toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The customer service rep told me that the basic motor and the brushes are exactly the same as all the recent models.  </li>
            <li> All the clean and white setting does is turn the timer a little longer.  </li>
            <li> After using it, there was literally little to clean when I went in for my regular 6-month cleaning and check-up at the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this specific model and suggested that you don&#x27;t need to spend big bucks to get a high quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This has very little power on full charge.</li>
            <li> Teeth are cleaner and generally whiter</li>
            <li> but I do like Sonicare toothbrushes in general - just not defective ones.</li>
            <li> My only con is that the charger is small and light and I have to wiggle it around when plugged in to keep the brush upright.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel comfortable buzzing so loudly after quiet hours, although no one has complained.  </li>
            <li> It works but just barely.</li>
            <li> Bare bones model.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare was very quiet and did the job well.  </li>
            <li> The handle vibrates a lot, but the brush bristles barely vibrate.</li>
            <li> However, what I found was a completely different design from my old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> When my last E-series started getting old, (6 years of use)</li>
            <li> The only thing is, my old one had a timer which let you know when each 30 seconds went by, and then when it was at 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I need to actually &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; with this unit where my old one literally did all the work for you.</li>
            <li> Replaced an almost ten year old Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Barely got used.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good enough to me ，but 2days after i bought it， the one which take 2 brush head be the same price like this。。。i feel so sad</li>
            <li> I would much rather spend less on a toothbrush for my teen as he is hard on them, and this will make sure he doesn&#x27;t have plaque issues while he is in braces.</li>
            <li> The head is small enough to get in those little corners of your mouth and cleans one tooth at a time, which I love!  </li>
            <li> actually opened up my new toothbrush last night to see if there was something I could do.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat noisier than my first Sonicare, and the detachable brush is easy to put on and replace; however, there is a very small and barely noticeable gap between the brush attachment and unit that bothers me a little because I would rather see no space that might allow water, toothpaste, etc.</li>
            <li> You can hear it VERY clearly from across my house, through closed doors, while completely unconscious.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps just right for a three-year-old with just a few teeth.  </li>
            <li> Some brush head replacements on other Sonicare models run as high as $30.00!</li>
            <li> It also seems to be much louder due to the increased vibration.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the older version of it that I have had for several years because the older version was getting water trapped inbetween the handle and brush head and causing mold.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, works very well but little annoying</li>
            <li> My previous Phillps tooth brush which I had for several years was much nicer than the new smaller one (only one tooth brush).  </li>
            <li> I love sonicare but this style hardly had any vibration compared to other ones I&#x27;ve had..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud enough to hear all over the house, doesn&#x27;t clean nearly as well as other models (even the older base models), and feels cheap and plastic.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll send the replacement back and start looking at buying a different model - they apparently don&#x27;t want to admit an apparent design fault with this model.</li>
            <li> I like Sonicare since I need them for my gum disease condition, but apparently this is not a model to utilize further</li>
            <li> My higher end Sonicare died a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> that even a medium bristle manual brush can remove while this one does not until you pretty much destroy the brush head.</li>
            <li> Overall, my teeth FEEL so much cleaner, and since I hate to floss, the sonic care is a good substitute.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, no matter how much I cleaned it), and then my partner&#x27;s brush broke down, and I replaced it with...</li>
            <li> I have gone back to my old model even though it does not hold a charge for long.</li>
            <li> Could have had a few speeds, pretty basic</li>
            <li> The first few brushes are extremely rough and uncomfortable but now I love this brush!</li>
            <li> The price of these electric toothbrushes have really come down in price but the quality seems about the same.  </li>
            <li> the voice is  a little large.</li>
            <li> The customers who have rated your toothbrush (Phillips Sonicare 2 series Plaque control) with high scores have obviously not experience any other electric toothbrushes before.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare 2 Series is an excellent toothbrush but with a base that makes the product less than desirable.  </li>
            <li> I like the timer (a little pulse hesitation) after a minute to help you know that you have brushed for a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li> It mainly vibrates with very little action.</li>
            <li> Good brush, can&#x27;t say one bad thing bout it.</li>
            <li> Overall is good, is the toothbrush head is bad to buy</li>
            <li> I am not unhappy enough to change back, but in a few years when I need a replacement, I will go back to the other style.</li>
            <li> This one seemed a reasonable value since it kept only the one &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting, and I expected it to work comparably to our other handle.  </li>
            <li> It might not be too loud for you, but be advised the 2 Series is not the quiet toothbrush the other Sonicares are known for being.</li>
            <li> Every 1-2 years or so, the brush motor or the charger breaks down, and we end up buying a new one.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy the series 2/3 because of some reviews that reported that they were not as powerful as the older models.  </li>
            <li> This model is far inferior to the two other Sonicare devices that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Admittedly the price is little high for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> high tech but a little noisy</li>
            <li> Pretty much got the &amp;#34;we recommend you use Sonicare label brush heads&amp;#34; - well if you didn&#x27;t make them so expensive</li>
            <li> When the replacement arrived AND WAS WORSE THAN THE FIRST ONE, it became clear:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sonicare: simply because you were first to market, or could advertise the loudest, doesn&#x27;t mean you can slack on quality.</li>
            <li> so not sure how much I will like it when I have to pay for replacements.</li>
            <li> Much too small.  </li>
            <li> At first did it a couple times, and not a  nice sensation, but now no issues at all.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;ve been wasting time every other time I have brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li> Either way the charge last a really long time</li>
            <li> long time user of a Sonicare HX6530...one of the earlier ProResults models.</li>
            <li> Even though I hadn&#x27;t been using it for long, my semi-annual teeth cleaning went a lot faster, and I&#x27;m eager to see what next time will be like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Decent price for skeptical first time buyers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One has failed to work properly after 3 months of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;One toothbrush has been used regularly since December 26, 2014 and no longer works properly, the other toothbrush has not beenused much but do not expect it to last much longer.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed in Sonicare and Amazon for selling such shoddy products.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, but it makes a weird grinding/buzzing sound that the same toothbrush purchased elsewhere does not make.</li>
            <li> To give you an idea of how fast and powerful it is, it makes my hand temporarily numb when I use it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud and the 2 minute shutoff time isn&#x27;t long enough for me to finish brushing.  </li>
            <li> If I  grab the center of the toothbrush head and push it down against the toothbrush, then turn on the switch, the toothbrush stops vibrating and is as quiet as my old Sonicare 6 series.</li>
            <li> but I attributed it to &amp;#34;being just in my head&amp;#34; and maybe just a different feeling due to a different shaped brush head.  </li>
            <li> This particular model of Sonicare toothbrush came in a small brown box that looked like a knock-off.</li>
            <li> There is a problem that it is a little loud.</li>
            <li> It works well but is a little noisier that my old one.</li>
            <li> As a regular user of the Oral B electric toothbrush for 8 years, my dentist mentioned that due to my sensitive and receding gums, they recommend I try something like Sonicare, which would apply less friction and agitation to the gums.</li>
            <li> Can not really feel the difference from my former Sonicare</li>
            <li> Have had that thing for a long time.</li>
            <li> it lasted long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charge holds a long time.  </li>
            <li> The charged battery lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> the four trouble spots the dentist was watching were completely healed.  </li>
            <li> These are minor disappointments, since this model is substantially cheaper.  </li>
            <li> guess you get what you pay for, so if you want that feature, don&#x27;t assume as I did - read descriptions carefully &amp; buy the next level brush.</li>
            <li> We will see how long the head holds up before replacement.</li>
            <li> I disengaged the soft start my holding the power button for a few seconds while in the charger and until I heard the one beep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waited a long time for I e</li>
            <li> I have used Phillips previous version and there nothing major difference between them.</li>
            <li> Saw very few differences in this model vs. more expensive Sonicare on the chart before purchasing, but apparently I missed something.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve stuck with them in spite of the price, the inconvenience of consistent breakdowns right after the warranty period, and the DISGUSTING buildup that happens under the brush head,, because our gums are so much healthier since starting with Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works just as well as my more expensive one, just has less features.</li>
            <li> I have to write a honest review - The vibration was so weak, even weaker than my broken HX6730 that I try to replace.</li>
            <li> The head last for a long time and love that it has a two minute timer, it makes you feel kinda bad when you click the power button to turn it off even though you know it hasnt been two minutes yet.</li>
            <li> The head last for a long time and love that it has a two minutes timer, it makes you feel kinda bad when you click the power button</li>
            <li> It is not as forceful and you will not have the same results if you have used any of the other Philips models.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud and the vibrations are stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I will not go back to any other brand unless Philips change the quality.</li>
            <li> lack of timer - very minor feature loss</li>
            <li> The battery lasts very long on this.</li>
            <li> It takes a few uses to get accustomed to the the differences between a regular brush and a sonic brush, which has bulk, vibrates, and requires a different style of brushing (you just pass the brush over your teeth and let the brush do the scrubbing).</li>
            <li> We have purchased several of the Sonicare toothbrushes during the last few years, so when the Philips Sonicare HX6211/30 2 Series Plaque Control came out and is advertised to be &amp;#34;better at removing Plaque&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The base is much too light for the unit.</li>
            <li> I have used the older model Sonicare brush for over 7 years and the batteries were finally getting weak.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick with the low tech model of a plain toothbrush in a human hand.</li>
            <li> I was not sure I could get used to how it would feel in my severely sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I prefer this electric toothbrush over oral-B because the head is small and the brush is not harsh on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Not powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> I also like the small soft bristle head, &amp; timer that stops the unit after 2 mins.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was blessed with good dental genes and have few problems, but I do hate to floss and don&#x27;t do it often enough.  </li>
            <li> It works but the head feels loose.</li>
            <li> Too bad, this could easily be a five star rating!</li>
            <li> better than my Oral B/Braun, and nigh impossible with a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t take the effort to actually time yourself, you will brush for less time</li>
            <li> Significantly less plaque on teeth after brushing with the Sonicare than using a regular toothbrush&lt;</li>
            <li> In less than a month, it suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li> works slightly the same as their 6500 series.</li>
            <li> This basic Sonicare model is a bit noisier than my previous HX6711/02 &amp;#34;Healthy White&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> but I am really frustrated because it is offered just by itself and also as a Special Bonus Pack (with case and extra head) which I didn&#x27;t see so had to go back and order the case.  </li>
            <li> Extremely loud due to head not fitting tight.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> The new model is no better at removing plaque than previous models.</li>
            <li> The vibration noise takes a little getting used to -- it&#x27;s noisier in your head than to anyone outside the bathroom door.</li>
            <li> A little big.</li>
            <li> I cannot even properly describe in words how obnoxious this little device is.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need or want the bells and whistles of the expensive models, so decided to buy a basic model.  </li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> Now, without the pauses, it is harder to divide your brushing time up</li>
            <li> Heavier than expected</li>
            <li> It was very noisy and seemed poorly constructed.</li>
            <li> Noisy, but works as expected.</li>
            <li> Works well, as expected.</li>
            <li> Product is longer than expected (compared to some oral-b products)</li>
            <li> The brush head rattles enough to wake the dead.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> It did not have some features that I expected.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I paid for the same exact item and only got the toothbrush with no case or extra head.</li>
            <li> The product preformed as expected</li>
            <li> works as expected, I like the 2 minute timer</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to clank your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Only took a few days to get used to it though.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Be careful about buying one with the word &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; in the title.</li>
            <li> The noise was so loud and the vibrations were so irritating that I immediately turned it off, repacked it and sent it back.</li>
            <li> However, when I put my diamondclean tip on it, it felt weak, and was clearly not cleaning my teeth the way it would when it was on the more expensive handle.  </li>
            <li> My third one gave out on me after less than 6 months, and I keep seeing the prices go down on these Ultrasonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and skinny which makes it hard to hold even for my small hands.</li>
            <li> It is not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I had an old base that worked.  </li>
            <li> and I did look at 2 other models.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if generic heads will work with this model.  </li>
            <li> performs as expected!</li>
            <li> It does not have all the bells &amp; whistles of the other Sonicare Toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Arrived before due date.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected!</li>
            <li> my other &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t share brush heads between both Sonicare models, but got a pack of 8 replacement heads for an extremely affordable price.  </li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t buy an Oral-B was their reported extreme vibration and noise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to order the same model again...</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Not sure why it had to be sold both ways when the price was the same.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and it is no different from the  other Sonicare toothbrushes I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Eh.... it always turns off way faster than the other Sonicare I got.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s 5 stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before this, I have used 2 other models of Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my other sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I live in an apartment with thin walls and because of my work schedule, I prepare for bed after midnight.  </li>
            <li> She also spent less time scrapping my teeth.</li>
            <li> Weak action on the brush, and battery rattles at the bottom of the brush.</li>
            <li> a little noisy than expected</li>
            <li> I have developed some areas with a separation between tooth and gums and this is helping get those tough spots.</li>
            <li> Normally the dental hygienist gives me a hard time about scrubbing my teeth too hard and tells me I should get a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I never used the other setting on my previous Sonicare, so bought this one.  </li>
            <li> Very noisy and feels lightweight and poorly made compared to the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Checking the reviews I found that others had the same complaint with this model.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t have a notice when two and a half minutes are up.</li>
            <li> and this was a severe step down</li>
            <li> A bit of a let down</li>
            <li> When my kids&#x27; Sonicares break down (and I know they will), we&#x27;ll go with Oral B for them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Down the line I&#x27;ll probably get a quieter model.  </li>
            <li> cuts down on dental cleaning time.</li>
            <li> bought this toothbrush thinking the price was low because it doesn&#x27;t have all the features (cleaning modes) or the big base and accessories like the more expensive models.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend (and I have a few times) to other people.</li>
            <li> The only down side I have of this is the brush head is so small it&#x27;s almost to small.</li>
            <li> Somewhat noisy when compared to my previous Philips Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li> The brush head on this toothbrush is smaller than the old series, so that was disappointing but otherwise works just as well.  </li>
            <li> Our previous two brushes were Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> * Not a fan of the 2 series brush head as they feel to cover less area.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t like the typical electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This one is a lot less</li>
            <li> The unit will not stand by itself if bumped ever so slightly.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have purchased a Sonicare years ago when my previous dentist recommended it</li>
            <li> It was impossible for my husband to wrap his head around it without the &amp;#34;quadpacer&amp;#34; so, seeing as how he had used it several times, making it not-such-a-good-idea to send it back to Amazon, I took advantage of Sonicare&#x27;s 90 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I have been unable to get the brush head properly attached to the handle</li>
            <li> and it lasted less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The brushing head is about half the size of the Sonicare toothbrushes I have used for 15 years.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so loud half of the time I can&#x27;t use it because I&#x27;m afraid it will wake up my roommate several rooms away.</li>
            <li> I regret this purchase as it is no where close to the previous version.</li>
            <li> We got over five years out of the previous model.</li>
            <li> For about half the cost it cleans my teeth just as well.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as my last Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I checked the brush and it was on tight.  </li>
            <li> The 5300 brush head goes on and off really easily with a twist and the base is wider so that accidental nudges do not knock it over.  </li>
            <li> after this last break down, I went with an Oral B (because I got tired of replacing the sonicare so often</li>
            <li> It has a fatter body and seems to be a little louder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little bit noisy, but within acceptable range.</li>
            <li> The vibration in your hand takes a little getting use to</li>
            <li> Just a little bit noisy.</li>
            <li> A little noisey.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to...</li>
            <li> On the Series 2, the brushes are less expensive, but it sounds like they sometimes hit the housing while in use, causing a loud buzz.</li>
            <li> My one and only complaint is that the grip is too slick and not easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> This one works fine, but the base is so light that it moves around just from the stiffness of the electrical cord, which is slightly annoying &amp; makes it feel cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> With this model, the whole handle of the brush shakes and makes my hand feel numb.</li>
            <li> and I have to think that it could have been included for a few pennies.  </li>
            <li> It made an annoying rattling sound.  </li>
            <li> So they&#x27;ve &amp;#34;escalated&amp;#34; my request quite a few times now and I&#x27;ve still not heard anything from them.</li>
            <li> and I wasted $40 for nothing.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are  expensive, and the toothbrush is old and getting noisy, so I decided to upgrade to the newer style.  </li>
            <li> I had to replace the brush heads with the &amp;#34;Gentle Gum cleaning heads&amp;#34;, the ones that came with it were too firm.</li>
            <li> and I am not an everyday flosser</li>
            <li> charging base is too light.  </li>
            <li> Mine died after just a few days.  </li>
            <li> Package was missing the toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m using it everyday</li>
            <li> It went broken after I bought it for only one month!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my dead sonicare essence 5300.  </li>
            <li> The oscillation from this one is so flawed that it causes the relatively soft bristles to &#x27;glide and hoover&#x27; over micro stains.</li>
            <li> Description was not accurate</li>
            <li> the head does not go on and off as easy and the base is rather small and unstable.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to put the tooth brush back on it&#x27;s base in low light situations, it is very difficult.  </li>
            <li> I am not real impressed with it, I use it maybe every other night or so.</li>
            <li> Aim the brush at a slight angle towards the gums moving slowly.</li>
            <li> This brush is one of the least expensive of those  Philips offers.</li>
            <li> However, since I know how much better they can be, I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps some part is loose or broken.</li>
            <li> This base is extremely lightweight, so the power cable makes it not stand straight.  </li>
            <li> and the hygienist said, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t make money from pts like you&amp;#34; because you have very little build</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for years, but had to replace them usually within a year.</li>
            <li> head is too small</li>
            <li> toothbrush vibrates like crazy when in the air, but as soon as the brush head touches my tooth, the vibration almost completely stops.  </li>
            <li> But I just take the brush off and put it in a small cup each time I use it</li>
            <li> Too small  </li>
            <li> This HX6211 is like a mini jack hammer with a small brush head.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the quality or effectiveness of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately got another one here in Dubai (local shop) for my wife.</li>
            <li> No more to say</li>
            <li> I mean you will be brushing one tooth at a time because it&#x27;s so little.</li>
            <li> small brushing head.  </li>
            <li> Do the exactly same job as the expensive ones..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the extra brush head or travel case in my order which was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> Half the time they will be complicated to use or interfere with other features on them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in my new Phillps Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> This one did not work well, the vibration/occilation was not very good</li>
            <li> The charger base is better designed as it&#x27;s now a solid base.  </li>
            <li> It came in a very plain package, which I agreed to, but there there were no directions either.  </li>
            <li> After having the better model I tried this one and was very disappointed in the poor performance of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I never realized how hard buying a sonic toothbrush could be until I Amazon searched it...</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t hear you.&amp;#34; However I hardly even notice it now.</li>
            <li> The head that came with the toothbrush was the head advertised, too hard for my gums.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe but it doesn&#x27;t feel as vigorous and there was a noticeable difference in</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get in touch with Phillips to get a replacement or organize the repair but seems it is quite hard to do it if the item is bought through amazon.  </li>
            <li> Cleans those hard to reach spots well.  </li>
            <li> A little annoyed that we had to replace one toothbrush purchased in a two-pack.  </li>
            <li> Why spend the extra $$$ and end up with all these crazy features for your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not much that could go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> and I am in my late 70s.  </li>
            <li> It is rechargeable and it comes for at least 10 days before you have to recharge.</li>
            <li> lot of people complained about the gap between the brush and the handle getting gunk and build up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this 2 series sucks..</li>
            <li> Also a bit disappointing is the fact that both models take different brush heads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry about the negative review</li>
            <li> This unit is cheap, makes horrible noise and there is ZERO chance</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m unhappy because I didn&#x27;t get the extra brush head and the travel case.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t wait to get at least two brushings in a day with this thing.  </li>
            <li> the fact that it gets you used to the power of the brush by slowly increasing the intensity every time you use</li>
            <li> The base is a little weird though as it isnt heavy enough to hold itself down on the counter it kinda lifts in the air when you take the brush off it.</li>
            <li> Brush head is very small</li>
            <li> The head to this toothbrush is very small and it is used for plaque removal.  </li>
            <li> Too loud... and vibrate like crazy!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it stopped working after less than two months.  </li>
            <li> This less expensive model runs for 2 minutes but does not beep every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> So, I tried this one since it is substantially less expensive.</li>
            <li> This thing is terrible, SUPER loud and won&#x27;t charge on the base provided.</li>
            <li> Not a good value.</li>
            <li> not good , It  always shake my teeth</li>
            <li> I find the vibrating action quite annoying.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basic and it gets the job done; I like the simplicity and the small size of the base</li>
            <li> holy crap is it ever loud.</li>
            <li> The tiny charging base lacks a mounting device so it is hard to keep the brush upright and stable.  </li>
            <li> The vibration is weak by design and there&#x27;s nothing I can do to fix</li>
            <li> Motor seems weak no matter how often I charge.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality and huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially jarring when I accidentally hit a row of teeth with the plastic backside of the brush, but not damaging or painful (it just transmits the vibration into your jaw, and feels weird.)  </li>
            <li> The head does not fit all the way onto the base so the vibration &amp; sound is awful.</li>
            <li> Item came bended and in a poor condition</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is extremely irritating to the lips and gums.</li>
            <li> But this one is a fake, or at least don&#x27;t have the Sonicare quality.</li>
            <li> That was false.</li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> Has no beep to switch positions during the 2 minutes; disappointed in this missing feature.</li>
            <li> Try it; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Maybe something is wrong with mine?</li>
            <li> I thought maybe this one was adjusted wrong at the factory.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to return this because my Dentist informed me</li>
            <li> I had bought the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> SO HORRIBLE SENT IT BACK FOR REFUND</li>
            <li> I think this is a case in point where Phillips attempted to improve their design and failed.  </li>
            <li> I was obsessed because I had never used an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this expensive, useless toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Wrong address, but the check arrived.</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong toothbrush.</li>
            <li> this sonic thing sorry</li>
            <li> uncomfortable on lips and gums.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I threw the box away.  </li>
            <li> I should have but the bullet and bought the expensive version</li>
            <li> and I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> It was impossible to tell from the photo which was the correct toothbrush head, resulting in a box of 6 of the wrong product on my doorstep.</li>
            <li> That is disappointing.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, I had a $75 Sonicare toothbrush before this</li>
            <li> Before I had the E series and couldn&#x27;t stand how dirty the inside got.</li>
            <li> I feel this could be dangerous for those who may not realize it can come on in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I thought she was crazy.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Bad product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; that get rid of that bad breath  </li>
            <li> I have bad teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a bad product.</li>
            <li> so I am somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> repackaged item, which makes me really disappointed</li>
            <li> so you spend about 1/4 of it on each quadrant;  I was disappointed that this feature had not been included in this Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY, the replacement is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed</li>
            <li> SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I did not like this tooth brush and found it very awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t it be flush with the base with no gap?</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> I will probably end up throwing this piece of crap away.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to a Philips Sonicare 2 from a base model Oral B/Braun electric toothbrush, and immediately noticed an improvement.  </li>
            <li> It shakes violently and hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> Crud doesn&#x27;t build up under the base of the handle or the head</li>
            <li> Do not like the way the head just slips into the hold in the base as a</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t pick it up with the base coming with</li>
            <li> If their crap is as noisy as the Oral B</li>
            <li> Have the base.</li>
            <li> so assumed we would get that as well as the charging base and the toothbrush body.</li>
            <li> I wish the base was not so flimsy.</li>
            <li> You have to get it on the protruding base.  </li>
            <li> The charging base on this is a joke.</li>
            <li> Why would someone want the base without a brush?</li>
            <li> and I hated the buildup issue</li>
            <li> Thoroughly disappointed and will not buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed .</li>
            <li> I am very very disappointed in this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it was just terrible.</li>
            <li> Vibrates horribly and does not even compare to a Costco bought sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The vibration was unreal and the tickle was insane.  </li>
            <li> but now I even wake up without nasty breath.  </li>
            <li> TERRIBLE QUALITY NO POWER OR PIZZAZ</li>
            <li> It lasted for 6 months and then started making this horrible rattling noise.</li>

            <li> I am replacing my old Philips Sonicare that I wore out and damaged while traveling.  I tried Sonicare after using the Oral-B for some time.  I was content with the Oral-B, but after trying the Philips Sonicare I will not go back.  It gives a more thorough and better clean, especially good for removing tartar.  Must be something about the vibration?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was blessed with good dental genes and have few problems, but I do hate to floss and don&#x27;t do it often enough.  When I went for my routine cleaning, the dentist noted how great my teeth looked, and asked if I&#x27;d been flossing more.  I notice the cleaner feel to my teeth after brushing, which tends to make me want to brush more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Easy to use, holds a charge well enough that I could take it along for long weekends (never tried any longer) with plenty of power.  The vibration noise takes a little getting used to -- it&#x27;s noisier in your head than to anyone outside the bathroom door.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED MY PHILLIPS SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH, I LOVE IT...I HAVE USED A ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH FOR YEARS BUT NEVER HAVE I HAD ONE LIKE THE SONICARE.  IT IS GREAT AND LEAVES YOUR MOUTH FEELING LIKE YOU HAVE HAD YOUR TEETH POLISHED BY THE DENTIST. JUST CAN&#x27;T SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT IT.  GREAT PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;MAGGIE</li>
            <li> Seems like a solid standard sonicare toothbrush. It doesn&#x27;t have all the fancy options the higher models offer. I was looking for something that would keep things basic and control my plaque build up. My dentist recommended Sonicare even sells it in his office. After using is for 1 full week I am happy with the results. Time will tell how the battery holds up. If I get the recommended 2 years of usage out of it I will be happy since I only paid $50 for it. Why spend the extra $$$ and end up with all these crazy features for your toothbrush. Half the time they will be complicated to use or interfere with other features on them. I did my research before buying this one and I did look at 2 other models. I ended going with this because it was just the basic model. Not much that could go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Can not really feel the difference from my former Sonicare</li>
            <li> Somewhat noisy when compared to my previous Philips Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush recommended by my dentist!!  Every time I brush feels like I have had my teeth cleaned !</li>
            <li> Everything was delivered on time. Philips Sonicare is a great thing to have. It helps you to keep your teeth in good condition.</li>
            <li> Got it while it was on sale and haven&#x27;t regretted my purchase in the slightest bit. In this age I think most people should have access to a powered toothbrush. This brush just does so much more than normal brushing can, it makes your teeth so clean they feel squeaky. When you brush with a manual brush after using one of these you can actually feel the difference. Phillips also has a Diamond tip that whitens teeth in under a week, so there&#x27;s that too. Would recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> Great price without all the bells and whistles like other models.  I never used the other setting on my previous Sonicare, so bought this one.  Has one setting &amp;#34;ON.&amp;#34;  That&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> Great deal!  It works just as well as my more expensive one, just has less features. Even works with braces!</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace an older one that used the e-series heads when the battery finally gave out after 5 years or so.  The e-series heads use a magnetic drive and are excellent, but they get a buildup of gunk under the head that is quite disgusting.  This style uses a mechanical drive and after a month of usage, I have to conclude that it does not produce as vigorous a brushing motion as the e-series.  It eventually does seem to get my teeth smooth and clean, but I end up brushing for somewhat longer to get the same effect.  I will say that it does not get gunked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other issue that might not matter to most is that it seems much louder than the e-series.  I live in an apartment with thin walls and because of my work schedule, I prepare for bed after midnight.  I don&#x27;t feel comfortable buzzing so loudly after quiet hours, although no one has complained.  I am not unhappy enough to change back, but in a few years when I need a replacement, I will go back to the other style.</li>
            <li> Sonicare are the best toothbrushes out there.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a terrific job.  Unfortunately, it stopped working after less than two months.  That is disappointing.</li>
            <li> What a terrific job it does.  Your teeth and mouth really feel clean after using this.  Dentist approved!</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush. One charge lasts over two weeks. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> As excellent gift for grandchildren.</li>
            <li> This sonic toothbrush does an excellent  job of cleaning teeth. It is an excellent choice if you have not had this type of toothbrush before.  It takes a few uses to get accustomed to the the differences between a regular brush and a sonic brush, which has bulk, vibrates, and requires a different style of brushing (you just pass the brush over your teeth and let the brush do the scrubbing). This brush is one of the least expensive of those  Philips offers. However, it shares the central and most important feature with the pricier Philips models: sonic vibration that is amazingly efficive in getting teeth really clean.  In my view this is a well-made, high quality product. I don&#x27;t often say that about products; I tend to be critical of any compromises in quality and am quick to find them.</li>
            <li> so surprise！comfortable and clear</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head on mine doesn&#x27;t fit all the way. Shouldn&#x27;t it be flush with the base with no gap? It&#x27;s very loud when used. If mine sounds defective please advise!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay; my oral b toothbrush was just as good with much lower cost.</li>
            <li> Love it. Every time I brush I feel like I just came from the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Actual product was a Philips Sonicare HX6210, sold with a discount. It was repackaged and came with all parts.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, cleaning is better than with a manual toothbrush, and I have gotten used to the &amp;#34;mosquito-mouth&amp;#34; buzz.</li>
            <li> a great gift for a 14 year old</li>
            <li> My last Sonicare lasted 10 years before it stopped charging and was over $150.  I purchased this one on right before Christmas and paid around $30 for it.  (I&#x27;m a great shopper)  Not sure yet if generic heads will work with this model.  I did try to use generic replacement heads with the first Eilte model they sold and they didn&#x27;t work; they turned on yes, but the vibrating brushing sensation was off, was loud and it just wasn&#x27;t the same.  Have tried generic replacements yet with this one, will update when I do.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> great, just what i wanted</li>
            <li> gave as gift  and they like it</li>
            <li> Sonicare has been my favorite teeth cleaning instrument for over 10 years.  I&#x27;ve tried various models.. Some I&#x27;ve liked better that others.  I chose this model because I&#x27;d had something similar for a much higher cost.  The flush fit of the actual brush as it mounts onto the handle is very desirable, The flush fit allows for better cleaning and maintenance of the actual  toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately as the adage goes, you get what you pay for!  The power of this particular model is much lower that ones previously tried.  It feels more like the battery operated models from Sonicare&#x27;s competitors.  I don&#x27;t get the squeaky clean feel like the diamond model or E-Sereis provide.  I&#x27;ll keep this model for travel and stick with my higher end models for daily use.</li>
            <li> The brush head on this toothbrush is smaller than the old series, so that was disappointing but otherwise works just as well.  I also didn&#x27;t like the 14 day mode, that is able to be shut off.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.  There is nothing new and improved about this toothbrush.  I bought this to replace another older Sonicare whose battery is starting to give out.  I will probably end up throwing this piece of crap away.</li>
            <li> Funtion is nice and delivery is ok</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the one I had for 6 years.  Love it.  I&#x27;ve had the best dental checkups  since starting to use the Sonicare and I am in my late 70s.  Have most of my extended family now using Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Our previous two brushes were Sonicare.  I know the brand works well as my every 6 month cleanings have revealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare is a fine product but we just have not had good luck with them lasting longer than a year or two...so this time we decided to go with the cheaper one....without all the bells and whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it does just as good a job cleaning as the more expensive models.  It has a fatter body and seems to be a little louder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s ok for over half the price I think I can live with that.</li>
            <li> Brush head is very small</li>
            <li> My original Sonicare toothbrush went kaput so I decided to try this one for plaque. It does a good job but it is very noisy and vibrates a lot. It is not as nice as my original so I am somewhat disappointed. I haven&#x27;t been to my dentist since buying it so I don&#x27;t know whether it is doing a good job with the plaque.</li>
            <li> performs as expected!</li>
            <li> It works but just barely. After having the better model I tried this one and was very disappointed in the poor performance of this toothbrush. It mainly vibrates with very little action. It does give you a 2 minute automatic off time. I am returning this product. I used my old brush attachment and not the new one that came with the product.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth wonderfully clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Solid electric toothbrush.  Once you go electric, you won&#x27;t go back to manual.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a great toohbrush</li>
            <li> I upgraded to a Philips Sonicare 2 from a base model Oral B/Braun electric toothbrush, and immediately noticed an improvement.  Very clean feeling mouth &amp; teeth; better than my Oral B/Braun, and nigh impossible with a manual toothbrush.  While the Oral B/Braun unit did little more than simulate a circular rotation of a manual toothbrush (albeit, very quickly,) the Sonicare actually pulsates in place at a reported &amp;#34;31,000 brush strokes per minute.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the head isn&#x27;t rotating really fast in small circles, the Sonicare feels more natural in my mouth, but the vibrations definitely took some getting used to.  It&#x27;s especially jarring when I accidentally hit a row of teeth with the plastic backside of the brush, but not damaging or painful (it just transmits the vibration into your jaw, and feels weird.)  I&#x27;m sure with some practice, I&#x27;ll quit doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend going through the &amp;#34;Easystart&amp;#34; process for anyone new to the Sonicare line of products.  I opted to turn it off for my first use, since I figured I was already accustomed to an electric toothbrush.  I probably shouldn&#x27;t have done this!  It doesn&#x27;t feel especially strong at full intensity, but it&#x27;s a completely different sensation than my previous brush.  I turned Easystart back on, and had a better experience the next time I brushed.  The feeling can be compared to a professional dental polisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  My only complaints are the &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; and charge time -- it supposedly takes a whopping 48 hours to charge from empty to full.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It&#x27;s a Sonicare without all the bells and whistles that just does what a toothbrush should do:  clean teeth.  Period. Try it; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have used Phillips previous version and there nothing major difference between them. It is rechargeable and it comes for at least 10 days before you have to recharge. And have been using for more than 9 months now and I like the head is soft and very easy to replace the head. Love it. My wife loved it and she got one for herself</li>
            <li> very good it takes getting used to, and remembering to turn it off before you remove from your mouth.  Cleaning is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Sonicare that stopped working after 8 yrs. This one did not work well, the vibration/occilation was not very good so I returned it and spent more to get the Healthy White.</li>
            <li> never thought I could LIKE an electric toothbrush but I actually look forward to using every day!</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other electric toothbrushes, but this one works great</li>
            <li> I bought these for my kids. It&#x27;s easy to use. Amazing! I would buy it again. Shipping was great and the package came sealed.</li>
            <li> When dental hygienist said I needed something different than &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; toothbrush to address plaque/tartar issue, I asked her what she recommended.  Yes, a Sonicare toothbrush.  I ordered and absolutely love it!  #1 my teeth have never been cleaner with no tarter buildup after hygienist cleaned them; #2 it forces me to brush for 2 minutes before it turns off; #3 it removes virtually all the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; between teeth - flossing rarely gets anything more; #4 took on a week trip but forgot charger - no problem as it lasted all week with 2 brushings per day; #5 use briefly on tongue and it feels much more refreshed and clean afterward.  Only wish I had not been so cheap and bought one years ago!</li>
            <li> Teeth are cleaner and generally whiter</li>
            <li> Perfect just what I wanted</li>
            <li> wish it had the 2minute timer which it does not</li>
            <li> Very powerful toothbrush</li>
            <li> Great！I  bought it twice！cheap and useful！</li>
            <li> The intensity of the vibration is about half that of the Healthy White version.  Points to consider:    * Most of the vibration is concentrated towards the bottom of the handle rather than at the brush head.  I find the vibrating action quite annoying.    * Not a fan of the 2 series brush head as they feel to cover less area.  They don&#x27;t seem to quite reach the gum areas as well as the flex/diamond brush heads.  * While half the price of the Healthy White they feel half as effective.  I don&#x27;t quite get the slick feeling on the teeth and gums as I do with the Healthy Whites.  * As of this writing Amazon is selling a Special Pack of the Healthy White that includes a Diamond brush, whitening pen and travel case.      Also, consider that the old style Elites still remains to provide the most vibration intensity for your teeth cleaning. The Healthy White is the sweet spot in my opinion.  As an aside, there are instructions on youtube on how to replace a dead battery on the Healthy Whites which requires some soldering if you&#x27;re so inclined.  I&#x27;ve returned the 2 Series in favor of another Healthy White and will probably try soldering a replacement battery on my old unit on a rainy day.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> shakes my teeth and my mouth doesnt feel clean anymore , a regular tooth brush leaves you with a cleaner feeling .</li>
            <li> Stopped working in 6 Months. Short-lived. Now what?</li>
            <li> I really love this thing. It isn&#x27;t like the typical electric toothbrush. it uses the same technology that my dental hygienist uses to clean my teeth. The price on Amazon was awesome also.</li>
            <li> When I bought this item, it was advertised with a travel case, but did not come with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does do a good job of cleaning your teeth. However, it is very loud. I&#x27;m kind of shocked that it got such good reviews with how loud it is. Maybe something is wrong with mine?</li>
            <li> This product is a basic electric toothbrush and provides the cleaning it is designed to do. It does not have all the bells &amp; whistles of the other Sonicare Toothbrushes. The price is fair and I just needed it to clean my teeth &amp; gums.</li>
            <li> good product but more cheaply made than the older one I had</li>
            <li> the voice is  a little large.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to use, and it is economic and affordable</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an older electric toothbrush.  I like the feeling of clean teeth which is much better than the older toothbrush gave.</li>
            <li> You feel like you&#x27;ve just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I was not sure I could get used to how it would feel in my severely sensitive teeth but I am totally used to it.  I am happy!!</li>
            <li> Nice toothbursh and improvement over older sonicare&#x27;s but the replacement heads are REALLY expensive.</li>
            <li> Not the best but for the price its ok.</li>
            <li> Charger did not work. Died after initial charge ran out..0 Stars</li>
            <li> Extremely loud due to head not fitting tight.&lt;br /&gt;Will return it.</li>
            <li> just want she wanted.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. Very clean and efficient brushing.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very easy to use. Very easy to change heads if you want to share with family members. Leaves teeth feeling clean. Easy to charge, easy to clean. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. Good value for price.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush for child</li>
            <li> There is a problem that it is a little loud.</li>
            <li> This model is far inferior to the two other Sonicare devices that I&#x27;ve used. It must be a knock-off.</li>
            <li> Works quite and teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Had some issues with receding gums and was recommended to see periodontist. This sonicare starts with a gentle cycle that builds gradually over two weeks, so there was never any pain or gum bleeding and my gums are healing. Every 30 seconds it pauses to let you know to change sections of your mouth. Plus, I have that &amp;#34;fresh from the hygienist&amp;#34; smooth teeth feel.</li>
            <li> Charm. Works very good</li>
            <li> A new improved , more stream-lined model</li>
            <li> Love love.. Finally feel like a real professional cleaning</li>
            <li> I purchased this item several months ago as a replacement for my Philips Healthy White model (that finally died after almost 5 yrs).  The first time I used the new brush I thought it didn&#x27;t clean as well as the Healthy White model but I attributed it to &amp;#34;being just in my head&amp;#34; and maybe just a different feeling due to a different shaped brush head.  Well,,, I went to the dentist today and the dentist commented that I had a LOT of buildup on my teeth and it took extra time for my semi-annual cleaning.  I never had comment like that while using the Healthy White model so this one is going in the trash and I&#x27;ll be going back to the Healthy White version.</li>
            <li> Bare bones model. Does the job if your not one that uses the quad timer to methodically move from one section of your gums to another.</li>
            <li> repackaged item, which makes me really disappointed</li>
            <li> Works well, a great buy!</li>
            <li> This base is extremely lightweight, so the power cable makes it not stand straight.  You put the toothbrush on the charger, and it all falls over.</li>
            <li> Overall great deal and product</li>
            <li> I prefer this electric toothbrush over oral-B because the head is small and the brush is not harsh on my teeth. I like it.</li>
            <li> A little big.Brush heads are not durable enough.</li>
            <li> fabulous. my teeth feel so much cleaner after using this product!</li>
            <li> Disappointing, I had a $75 Sonicare toothbrush before this and this was a severe step down but it is so loud I use a normal, non mechanic toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Super loud - everyone in my house hates this toothbrush. I can&#x27;t use it in the morning or it will wake people up on another floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) cleanliness - while better than a non mechanic toothbrush, very noticeable drop-off vs the better Sonicare products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) lack of timer - very minor feature loss but if you don&#x27;t take the effort to actually time yourself, you will brush for less time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regret I bought this.</li>
            <li> Been using Sonicare for years and this version is lighter, more comfortable - just right.</li>
            <li> great product and easy to use.  My middle schooler thinks it is fun to use!</li>
            <li> It is nice. My friend likes it</li>
            <li> TOO NOISY, LOW GRADE MERCHANDISE, NO COMPARIZON TO MY OLD SONICARE.  My old Sonicare toothbrush sonicare 6 series went out. Have not been able to find another one like it. So,I bought this Phillips Sonicare HX6211/30 2 Series Plaque control because it was rated #1 and because of my satisfied past experience with a Sonicare series 6. This toothbrush is cheaply made, It is so loud and the brushead fits loose against the toothbrush. I think the manufacturer forgot to put a rubber ring between the brushead and the tootbrush. If I  grab the center of the toothbrush head and push it down against the toothbrush, then turn on the switch, the toothbrush stops vibrating and is as quiet as my old Sonicare 6 series. My old Sonicare was very quiet and did the job well.  But when I use this new (Phillips Sonicare 2 series plaque control) my teeth do not feel thoroughly clean. I am so dissapointed and disatisfied with Phillips Sonicare for producing a toothbrush of such cheap quality and high price. Now I will have to go through the hazzle of returning and exchanging this toothbrush for one that works properly and is not so noisy.  The customers who have rated your toothbrush (Phillips Sonicare 2 series Plaque control) with high scores have obviously not experience any other electric toothbrushes before.  Maria Heydenburg</li>
            <li> Older model Sonicare died and replaced with this one.  Don&#x27;t have to take apart to clean....just love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> New one solved the problem I was having and now it stands up on its own.</li>
            <li> meet and exceeded all my expectation , great little toothbrush</li>
            <li> Buy one you will like it!  It only comes with one brush head so I ordered 8 replacement brushes that work fine and are much cheaper in price than the philips heads. Cost was 39.99 plus there was a $10.00 coupon so 29.99 plus free shipping. This model is identical in power, quality, and mechanical functionality in cleaning your teeth as the much higher priced models which in my opinion have overrated, unnecessary bells and whistles that make little if any difference in your brushing outcome-which is an excellent job of cleaning your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;8 Pcs. (2x4) E-Cron® Toothbrush heads,...&lt;br /&gt;E-Cron around $10.00 Free delivery</li>
            <li> is not as good as the HX6530 model.  this purchase shakes and does not brush as fast!</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush for my mother, who is 94.  She likes the feature that runs the brush for 2 minutes, then switches off. She says it makes her teeth (yes, she still has most of her own teeth, other than a couple she had implanted) cleaner than they&#x27;ve felt in months.  And, if Mama&#x27;s happy, then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> why there&#x27;s only one brush</li>
            <li> Love it. Auto-shuts off at 2 minutes, so I can&#x27;t cheat myself of a good cleaning. Much more gentle and effective than brushing with a regular toothbrush. Charge lasts about a week. It&#x27;s basic and it gets the job done; I like the simplicity and the small size of the base</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Cleaning power not as good as older unit.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Great Price. We had a more expensive model for which we paid over $100 dollars.It lasted just over one year. This one is a lot less and so far is just as good. The only noticeable difference between this one and the much more expensive model is that the higher priced one beeped  every 30 seconds while it ran for 2 minutes. This less expensive model runs for 2 minutes but does not beep every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Better than the ones I used in the past</li>
            <li> Could notice teeth getting whiter (together with sensodyne gentle whitening toothpaste) after a few weeks of use. Definitely cleans much better than an ordinary tooth brush.</li>
            <li> You should know that the image for this item shows the more expensive bonus pack, not the standard item. The two-minute timer doesn&#x27;t include the 30-second intervals like my old Sonicare. It&#x27;s OK, and I will keep it because it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to pack it up and ship it back.</li>
            <li> It works great!! i love how fast it removes plaque.&lt;br /&gt;would totally recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I am not real impressed with it, I use it maybe every other night or so.</li>
            <li> As a regular user of the Oral B electric toothbrush for 8 years, my dentist mentioned that due to my sensitive and receding gums, they recommend I try something like Sonicare, which would apply less friction and agitation to the gums. After a few weeks, I’ve definitely noticed a difference am glad I made the switch. It&#x27;s certainly more gentle while giving me the same clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Tip: Aim the brush at a slight angle towards the gums moving slowly. Hold the brush gently so your hands/body doesn’t absorb most of the vibrations, rather it goes where it is supposed to. Your teeth.</li>
            <li> I payed much more a while back for the healthy white version of this toothbrush.  Both toothbrushes worked great, and the only difference between this version and the healthy white are the &amp;#34;features&amp;#34;.  The quadpacer to tell you when to switch to a new section of your mouth, and the clean and white setting.  All the clean and white setting does is turn the timer a little longer.  I picked this up for 40 dollars and it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this tooth brush at the recommendation of my dental hygienist.  What an awesome product.  Using it results in a much more thorough teeth cleaning experience than I got with my former electric tooth brush .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for years, but had to replace them usually within a year. Finally decided to upgrade. Love this! I keep running my tongue over my teeth because they feel so clean, even on the backsides. Money well spent. I would do it again in a heartbeat. Came with a 2 1/2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> Great experience all around and delivery was very expeditious!</li>
            <li> Incredible toothbrush, SO worth thremoney! Only wish I&#x27;d gotten it sooner!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, Very happy with my purchase !!</li>
            <li> Great brush but way too loud and brush head is too small</li>
            <li> I very like it.it can use convenience</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, stay away.  The vibrations are SO strong, I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This seems to do a pretty good job. The head to this toothbrush is very small and it is used for plaque removal.  I assume I can purchase a different type of head. I use this combined with a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected. So far I love the toothbrush. Before I had the E series and couldn&#x27;t stand how dirty the inside got. This model is so much better.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> Mine does not have the Quadpacer as advertised. It does have a 2 minute timer which is nice. I have not felt a difference in strength since the first time until now. However, it lasts forever and it makes my teeth feel very clean!</li>
            <li> After using multiple Sonicare toothbrushes, I can tell you that this is all you&#x27;ll ever need. I&#x27;ve used several higher-end models, and they really don&#x27;t do much more than you can do with this brush. While I miss the 30-second timer per quadrant, it still has a 2-minute timer. Your Sonicare will break after 2 years, regardless, so why spend triple or quadruple on a higher end model?</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome and the charger works perfectly! I love having the convenience of notification when the battery is running low!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this toothbrush, I got it for him for a Christmas present</li>
            <li> Great product. This is my third Sonicare toothbrush and I&#x27;ll never go back to manual ones.</li>
            <li> I am a retired dentist and I can&#x27;t  rave enough about this devise. I am old school and always thought a hand brush was the best. I have now changed my mind. This brush cleans and massages fantastically. My gums are better than ever and my teeth feel sooo smooth after&lt;br /&gt; using the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;  This dentist is a convert.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare Healthy White toothbrush for a long time and it finally started to quit. So, I tried this one since it is substantially less expensive. The handle vibrates a lot, but the brush bristles barely vibrate. So, it took me a good 4 minutes of brushing before I felt properly clean. I&#x27;ll be returning this and purchasing another Healthy White model.    On the up side, this model can use the same charger and brush heads as theHealthy White model.    Update: I turned off the \\&quot;Easy Start\\&quot; feature so the toothbrush would be brushing at full speed. I didn&#x27;t realize this was a thing... Anyway, it&#x27;s better at brushing now, but it still doesn&#x27;t feel as effective as the Healthy White. It feels \\&quot;cheap.\\&quot; I can&#x27;t really explain what it lacks, but I feel better brushed after 2 minutes with the Healthy White than I do after 2 minutes with this model. I&#x27;ll be exchanging for the Healthy White.</li>
            <li> this brush is unusable and I am returning it already. It shakes violently and hurt my gums. Thoroughly disappointed and will not buy this brand again! I would like to add that this happens when the brush head is added, and it&#x27;s possible that is the problem?</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes don&#x27;t get much simpler than this. It has a one button control, so it goes on and off. It has a single beep and light to let you know the battery is low. Which means, this is the perfect sonicare toothbrush for me! It times the cycle, and all I have to do it gently move it around. Changing the brush is easy peezy, and it&#x27;s proven to be pretty durable along with effective.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very appreciative of the preset ramp up period too, no thinking, just brushing, while it slowly takes 10 fully brush cycles to hit max sonicare cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, and this gets my teeth sparkling clean! Highly, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist and I love it.</li>
            <li> Every other one/two star review is right. It&#x27;s loud enough to hear all over the house, doesn&#x27;t clean nearly as well as other models (even the older base models), and feels cheap and plastic. Only someone who has never had a Sonicare before would enjoy this model. I&#x27;ve owned 6 before this one and it&#x27;s a travesty.</li>
            <li> Excellent Unit, does what is says it does. Three weeks usage and big difference in plaque removal.</li>
            <li> It is an interesting process, but my dentist assures me it is an effective one. Easy to operate, but covering one&#x27;s mouth when using saves spraying all over self and mirrors.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush not only cleans my teeth but my gums also.  Easy to use.  I wish an extra brush was included.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok - had others that made my mouth feel cleaner</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband on the advice of our dental hygienist. He has had many problems with gum disease but possibly due to not enough flossing and brushing. Since we received this last week he has brushed and flossed every day. I&#x27;m pleased. Don&#x27;t know if the unit is good because I am not the one using it but he says it works great. Just the fact that he is using it makes it a great purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Better than old brush.  Will know more at next cleaning!!</li>
            <li> BEWARE:  The motor that drives this toothbrush is not the same as most others (except for the 6631 which is the same).  It is not as forceful and you will not have the same results if you have used any of the other Philips models.  I confirmed this with Philips Customer Service.</li>
            <li> Wow, does it clean well!</li>
            <li> very effective, a little noisy,</li>
            <li> Love it, my mouth feels extra clean!</li>
            <li> The head does not fit all the way onto the base so the vibration &amp; sound is awful. VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush likely does a good job, but it&#x27;s extremely noisy.</li>
            <li> Item came bended and in a poor condition</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s replacing the Sonicare Diamond I had, which had several different speeds and times. I got used to the more complicated one.</li>
            <li> Great power toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li> As a dental professional, I am able to get a discount on the toothbrushes my office sells. However, this deal, especially with Amazon Prime&#x27;s free shipping, is better than what I can get in my own office! I bought this brush as a replacement for a more expensive Sonicare toothbrush that my teenager broke. He is in braces, and this brush cleans his teeth much better, due to the ultrasonic action that will not only remove plaque &amp; stains but also helps to reduce bacterial biofilm. The brush is perfect for teens because it only has the on/off button, and a thicker handle that is easy to grip. An older person will find this brush easy to use as well. I was going to spend more on an Oral B power brush, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t. The cost to replace the head on this brush is under $5.00, which I always tell my patients to consider. Some brush head replacements on other Sonicare models run as high as $30.00! Oral B has outstanding warranty service if anything happens to your brush as well. I would much rather spend less on a toothbrush for my teen as he is hard on them, and this will make sure he doesn&#x27;t have plaque issues while he is in braces. The ultrasonic brush vibrations are not too strong, so no worries that he will knock off a bracket while using this brush. All in all, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Was just as I wanted. Came on time and to my surprise was already charged</li>
            <li> A lower end model.  It works ok, but the brushes don&#x27;t fit exactly, and its a little buzzy.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush but not as good as my previous Sonicare toothbrushes. My other Sonicares had a two minute timer that had a quick pause and restart after 30 seconds, 60 seconds, and 90 seconds and shut off after 120 seconds.  Those little pauses made it easy to spend about 30 seconds on each quadrant of your teeth.  Now, without the pauses, it is harder to divide your brushing time up so you spend about 1/4 of it on each quadrant;  I was disappointed that this feature had not been included in this Sonicare toothbrush.  That is a feature that I have come to expect from Sonicare and I have to think that it could have been included for a few pennies.  The toothbrush itself does seem to work well and it does a good job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Very effective plaque remover.  My dentist congratulated me on the lack of stains, plaque and tarter on my teeth after I used this toothbrush for six months.  I have not had any cavities since using this, either.  The charger is a bit flimsy, and the electric cord is still tangled after months of use.  But as for the toothbrush itself and it&#x27;s tooth-decay prevention, it is an A+--I do recommend this!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully and is a great value for the price paid</li>
            <li> The brush on this is much stiffer that the ones on my old Philips toothbrush.  It works well but is a little noisier that my old one.</li>
            <li> A very good product. Easy to use and improved brushing.</li>
            <li> This version of the toothbrush is way better than the e-series. Easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed . It is very lightweight and skinny which makes it hard to hold even for my small hands. It is not very powerful. My old one was fast and felt like my teeth were being cleaned.  This has very little power on full charge. I reverted to using my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> My teeth become whiter indeed.And the gums do not bleed as before when the teeth are brushed.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works really well. Warning: make sure to charge it fully before using for the first time, otherwise, its battery will last for shorter than it is intended for. Overall, the charging is a bit slow, but all-in-all, this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> works great!  Just as advertised!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. SMOOTH TRANSACTION. DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> This the 2nd sonicare purchased, I have been using one for over 3 yrs and have GREAT dental cleanings, where use to be stains and tartar are NO MORE.</li>
            <li> I purchased two Phillips Sonicare HX6211/30 2 Series electric toothbrushes. One has failed to work properly after 3 months of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;One toothbrush has been used regularly since December 26, 2014 and no longer works properly, the other toothbrush has not beenused much but do not expect it to last much longer. The product(s) cannot be returned after 30 days and the product is junk. Do not purchase this product if you expect it to last more than 3 months. Very disapointed in Sonicare and Amazon for selling such shoddy products.</li>
            <li> Compared to the more expensive models, such as the Easy Clean and/or Healthy White, this Plaque Control model rattles loudly during usage. Motor works strong and cleans teeth the same, but it seems as though the plastic housing does not have the same build quality as the more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t care about the loud noise, this model might be good for you if you are looking for a low-cost entry model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip: Target has a special edition model with various colors and free travel case for the same price.</li>
            <li> Everything about it was right... the price, the quality and the machine.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these on the same day hoping to access the $10 off coupon but only got $10 of one of the items. I requested weeks ago the additional $10 off. No response from Amazon. This is a flimsy, noisy product. This is our second Philip Sonicare and they certainly seem to have cheapened up their product.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the first one; bought another. Everybody,happy!</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to bother with batteries.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended this brand.</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth better than any other toothbrush I have used</li>
            <li> I miss the Philips Sonicare HX7002/62 e-Series.  This one doesn&#x27;t come a part as easy and doesn&#x27;t have the handy travel case.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare 2 Series is an excellent toothbrush but with a base that makes the product less than desirable.  The base is much too light for the unit. The unit will not stand by itself if bumped ever so slightly.  Too bad, this could easily be a five star rating!</li>
            <li> Why I didn&#x27;t get it earlier? It&#x27;s the best thing for your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was struggling with the tickling sensation but as soon as I got used to it I enjoy every time I use this amazing toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is extremely irritating to the lips and gums.</li>
            <li> Replacing our old Sonicare! Works great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t setup the timed brushing.  The brush works well.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth so fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  Thought it rotated and it just vibrates.</li>
            <li> Great tool to keep your teeth clean and happy. Working wonders for my 12 years old. Quiet and ergonomic. Light and I like the fact that gives you a built in timer.</li>
            <li> I am very very disappointed in this toothbrush. I bought it Sept 26, 2014. It stopped working on Jan 6, 2015. It is not even 4 months old. It will not hold a charge. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Much easier to maintain than the old style sonicare which I just switched from.  Cheaper too.</li>
            <li> I have a very old Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush, model HX6950, that I bought in 2008.  It&#x27;s not in the best shape these days; I need to open it up once in a while to clean it because a little bit of moisture can get inside due to the old gasket on top.  The model I&#x27;m reviewing had a good promotion ($10 off the normal price), so I figured this was a great time to replace my old toothbrush.  Now I wish I hadn&#x27;t bothered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush vibrates like crazy when in the air, but as soon as the brush head touches my tooth, the vibration almost completely stops.  My old toothbrush had a very strong vibration that did not stop once in contact with my teeth.  Don&#x27;t worry, I did follow the instructions to disable the easy-start feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually opened up my new toothbrush last night to see if there was something I could do.  The old toothbrush had an adjustable gap between the coil and the magnet that would affect the strength of the vibration.  I thought maybe this one was adjusted wrong at the factory.  Easy fix, I thought!  However, what I found was a completely different design from my old toothbrush.  There is no way to adjust it.  The vibration is weak by design and there&#x27;s nothing I can do to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had not come from a better toothbrush, I might think this one was amazing.  Perhaps that&#x27;s why it has such great reviews, since it&#x27;s an entry level Sonicare and most people buying this came from a manual toothbrush.  However, since I know how much better they can be, I&#x27;m very disappointed.  My teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean after using this like they do with my old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this toothbrush thinking the price was low because it doesn&#x27;t have all the features (cleaning modes) or the big base and accessories like the more expensive models.  I could deal with that.  However, what I found is that it&#x27;s cheaper because it doesn&#x27;t come with all the features, accessories, AND an it has an inferior vibration design.</li>
            <li> So far working really well. Purchase and mailing were perfect.</li>
            <li> It is take a while to get use to the brush, I like it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, but it makes a weird grinding/buzzing sound that the same toothbrush purchased elsewhere does not make. Perhaps some part is loose or broken.</li>
            <li> 4 months and will not hold a charge.  I&#x27;m trying to get it replaced by the manufacturer which has been a drawn out process.  I&#x27;ll go back to Oral B after this.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I was just at the Dentist every day!! Haven&#x27;t had to buy replacements yet so not sure how much I will like it when I have to pay for replacements. Battery lasts forever and it charges overnight. So convenient and handy!</li>
            <li> good but a little noisy</li>
            <li> I think this might have been a gray market purchase.  Cheaply made and cheaply performs.  Not nearly as good as my last Sonicare.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this brand because she said it wouldn&#x27;t deteriorate my gums. I knew it wouldn&#x27;t work for me the first moment I tried it out. The noise was so loud and the vibrations were so irritating that I immediately turned it off, repacked it and sent it back. I think I&#x27;ll stick with the low tech model of a plain toothbrush in a human hand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;The brush component to mine obviously didn&#x27;t fit the body.</li>
            <li> Just got and used for the first time. Apparently I&#x27;ve been wasting time every other time I have brushed my teeth. They feel amazing.  I suppose I&#x27;ll get used to the tickling sensation.  If anything displeased me I&#x27;ll update this review. Otherwise 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to return this because my Dentist informed me I had bought the wrong one.  I did, however, buy one from his office - it is&lt;br /&gt;a sonic and I absolutely love it -- the best toothbrush I have ever used.  It is so unique and different from any that are out there. Makes your&lt;br /&gt;teeth feel so clean and helps with gum care!</li>
            <li> This does a great job. My only regret is that it doesn&#x27;t have 2 speeds. That is my fault, not the brush.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Love how clean my teeth and gums feel.</li>
            <li> Like this model much better than the old e-series! Crud doesn&#x27;t build up under the base of the handle or the head and it still brushes my teeth as well!</li>
            <li> Boy does it work!  Wish I had bought one years ago.</li>
            <li> Totally garbage!  Does not compare to more expensive Sonicare models.  I bought this because my fiancée and I shared a single sonicare brush handle (using our own heads, of course) and wanted a second one.  My original was a version with 4 speed settings that cost over $100. This one seemed a reasonable value since it kept only the one &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting, and I expected it to work comparably to our other handle.  However, when I put my diamondclean tip on it, it felt weak, and was clearly not cleaning my teeth the way it would when it was on the more expensive handle.  I was so infuriated with Phillips over this cheap junk that I&#x27;m gonna give Oral b&#x27;s electric toothbrush a try as our second unit</li>
            <li> I only needed one brush and this fit the bill. I would prefer the larger brush as the older models were like, but this is okay. It is very good and keeps the charge very well.</li>
            <li> Compare with the price it&#x27;s good enough. Little bit noisy, but within acceptable range.</li>
            <li> VERY VERY LOUD AND VIBRATING IN YOUR HAND......SO HORRIBLE SENT IT BACK FOR REFUND</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush I ever used.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a wonderful job scrubbing my teeth super clean.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and there&#x27;s no plaque anywhere.  Yea!</li>
            <li> I love how my teeth feel after brushing with my new Philips Sonicare tooth brush. My dentist will be impressed!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have purchased a Sonicare years ago when my previous dentist recommended it but I could not bring myself to spend well over $100 at them time (10 plus years ago). My teeth have never felt as clean after brushing (either with a battery operated Spinbrush or a manual brush) as they do with my new Sonicare. I am also very happy with the smaller gum care brush head that came with it. Some people may prefer standard size but I think my mouth is on the smaller size and feel as though I can reach harder to reach areas more easily. I love it and will update my review when or if any significant changes occur for me with he brush.</li>
            <li> The brush works great.  Has two minute timer.  I like bare bones appliances without too many features to learn so brushing in the morning before coffee amounts to putting some toothpaste on the brush and pushing the button.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Sonicare. It does a great job.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after brushing with a Sonicare. It feels more powerful and better quality than those battery powered toothbrushes.  Since I had arm surgery on both arms, I&#x27;m happy that the toothbrush is doing the work and doing it well.</li>
            <li> I also own an E-series Sonicare, and the Series 2 seems to be lower quality. On the E-series, the brushes are more expensive, but the unit just hums when you use it. On the Series 2, the brushes are less expensive, but it sounds like they sometimes hit the housing while in use, causing a loud buzz. I&#x27;d stay with the E-series if I had a do over.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my kids. Love sonicare!</li>
            <li> It took me two days and night to get it fully charged. Called it&#x27;s customer service and be told they won&#x27;t replace it if it&#x27;s still working fine. So be prepared to buy two at the same time.</li>
            <li> My dentist is so happy i got this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the E-Series sonicare electric tooth brushes for years.  When my last E-series started getting old, (6 years of use) I thought I would try one of the newer models.  Well, I can&#x27;t tell you how dissapointed I was when I received it.  I charged it overnight and then used it for the first time.  It made an annoying rattling sound.  I checked the brush and it was on tight.  It also didn&#x27;t have the same cleaning power of the older E-series.  The E-series cleans better and is much quieter.  I sent it back and ordered another new E-series unit.  I think this is a case in point where Phillips attempted to improve their design and failed.  Either that or I got a defective unit.  If so, I didn&#x27;t want to try another one.      It seems to me that they decided to make more profit by making the new design cheaper.  In the end, it&#x27;s not as good as the old model.  I&#x27;ll keep using the E-series models until they stop making them.  In fact, I may order a couple more just so I have them on hand in case they stop making them.</li>
            <li> Great brush, though takes a little while to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> This product is really good.  Leaves teeth clean and mouth fresh!  Can&#x27;t wait for my next dental appointment, will my hygienist be surprised!</li>
            <li> Has no beep to switch positions during the 2 minutes; disappointed in this missing feature.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very noisy and vibrates a lot; but I think for the price it does the job.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Sonicare and said they all clean the same (the expensive ones just have more bells &amp; whistles), so I bought the 2 Series, the most basic Sonicare.  Had to return all 3 I tried.  They are MUCH louder than the other Sonicares I&#x27;ve experienced.  Louder than my Oral-B Professional Care 3000; loud enough to hurt my ears without touching the brush to my teeth.  I spoke at length with Philips customer support multiple times and got varying answers.  None thought it should be as loud as what they heard over the phone.  One rep suggested the Easy Clean or Healthy White products as quieter than the 2 Series.  My father&#x27;s FlexCare is much quieter.  It might not be too loud for you, but be advised the 2 Series is not the quiet toothbrush the other Sonicares are known for being.</li>
            <li> It works but the head feels loose. So cut a star.</li>
            <li> Loud and bulky. Sent it back as the vibration was glitchy. I pretty sure it was defective.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for a long time, and love it. But this one is a fake, or at least don&#x27;t have the Sonicare quality. Its shrill sound is unbearable.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever had.</li>
            <li> there is some better deals available</li>
            <li> Really like this brush. The head last for a long time and love that it has a two minute timer, it makes you feel kinda bad when you click the power button to turn it off even though you know it hasnt been two minutes yet. Either way the charge last a really long time and I never worry when traveling. The base is a little weird though as it isnt heavy enough to hold itself down on the counter it kinda lifts in the air when you take the brush off it. Over all good product no problems.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife and she loves it. Teeth feel so much cleaner than regular brushing. I have a EasyClean that I spent a lot more for. Higher models simply have more features. This is the basic, and in my opinion, all you need.</li>
            <li> I really do like my new tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Arrived before due date. As described but came with only 1 head.</li>
            <li> Works great and is very quiet. It remains to be seen how long the heads last, but so far so good the 2 minute timer feature is helpful. I&#x27;m really not sure why you would spend more on an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought the cheaper version, the extra $5 saved could have been used for a meal at In N Out.</li>
            <li> A big improvement over the chintzy Sonicare I returned.</li>
            <li> I have been using this and now can&#x27;t go back to just brushing with a manual brush. I love how you can keep using it for a couple of weeks even before it needs another charge too.</li>
            <li> I love sonicare but this style hardly had any vibration compared to other ones I&#x27;ve had.. It felt as if I was brushing with a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a replacement for a fancier model that broke.  No bells and whistles but it does what I need and want. Teeth feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product, timely delivery!</li>
            <li> In the picture, it shows 2 brushes.  On the original package,which I did not get, it says &amp;#34;additional brush&amp;#34; I only recieved one brush.</li>
            <li> So I was going to buy the the older Sonicare toothbrush, the HX5630/50 I believe, because my boyfriend uses that one and it&#x27;s amazing. I was obsessed because I had never used an electric toothbrush. So I get on Amazon and see that there is a new and improved one that is only $10 more... So of course I wanted to get it and rub it in his face that mine was much better than his, BUT that was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is so loud, it scares the life out of my 2-year old pitbull. And it does not even work.... I felt like I had to just use it like a normal toothbrush because the top and bottom don&#x27;t really connect and it was just terrible. When I saw the reviews on it... I was sure it was going to be awesome, but now I&#x27;ve realized that Sonicare is like all other companies and most likely has people making 5-star bogus reviews that are lies. I do not recommend this expensive, useless toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the price is ok, i like it</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Significantly less plaque on teeth after brushing with the Sonicare than using a regular toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;- Self timer (2 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to recharge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Heavier than expected&lt;br /&gt;- Only one movement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend if you want a toothbrush that can significantly reduce plaque build up. I&#x27;m sure there are more expensive toothbrushes with more movement but these are sufficient.</li>
            <li> Not powerful enough.  A bit of a let down</li>
            <li> This particular model wasn&#x27;t nearly as powerful vibration wise as past Sonicares I&#x27;ve had. Not sure if it is a different model or not, but wasn&#x27;t as effective as before.</li>
            <li> It does the job but spend a little more and get the next model up.  03/13/2016 - Update: Battery started not taking a full charge about a month ago. A full charge only lasts about five days. Also very loud. Spend a little more and get a better model.</li>
            <li> PREFER IT OVER THE ORAL-B (ROTATING HEAD) AND FOUND THIS THE BEST PRICE, EVEN OVER COSTCO. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT IT DOES NOT COME WITH A TRAVEL CASE, BUT I DEFINITELY LIKE THE EASILY RECYCLABLE CARDBOARD WRAPPING OFFERED BY AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Good but expensive replacement heads</li>
            <li> Really, this gets zero stars. I bought it not knowing what a &amp;#34;quadpacer*&amp;#34; was, not did I know why I&#x27;d want to spend $20 extra to get it. It was impossible for my husband to wrap his head around it without the &amp;#34;quadpacer&amp;#34; so, seeing as how he had used it several times, making it not-such-a-good-idea to send it back to Amazon, I took advantage of Sonicare&#x27;s 90 day money back guarantee. That was in April. This is July. I&#x27;ve called, I&#x27;ve called, I&#x27;ve called, and I&#x27;ve called. They tell me there is nothing they can do to get my money back except to &amp;#34;escalate&amp;#34; my request. I&#x27;ve never heard anything from them. So they&#x27;ve &amp;#34;escalated&amp;#34; my request quite a few times now and I&#x27;ve still not heard anything from them. I bought a WaterPik with electric toothbrush -- love it!  *Quadpacer -- it&#x27;s the beep you hear every 30 seconds to tell you to switch to another quadrant of your mouth. Why would anyone (!!!) who has made so much money off electric toothbrushes want to stop this feature? It probably cost them more money to NOT put this feature in that it does to add it. These products have always had this feature (we&#x27;ve used them for decades) and now all of a sudden they&#x27;re making one without?  Update August 18th. Check received. Wrong address, but the check arrived. Amazing.</li>
            <li> Love.  Took me awhile to get used to though.  My whole mouth vibrated at first.</li>
            <li> very good toothbrush, cleans very good.</li>
            <li> It was very noisy and seemed poorly constructed. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Very good, to brush cleaner than ordinary toothbrush, it is suitable for my kind of late &amp;#34;lazy cancer&amp;#34; people, beginning with the time will be struggling to master a bad time, but got used to it after a few used, overall the toothbrush is very good, worth buying, only to determine that the voice is a bit large.</li>
            <li> Bad product.  Vibrates horribly and does not even compare to a Costco bought sonicare.  Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I have to write a honest review - The vibration was so weak, even weaker than my broken HX6730 that I try to replace. And, you can&#x27;t even return to get refund - hygiene product. It tarnish the reputation of Sonicare big time and I wasted $40 for nothing.</li>
            <li> Use everyday and am pleased with its performance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older stye Sonicare essence toothbrush for many years.  The replacement heads are  expensive, and the toothbrush is old and getting noisy, so I decided to upgrade to the newer style.  My wife has one and loves it.  I didn&#x27;t really need or want the bells and whistles of the expensive models, so decided to buy a basic model.  I should have read the reviews, because this model is very noisy - much louder that the one I&#x27;m replacing.  The brush doesn&#x27;t fit all the way down on the holder, and it vibrates loudly.  I returned the first one, thinking it was defective.  The replacement is exactly the same - very noisy.  So I am now returning that one as well.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I feel this product truly aids in keeping your teeth and gums the cleanest and healthiest they can be. It charges quickly and is very lightweight and portable.</li>
            <li> For what I payed for it I am not unhappy.  I purchased the more expensive model several years back and never used a lot of the features.</li>
            <li> I had to replace the brush heads with the &amp;#34;Gentle Gum cleaning heads&amp;#34;, the ones that came with it were too firm. Because the cost of the unit was so discounted it was still a bargain money wise and works for me quite well.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected! Battery life is great. Charge it overnight once a week!</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong toothbrush. This one buzzes as loud as a saw! Go with the Easy Clean Hx/6511/34 if you want a quieter toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like this electric toothbrush. The vibration in your hand takes a little getting use to but it works great. The narrower brush helps me get to my back teeth area much better.  I like the timer (a little pulse hesitation) after a minute to help you know that you have brushed for a certain amount of time. At first I thought it was a defect but then I realized that was the timer that was mentioned.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted. Really good.</li>
            <li> It was impossible to tell from the photo which was the correct toothbrush head, resulting in a box of 6 of the wrong product on my doorstep.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit noisy. Anyway, it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! I don&#x27;t think I can go back to a manual toothbrush. If your thinking of buying one, do it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this at Walgreens for $74. Good gawd...what a price difference here on Amazon. Okay...long time user of a Sonicare HX6530...one of the earlier ProResults models. Have had that thing for a long time. Most likely 8 years or so. Workhorse of a brush. Always worked great and is still working. Stays at the office. So I go to purchase this unit at Walgreens, great packaging and such....got it home and holy crap is it ever loud. Even the dog ran out of the room. If I remove the brush, it&#x27;s perfectly fine. As soon as the brush is install...CHAOS! I also purchased two replacements brushes and those have the same problem. I did brush with it once and the noise went away as long as you applied a good amount of pressure on the brush. Most likely too much pressure for safe brushing. Additionally, it felt like I had a chain saw in my mouth. WAY too aggressive. Just didn&#x27;t seem like it was a well thought out, tested, high quality unit. But again, I love my HX6530 model and will most likely just get another one of those. Perhaps they forgot to bolt my together correctly...but if they are all like this, then I would highly recommend that you look at a different model.</li>
            <li> Works well, vibration is very strong, might be to much if you have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Your teeth feel like they just left a cleaning from the dentist.  Been using crest white with it, have noticed a difference in just a couple days</li>
            <li> Everything worked fine  but the vibration tickled my tongue so much when I accidentally touched it, I gave it to my wife.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Best toothbrush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Brushes teeth like a champ</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is exactly what I need. Simple and highly effective. I never realized how hard buying a sonic toothbrush could be until I Amazon searched it... there are so many options and I had no idea which one to pick. I ran into this one on sale at Walmart, took the plunge, and very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Love the fact that it gets you used to the power of the brush by slowly increasing the intensity every time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people complained about the gap between the brush and the handle getting gunk and build up. But I just take the brush off and put it in a small cup each time I use it and this solved every bit of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. Easy to use. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more expensive ones but bought this as a back up. Do not like the way the head just slips into the hold in the base as a I feel this could be dangerous for those who may not realize it can come on in your mouth. I feel this has a propensity to be swallowed by kids and/or those who just don&#x27;t realize it. I&#x27;d go with the more expensive one just for the safety factor that head screws on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, way better than manual brushing. Have used Sonicare products for over ten years and dental check ups are always better than they ever were before electronic tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> Really love it! Light weight and get the job done.</li>
            <li> i dont like it feel this thing vibrating when useing it feel like your&lt;br /&gt; felings are going to vibrate out of your mouth i perfer&lt;br /&gt; a side to side brushing action  seems ever one wemt to&lt;br /&gt; this sonic thing sorry i dont like it at all&lt;br /&gt; dont like the feel dont like the vibration what the sence&lt;br /&gt; if you dont like the felling lets bet back on the road with this one  ask people what they like&lt;br /&gt; befor puting it out to market  i own it i dont like it no sonic tooth brush for me&lt;br /&gt; and when brushing dont forget to brush your tung&lt;br /&gt; that get rid of that bad breath  mouth wash is nice&lt;br /&gt; but want results brush that tung  nice and clean ask your dentist&lt;br /&gt;  he or she will agree for they know !!!!</li>
            <li> works well but should have waited, it was cheaper a week later</li>
            <li> We have used sonicare for years. Every 1-2 years or so, the brush motor or the charger breaks down, and we end up buying a new one. We&#x27;ve stuck with them in spite of the price, the inconvenience of consistent breakdowns right after the warranty period, and the DISGUSTING buildup that happens under the brush head,, because our gums are so much healthier since starting with Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is... after this last break down, I went with an Oral B (because I got tired of replacing the sonicare so often and I hated the buildup issue, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, no matter how much I cleaned it), and then my partner&#x27;s brush broke down, and I replaced it with... you guessed it, another Sonicare. UNFORTUNATELY, the replacement is AWFUL. I don&#x27;t know what they did with this latest version, but it&#x27;s LOUD, obnoxiously so, and vibrates uncontrollably. I&#x27;ve had it with this brand, and we&#x27;ll be switching to Oral B. When my kids&#x27; Sonicares break down (and I know they will), we&#x27;ll go with Oral B for them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare: simply because you were first to market, or could advertise the loudest, doesn&#x27;t mean you can slack on quality. Fix your known issues!</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth tingly clean!</li>
            <li> The first few brushes are extremely rough and uncomfortable but now I love this brush!</li>
            <li> Definitely the lower end of the Sonicare product line.  Very noisy and feels lightweight and poorly made compared to the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I like it just fine. The only thing is, my old one had a timer which let you know when each 30 seconds went by, and then when it was at 2 minutes. This one just shuts off at 2 minutes period. I&#x27;m getting used to that though. So it&#x27;s all great!</li>
            <li> So went for my first cleaning 6 months post using sonicare (I should use it 2x/day) and the hygienist said, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t make money from pts like you&amp;#34; because you have very little build up&amp;#34;. There&#x27;s no way a manual would have given me the same results and I am not an everyday flosser (I should tho). I,  however, use the therabreath mouth wash daily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my old sonicare started turning on by itself so it was time to replace it. it lasted long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this 2 series sucks.. its bulkier and its really noisy. it sounds like something is loose and vibrating or loose on top of the normal vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh well.. it was cheap and it does work.</li>
            <li> Too loud... and vibrate like crazy! My hand gets numbness...</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this !</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been so clean!  Took about a week for my head to get used to the vibrations of this thing.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush works just fine.  I only gave it 4 stars because I have been unable to get the brush head properly attached to the handle so it doesn&#x27;t make a loud vibrating noise when used.  I am hopeful this problem will go away with replacement brush units.</li>
            <li> My friends told me it would be better then my other &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; toothbrush.  Boy were they right.  This feels a bit like it is vibrating your insides, but does an amazingly good job of leaving my teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  My dentist recommended this specific model and suggested that you don&#x27;t need to spend big bucks to get a high quality toothbrush. It is basic and gets the job done.  The cycle is 2 minutes which is plenty of time to leave you with a fresh mouth and teeth that feel just as though you came from the dentist after a cleaning.  If 2 minutes doesn&#x27;t cut it, just go through another cycle.</li>
            <li> Noisy, but works as expected.</li>
            <li> The brush is too load.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Awesome! Works likes no other battery operated tooth brush I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I have bad teeth. Stained from medication. Destroyed deom medication but I could never justify spending this much on a toothbrush. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Pros and cons.  Pros: 1. Dentist clean. 2. Removes a LOT of gumline plaque. 3. My breath smells better 4. Charge holds a long time.  Cons 1.noise wakes up kids. 2. Neighbors called police thinking my boyfriend might be hacking me with a chainsaw. 3. You need earplugs.  Seeiously. This thing is LOUD, but you DO adjust and to me it&#x27;s worth it. Down the line I&#x27;ll probably get a quieter model.  EDIT: Been a bit over a month now and wanted to update. Thing is still just as loud as the day I bought it.  &amp;#34;Kids don&#x27;t talk mom is brushing her teeth. I won&#x27;t hear you.&amp;#34; However I hardly even notice it now. You really adjust to the noise.   My teeth def look better, and that&#x27;s coming from my dentist.  Still one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud and the vibrations are stronger than I expected. It&#x27;s taking some getting used to. I do like the timer that auto stops after 2 minutes. The charged battery lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> When my wife said she wanted a Sonicare for Christmas I thought she was crazy.  That much money for a toothbrush? But I indulged her and we both got one.  Two months later I had the best dentist appointment of my life--no cavities, increased gum health, and the four trouble spots the dentist was watching were completely healed.  I&#x27;m a believer.  This is the best toothbrush you can get, and totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Powerful and effective.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush very much. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now, and love the way it makes my mouth feel so clean. I think my teeth have gotten whiter in that time too.</li>
            <li> I truly love the smaller brush size.  I can now clean my back teeth without the larger heads activating a gag response. My entire mouth now feels wonderfully clean after using my Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Great, got it for a step daughter who wanted one but couldn&#x27;t afford it.  She is very happy with it/me!</li>
            <li> 3.5 stars, considering its affordable pricing.  This is our second Sonicare toothbrush.  They are excellent products that truly help with gingivitis and receding gum lines. It takes a bit of time to get used to the vibrations (particularly when touching a tooth by mistake), but once you get used to using them, there is not going back to manual brushes. We got several electric toothbrushes for our son.  The Philips are the best.  We have an older model that is slightly better built and less noisy.  With the older model, the brush heads vibrate with a slightly greater amplitude.  These are minor disappointments, since this model is substantially cheaper.  If pricing was not taken in consideration, I would give 3 starts to this model and 4 starts to the older model, but considering pricing, 3.5 seems about right.  Also a bit disappointing is the fact that both models take different brush heads.  We can&#x27;t share brush heads between both Sonicare models, but got a pack of 8 replacement heads for an extremely affordable price.  They are of a quality that is fairly similar to the Philips heads, at a much more affordable price.</li>
            <li> Works well, as expected.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare was really not much good any more even though I had it for over 5 years.  Amazing.  It was still working but I ordered a newer style so the cleaning of the toothbrush was not so extensive.  This toothbrush is much lighter in weight, is more quiet, and does a great job cleaning my teeth.  The head that came with the toothbrush was the head advertised, too hard for my gums.  I ordered the soft, sensitive bristle heads.  I am more than satisfied with the Sonicare I ordered.  The packing of the Sonicare was so that I could get right into all the parts without having to get a sledge hammer to open the package.  Hopefully, I can always get the Sonicare to care for my mouth health.</li>
            <li> These turned out to be better than the one that came with the original toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Awesome had to buy another for my son</li>
            <li> I am used to using rotodent and this is somewhat bigger so it takes a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li> Cleans &amp; polishes teeth well, giving them the feel of a professional cleaning after each brushing..</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush I have ever had!</li>
            <li> Been using Sonicare for 25 years and needed to update my toothbrush... it works great.  Sonicare puts out excellent producrts.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my electric toothbrush after years of use and this was a great buy for me and is serving me well. The head on it is a more compact head than many are and is extremely important when you have a small mouth. It gets to the back teeth easily. So if you need a toothbrush with a small head this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> I like it. No problems yet.</li>
            <li> can i write the review in chinese.......?  oh,during i use it in 3 weeks,in my words,it just so so. the pilot lamp is useless.and my tooth are not cleared as clean as description</li>
            <li> I have two major complaints about this toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging base is too light.  You can&#x27;t pick it up with the base coming with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to the older larger brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the older unit which was bought many many years ago.  If it hadn&#x27;t stopped working I would still be using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry about the negative review but I hope it will help with future Sonicare development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edwin L. Minnick</li>
            <li> Not as nice as the newer numbers, 69 series.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Sonicare brush, which was great &amp; lasted for many years. This one works fine, but the base is so light that it moves around just from the stiffness of the electrical cord, which is slightly annoying &amp; makes it feel cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my old one gave an audible beep every 30 seconds during the 2 minute brushing time, so it was easy to brush top front/back &amp; bottom front/back sections of my mouth for 30 seconds each. The description online says that this unit has the 2 minute brush time too, which it does, but neglected to mention that it doesn&#x27;t beep. I just assumed it did, but it just runs straight for 2 minutes, so now I have to guess when to move to the next area. It would have saved me some aggravation if they had said that the beep feature comes on the next higher model...&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for, so if you want that feature, don&#x27;t assume as I did - read descriptions carefully &amp; buy the next level brush.</li>
            <li> My first sonic toothbrush. It takes a while to get use to it. I have developed some areas with a separation between tooth and gums and this is helping get those tough spots.</li>
            <li> This ToothBrush is in fact unique. Until I use this brand, I was thinking they are all the same and serve the same purpose. I like it in every way. I will not go back to any other brand unless Philips change the quality. The shipping was fast. Admittedly the price is little high for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> uncomfortable on lips and gums.  buzz rate is too high.</li>
            <li> Experience so far is awesome. It works.</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought this to replace a higher end Sonicare 6731 that was lost while we were traveling.  The build quality is good but the brushing action feels &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s hard to describe but it doesn&#x27;t feel as vigorous and there was a noticeable difference in how well it cleaned your teeth.  It worked, but not well enough when compared to the 6731.</li>
            <li> Too small  Should have bought a larger one with more brushes</li>
            <li> The tiny charging base lacks a mounting device so it is hard to keep the brush upright and stable.  I taped it to the counter. Bad design of charger, excellent brush.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel clean, but it is very noisy and I wonder if it is refurbished rather then brand new.</li>
            <li> great product amazing results</li>
            <li> not working correctly.  timer does not work.  the brush is working as designed.   just a pain to have to count the seconds to be brushed in my head</li>
            <li> only machine dont have notthing inside how i can use it?, i need buy thw brush now, oh my god</li>
            <li> Promptly returning. This unit is cheap, makes horrible noise and there is ZERO chance it vibrates/cleans as well as my original E-Series did. The brush head sounds like its going to rattle off and I feel like I need to actually &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; with this unit where my old one literally did all the work for you. I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works just as described and efficiently.  I do enjoy the fact that the heads can be switched between the other, more expensive bases.  I also appreciated the 14 day time frame for adjusting your teeth to the vibrations.</li>
            <li> Good！but the vibration is too strong！</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Too loud. I don&#x27;t like it. I went back to my regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> Buyer beware. What you see in the ad is not what you get.</li>
            <li> A little annoyed that we had to replace one toothbrush purchased in a two-pack.  The battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  Purchased this to replace the one that wore out early.</li>
            <li> I bought mine on sale from newegg, and I intend to return it to Sonicare.    The reason I didn&#x27;t buy an Oral-B was their reported extreme vibration and noise. This HX6211 is like a mini jack hammer with a small brush head.    This model is no where near the same as my 10 year old Sonicare Elite.    I contacted Sonicare and they are replacing the handle, but I doubt this will solve the problem.    I don&#x27;t care for it at any price.    FOLLOW UP:    Sonicare did send a replacement handle in it&#x27;s definitely the design, not the handle or brush head alone.    I contacted Sonicare again and they agreed to send me a return label for everything and refund my money.    IMHO this vibration is inherent in all the \\&quot;push the brush head on to the metal shaft\\&quot; brushes.    The older \\&quot;screw on cap with magnets suspended in air\\&quot; is more quite.    My 11 year old Sonicare elite HX7800 is still working and w a y more quite, even with new brush heads and full charge.    EDIT #2:    Sonicare DID NOT offer a return label, they refuse to do so! It is not their policy.    I have no intentions of paying my own money to return a $40 product, and I&#x27;m DONE with Sonicare.    If their crap is as noisy as the Oral B then what&#x27;s the incentive to stick with them?</li>
            <li> the vibrator is too strong</li>
            <li> The easystart feature did not work on mine, even after working with customer support from Philips to make sure I was doing it right. Whether it was in easy start mode or not, it ran at the same intensity, which was too harsh for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I compared the normal mode it to the way my roommate&#x27;s sonicare worked (she has the clean white model), and hers seems to run much more smoothly, with just the brush vibrating.  With this model, the whole handle of the brush shakes and makes my hand feel numb. It seems like just the brush should vibrate. I&#x27;m hoping that I just have a defective one, but since the easy start feature does not seem to be working on mine, I&#x27;m returning it.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to order the same model again...</li>
            <li> A great electric toothbrush and a real good brand. Perfect for keeping your teeth good and clean. Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Well packed and looks good. bought for my aunt. I am happy that she like it.</li>
            <li> Better than ordinary sonic brushes. Works fine so far. Product is longer than expected (compared to some oral-b products)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the brush or the noise it makes.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a very aggressive spin cycle, which is what was wanted. Keeping the unit on the charger ensures the cycle rate doesn&#x27;t drop as it does with battery units.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very useful for me to clean my teeth.I like it!</li>
            <li> Good, easy to use, long battery life. Although I&#x27;m unhappy because I didn&#x27;t get the extra brush head and the travel case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the quality or effectiveness of this toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve used it once and it doesn&#x27;t vibrate like my old Phillips Sonicare toothbrush and it has a louder sound like my old toothbrush had just before it quit working.  Something isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to a normal toothbrush now. This was perfect for my first electric toothbrush. Right out of the box it was fully charged and ready to go. The battery lasts very long on this. I would recommend (and I have a few times) to other people. Buy this if you are on the fence about getting an electric toothbrush and don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on one.</li>
            <li> After my dentist said he thought some electric toothbrushes were good I looked for something affordable and effective. This gets the job done. But if you are like me and have never used a Sonicare be prepared to try it for up to 2 weeks before you gets used to it. The cleaning is very intense compared to any other manual or electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought three for Christmas gifts. We love this toothbrush. The only downside was there was a limit of 3.  I really wanted to buy 7.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush, after getting use to the vibration.  It&#x27;s simple and effective.  My teeth and tongue feel so clean after brushing with this toothbrush.  I like its simplicity, just an on-off button, no fancy settings that I wouldn&#x27;t use anyway.  It would be nice to have the Quadpacer, but not worth the extra $30!</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old one that beeped at the 30 second mark. It had a better brush head and more vigorous brushing. Can&#x27;t find the brush for it. Have the base. Should have gone for the higher priced one.</li>
            <li> Good basic Sonicare brush, not thirty second indicator to allow you to change brush positions.</li>
            <li> Surprised the first time I put this in my mouth - felt like it was about to vibrate my teeth loose - an exaggeration, but it was really surprising.  Now I can&#x27;t go back to a regular toothbrush anymore. It feels like it can remove plaque, but I&#x27;ll have to wait until I visit the dentist to be sure.</li>
            <li> high tech but a little noisy</li>
            <li> I bought this a Christmas gift for my husband. He has been using it and has had no problems with the product. So I can not give my opinion as I am not using it. From what I can tell it is a good toothbrush. We will see how long the head holds up before replacement. It was a good deal as well with a $10 coupon at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son for Christmas.  His teeth and gums already look much better!</li>
            <li> Bought it after extensive gum surgery. Glad I did.</li>
            <li> My niece gave me my first Sonicare toothbrush for a Christmas present almost ten years ago.  It was simply awesome!  After using it, there was literally little to clean when I went in for my regular 6-month cleaning and check-up at the dentist&#x27;s office.  Well, my original Sonicare finally died so I was in the market to buy another.  I saw the Sonicare HX6211/30 2 Series on Amazon, and liked what I read about the item so I ordered it. When I got it and began to use it, I really enjoyed how light weight it was to use and how well it worked brushing my teeth.  It is somewhat noisier than my first Sonicare, and the detachable brush is easy to put on and replace; however, there is a very small and barely noticeable gap between the brush attachment and unit that bothers me a little because I would rather see no space that might allow water, toothpaste, etc. to enter and remain in there as a contaminant. So I have to remove frequently the brush to flush out the space from contaminants. I would suggest Sonicare re-engineer the brush attachment to eliminate the space.  Otherwise, I really like this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare was a gift for my son. He is enjoying it very much.He had already had one before and would use nothing else..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;  Shirley Scarbrough</li>
            <li> I AM PLEASED WITH MY PHILIPS SONICARE PURCHASE.  I AM USING IT AND IT HAS MET MY EXPECTATIONS</li>
            <li> Good brush, can&#x27;t say one bad thing bout it. My oral b was higher quality but this item still gets the job done! Good sale on a good item</li>
            <li> Works as described. Cleans very well.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, strong and powerful. I guess it works like it&#x27;s supposed to I&#x27;m just not a fan of the vibrating toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Save on Dental Bills!!  Exactly as pictured.  Super strong sonic power.  Wonderful price for product.  I have saved so much money and pain over the years by using a sonic toothbrush.  After reading all the reviews I chose this Philips Sonicare.  I wanted the sanitizer with it but that&#x27;s too pricey. New unused product.  Several weeks later still working great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quick to charge and fits nicely on small bathroom counter. Was pleased with the price. A better deal than larger retailer even with coupon. Will purchase again when this one wears out. Cleans great!</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping. Very pleased :)</li>
            <li> It feels like going to the dentist and getting your teeth cleaned. I recently switched from Crest prospin to Sonicare and prefer the Sonicare. The sonicare does not eliminate flossing and other good dental hygine.</li>
            <li> It is loud and havemy teech some pain, while it is accepable. I have some pizzle that i buy HX6211/30 but it is marked HX6210  on its bootom.</li>
            <li> It really is very basic.  But it is good for the extra bathroom.</li>
            <li> I picked up a 2pk of these at Costco with for $59.99 including travel cases and extra brush heads.  My hygienist told me to get the SonicCare brand because that is what all of her patients recommended over the Oral B.  I&#x27;m 41 and been a manual scrub brusher all my life.  Always considered electric toothbrushes to be kind of gimmicky.  The package was great to open, nothing to swear at or cut apart, they came charged and just recommended a 2 hour charge to top off before I started to use.  At first, I could not stand the feel of this toothbrush.  The vibration was unreal and the tickle was insane.  Once in a while the back of the brush would go against my teeth and chatter like crazy while I was trying to figure out the best way to orient it.  There isn&#x27;t great brushing instructions with this package.  I didn&#x27;t know after the first time if I could stand to use it again, but I figured I would give it a chance.  Fast Forward 7 days.  I LOVE IT.  I totally got used to the vibration and the tingly went away quickly.  My teeth feel cleaner after 7 days than they ever have after leaving the dentist.  I swear they are visibly whiter too.  I used to only brush and floss once a day, then use mouthwash before bed.  Now I can&#x27;t wait to get at least two brushings in a day with this thing.  My breath was always pretty fresh but now I even wake up without nasty breath.  The charger is really nice on this accept there is alot of extra cord that is annoying and does not fold up nicely so I don&#x27;t leave it on the counter, but the charge is still going strong after 14 uses so not a big deal to charge up once in a while.  I love the travel cases that came with my version, very nice.  And I also have the Quadpacer which is kind of helpful, it pauses every 30 seconds to tell you to move to a new part of your mouth.  I also use this in the shower, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Works even better than my previous electric tooth brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Crest/Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush for years. My third one gave out on me after less than 6 months, and I keep seeing the prices go down on these Ultrasonic toothbrushes. (I have an ultrasonic Jewelers cleaner, so I was intrigued at the thought of my teeth getting cleaned the same way)&lt;br /&gt;So, I ordered one, and it&#x27;s AWESOME! I feel like I got my teeth cleaned at the dentist! If I knew how great this was going to be, I would have done this years ago! I highly recommend buying one of these!</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting use too, but makes your teeth feel super clean</li>
            <li> Though it is a little bit noisy and use Ni-Hm battery rather than Li-ion battery, it cleans much much better than hand tooth-brushes.</li>
            <li> Best bang for the buck when purchased with a coupon.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money</li>
            <li> Bought the toothbrush in December but the brush stopped working after 5 months. Unfortunately got another one here in Dubai (local shop) for my wife. Hope that one will not fail me as well. I was hoping to get in touch with Phillips to get a replacement or organize the repair but seems it is quite hard to do it if the item is bought through amazon.  return Only available for around 2 months ( out of which 2 weeks are delivery time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall the performance was good, dentist recommended it and he thinks the performance is superior than Oral B. I was happy with delivery and with brushing process until of course it suddenly stopped working ( some noise still comes out but the brush is not properly moving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Phillips would consider replying me on my request to change it I would be thankful and recommend the brush to my friends. otherwise the overall experience would be spoiled and i dont think i would risk buying the Phillips brush again. Thanks, Faraj</li>
            <li> Nice, works as stated.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but is extremely noisy.  I did not expect it to sound so loud.  The others I have purchased were quieter.  Perhaps they were a different series.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any kind of electric toothbrush and wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it, but a friend just raved about hers. I decided to give it a try, and I am liking the results. Even though I hadn&#x27;t been using it for long, my semi-annual teeth cleaning went a lot faster, and I&#x27;m eager to see what next time will be like. Overall, my teeth FEEL so much cleaner, and since I hate to floss, the sonic care is a good substitute.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush for the money. Only problem is it&#x27;s a lot louder than the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> A good  purchase @ a fair price.</li>
            <li> It just make me feel some noisy</li>
            <li> The  voltage is 110-240v,so it is wonderful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud, but acceptable. Overall is okay. Only one brush inside so need to purchase additional brushes.</li>
            <li> This particular model of Sonicare toothbrush came in a small brown box that looked like a knock-off. In less than a month, it suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li> brush doesn&#x27;t mount cleanly with unit, thus causing noisy vibration  *update*   Hygenist suggested I contact Philips after being told the brush head shouldn&#x27;t vibrate and was not sitting correctly on the shaft from the handle. After getting a replacement for this, still having same problem. Was told today by a different Philips agent that the vibration is caused by aftermarket brush heads (even though I&#x27;ve told them both times I&#x27;ve talked to them that both the head it originally came with did the same thing). Pretty much got the &amp;#34;we recommend you use Sonicare label brush heads&amp;#34; - well if you didn&#x27;t make them so expensive I would! So I&#x27;ll send the replacement back and start looking at buying a different model - they apparently don&#x27;t want to admit an apparent design fault with this model. I like Sonicare since I need them for my gum disease condition, but apparently this is not a model to utilize further</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Perfect price!</li>
            <li> brushes are a bit flimsy... make more noise than previous models.</li>
            <li> does the job.  It&#x27;s not as refined as their nicer models.</li>
            <li> Love the tooth brush  My teeth have never been this clean with my d manu brush.  I feel it is too noisie.</li>
            <li> Gave it to for Christmas.</li>
            <li> my only problem is the way this was posted I thought I was gonna get two brushes....not</li>
            <li> This is the low end of the Philips Sonicare product line.  If you&#x27;ve only got $50 to spend, it&#x27;s still better than a manual toothbrush. But it just doesn&#x27;t have the power or the heft of the more expensive models.  Dad was right! -- you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud and the 2 minute shutoff time isn&#x27;t long enough for me to finish brushing.  That should be longer or you should be able to change it.</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because I cannot find replacement heads for it.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done but not quite as powerful as the more expensive model I owned and used before it broke.</li>
            <li> The brush head rattles enough to wake the dead. I tried swapping out brush heads to no avail.  I&#x27;ve had several others and they didn&#x27;t do this.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE QUALITY NO POWER OR PIZZAZ</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in my new Phillps Sonicare.  My previous Phillps tooth brush which I had for several years was much nicer than the new smaller one (only one tooth brush).  It is louder and smaller .</li>
            <li> This unit works great !!</li>
            <li> i loved it so much I ordered again for my teen!</li>
            <li> I have had it for about two weeks and bought it to replace my &amp;#34;healthy white&amp;#34; Sonicare which died after about 2 years. It is not as strong of a vibration as my last one or my kid&#x27;s Sonicare which I dislike. It is also really loud. Thinking about returning it.</li>
            <li> Never tried a sonicare toothbrush before. This one is &amp;#34;crazy good&amp;#34; &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; all in one. The price was a concern at first but it is worth every penny right from the first brushing. I was using the battery operated toothbrushes before this but my teeth never felt this good after being brushed.</li>
            <li> I replaced an old Sonicare toothbrush with this one and it seems to operate at a faster rate.  It does an even better job than my old one.</li>
            <li> Works Great,  And The Price Was More Than Reasonable!</li>
            <li> Compared to the other Sonicare toothbrushes I&#x27;ve had, this one is not as powerful.  It also does not have the 30second indicator.  Other than that.. it&#x27;s a toothbrush, so it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Sonicare and I would not be without it. This model is very light and work great.</li>
            <li> Only toothbrush i have used since they came out. No more to say</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as much as my last phillips sonicare. It seems to be lesser quality than the older model?&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s still good but not great.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare and it never fails to keep my teeth clean.  A great product for the money!</li>
            <li> My wife uses it but she loves it.</li>
            <li> Working great. You can take off the brush portion easily and clean out any tooth paste etc from the handle/brush connection point. Charge lasts several days. The generic replacements fit well, and are pretty inezpens</li>
            <li> Works great! My teeth feel so much cleaner as opposed to brushing with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these on July 28th for my husband and myself.  His is still working OK.  Mine died after just a few days.  Absolutely does not work, will not charge. I can&#x27;t believe there is a 2 1/2 year warranty on this and it lasted less than two weeks.  I had a 20 minute &amp;#34;live chat&amp;#34; with Phillips tonight in which I finally convinced the agent that the toothbrush was defective.  They are supposed to send me a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an experienced sonicare user - having had a high end model for about 5 years.  When it died, I ordered this basic model because I never used the bells and whistles on the more expensive model.  I am quite disappointed but I do like Sonicare toothbrushes in general - just not defective ones.</li>
            <li> Only comes with one brush.  So have to order more. Rather pay more and get three brushes at same time.  Motor seems weak no matter how often I charge. Not a good value.</li>
            <li> Got this on recommendation of my dental hygienist. My mouth never felt so clean and my lady checkup wad great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to go into too much detail because there are plenty of reviews that do that. Everything is fine about the toothbrush but it&#x27;s important to note that the head is tiny. By tiny I mean you will be brushing one tooth at a time because it&#x27;s so little. It takes a while to brush your teeth because of the tiny head but it does seem to do a good job cleaning teeth once you finally finish.</li>
            <li> I have long used Sonicare toothbrushes, and this one is the best value yet.</li>
            <li> 3rd Sonicare product; always the best; highly recommend over any other brand.</li>
            <li> This sonicare does not become a mold farm like the thicker older model. It is louder than its thicker ancestor.</li>
            <li> Awesome price, great performance. My teeth look good, but now my gums *feel* good.</li>
            <li> This is a really cheaply made toothbrush. I love Sonicare toothbrushes, and have bought Phillips brand ones for years. I have arthritis and sensitive teeth, and this toothbrush vibrates (the toothbrush, not the bristles!!) so much, it is loud and it knocks against my teeth and hurts. My wrist is sore after I use it. Also, the charger is so cheap and lightweight, the toothbrush falls out of the charger onto the floor! I am returning it, but will get another Phillips Sonicare toothbrush because I have always liked them. Just not this one!</li>
            <li> It should have come with the travel case and it did not!</li>
            <li> this is my 3 Sonicare, the batteries eventually will not hold a charge. they work very well.</li>
            <li> This little powerhouse of a toothbrush does a great job.  The head is small enough to get in those little corners of your mouth and cleans one tooth at a time, which I love!  It is so powerful it can rattle my teeth if I bump my teeth with the handle.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat.  An excellent buy for the money.  The replacement heads are pricey though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great one.The only promble is the noice</li>
            <li> The brushing head is about half the size of the Sonicare toothbrushes I have used for 15 years.  Much too small.  Perhaps just right for a three-year-old with just a few teeth.  Phillips won&#x27;t tell me the model number of replacement brushes, even though I&#x27;ve used their chat service and have called directly.  My advice: save your money.</li>
            <li> I finally found a fantastic electric toothbrush &amp; it works great! It also doesn&#x27;t accumulate water &amp; gunk inside the unit, like my old electric toothbrush! I also like the small soft bristle head, &amp; timer that stops the unit after 2 mins. No cons so far with this one!</li>
            <li> the handle vibrates a lot and is loud.  small brushing head.  I would return it if I still had the box.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare products since they first came out about 15 years ago, going thru the various generations until the current one.  I was skeptical to buy the series 2/3 because of some reviews that reported that they were not as powerful as the older models.  I decided to go ahead anyway and found this to be true….BUT…I soon realized that my model has the &amp;#34;Easy Start&amp;#34; mode that starts the power level low and gradually increases until full power (after 14 uses). This is for first time users that aren&#x27;t used to strong vibrations in their mouth.  You can skip this feature (read instructions) by leaving handle on the charger and pressing the start button for three seconds.  Unit will beep once and &amp;#34;Easy Start&amp;#34; feature is disabled and you go to full power.  Best Sonicare yet! Powerful, smaller, easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush, this is my third one.</li>
            <li> Works great but nosisy</li>
            <li> Awesome for the price</li>
            <li> I ordered this but received the Phillips Sonicare HX6212/30 in the HX6211/30 box. Discovered this after trying it and finding that it was very noisy with a high pitched sound. My husband has a similar but different year and it was much quieter, no high pitched sound. Sent it back for a correct replacement and received the same thing again which I returned. Checking the reviews I found that others had the same complaint with this model. I have gone back to my old model even though it does not hold a charge for long.</li>
            <li> Had Sonicare for many years and it&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> damage to my gums, made them very sensitive</li>
            <li> Works well, my mother states that it does the job she is looking for...keeping the plaque down and her teeth clean.  She likes using this electric toothbrush better than a regular as she feels her teeth are more clean afterwards. Not too powerful as to feel as if your mouth has been assaulted after use from the vibration.</li>
            <li> We have purchased several of the Sonicare toothbrushes during the last few years, so when the Philips Sonicare HX6211/30 2 Series Plaque Control came out and is advertised to be &amp;#34;better at removing Plaque&amp;#34;, I called Sonicare customer service to find out if it is any better at removing plaque than previous Sonicare models.  The customer service rep told me that the basic motor and the brushes are exactly the same as all the recent models.  The model numbers are changed when they add more bells and whistles to the charger or stand or cleaner or....  The new model is no better at removing plaque than previous models.</li>
            <li> Works great as expected. No complaints</li>
            <li> THIS THING IS SOOO LOUD!!! You can hear it VERY clearly from across my house, through closed doors, while completely unconscious.  My roomate can attest to that.  I cannot even properly describe in words how obnoxious this little device is.  It sounds like a power tool when you turn it on (not joking at all).  Returning immediately for the sake of the people sleeping within a mile radius of my bathroom.</li>
            <li> not good , It  always shake my teeth</li>
            <li> Terrific price (frustration free packing) and makes your teeth feel cleaner than my old spin brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good enough to me ，but 2days after i bought it， the one which take 2 brush head be the same price like this。。。i feel so sad。。。</li>
            <li> This is a great product but I am really frustrated because it is offered just by itself and also as a Special Bonus Pack (with case and extra head) which I didn&#x27;t see so had to go back and order the case.  Not sure why it had to be sold both ways when the price was the same.  Shame on me for not looking at the options more thoroughly!</li>
            <li> The engine was noisy,Even if is the entry-level products</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist, and I have been please with product. I have never used toothbrush like this, but like results.</li>
            <li> Weak action on the brush, and battery rattles at the bottom of the brush. Saw very few differences in this model vs. more expensive Sonicare on the chart before purchasing, but apparently I missed something.</li>
            <li> Cleans the teeth and gums great.  The 2 minute stop is a very good idea.  A little noisey.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It was a good price too</li>
            <li> After getting used to the &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; (which took several brushings),  thereafter, it was/is fine.!</li>
            <li> A very fine electric tooth brush for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Package was missing the toothbrush head.  It has it in the photo so assumed we would get that as well as the charging base and the toothbrush body.</li>
            <li> I bought 2, 1 would not charge after 3 month, amazon replaced it and so far so good.</li>
            <li> It is strong, so it isn&#x27;t so comfortable, but can be accept. And my tooth is very clean after use this toothbrush. That&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Have been a sonicare customer for more than 10 years. This is a good basic brush. However, it seems to be a little more noisy.</li>
            <li> It did not have some features that I expected.</li>
            <li> Bought  this as a gift for my wife. She loves it</li>
            <li> works slightly the same as their 6500 series. only difference is this has one speed setting (high). this doesn&#x27;t have the low setting. I&#x27;ve owned/used a 6500 series before and didn&#x27;t really like the low setting because I felt it was too gentle, and I have sensitive teeth. I occasionally used the low setting when brushing my lips. but ive used this one for almost two months on its high setting and have no issues, even with brushing my lips.</li>
            <li> Works great and shipped quickly.  Price was very competitive!!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this toothbrush so much.  Who would ever think a person could get excited about a toothbrush?!  I got the economy model, and it works just fine.  My teeth look and feel extremely clean after each use. I look forward to my next dental cleaning to see if there is a difference in the amount of plaque found. My only con is that the charger is small and light and I have to wiggle it around when plugged in to keep the brush upright. Not a big deal in the scheme of things.</li>
            <li> very good toothbrush, love it. i&#x27;m using it everyday and i feel it get some help on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;the noise is very small,not like the others said it very loud,it a happy order on amazon!</li>
            <li> a little noisy than expected</li>
            <li> It tickles my lips. getting used to it though. Hope it does a better job with my gums and teeth than the rotary electric that I had been using.</li>
            <li> Did not come with the colored sleeves and brush head is even bigger then my adult sized sonicare ... So far not impressed , I&#x27;m sure it operates fine</li>
            <li> great toothbrush for a great price! my teeth feel so clean :)</li>
            <li> When working at the case of a large resonant sound</li>
            <li> Put off the Sonicare for years--satisfied with Oral B Vitality.  Following a hunch and an enticing price, I gave the Sonicare 2 Series a shot.  The difference is incredible.  The Sonicare gives a sense of thorough cleansing unequaled by anything else.  It takes getting used to--maybe a week or so.  The payoff is worth the patience.</li>
            <li> It lasted for 6 months and then started making this horrible rattling noise. I&#x27;m still sticking to sonicare. I&#x27;m just going to buy a more expensive brush so that last.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is absolutely amazing!  I bought this as a gift to my partner and he is so loving it! He totally swears by this instrument! He said it is the best gift ever.</li>
            <li> Vibration strong but I like it. Cleans well</li>
            <li> Overall is good, is the toothbrush head is bad to buy</li>
            <li> I think I will soon get used to it</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband for Christmas.  he loves it.  great battery life.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush alot but my husband got his with an extra head for his toothbrush, and a traveling case. I was disappointed that I paid for the same exact item and only got the toothbrush with no case or extra head.</li>
            <li> It went broken after I bought it for only one month! the light keeps flashing no matter how long it&#x27;s been charged. it came in without boxes, the other brushes we bought from the store are good. I deeply doubt its quality, DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> Brushing effect is good, worth having</li>
            <li> It wonderful great cleaning tool</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing... you WILL see noticeable results.</li>
            <li> the  toothbrush  is  very  soft  and  clear</li>
            <li> This toothbrush hurts my teeth very much.  I would have sent it back but unfortunately I threw the box away.  I had an Oral-B and I loved it.  I&#x27;m giving this to my husband and buying another Oral-B for me.  If you have sensitive teeth or just don&#x27;t like the feeling of a drill in your mouth, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  The rechargeable stand is slim and fits in the corner so I like the ease of its use, but that&#x27;s all I like.</li>
            <li> great for the price and easy to use</li>
            <li> light don;t always come on when charging</li>
            <li> I replaced an older model, and this is better.  Lighter, and easier to hold.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Sonicare toothbrush on a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; recommendation.  It is very noisy!  Please, folks, do not base your opinion of Sonicare on this model.....I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for over 10 years and love them....that is until this model.  My teeth do not feel as clean, and it is messy, somehow causing one to have drool....if that makes sense.  Upgrade to another model!</li>
            <li> The product came in a regular box but I am still very happy with it.I tried it and it is no different from the  other Sonicare toothbrushes I&#x27;ve bought in the past.This is just a newer model.I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Great dental hygiene tool!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.. Do the exactly same job as the expensive ones..</li>
            <li> Could have had a few speeds, pretty basic</li>
            <li> clean the teeth very well</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Sonicare Flexcare which I loved but it had broken after 5 years.  I don&#x27;t need all the features of the Flexcare and the reviews indicated this was a good basic sonicare technology.  Turns out, this model uses some other vibration mechanism which seems not as strong or fast as the Flexcare.  I gave this to one of my kids and got a a Sonicare Easyclean which seems to have similar vibration to the Flexcare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: Sonicare Easyclean.</li>
            <li> Replaced an almost ten year old Sonicare toothbrush. Works well, but even after a couple months of use doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful.</li>
            <li> Its way powerful than what the teeth can handle. Barely got used. Collecting dust now. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great product. Wish the brush head was a bit larger.</li>
            <li> it is nice ,and I like it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it .</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the older version of it that I have had for several years because the older version was getting water trapped inbetween the handle and brush head and causing mold. This is not even close to the older model, it is EXTREMELY loud compared to my last one. I would not recommend it to anyone. Terrible quality and huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I WAS EXPECTING A TIMER FOR EACH QUADRANT SIMILAR TO THE ONE I HAD SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED  THE DIRE THREATS OF ELECTROCUTION WERE VERY OFF-PUTTING.</li>
            <li> Nice effective cleaning</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this toothbrush! My teeth always feel so clean. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as powerful as it is and it took me awhile to get used to it. I also love the automatic cut off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> This model is noisey, buzzy, slippey, and has a cheap plastic feel.&lt;br /&gt;Get the HX6511 instead, its a much nicer unit.</li>
            <li> The product preformed as expected</li>
            <li> I like it. My dentist recommended I get a Sonicare electric toothbrush because of beginning gum disease. So far...so good...</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, and I don&#x27;t feel the tingling too much.  What I do notice is my teeth and gums feel much cleaner, and I like the timer because I brush much longer now.</li>
            <li> GREAT &#x27;BASIC&#x27; electric toothbrush, which is really ALL that is needed for great dental hygiene! ~ My previous Sonic was the one with all the bells &amp; whistles features along with an ultra-violet brush sterilizer, all of which were rarely needed or used!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line; THERE IS NO WAY that you can ever come close to getting your teeth as clean as can be quickly done with a Philips Sonicare electric tooth brush!  ~ Personally, I would NEVER go back to using a manual toothbrush again!  ~ HIGHLY RECOMENDED!</li>
            <li> The price of these electric toothbrushes have really come down in price but the quality seems about the same.  I have a 67xx series and enjoy that one.  I got this as a backup because it was on sale.  The charger base is better designed as it&#x27;s now a solid base.  My old one has an door opening on the bottom for the battery. I think this will eventually let water in and short the system.  The body is a little more thicker but not really noticeable.  Overall, happy with this new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, works very well but little annoying</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, and functioned just as described.</li>
            <li> Good for the price--although mine is much noisier than my more expensive version I previously had.</li>
            <li> LOVE this! My teeth feels like post-dental visit every time I brush! And the price in comparison to retail is 65% off! Did my research on all SonicCare models before buying and this one does the job and had the most flexibility for brush head replacements.</li>
            <li> Really like this brush. The head last for a long time and love that it has a two minutes timer, it makes you feel kinda bad when you click the power button it turn it off.</li>
            <li> bought for grandchildren on dentist&#x27;s advice</li>
            <li> LOUD! So, so loud. I mean for the price it does a good job and I&#x27;m glad I have it because I wasn&#x27;t convinced a sonic would make that much of a difference and it really does.  But it&#x27;s so loud half of the time I can&#x27;t use it because I&#x27;m afraid it will wake up my roommate several rooms away. And it&#x27;s progressively getting more and more intense, to a ridiculous degree, and if I accidentally hit my teeth with the toothbrush head it&#x27;s like my whole head rattles. I should have but the bullet and bought the expensive version so I can actually use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This basic Sonicare model is a bit noisier than my previous HX6711/02 &amp;#34;Healthy White&amp;#34;.  After several years of service the brushes would not stay attached and I decided to try the basic much cheaper model.  It seems to work fine just a louder buzzing sound.  It is also not quite as sleek as the more expensive model.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t have a notice when two and a half minutes are up. Otherwise it is a five star.</li>
            <li> Perfect. inexpensive option to get started in sonic toothbrushes</li>
            <li> After applying Discover rebate money, it cost $20. Very good product, with replaceable head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a while now and I will say I definitely feel a difference in cleanliness on my teeth.  The only down side I have of this is the brush head is so small it&#x27;s almost to small.</li>
            <li> This is the second Sonicare brush I have had.  It works well, but is really LOUD.</li>
            <li> Not as hefty as the original SONICARE, so will have to see how well it holds up. I&#x27;ve had the original for MANY years and they&#x27;re still working; bought this to keep in a second home, as the new price is so much lower!</li>
            <li> I recommand it to my friends</li>
            <li> It vibrates a little more then my old screw on brush head model but its just as effective in cleaning so I can deal with the increased loudness due to more vibration of the brush head on the unit.  If it broke tomorrow I would buy another...</li>
            <li> Love it! Teeth look  and feel really clean!</li>
            <li> Loved my other one and used it for many years;  Expect this one to last a long time as well.  Works well.</li>
            <li> works as expected, I like the 2 minute timer</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush as it does all of the hard work!  Excited to see how the next dental cleaning goes............ I think much better than last!</li>
            <li> Sonic #3 over the years best tooth brush</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk! It is loud and rattles so much it hurts your lips if they happen to touch any part of the brush. I have used a previous sonicare that was very good, thorough, quiet, until it would no longer hold a charge. I regret this purchase as it is no where close to the previous version.</li>
            <li> All right. Brown will sseudaga&lt;br /&gt;Phillips came to think it would fit better ...</li>
            <li> I used to use oral b toothbrishes.  got a good deal and my dentist likes soniccare.  It took about a week to get used to,  different sensationn than oral b.  Just be careful not to clank your teeth.  At first did it a couple times, and not a  nice sensation, but now no issues at all.</li>
            <li> It works very nicely, but it sure is loud!  I&#x27;m told I will get used to that.....</li>
            <li> I liked my first Sonicare toothbrush, that died, but this model does not vibrate as fast or as hard, and won&#x27;t do the job.  I have owned three of these toothbrushes and I was happy with the first two.</li>
            <li> I did not like this tooth brush and found it very awkward to use.  Too much having to continually push buttons to get it do anything and I never did get it to time correctly. I returned it and ordered a more expensive one with better feature. I like the quad timer and although the instructions say you can make it time for each quadrant I never could get it to work.</li>
            <li> Eh.... it always turns off way faster than the other Sonicare I got. Not too much a fan.</li>
            <li> feels clean and gets all the way to the back of my mouth!  Used ORal B for years but i like this better!</li>
            <li> We got over five years out of the previous model. This rating represents the satisfaction of our first one and the expectation of our second one.</li>
            <li> Great item!  So glad i got it!</li>
            <li> The product is fine, I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years. The three stars is because the product photo showed a travel case which it did not come with.</li>
            <li> My higher end Sonicare died a few weeks ago.  Did not feel like spending $80 on a new one. For about half the cost it cleans my teeth just as well. Doesn&#x27;t have all the settings in the higher models but who really uses them anyway.</li>
            <li> good dental tool.  cuts down on dental cleaning time.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever bought. This is my 3rd Sonicare and I assumed they were generally similar and well functioning. That was false. I&#x27;ve always bought mine at Sam&#x27;s in a 2 pack when we thought it was time to upgrade. My old one died and I was in a pinch and just picked one off Amazon. This thing is terrible, SUPER loud and won&#x27;t charge on the base provided. Luckily, I had an old base that worked.  This thing is so loud it wakes my wife in another room with the door closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid. This is a bad product. Pay a bit more for a great product because I know they make them.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Does a wonderful job of cleaning and polishing your teeth. My gums have not been sore since starting to use the unit.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush, easy to handle, does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good vibes but buzzy when not pressed against the teeth.</li>
            <li> Vibrates a lot more than my old version. Doesn&#x27;t have the quad timer, which is REALLY convenient</li>
            <li> Probably best overall value in a Sonicare</li>
            <li> Takes practice, but worth it! Cleans my teeth much better than a brush.</li>
            <li> Very strong and hurt.  I returned this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have used the older model Sonicare brush for over 7 years and the batteries were finally getting weak.  I ordered this newer model and could not be more pleased.  The older one was difficult to clean and had many areas where germs could accumulate.  The new one is a huge improvement.  Easy to clean with no inaccessible areas.  It is lighter and easier to handle as well.</li>
            <li> On receiving the first unit, thought it was just a simple manufacturing defect. When the replacement arrived AND WAS WORSE THAN THE FIRST ONE, it became clear: This model is a dud. There are much better options in the Sonicare line.</li>
            <li> Product arrived early. Well packaged.  It works exceptionally well.  My one and only complaint is that the grip is too slick and not easy to hold.  Other than that it&#x27;s 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush.  Cleans those hard to reach spots well.  The brush massages the gums well.</li>
            <li> One speed is enough. This works great!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It gives me a much better clean then a manual one.  I have a small mouth and the head fits great.</li>
            <li> very good quality made product</li>
            <li> Toothbrush was bought for my wife, but a little brushing sound</li>
            <li> Love my sonic.....won&#x27;t be without it.  Packs well.....keeps a good charge.  I would recommend it  for anyone.</li>
            <li> seems to be working very well. much smoother/faster operation than the Oral B we had been using.</li>
            <li> Sound really cheap, unlike the Sonicare toothbrushs I&#x27;ve had in the past.  It came in a very plain package, which I agreed to, but there there were no directions either.  Just feels and sounds really cheap.</li>
            <li> If I bought again I would get e series as internal works different and better in my estimation. e series worth extra price.</li>
            <li> Good brush, my 2nd one.  I wish the base was not so flimsy.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my dead sonicare essence 5300.  The sonicare 2 series wasn&#x27;t the right choice for our family.  We have one which we share by switching heads.  the head does not go on and off as easy and the base is rather small and unstable.  If you&#x27;re trying to put the tooth brush back on it&#x27;s base in low light situations, it is very difficult.  You have to get it on the protruding base.  The 5300 brush head goes on and off really easily with a twist and the base is wider so that accidental nudges do not knock it over.  We returned this one and got another 5300.</li>
            <li> The charging base on this is a joke. The weight of the toothbrushes is hardly enough to keep it from tipping. The toothbrush itself is fine, although I haven&#x27;t been able to notice the timing feature.</li>
            <li> It will take time to get used to it. Not liking the vibrations against my teeth but will get used to it as time goes by. I do like the job it does cleaning my teeth, much better than brushing alone.</li>
            <li> The shaft felt loosely attached and produced unbearable jarring metallic sound when working. Made from cheep plastic. Is advised to avoid. I returned it back and will buy more expensive Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Excellent build quality</li>
            <li> The handle seems to vibrate much more than previous model. It also seems to be much louder due to the increased vibration. Otherwise these are only brush to use.</li>
            <li> only one function, simple, and that&#x27;s ok for me.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare before and I thought this was the same model.  It&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I had used a Sonicare toothbrush for years until it broke. Because of the high price I changed to Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really can&#x27;t compare the two since they brush the teeth differently. However I missed the Sonicare because the Oral B just doesn&#x27;t seem to get my teeth or gum line as clean. Plus my dental checkups were not as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to go back to using Sonicare and as always I did need to make a choice from all the newer models.  The HX6211 is the basic model for all the toothbrushes the rest have features that I really don&#x27;t need. I disengaged the soft start my holding the power button for a few seconds while in the charger and until I heard the one beep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tooth brush has as much power as the older models perhaps a bit more.  The one basic principle of this toothbrush is light pressure. The toothbrushes will last a lot longer and the brushing is more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel clean again along with my gums.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It does the cleaning better than by hand. I&#x27;m very pleased with the result. The only problem was that the easy start feather doesn&#x27;t turn on/off as said in the product manual.</li>
            <li> The photo of this toothbrush shows a brush, however no brush was included in the package.  Was this a mistake?  Why would someone want the base without a brush?</li>
            <li> Not the same as the lithium battery powered ones. Pay a little more and get a better sonicare, lasts longer and cleans better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you only charge when the indicator shows low batt., plus a full charge every time, this one&#x27;s NiMH battery deteriorates so quickly that brushing leaves visible stains on my teeth that even a medium bristle manual brush can remove while this one does not until you pretty much destroy the brush head. Not good! The lithium battery powered ones are better at cleaning since the battery voltage and current lasts in terms of keeping the oscillation at an acceptable level to actually clean as it should, not just vibrate and make noise... The oscillation from this one is so flawed that it causes the relatively soft bristles to &#x27;glide and hoover&#x27; over micro stains. Some fine stains even clean off better with this brush off and used as a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rethink engineering on this one Philips! Don&#x27;t just make a cheap one to reach more people, make sure it stands up to functionality first!</li>
            <li> Packing sound Without damage.&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush is bigger than imagine, instead of small brush head is suitable for brushing your teeth to reduce resonance&lt;br /&gt;This is no spare brush head, feel no variant.</li>
            <li> Excellent these are the best. The old one I just replaced I have had since 2003. They are the answer to dental hygeine.</li>
            <li> I really like this design better than the older one I had. No little spaces for funky stuff to grow. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is when I ordered this I ordered a combo pack with a travel case and extra brush head. I didn&#x27;t get the extra brush head or travel case in my order which was a little disappointing. Also, my older model came with a stand for the brush heads while this one did not.</li>
            <li> First time using an electric toothbrush, I&#x27;m not using a manual one ever again! I was hesitant to spend $50 on something so seemingly trivial as a toothbrush I could get for free from the dentist. Then I got cavities in my wisdom teeth because I wasn&#x27;t cleaning them well enough. Cavities cost more than this toothbrush. We&#x27;ll see if it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Decent price for skeptical first time buyers.&lt;br /&gt;- 2 minute timer is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;- My teeth feel sooooo clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- The description talks about an &amp;#34;easy start&amp;#34; mode, but I don&#x27;t think it works. Activating and deactivating it resulted in the exact same power output. Only took a few days to get used to it though.&lt;br /&gt;- Despite what the instruction book says, there&#x27;s no quad timer mode (I forget what it&#x27;s called) that pauses every 30 seconds. Not a deal breaker though because the 2 minute timer works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT SURE&lt;br /&gt;- I always have it plugged in so I can&#x27;t speak to the battery life.</li>
            <li> This is very bare bones but does the job, a well-priced replacement for my original sonicare toothbrush that went haywire.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush for a month. So far, I like it very much!&lt;br /&gt;Before this, I have used 2 other models of Sonicare brushes. I think this one is comparable to them in performance. The price is much more competitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with my recent purchase of this item, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality toothbrush at a great price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful appliance.  I purchased another one to give as a Christmas present.  They need to improve the charger stand.  That&#x27;s the only problem I see.  I am really impressed with how fast and vigorous it is.  I will say that the manufacturers suggested retail price is rather high.  I got a real good discount or I probably would have continued with the battery operated toothbrushes from a drugstore for about $15.00.  To give you an idea of how fast and powerful it is, it makes my hand temporarily numb when I use it.  That&#x27;s not a bad thing, just a reminder of how powerful it really is.  I would recommend it to anybody.  I saw a video of a competitors brush and I was not impressed.  One more thing, I remove my glasses when I use it.  That way they stay cleaner.</li>
            <li> Everyone should use this toothbrush. Be careful about buying one with the word &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; in the title. The Philips Sonicare is still the best. At this price, it is a bargain. You can feel the difference when you brush daily with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I got one for my boyfriend and then one for my dad. If my mom has not had another philips toothbrush I will get one for her too</li>
            <li> Really gets your teeth clean, and has an automatic shut-off feature that tells you how long to brush.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush. I&#x27;d very much recommend this to someone looking for an electric toothbrush. It&#x27;s inexpensive and the motor is the same as most of the higher priced Sonicare models, it just doesn&#x27;t have any of the frills.</li>
            <li> If you want a quite toothbrush, this is not it.  It is very loud which is obnoxious. Cleans fine.</li>
            <li> a big noise,not as well as my 7610</li>
            <li> Better than expected and great price!</li>
            <li> We changed to this brand and I am very happy with it although the handle is harder to hold because it is round while our older brush was more triangular. However, my wife prefers our older one because it vibrated differently and she prefers the shape of the brush which was more round.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love it.</li>
            <li> Very good, the trembling voice</li>
            <li> The noise is like a plane passing by！</li>
            <li> I love it! My mouth feels super clean!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my other sonicare toothbrush.  It does an excellent job and holds a charge for a long time so it travels well.  It does not come with a travelling case, but fortunately it fits just fine in the one I already had.  I like the larger handle, and I like that I can turn it off when I need to.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my teeth feel. Easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li> why there&#x27;s only one brush?</li>
            <li> I really love my Philips Sonicare.  I have issues with my gums and this does a great job without irritating my gums.  Does a much better job of cleaning etc.</li>
            <li> Love it. Waited a long time for I e</li>
            <li> Gd quality with reasonable price!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! MY TEETH CAN BE REALLY WHITE NOW!</li>
            <li> Works as good as more expensive units.</li>
            <li> Works well good price and don&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles as more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this model doesn&#x27;t indicate when 30 seconds have elapsed, and that&#x27;s a feature I wanted. It does shut off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Have purchased a number of these for myself and family members.  Works great and holds a charge for a long time.  The only problem I have with this toothbrush is the high cost of replacement heads.  My hope is that a good quality generic head becomes available or that Phillips comes down on the excessive cost.</li>
            <li> Very good piece of equipment for the price.  Would definitely purchase from Amazon again!</li>
            <li> Love the styling of this brush, makes it easy to turn while brushing the gum line.</li>
            <li> The charging base is a puny unstable affair, but the brush works great. The interval timer is very helpful in getting the right amount of brushing for each tooth.</li>
            <li> Normally the dental hygienist gives me a hard time about scrubbing my teeth too hard and tells me I should get a Sonicare.  This time she asked which sonic toothbrush had I been using!  She also spent less time scrapping my teeth.</li>
            <li> Basic model. Description was not accurate</li>
            <li> The vibration was too strong - hurt my teeth to use.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to...but it has a &amp;#34;training&amp;#34; mode that gradually increases the intensity over a couple of weeks.  (You can turn the training mode off, if you like.)  After about a week I was pretty much comfortable with it.  My daughter has had one for several months and likes it very much.  So far I&#x27;m pleased, as well.  And unbelievably quick shipping.</li>
