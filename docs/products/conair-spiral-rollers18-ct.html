    <ol>
            <li>but they are absolutely amazing!!!</li>
            <li>These work great!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for heatless curls.</li>
            <li>it is like the best thing ever happend to your hair</li>
            <li>Love them!!!</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>Worked amazing!</li>
            <li>However this product has some nice aspects and you end up with great curls.</li>
            <li>Although the turnout looks amazing there is a price to pay for these spectacular curls,</li>
            <li>amazing</li>
            <li>They are fun!!!</li>
            <li>When I first bought these I was thrilled because this product got relatively good reviews</li>
            <li>and I had some breakage, but I still love them.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, they don&#x27;t stay in well.  </li>
            <li>These are challenging to put in and take out and work better with some assistance to fully wrap the hair around the curler and fold it in.</li>
            <li>and you i love it</li>
            <li>They have perfect hold rather than the hair store flexi rods very easy to install and most importantly will curl your hair in a short period of time!</li>
            <li>After experimenting I realized these curlers do work best with dry hair.</li>
            <li>Love them, easy to pack, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Best for wet or damp hair</li>
            <li>but I think these will suit people will fine medium hair</li>
            <li>The bend and stay in place easily and seem pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>It workes realy good if you have long hair</li>
            <li>Careful, nice curl, but wire can come through the sponge easily.  </li>
            <li>I saw these fun rollers on a Country Music/Family TV series and thought they would be fun to try.</li>
            <li>I put my hair in a pony-tail, roll a couple of these into the back, and I am good to go until it&#x27;s time to get ready.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and was just looking for something that would make the curls I already have more defined.  </li>
            <li>These take a bit of practice as far as how many rollers I need and where to place them, but they do the job pretty well.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use them when you hair is a good 90% dry or it will take way too long for your hair to dry and set.</li>
            <li>The pink rollers would probably work better for shorter hair.</li>
            <li>Bought for my niece and she absolutely lovesssssss</li>
            <li>This is a great choice, for those rare times when  you have a whole day or night to sit around because it is very difficult to sleep.</li>
            <li>I am finding my nearly waist length hair looks better using all the larger green rollers.</li>
            <li>I wanted an alternate option and these seemed great since this requires no heat and works well with dry hair but that night even after wrapping my hair in a thick scarf,my head ached and I had spent the night tossing and turning.      </li>
            <li>apparently  these are the only brand that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;snap\\&quot;and are space efficient because they fold up.</li>
            <li>My hair WANTS to curl and these things manage to mess the curl up.  </li>

            <li> My hair WANTS to curl and these things manage to mess the curl up.  </li>
            <li> but if you have short hair it is so bouncy and big and if you have long hair</li>
            <li> No more perm chemicals, I will get the curls naturally with just a bit of elbow exercise!!!</li>
            <li> These rollers actually made my hair very frizzy and were hard to work with</li>
            <li> I experimented with them such as the amount of hair I rolled up, dry hair verses wet hair, short hair verses long hair and the time to keep them in your hair.</li>
            <li> The process it takes to get to the final product is filled with challenges making it a very hard to travel down this road with much satisfaction because it is a long and unappealing process.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about buying spiral curlers I would automatically try to buy the cheapest brand but others said differently about other brands</li>
            <li> Be careful when you put setting product on your hair and then roll hair up on the spiral rollers.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of practice, but these work</li>
            <li> I tried the other brands, but they broke, so lesson learned!!  </li>
            <li> The curlers tend to pull the hair down as they are very heavy.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you had thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This size works well for me because my hair is really thick</li>
            <li> Not exactly as great as we had hoped.  </li>
            <li> but if you have thin hair then I would buy the pack of twelve</li>
            <li> and I am bad  at using curlers.</li>
            <li> My daughter feels like they are painful with pulling and tugging when she uses them.</li>
            <li> I cannot fully express how much I hate them.</li>

            <li> These take a bit of practice as far as how many rollers I need and where to place them, but they do the job pretty well. The bend and stay in place easily and seem pretty sturdy. The pink rollers would probably work better for shorter hair. I am finding my nearly waist length hair looks better using all the larger green rollers. Just be sure to use them when you hair is a good 90% dry or it will take way too long for your hair to dry and set.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase these from Amazon but they are absolutely amazing!!! They have perfect hold rather than the hair store flexi rods very easy to install and most importantly will curl your hair in a short period of time! I have a Brazilian weave and this is the only thing I use to curl it!! Loveeeeee them!</li>
            <li> Got the product on time. I use these for my daughters&#x27; hair when they want to wear it out.</li>
            <li> These work great!  I use them for my hair and my granddaughter too!!  I experimented with them such as the amount of hair I rolled up, dry hair verses wet hair, short hair verses long hair and the time to keep them in your hair.</li>
            <li> These rollers actually made my hair very frizzy and were hard to work with</li>
            <li> Bought for my niece and she absolutely lovesssssss</li>
            <li> I saw these fun rollers on a Country Music/Family TV series and thought they would be fun to try. They are fun!!! Be careful when you put setting product on your hair and then roll hair up on the spiral rollers. Your hair will stick a bit to the foam and I had some breakage, but I still love them. I haven&#x27;t had to have a curly perm applied in a while. No more perm chemicals, I will get the curls naturally with just a bit of elbow exercise!!! The various sizes in the package give me a variety of &amp;#34;tightness&amp;#34; in placing them around my head. I will recommend them to friends! Diverbro</li>
            <li> Not exactly as great as we had hoped.  The curlers tend to pull the hair down as they are very heavy.  Maybe if you had thick hair.  My daughter feels like they are painful with pulling and tugging when she uses them.</li>
            <li> Worked amazing! I only used 2 in my hair and it still turned out with spiral curls, and with no damaging heat!</li>
            <li> Love them, easy to pack, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect for heatless curls.</li>
            <li> Terrific rollers for today&#x27;s curly styles!  I tried the other brands, but they broke, so lesson learned!!  I put my hair in a pony-tail, roll a couple of these into the back, and I am good to go until it&#x27;s time to get ready.</li>
            <li> Worked well enough but sleeping in them couldnt be more uncomfortable</li>
            <li> These do not give curls at all.  They make my hair kinky looking. What&#x27;s more, they don&#x27;t stay in well.  I have naturally curly hair and was just looking for something that would make the curls I already have more defined.  My hair WANTS to curl and these things manage to mess the curl up.  I cannot fully express how much I hate them.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of practice, but these work Great once you get the hang of it. Best for wet or damp hair</li>
            <li> Although the turnout looks amazing there is a price to pay for these spectacular curls,no sleep.This is a great choice, for those rare times when  you have a whole day or night to sit around because it is very difficult to sleep.These probably will just be sitting in your drawers for a while because there is not a lot of opportunity to use them. When I first bought these I was thrilled because this product got relatively good reviews and I am bad  at using curlers. I wanted an alternate option and these seemed great since this requires no heat and works well with dry hair but that night even after wrapping my hair in a thick scarf,my head ached and I had spent the night tossing and turning.      The process it takes to get to the final product is filled with challenges making it a very hard to travel down this road with much satisfaction because it is a long and unappealing process.These are challenging to put in and take out and work better with some assistance to fully wrap the hair around the curler and fold it in. These are flimsy in the middle and after being used a couple times I am scared to use them again because it feels like they will break at any moment.      However this product has some nice aspects and you end up with great curls. After experimenting I realized these curlers do work best with dry hair.These may seem like risky gamble to pay for curlers  that may not work but they are affordable compared to irons and they work well. They  need nothing to hold them in place which is convenient. If you are thinking about buying spiral curlers I would automatically try to buy the cheapest brand but others said differently about other brands apparently  these are the only brand that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;snap\\&quot;and are space efficient because they fold up. This size works well for me because my hair is really thick but if you have thin hair then I would buy the pack of twelve also offered for ten dollars.  -Ada</li>
            <li> It workes realy good if you have long hair but if you have short hair it is so bouncy and big and if you have long hair it is like the best thing ever happend to your hair and you i love it and i would recomended it to everyone</li>
            <li> Love them!!! my curls come out amazing I leave them overnight but they kill me when I sleep but I think these will suit people will fine medium hair</li>
            <li> Careful, nice curl, but wire can come through the sponge easily.  Would order again though.</li>
