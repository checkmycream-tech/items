            <li>Okay for around the house,</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>These are ok, but they leak if they aren&#x27;t standing upright.</li>
            <li>They do leak so make sure they are always upright.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for better.</li>
            <li>The roller top is plastic, but at this price point that is what you would expect.  </li>
            <li>The swirl pattern give the bottle an elegant look for not a lot of money.</li>

            <li>I want to apply labels and the texture keeps me from being able to do so.</li>
            <li>These ones take a bit more pressure to dispense oil.</li>
            <li>These are the perfect size for using essential oils.</li>
            <li>These are OK roller ball bottles but in my shipment, some leak &amp; some do not leak so you need to give them a test with water before putting in your fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Also make sure to fully press the plastic roller ball head in to the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>The packaging could use some more padding but everything arrived just in time</li>
            <li>Threw those ones away and the others worked perfectly and do the trick for my essential oils</li>
            <li>Love these roll on doTERRA oil bottles.  </li>

            <li>These bottles didn&#x27;t fit the YLEO filment  roller but its ok</li>
            <li>I filled mine with avocado oil for under my eyes, and am planning to make more for friends.</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;d like but other than that they&#x27;re perfect!</li>

            <li>The package the bottles came in, seemed to have a smell but the bottles were fine.</li>
            <li>I know most of us are intelligent enough to know how shipping a bag full of GLASS vials turned out....</li>

            <li>I am not super happy with this product.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and the glass is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>BUT my first 2 bottle tops broke!</li>
            <li>The bottles are larger than expected, but, beautifully styled and everything appears to be much better quality than I would have imagined.</li>
            <li>Only concern was I wouldn&#x27;t be able to label the, but the lids worked fine for that.</li>
            <li>These are very pretty, but the lids don&#x27;t close right.  </li>
            <li>Love the bottles, nice heavy duty glass.</li>
            <li>They have proven very sturdy, and glide over skin wonderfully smoothly.</li>
            <li>It was thrown into the box which probably had more to do with the Amazon fulfillment center more than anything.  </li>

            <li>there are more extensive lists online, but that covers many of the most popular / common ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>there are more extensive lists online, but that covers many of the most popular / common ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purchased these to mix my own essential oil scents for perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been making my own blends and perfumes with essential oils.</li>
            <li>They are very nice little bottles, and the rollers snap out and back in nicely.</li>
            <li>No mess, no worry about touching your eyes after you apply them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The other six are markedly more stubborn, and a bit more resistant to friction.</li>
            <li>Super Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>does not leak and is just the right size for my purse.</li>
            <li>My personal favorite is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BFZFUX6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_10 , but you could also use jojoba oil, olive oil, canola oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, evening primrose oil, grapeseed oil, sunflower oil...</li>
            <li>This took me thru a lot of searching (2 months in all) but with the shipping cost it was the same as the other products but the wonderful thing about it is the amount, you get 12 bottles, and I thought I was only getting 7 at the most but</li>
            <li>If this is not a problem for you then it is great for a small quantity.</li>
            <li>I found the roller balls to fit properly and work just fine.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes of creating my own little vials of perfumed oil and this seemed like a better way to apply than a spritz bottle.</li>
            <li>I like the bottles very much.</li>
            <li>and they shipped very fast.  </li>
            <li>It is a special size and doesn&#x27;t fit standard roll tops.</li>
            <li>They stay in place, the ball rolls easily, and the top screws on tightly</li>
            <li>They look pretty and work well.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I work with essential oils and give as gifts to friends, so these bottles make a lovely</li>
            <li>It sure saves the hassle of pouring essential oils all over in excess.</li>
            <li>Just exactly what I hoped they would be.</li>
            <li>I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to remove the rollerball piece to refill the bottle a second time.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted and what was described.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first because the tops are silicone.</li>
            <li>At first some of the balls don&#x27;t roll, then some fall out.  </li>
            <li>I gave this a star because the bottle is pretty</li>
            <li>The roller ball popped out of the plastic top and doesn&#x27;t pop back in.</li>
            <li>No matter what I do, I can not get them to sit properly on the top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is almost never a reason to use an essential oil at more than a 3% to 5% concentration.</li>
            <li>;D)</li>
            <li>/&gt;6-10 drops of essential oil per 10 ml &#x3D; 3-5% concentration &#x3D; safe for temporary conditions/short-term use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Nice bottles with thick glass and easy to fill.  </li>
            <li>I personally prefer the looser ones, but I can appreciate the value of the more reserved ones for certain situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I buy my own essential oils then make natural fragrances with them in these bottles</li>
            <li>These would be great for trying to dispense oil across a larger area, like in a facial cream, or over a sensitive area, like the front of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These bottles &#x3D; 10 ml &#x3D; capacity of 200 drops of oil.&lt;br /&gt;1 drop of essential oil per 10 ml &#x3D; 0.5% concentration &#x3D; safe for young children and the elderly.&lt;br /&gt;2 drops of essential oil per 10 ml &#x3D; 1% concentration &#x3D; safe for use in massage oil.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been particularly concerned by one reviewer&#x27;s complaints of roller balls that didn&#x27;t roll, so one of the first things I did was run a finger over each of the ones sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t want to go slathering Rose oil around all willy-nilly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the two types of roller balls are perfectly even in their distribution (six and six) and consistent among their respective classifications (the slow and stubborn ones are all the same speed, and the light and loose ones are all the same speed), I can&#x27;t help but think that the variety is deliberate.</li>
            <li>great little bottles for essential oils.</li>
            <li>I do still really like them</li>
            <li>and they were shipped well packaged and in a fast time frame&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The roller ball doesn&#x27;t seal very well and the contents will leak a bit after each use.</li>
            <li>I was told by a friend to buy a larger pack of these because they they were cheap and the balls don&#x27;t always roll</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have this experience as these were better than expected</li>
            <li>AS MUCH AS</li>
            <li>so much easier than the spray bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re ready to roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are not easily broken and do not leak.</li>
            <li>They work very well and don&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>I also found that I like the roll on just as much as the spray</li>
            <li>and they are much easier to travel with than a spray.  </li>
            <li>Very happen with this roller bottles.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I was very relieved to find that none were damaged or broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only 2 of the rollerball  inserts would fit in the bottles.</li>
            <li>I think it sprays too much perfume.  </li>
            <li>Putting them on a roll on helps me control how much I put on.</li>
            <li>It is not defective, and it is not the only kind of roller ball in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just a word of advice if you&#x27;re getting these for essential oil blends?</li>
            <li>The roller ball works just fine in all the bottles I have tried to far (about half) and they were easy to fill.</li>
            <li>Am sure I will find other uses for them, lotion and perfume maybe.</li>
            <li>Nice little bottles!  </li>
            <li>and sometimes i feel like it doesn&#x27;t let out as much oils as a high quality one does.</li>
            <li>Works much better than spray bottles, which seem to vaporize half of what they spray out.  </li>
            <li>These work decently</li>
            <li>is your main concern with these.</li>
            <li>I will definitely use this seller again when I need more roll-on bottles for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>so I am glad they included it; however, they only included one and it did not last through the filling of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need to put labels on them, I&#x27;d highly recommend purchasing these.</li>
            <li>Beautiful bottles, but the tops, not the roller ball part, the lids, do not fit tight on them.</li>
            <li>These are cute little bottles.</li>
            <li>The description on Amazon says NEW, and the packaging states NEW, but they reek of tacky perfume!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend putting round sticker labels on top of the lids.  </li>
            <li>In fact, if you&#x27;re intending this mixture for daily use, then you really shouldn&#x27;t use anything higher than a 2%</li>
            <li>1 large plastic eyedropper was included and that was folder in half in order to fit in the box  </li>
            <li>Less likely to get oily and just a little more tidy, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Bad thing is I missed being able to return them by one day!!!</li>
            <li>Love these little roll-ons!</li>
            <li>Filling and refilling are incredibly easy, and the cap screws on tightly with no leaking.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty and they work well enough, but you couldn&#x27;t sell them with blends or anything because they aren&#x27;t pro quality.  </li>
            <li>All of mine came separated and have all gone together perfectly so far!</li>
            <li>These are pretty big.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for to use with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>drops of essential oil per 10 ml &#x3D; 2% concentration &#x3D; safe for daily use / use in facial</li>
            <li>Out of my 12 bottles, nine caps didn&#x27;t fit correctly and would not screw down all the way.</li>
            <li>future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plain bottles that arrived do seem to work just fine.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to use instead of having the big bottle on the counter.</li>
            <li>Can be used for oils or perfume (or any liquid that you want to apply directly and sparingly)</li>
            <li>it be an herbal concoction of natural bug spray</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of these rollers.</li>
            <li>I have used 3 so far &amp; 2 leaked.</li>
            <li>I just wished I had of purchased the dark ones as essential oil are very sensitive to light.</li>
            <li>Very glad I spent a little extra for the swirled bottle.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re making perfumes, your other options include diopropylene glycol, perfumer&#x27;s alcohol from specialty stores online, or high-proof grain alcohol (such as 190-proof Everclear) from the local stores in states where it is commercially available.</li>
            <li>The only tiny issue they have is that the caps do not screw on completely straight, but that doesn&#x27;t have any affect on the product functionality.</li>
            <li>I was concerned I would break these easily, but actually, having the experience of dropping them a few times, they have all held up well to my chaotic home!</li>
            <li>, I left several full bottles on their sides for a long while and came back to no signs of leakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s already saved money (when compared to buying pre-made natural essential oil fragrances).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re making perfumes, your other options include diopropylene glycol, perfumer&#x27;s alcohol from specialty stores online, or high-proof grain alcohol (such as 190-proof Everclear) from the local stores in states where it is commercially available.il, canola oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, evening primrose oil, grapeseed oil, sunflower oil...</li>
            <li>The roller balls dispense a small amount at a time, so a single bottle holds enough for daily use for many weeks.</li>
            <li>Pretty disappointed because they look so nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are generally about 20 drops of essential oil in 1ml.</li>
            <li>I will try the others and if no more problems I will revisit this review but as of right now I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>Before the return I decided I&#x27;d try one more test before I was certain these were bad bottles, and tried a different roller-ball insert than the one I thought was leaking...</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find that not only was I paying a fraction of the price of several other places for only one and then receive several of them with out sacrificing quality.</li>

            <li> Perfect for essential oil mixes.</li>
            <li> THE TOP DOESNT WORK</li>
            <li> everything came neatly packed - safely -- roller balls all fit no problems at all!</li>
            <li> Okay for around the house,</li>
            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> These are ok, but they leak if they aren&#x27;t standing upright.</li>
            <li> They do leak so make sure they are always upright.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for better.</li>
            <li> The roller top is plastic, but at this price point that is what you would expect.  </li>
            <li> The swirl pattern give the bottle an elegant look for not a lot of money.</li>
            <li> They do need to stay upright but that&#x27;s OK with me just for ease of use.</li>
            <li> but you do have to make sure to use the rollerball.</li>
            <li> I am a DMSO user, and I also enjoy creating my own products&lt;</li>
            <li> Being able to use the role-on is a sanity savor.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using them for applying essential oils and they work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I want to apply labels and the texture keeps me from being able to do so.</li>
            <li> These ones take a bit more pressure to dispense oil.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for using essential oils.</li>
            <li> These are OK roller ball bottles but in my shipment, some leak &amp; some do not leak so you need to give them a test with water before putting in your fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Also make sure to fully press the plastic roller ball head in to the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> The packaging could use some more padding but everything arrived just in time</li>
            <li> Threw those ones away and the others worked perfectly and do the trick for my essential oils</li>
            <li> Love these roll on doTERRA oil bottles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost out of them already, making up roller bottles of my favorite oil blends.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be buying more of these!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and didn&#x27;t expect to get as many as I did for the price and the tub-sucker to put the liquid into the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love these bottle, for my oils, I an carry in my purse, for easy access.</li>
            <li> Came quick, the bottles look nice.</li>
            <li> These have been great so far!</li>
            <li> Nice bottles, very pretty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I can wash these and still use them just fine, but just thought someone should know that their&#x27;s might smell like perfume when you get them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These bottles didn&#x27;t fit the YLEO filment  roller but its ok</li>
            <li> I filled mine with avocado oil for under my eyes, and am planning to make more for friends.</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;d like but other than that they&#x27;re perfect!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t leak and go together easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put together, easy to use, and they do not leak.</li>
            <li> The roll on lid fits snugly in the bottle, but it is also easily removed if needed.  </li>
            <li> Easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li> VERY QUICK response.  </li>
            <li> They work well and dispense the contents easily if it&#x27;s oil based or alcohol based.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove roller to refill, but not so easy that it pops off unintentionally.</li>
            <li> With that said, the bottles were easy to fill and the roller was easy to install.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble and does not leak.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re actuality pretty nice roll on bottles.</li>
            <li> I did wash them before use, and the oils come out just fine with the rollerball.</li>
            <li> The package the bottles came in, seemed to have a smell but the bottles were fine.</li>
            <li> I know most of us are intelligent enough to know how shipping a bag full of GLASS vials turned out....</li>
            <li> These are great and easy to use with my essential oil creations.  </li>
            <li> a  scent.&lt;br /&gt;These little bottles are perfect for: decanting a favorite&lt;br /&gt;perfume</li>
            <li> They were not fancy swirl as described but smooth surfaces.</li>
            <li> Also, it did  not come with the free dropper.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for traveling.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;The rest of this bottle should be filled with a carrier oil.</li>

            <li> These are every bit as good as other more pricey bottles.</li>
            <li> These bottles are a good size for essential oil roll-ons.</li>
            <li> I prefer these to the spray, as it gives me more control over how much perfume I am putting on.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product.</li>
            <li> The glass is pretty and easy to fill and put together.</li>
            <li> They are very nice to look at except, the tops are not straight when they are screwed on.  </li>
            <li> The bottles were packaged well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> But they did arrive quickly.</li>

            <li> These are perfect for mixing essential oils in and making blends for various health and mood relievers.</li>
            <li> Very pretty bottles.</li>
            <li> I am not super happy with this product.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and the glass is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> BUT my first 2 bottle tops broke!</li>
            <li> The bottles are larger than expected, but, beautifully styled and everything appears to be much better quality than I would have imagined.</li>
            <li> Only concern was I wouldn&#x27;t be able to label the, but the lids worked fine for that.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty, but the lids don&#x27;t close right.  </li>
            <li> Love the bottles, nice heavy duty glass.</li>
            <li> They have proven very sturdy, and glide over skin wonderfully smoothly.</li>
            <li> It was thrown into the box which probably had more to do with the Amazon fulfillment center more than anything.  </li>
            <li> I make my own essential oil recipes from Solle Naturals.</li>
            <li> there are more extensive lists online, but that covers many of the most popular / common ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> there are more extensive lists online, but that covers many of the most popular / common ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchased these to mix my own essential oil scents for perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making my own blends and perfumes with essential oils.</li>
            <li> They are very nice little bottles, and the rollers snap out and back in nicely.</li>
            <li> No mess, no worry about touching your eyes after you apply them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other six are markedly more stubborn, and a bit more resistant to friction.</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> does not leak and is just the right size for my purse.</li>
            <li> My personal favorite is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BFZFUX6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_10 , but you could also use jojoba oil, olive oil, canola oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, evening primrose oil, grapeseed oil, sunflower oil...</li>
            <li> This took me thru a lot of searching (2 months in all) but with the shipping cost it was the same as the other products but the wonderful thing about it is the amount, you get 12 bottles, and I thought I was only getting 7 at the most but</li>
            <li> If this is not a problem for you then it is great for a small quantity.</li>
            <li> I found the roller balls to fit properly and work just fine.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes of creating my own little vials of perfumed oil and this seemed like a better way to apply than a spritz bottle.</li>
            <li> I like the bottles very much.</li>
            <li> and they shipped very fast.  </li>
            <li> It is a special size and doesn&#x27;t fit standard roll tops.</li>
            <li> They stay in place, the ball rolls easily, and the top screws on tightly</li>
            <li> They look pretty and work well.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I work with essential oils and give as gifts to friends, so these bottles make a lovely</li>
            <li> It sure saves the hassle of pouring essential oils all over in excess.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I hoped they would be.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to remove the rollerball piece to refill the bottle a second time.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and what was described.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first because the tops are silicone.</li>
            <li> At first some of the balls don&#x27;t roll, then some fall out.  </li>
            <li> I gave this a star because the bottle is pretty</li>
            <li> The roller ball popped out of the plastic top and doesn&#x27;t pop back in.</li>
            <li> No matter what I do, I can not get them to sit properly on the top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is almost never a reason to use an essential oil at more than a 3% to 5% concentration.</li>
            <li> ;D)</li>
            <li> /&gt;6-10 drops of essential oil per 10 ml &#x3D; 3-5% concentration &#x3D; safe for temporary conditions/short-term use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Nice bottles with thick glass and easy to fill.  </li>
            <li> I personally prefer the looser ones, but I can appreciate the value of the more reserved ones for certain situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I buy my own essential oils then make natural fragrances with them in these bottles</li>
            <li> These would be great for trying to dispense oil across a larger area, like in a facial cream, or over a sensitive area, like the front of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These bottles &#x3D; 10 ml &#x3D; capacity of 200 drops of oil.&lt;br /&gt;1 drop of essential oil per 10 ml &#x3D; 0.5% concentration &#x3D; safe for young children and the elderly.&lt;br /&gt;2 drops of essential oil per 10 ml &#x3D; 1% concentration &#x3D; safe for use in massage oil.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been particularly concerned by one reviewer&#x27;s complaints of roller balls that didn&#x27;t roll, so one of the first things I did was run a finger over each of the ones sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t want to go slathering Rose oil around all willy-nilly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the two types of roller balls are perfectly even in their distribution (six and six) and consistent among their respective classifications (the slow and stubborn ones are all the same speed, and the light and loose ones are all the same speed), I can&#x27;t help but think that the variety is deliberate.</li>
            <li> great little bottles for essential oils.</li>
            <li> I do still really like them</li>
            <li> and they were shipped well packaged and in a fast time frame&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The roller ball doesn&#x27;t seal very well and the contents will leak a bit after each use.</li>
            <li> I was told by a friend to buy a larger pack of these because they they were cheap and the balls don&#x27;t always roll</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this experience as these were better than expected</li>
            <li> AS MUCH AS</li>
            <li> so much easier than the spray bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re ready to roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are not easily broken and do not leak.</li>
            <li> They work very well and don&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> I also found that I like the roll on just as much as the spray</li>
            <li> and they are much easier to travel with than a spray.  </li>
            <li> Very happen with this roller bottles.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was very relieved to find that none were damaged or broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only 2 of the rollerball  inserts would fit in the bottles.</li>
            <li> I think it sprays too much perfume.  </li>
            <li> Putting them on a roll on helps me control how much I put on.</li>
            <li> It is not defective, and it is not the only kind of roller ball in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just a word of advice if you&#x27;re getting these for essential oil blends?</li>
            <li> The roller ball works just fine in all the bottles I have tried to far (about half) and they were easy to fill.</li>
            <li> Am sure I will find other uses for them, lotion and perfume maybe.</li>
            <li> Nice little bottles!  </li>
            <li> and sometimes i feel like it doesn&#x27;t let out as much oils as a high quality one does.</li>
            <li> Works much better than spray bottles, which seem to vaporize half of what they spray out.  </li>
            <li> These work decently</li>
            <li> is your main concern with these.</li>
            <li> I will definitely use this seller again when I need more roll-on bottles for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> so I am glad they included it; however, they only included one and it did not last through the filling of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need to put labels on them, I&#x27;d highly recommend purchasing these.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottles, but the tops, not the roller ball part, the lids, do not fit tight on them.</li>
            <li> These are cute little bottles.</li>
            <li> The description on Amazon says NEW, and the packaging states NEW, but they reek of tacky perfume!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend putting round sticker labels on top of the lids.  </li>
            <li> In fact, if you&#x27;re intending this mixture for daily use, then you really shouldn&#x27;t use anything higher than a 2%</li>
            <li> 1 large plastic eyedropper was included and that was folder in half in order to fit in the box  </li>
            <li> Less likely to get oily and just a little more tidy, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Bad thing is I missed being able to return them by one day!!!</li>
            <li> Love these little roll-ons!</li>
            <li> Filling and refilling are incredibly easy, and the cap screws on tightly with no leaking.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty and they work well enough, but you couldn&#x27;t sell them with blends or anything because they aren&#x27;t pro quality.  </li>
            <li> All of mine came separated and have all gone together perfectly so far!</li>
            <li> These are pretty big.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to use with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> drops of essential oil per 10 ml &#x3D; 2% concentration &#x3D; safe for daily use / use in facial</li>
            <li> Out of my 12 bottles, nine caps didn&#x27;t fit correctly and would not screw down all the way.</li>
            <li> future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plain bottles that arrived do seem to work just fine.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use instead of having the big bottle on the counter.</li>
            <li> Can be used for oils or perfume (or any liquid that you want to apply directly and sparingly)</li>
            <li> it be an herbal concoction of natural bug spray</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of these rollers.</li>
            <li> I have used 3 so far &amp; 2 leaked.</li>
            <li> I just wished I had of purchased the dark ones as essential oil are very sensitive to light.</li>
            <li> Very glad I spent a little extra for the swirled bottle.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re making perfumes, your other options include diopropylene glycol, perfumer&#x27;s alcohol from specialty stores online, or high-proof grain alcohol (such as 190-proof Everclear) from the local stores in states where it is commercially available.</li>
            <li> The only tiny issue they have is that the caps do not screw on completely straight, but that doesn&#x27;t have any affect on the product functionality.</li>
            <li> I was concerned I would break these easily, but actually, having the experience of dropping them a few times, they have all held up well to my chaotic home!</li>
            <li> , I left several full bottles on their sides for a long while and came back to no signs of leakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already saved money (when compared to buying pre-made natural essential oil fragrances).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re making perfumes, your other options include diopropylene glycol, perfumer&#x27;s alcohol from specialty stores online, or high-proof grain alcohol (such as 190-proof Everclear) from the local stores in states where it is commercially available.il, canola oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, evening primrose oil, grapeseed oil, sunflower oil...</li>
            <li> The roller balls dispense a small amount at a time, so a single bottle holds enough for daily use for many weeks.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed because they look so nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are generally about 20 drops of essential oil in 1ml.</li>
            <li> I will try the others and if no more problems I will revisit this review but as of right now I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Before the return I decided I&#x27;d try one more test before I was certain these were bad bottles, and tried a different roller-ball insert than the one I thought was leaking...</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find that not only was I paying a fraction of the price of several other places for only one and then receive several of them with out sacrificing quality.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed as I read reviews of several different roller bottles and these looked like the best in terms of no paint to fall off and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Someone posted that they would buy flat bottles in the future so they can apply labels.  </li>
            <li> The trick with not leaking, is to simply force the roll on ball as far down as possible.</li>
            <li> story short, don&#x27;t be concerned if the first roller ball you pick up seems to be slow and a bit halting.</li>
            <li> Slightly annoying as I&#x27;d hoped they would all be consistently the same - but for the price, I can&#x27;t really argue with it or expect much else!</li>
            <li> Sometimes they&#x27;ll lock up briefly and skid over skin dry before they want to get rolling again.</li>
            <li> The roll on balls are loose enough.</li>
            <li> THe only qualm is that the ball on the end, the applicator falls loose once in a while.</li>
            <li> the little ball has fallen out of two so far with use.</li>
            <li> I would say it holds at least twice as much and is refillable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they were smaller than I expected-</li>
            <li> Half way is far enough to make the bottle liquid tight and allow the lid to screw on.</li>
            <li> Bigger than i expected!</li>
            <li> My specific reason that I won&#x27;t be ordering them again is due to the texture on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my eo for a trip and have had problem with every single one of them.</li>
            <li> Even with the plastic roller ball portion not fully inserted (about halfway down, it comes to a snug stop, and I have yet to gather enough pressure to force them all the way in)</li>
            <li> so I paid extra close attention to them when I refilled but when I snapped in the roller part, it wasn&#x27;t a tight seal.</li>
            <li> (I got them for mixing essential oil blends) but are a little leaky, which is a bummer.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bothers me about these is that the products I put in them come out a little faster</li>
            <li> so there is not much loss of oil wish</li>
            <li> What a waste of my essential oils!!!!</li>
            <li> Caps don&#x27;t screw on straight, quality is not great.</li>
            <li> of them feel very loose, almost as though I should worry about them falling out.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> not sure how that is possible</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t leak other than the balls falling out.  </li>
            <li> All 12 bottles arrived in two separate baggies enclosed in a padded envelope... inside my box of other items.</li>
            <li> but this is due to my ignorance,&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> (Gave the other 6 to my daughter who also uses them for travel)</li>
            <li> I was worried about a smell, as other had mentioned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made some perfume with essential oils that require shaking everyday for a few weeks before they can be used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviewers on Amazon self-medicating with frighteningly high amounts of essential oils, because they don&#x27;t realize how dangerously concentrated these oils are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth contacting them.</li>
            <li> I just pop them back in, but it&#x27;s not ideal obviously.  </li>
            <li> Despite much testing, I was unable to dislodge any of the roller balls, even when deliberately trying to force them up from below with pencils/etc.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the hassle for me to return them.</li>
            <li> Experimenting with water in the bottle, I discovered that you don&#x27;t have to push that piece down all the way.</li>
            <li> Twelve glass bottles, twelve black caps, twelve roller balls and one 3ml dropper found their way to me just two days after I ordered them.</li>
            <li> On half of the bottles the roller has fallen off.  </li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> The roller balls on these are so tight they don&#x27;t roll.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that they folded over the  plastic dropper enclosed to fit in same box and now seems a bit broken.</li>
            <li> The roller part of it can be a little scratchy against my skin</li>
            <li> The tops do not properly fit.</li>
            <li> I plan on gifting a few to friends for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave up a few times for fear of breaking the roller.</li>
            <li> Have not had any trouble putting them together.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the roller balls not working.  </li>
            <li> will start rolling and dispensing after a few rubs.</li>
            <li> It gets trapped in the lid around the mouth of the bottle and gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> There was no free 5mls plastic dropper as promised.</li>
            <li> Out of the 12 received 2 of the caps were missing, therefore I had to contact the vendor to request them to send out the remaining portion of the order.</li>
            <li> They are plain bottles.</li>
            <li> was plain bottles, not fancy at all</li>
            <li> Plain 10 ml bottles arrived.</li>
            <li> Wasted some expensive essential oils I had in them.</li>
            <li> No broken bottles or bad smell.</li>
            <li> Then VIOLA - no more leaks.</li>
            <li> Just add your product, firmly push in the roller ball until it *snaps* and sits flush with the rim of the glass, and Voila!</li>
            <li> and I usually just have it in my purse.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s 10 wasted !</li>
            <li> never liked perfume spray.  </li>
            <li> (And no, that doesn&#x27;t mean that you should just go and blend all of your oils at a 5% concentration.</li>
            <li> No more oils where you dont want them, no spills!  </li>
            <li> They do appear with swirl as shown and are pretty, but they leak horribly even when I try and keep upright and</li>
            <li> They leak, the balls have broken off, and one bottle shattered.</li>
            <li> Without the balls they are completely useless to me.</li>
            <li> I had a rollerball applicator of expensive perfume that I lost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just disappointing that what I ordered is not what I received.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> it being in a plastic baggie since they have leaked so bad.</li>
            <li> The tops don&#x27;t look quite as sturdy as I had hoped but they aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> The roller ball doesn&#x27;t work well:(</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> , these babies handle my crap like champs</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>

            <li> I am terribly dissatisfied with this product. These bottles have no roller ball and were all thrown in a bag to be shipped. I know most of us are intelligent enough to know how shipping a bag full of GLASS vials turned out.... Rediculous.</li>
            <li> They are very nice for mixing  essential oils .</li>
            <li> nice! Bigger than i expected!</li>
            <li> I like the bottles very much. I just wished I had of purchased the dark ones as essential oil are very sensitive to light.</li>
            <li> Works great, now I can take my exp. perfumes with me, good value and well worth the price for carrying in purse</li>
            <li> I will not purchase from them again. They were not fancy swirl as described but smooth surfaces. The tops do not properly fit. Also, it did  not come with the free dropper. It was thrown into the box which probably had more to do with the Amazon fulfillment center more than anything.  Not protected at all.</li>
            <li> These bottles didnt work as well for the oils trhat I use in them because they dispense more than i thought they would. I do still really like them and they were shipped well packaged and in a fast time frame&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used but received as pictured and described</li>
            <li> Awesome. Exactly what I expected :-)</li>
            <li> I bought these to use as travel bottles of perfume, and I love them. Filling and refilling are incredibly easy, and the cap screws on tightly with no leaking. The bottle itself is beautiful and sturdy. I plan on gifting a few to friends for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 12 I received are the larger size shown in the description picture. The roller balls dispense a small amount at a time, so a single bottle holds enough for daily use for many weeks. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re actuality pretty nice roll on bottles. Sturdy and perfect size for my need. The trick with not leaking, is to simply force the roll on ball as far down as possible. The roll on balls are loose enough. I like it.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just wanted I wanted and no leaking.</li>
            <li> Love them and was delivered in 3 days</li>
            <li> These were such a great deal!</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for what I needed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with droppers as listed.</li>
            <li> These are great and easy to use with my essential oil creations.  I make my own blend and then fill the bottles and have them on the go.</li>
            <li> I love these roll on bottles for making my own blends with essential oils. The are pretty and have great rollwers in them too.</li>
            <li> Great price!  And they are so handy to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> no problems with these.  They do the job well.</li>
            <li> I am not super happy with this product. The roller balls stick and don&#x27;t roll.The lids don&#x27;t even go on all the way. You can twist them on but they don&#x27;t seal against the glass. I haven&#x27;t had any issue with leaking yet though but could see this as a potential risk. Plus, if I buy something with a twisting cap, I assume it would twist all the way on and not be too short for the glass.  I like the style but the functionality isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> Good quality, fair price &amp; decent delivery time</li>
            <li> The roller is difficult to get in and out, but it works ok when you can manage it. I gave up a few times for fear of breaking the roller. So some bottles are unused.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for traveling.  Great for putting your favorite perfume and take in you purse.  Very convenient to use instead of having the big bottle on the counter.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner, as described.</li>
            <li> These bottles didn&#x27;t fit the YLEO filment  roller but its ok</li>
            <li> These bottles work well for holding essential oil blends, look lovely, are of good quality.  Competitively priced.  Arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  I am a fan and will purchase more when needed!</li>
            <li> The bottles were packaged well and arrived quickly. All parts present. They look pretty and work well. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I only wanted three of them and gave the rest away.  They work well for what they are.  Not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and didn&#x27;t expect to get as many as I did for the price and the tub-sucker to put the liquid into the bottle.</li>
            <li> The roller ball leaked.</li>
            <li> Love the bottles, nice heavy duty glass. Caps and rollerballs fit well, no leakage. Would buy these again.</li>
            <li> Works great for essential oils!  Love the swirl.  Have not had any trouble putting them together.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Perfect size for making essential oil blend!</li>
            <li> They are perfect!  They don&#x27;t leak and go together easily.  I just ordered 24 more!  I make my own essential oil recipes from Solle Naturals.</li>
            <li> loved them, none broke and all rollerballs fit.. thanks</li>
            <li> I ordered these before and they were EXCELLENT!  This time, they came packaged completely different and the rollers WILL NOT ROLL.  I want the ones I ordered the first time that were awesome...thats why I ordered from here again.  Very very disappointed.  :(</li>
            <li> Love the bottles. Perfect for essential oil mixes.</li>
            <li> High quality and a very good feel</li>
            <li> ***UPDATE*** I&#x27;m finding minty oils like Peppermint or Wintergreen or some ingredients in a MLM \\&quot;grounding\\&quot; blend, may cause the ball to fall out. It&#x27;s like it either shrinks the ball, or widens the cap the ball fits into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought these bottles leaked. I was planning to return and got the info I needed to make the return from the seller. Before the return I decided I&#x27;d try one more test before I was certain these were bad bottles, and tried a different roller-ball insert than the one I thought was leaking... Then VIOLA - no more leaks. I rate 4 stars because of the the inconsistency in the roller-ball inserts that roll or not roll,  or leak or not leak.  I am finding that if the ball wont roll with one type of oil blend, it will using another oil blend, so it&#x27;s just a matter of determining which ones will work for which oils. Slightly annoying as I&#x27;d hoped they would all be consistently the same - but for the price, I can&#x27;t really argue with it or expect much else! Will buy again from this seller. Would recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> The roller ball doesn&#x27;t seal very well and the contents will leak a bit after each use.</li>
            <li> I received the swirl bottles as pictured but they did not come with the roller balls. Without the balls they are completely useless to me. I will be returning them.</li>
            <li> These work decently (I got them for mixing essential oil blends) but are a little leaky, which is a bummer. If they aren&#x27;t stored upright, they&#x27;ll leak all over the place.</li>
            <li> Very pretty bottles. I work with essential oils and give as gifts to friends, so these bottles make a lovely presentation.&lt;br /&gt; Disappointed that they folded over the  plastic dropper enclosed to fit in same box and now seems a bit broken. Not worth contacting them. Hold they change that for future clients.</li>
            <li> Perfect little bottles, rolls on great without leaving at all.  It sure saves the hassle of pouring essential oils all over in excess. It make application nightly very easy for my kids....they love it, says it tickles them!</li>
            <li> I was told by a friend to buy a larger pack of these because they they were cheap and the balls don&#x27;t always roll but I think she might have bought a different brand.  I didn&#x27;t have this experience as these were better than expected and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the roller balls not working.  They are perfect for making your own essential oil blends and fit perfectly into your purse or side pocket.  I love them!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my essential oil blends. According to most reviews these were a great product. They do appear with swirl as shown and are pretty, but they leak horribly even when I try and keep upright and the little ball has fallen out of two so far with use. I would never put one in my purse with out it being in a plastic baggie since they have leaked so bad. Will be trying another brand.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I hoped they would be. I have two of them in the bottom of my purse at all times; no fragrance is noticeable until I unscrew the cap. I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to remove the rollerball piece to refill the bottle a second time. Experimenting with water in the bottle, I discovered that you don&#x27;t have to push that piece down all the way. Half way is far enough to make the bottle liquid tight and allow the lid to screw on.</li>
            <li> Filled these with perfume, and they work great, don&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and what was described. These are cute little bottles. Perfect to fill and keep in your purse.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first because the tops are silicone. The silicone tops work great though. They stay in place, the ball rolls easily, and the top screws on tightly so there is not much loss of oil wish is your main concern with these. The fancy swirl is nice. I buy my own essential oils then make natural fragrances with them in these bottles and it&#x27;s already saved money (when compared to buying pre-made natural essential oil fragrances).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking - good quality. I&#x27;d like to try the smaller bottles for lip and cheek stains.  Will re-order!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t bother, they leak even when they are standing up...not sure how that is possible but they do.  There was always a ring of oil around the bottom of the bottle.  What a waste of my essential oils!!!!</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING quality for the price. Easy to put together, easy to use, and they do not leak. The only tiny issue they have is that the caps do not screw on completely straight, but that doesn&#x27;t have any affect on the product functionality. I will certainly be buying more of these!!</li>
            <li> FOR SOME REASON THE ROLLER AT THE TOP DOESNT WORK AS MUCH AS THE SMOOTH GLASS ONES</li>
            <li> They all leaked... constantly.</li>
            <li> 12 Swirl design refillable glass bottles,  each with its own removable plastic Roll-On attachment and cap. 1 large plastic eyedropper was included and that was folder in half in order to fit in the box  but it resumed its shape and functions well. Arrived on time and intact. Packed very safely and securely. Can be used for oils or perfume (or any liquid that you want to apply directly and sparingly) Would order again as needed and would recommend.&amp;#34;  Doesn&#x27;t leak. Need to snap the roll-on ball attachment snuggly into the bottle opening. You can hear a &amp;#34;click&amp;#34;. The  liquid that is put in the bottle will lubricate the ball and the roll-on ball  will start rolling and dispensing after a few rubs.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty, but the lids don&#x27;t close right.  But it works well enough for what I needed.  I wouldn&#x27;t travel with it though, it will leak.</li>
            <li> I love these bottle, for my oils, I an carry in my purse, for easy access. Nice! Great Deal! Super Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> everything came neatly packed - safely -- roller balls all fit no problems at all! will buy again!</li>
            <li> At first some of the balls don&#x27;t roll, then some fall out.  They don&#x27;t leak other than the balls falling out.  I just pop them back in, but it&#x27;s not ideal obviously.  They&#x27;re pretty and they work well enough, but you couldn&#x27;t sell them with blends or anything because they aren&#x27;t pro quality.  Some work perfectly, but there isn&#x27;t consistency across all the bottles.  Okay for around the house, but I don&#x27;t think I will order them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone posted that they would buy flat bottles in the future so they can apply labels.  I&#x27;d recommend putting round sticker labels on top of the lids.  Less likely to get oily and just a little more tidy, in my opinion.  Nice for top view storage too.</li>
            <li> All of mine came separated and have all gone together perfectly so far!</li>
            <li> I have high hopes of creating my own little vials of perfumed oil and this seemed like a better way to apply than a spritz bottle. I&#x27;ve only used one as of today, and it makes applying my [[ASIN:B009RY3SHW Body Dew Silky Body Oil w/Pheromones - 8 oz Original]] so much easier than the spray bottle it comes in. Side note: don&#x27;t have a clue if those pheromones are working but it smells divinely of Gardenia. All 12 bottles arrived in two separate baggies enclosed in a padded envelope... inside my box of other items. I appreciate the extra care in packaging since they&#x27;re glass. They&#x27;re so simple to put together. Just add your product, firmly push in the roller ball until it *snaps* and sits flush with the rim of the glass, and Voila!... you&#x27;re ready to roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, Jan. 22, 2014: I&#x27;ve now used about five more of these and each one is perfect. I&#x27;ve made some perfume with essential oils that require shaking everyday for a few weeks before they can be used and there&#x27;s NO leaking at all. Love these little roll-ons!</li>
            <li> No broken bottles or bad smell. Came in on time. Will order again!</li>
            <li> They leak, wont buy again</li>
            <li> Used these to put oils in for homemade cuticle oil.  Used for family and gave as gifts to friends.  Would buy again.  No problems.</li>
            <li> These have been great so far! I have had no problems with the roller balls. I do prime each one with a bit of coconut oil and that works great to get them rolling. Will purchase them again in the future.</li>
            <li> Love them but I don&#x27;t care for the plastic rollers. Purchased steel ones  separately.</li>
            <li> I gave this a star because the bottle is pretty BUT my first 2 bottle tops broke! The roller ball popped out of the plastic top and doesn&#x27;t pop back in. Wasted some expensive essential oils I had in them. Bad thing is I missed being able to return them by one day!!! I will try the others and if no more problems I will revisit this review but as of right now I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Nice bottles, very pretty</li>
            <li> Works great for my essential oils</li>
            <li> I bought these for my eo for a trip and have had problem with every single one of them. They leak, the balls have broken off, and one bottle shattered. I&#x27;ve lost my oils and everything plastic that the bottles were close to. My suitcases and clothes were the only beneficiaries of my oils.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price! They were wrapped well for shipping. The glass is pretty and easy to fill and put together. They do not leak either. I will reorder in the future.</li>
            <li> These are ok, but they leak if they aren&#x27;t standing upright.</li>
            <li> Used these for essential oils....worked great!</li>
            <li> They do leak so make sure they are always upright.</li>
            <li> The roller part of it can be a little scratchy against my skin and sometimes i feel like it doesn&#x27;t let out as much oils as a high quality one does. But it works!</li>
            <li> These roll ones work great for my essential oils. They are not easily broken and do not leak.</li>
            <li> These are great if they are going to sit on your counter or in a cabinet standing up, but don&#x27;t try to take them with you anywhere or you will have oil, perfume, or whatever is in them all over the place.  They don&#x27;t seal at all.  Pretty disappointed because they look so nice. Was hoping for better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with leaks like some reviewers stated.  All my bottles were in good shape and all the rollers work.  I sell essential oils and I hand these out with all of my starter kits. The roller top is plastic, but at this price point that is what you would expect.  For the money they are  awesome little bottles!</li>
            <li> Great deal for the quantity!</li>
            <li> I found the roller balls to fit properly and work just fine. The product description says that a plastic dropper was supposed to be included, however my shipment did not include one. I used mine for essential oil application.</li>
            <li> Items will be perfect for my homemade remedies.  They look nice.  The roll on lid fits snugly in the bottle, but it is also easily removed if needed.  The screw on lid also fits nicely.  The swirl pattern give the bottle an elegant look for not a lot of money.</li>
            <li> These are pretty big. Caps don&#x27;t screw on straight, quality is not great.</li>
            <li> I use them for aromatherapy oils. They do need to stay upright but that&#x27;s OK with me just for ease of use. I choose my oil combinations, mix with whatever oil I choose to use and away I go.</li>
            <li> perfect size, roller works well.  This is exactly what I was looking for to use with essential oils.  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and great price also!</li>
            <li> great little bottles for essential oils.</li>
            <li> These work well for what I wanted - to fill with oils and use as a roll-on moisturizer for my lips. The cap does not always seem to screw in perfectly but I haven&#x27;t had any problems and I usually just have it in my purse. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> The roller ball doesn&#x27;t work well:(</li>
            <li> I use these for my essential oil blends.  They work very well and don&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> These are nice bottles but you do have to make sure to use the rollerball. You cannot just put your oul blend in and use the lid. It gets trapped in the lid around the mouth of the bottle and gets everywhere. You need that rollerball to prevent that. For that purpose, though, they are great!</li>
            <li> I bought these for use with my essential oils. They work great. I did wash them before use, and the oils come out just fine with the rollerball.</li>
            <li> REASON PURCHASED:  I try to avoid chemicals at all costs and therefore, make a buncha non-chemical crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, from bug repellent to mineral oil to purse-sized deodorant, these babies handle my crap like champs and I&#x27;m sure I will be buying them again!</li>
            <li> Does what it says. THe only qualm is that the ball on the end, the applicator falls loose once in a while. If you lose that you lose function of the dispenser.</li>
            <li> We asked the seller to ship us 6 of each size. They all arrived nicely bubble wrapped.  These are great fro taking perfume on the go. Works much better than spray bottles, which seem to vaporize half of what they spray out.  And these don&#x27;t leak at all either. Very happy with them, and the swirly design is nice too.</li>
            <li> These bottles are a good size for essential oil roll-ons. They are easy to use and the glass is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> These roller ball bottles are beautiful!</li>
            <li> Great bottles!  I put my mixed essential oils in them and no issues with leaking and I carry them in my purse and use them often!</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottles, but the tops, not the roller ball part, the lids, do not fit tight on them. They sit like they are cross threaded, but they are not. No matter what I do, I can not get them to sit properly on the top.</li>
            <li> I am a DMSO user, and I also enjoy creating my own products&lt;br /&gt;whether it be an herbal concoction of natural bug spray&lt;br /&gt;or a  scent.&lt;br /&gt;These little bottles are perfect for: decanting a favorite&lt;br /&gt;perfume for a purse or pocket size roll on, for decanting&lt;br /&gt;your personal \\&quot;whatever\\&quot; formula (think:\\&quot;How can I carry&lt;br /&gt;my joint pain liniment around w/o spilling?\\&quot;) these bottles ARE&lt;br /&gt;the solution---&lt;br /&gt;they were smaller than I expected- but this is due to my ignorance,&lt;br /&gt;not to the seller advertising.(I thought I needed deodarent sized applicators - well no, I did not, these smaller ones are just dandy.) Arrived on time, seller very&lt;br /&gt;responsible and communicative.&lt;br /&gt;I am REAL Happy!</li>
            <li> I needed these when I broke the spray mechanism on my cologne bottle.  I filled 6 of these bottles and saved the cologne.  I also found that I like the roll on just as much as the spray and they are much easier to travel with than a spray.  I have yet to have one leak on me as others have noted.  Solved my problem.  (Gave the other 6 to my daughter who also uses them for travel)</li>
            <li> work great for my essential oils</li>
            <li> I love these Bottles they are great!! They do not leak... They were shipped well and quickly!! I use them for my essential oils and they are holding up great. The rollers are smooth and caps go on perfect. No defects in any way.</li>
            <li> I bought these bottles to use for anointing oil, and I thought there were only 2. To my surprise when I got the package there were 12 bottles. I gave the extra&#x27;s away to friends. They are very nice little bottles, and the rollers snap out and back in nicely. I keep it with oil in my purse and have not had any problems with leaking. The rollers dispense the oil quite nicely. They are much bigger than the roller bottles you get if you buy anointing oil in a roller bottle. I would say it holds at least twice as much and is refillable.</li>
            <li> The bottles were only 5mls instead of 10mls as advertised. There was no &amp;#34;swirl&amp;#34; as in the description. There was no free 5mls plastic dropper as promised. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Nice little bottles!  Easy to assemble.  I have been using these for essential oils.  Drop the oils into the bottles and then rub on wherever you want relief.  Works well.  Am sure I will find other uses for them, lotion and perfume maybe.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bothers me about these is that the products I put in them come out a little faster then I&#x27;d like but other than that they&#x27;re perfect!</li>
            <li> Very happen with this roller bottles.</li>
            <li> Bottles were leaky. But they did arrive quickly.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of these rollers. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use mine with my essential oils. Some of my patients need essential oils and the oils need to be applied to a sore muscle or something. Being able to use the role-on is a sanity savor.</li>
            <li> Prior to ordering, I contacted seller with a question.  VERY QUICK response.  Great customer service.  Received roll-on bottles just as described.  Good quality. I will definitely use this seller again when I need more roll-on bottles for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I use these for applying essential oils (EOs), and they work great.  The bottles are easy to assemble, they don&#x27;t leak, and rolls on great.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I was worried about a smell, as other had mentioned it. The package the bottles came in, seemed to have a smell but the bottles were fine.</li>
            <li> The bottles are larger than expected, but, beautifully styled and everything appears to be much better quality than I would have imagined.</li>
            <li> I ordered the larger size and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I&#x27;m using them for applying essential oils and they work wonderfully.  Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Out of the 12 received 2 of the caps were missing, therefore I had to contact the vendor to request them to send out the remaining portion of the order. Aside from that one issue the bottles are very elegant looking and the rollers work well.</li>
            <li> The roller balls are plastic!! Ick!</li>
            <li> Nice roll on bottles. They work well and dispense the contents easily if it&#x27;s oil based or alcohol based. They are also attractive so they make wonderful gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any leaking or problems with these perfume bottles and they have performed well. My specific reason that I won&#x27;t be ordering them again is due to the texture on the bottle. I want to apply labels and the texture keeps me from being able to do so. If you don&#x27;t need to put labels on them, I&#x27;d highly recommend purchasing these.</li>
            <li> Loved. Only concern was I wouldn&#x27;t be able to label the, but the lids worked fine for that. Shipped quickly, clean, and have been using for a while with no problems. Easy to remove roller to refill, but not so easy that it pops off unintentionally.</li>
            <li> It is a special size and doesn&#x27;t fit standard roll tops.</li>
            <li> Twelve glass bottles, twelve black caps, twelve roller balls and one 3ml dropper found their way to me just two days after I ordered them. I was very relieved to find that none were damaged or broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite hearing a lot of complaints about similar vials, I&#x27;ve found that these bottles do not leak. Even with the plastic roller ball portion not fully inserted (about halfway down, it comes to a snug stop, and I have yet to gather enough pressure to force them all the way in), I left several full bottles on their sides for a long while and came back to no signs of leakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been particularly concerned by one reviewer&#x27;s complaints of roller balls that didn&#x27;t roll, so one of the first things I did was run a finger over each of the ones sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six of them feel very loose, almost as though I should worry about them falling out. (I shouldn&#x27;t. Despite much testing, I was unable to dislodge any of the roller balls, even when deliberately trying to force them up from below with pencils/etc.) They have proven very sturdy, and glide over skin wonderfully smoothly. These would be great for trying to dispense oil across a larger area, like in a facial cream, or over a sensitive area, like the front of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other six are markedly more stubborn, and a bit more resistant to friction. These ones take a bit more pressure to dispense oil. Sometimes they&#x27;ll lock up briefly and skid over skin dry before they want to get rolling again. However, this isn&#x27;t necessarily a defect. If you&#x27;re using bottles with these to store blends containing higher concentrations of your valuable essential oils, then this is actually an incredibly practical feature. You wouldn&#x27;t want to go slathering Rose oil around all willy-nilly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the two types of roller balls are perfectly even in their distribution (six and six) and consistent among their respective classifications (the slow and stubborn ones are all the same speed, and the light and loose ones are all the same speed), I can&#x27;t help but think that the variety is deliberate. I personally prefer the looser ones, but I can appreciate the value of the more reserved ones for certain situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, don&#x27;t be concerned if the first roller ball you pick up seems to be slow and a bit halting. It is not defective, and it is not the only kind of roller ball in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just a word of advice if you&#x27;re getting these for essential oil blends? Please remember to dilute your oils properly. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviewers on Amazon self-medicating with frighteningly high amounts of essential oils, because they don&#x27;t realize how dangerously concentrated these oils are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is almost never a reason to use an essential oil at more than a 3% to 5% concentration. (And no, that doesn&#x27;t mean that you should just go and blend all of your oils at a 5% concentration. ;D) In fact, if you&#x27;re intending this mixture for daily use, then you really shouldn&#x27;t use anything higher than a 2% concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, I&#x27;ll even do out the math for you! You&#x27;re welcome to double-check all of this with your favorite search engine and calculator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are 10ml bottles.&lt;br /&gt;There are generally about 20 drops of essential oil in 1ml. So:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bottles &#x3D; 10 ml &#x3D; capacity of 200 drops of oil.&lt;br /&gt;1 drop of essential oil per 10 ml &#x3D; 0.5% concentration &#x3D; safe for young children and the elderly.&lt;br /&gt;2 drops of essential oil per 10 ml &#x3D; 1% concentration &#x3D; safe for use in massage oil.&lt;br /&gt;4 drops of essential oil per 10 ml &#x3D; 2% concentration &#x3D; safe for daily use / use in facial creams.&lt;br /&gt;6-10 drops of essential oil per 10 ml &#x3D; 3-5% concentration &#x3D; safe for temporary conditions/short-term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of this bottle should be filled with a carrier oil. My personal favorite is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BFZFUX6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_10 , but you could also use jojoba oil, olive oil, canola oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, evening primrose oil, grapeseed oil, sunflower oil... there are more extensive lists online, but that covers many of the most popular / common ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re making perfumes, your other options include diopropylene glycol, perfumer&#x27;s alcohol from specialty stores online, or high-proof grain alcohol (such as 190-proof Everclear) from the local stores in states where it is commercially available.il, canola oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, evening primrose oil, grapeseed oil, sunflower oil... there are more extensive lists online, but that covers many of the most popular / common ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re making perfumes, your other options include diopropylene glycol, perfumer&#x27;s alcohol from specialty stores online, or high-proof grain alcohol (such as 190-proof Everclear) from the local stores in states where it is commercially available.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for using essential oils. The roller has never given me any problems. I&#x27;m able to mix my oils right into the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these bottles. The roller ball works just fine in all the bottles I have tried to far (about half) and they were easy to fill.</li>
            <li> Only 2 of the rollerball  inserts would fit in the bottles. That&#x27;s 10 wasted ! I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bottles are nice, BUT they have been used! The description on Amazon says NEW, and the packaging states NEW, but they reek of tacky perfume! Mine also did not include the dropper that the description states is included. I&#x27;m sure I can wash these and still use them just fine, but just thought someone should know that their&#x27;s might smell like perfume when you get them.&lt;br /&gt;They are a nice size and lids seem to tighten well...I&#x27;ll update if they leak after I try them out. Going to wash them now...</li>
            <li> These are OK roller ball bottles but in my shipment, some leak &amp; some do not leak so you need to give them a test with water before putting in your fragrance.  Also make sure to fully press the plastic roller ball head in to the bottle.  IMO I would not trust these in my purse or luggage without sealing them in a Ziploc bag first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tested all of them yet.  I have used 3 so far &amp; 2 leaked.</li>
            <li> Love them. Beautiful, easy to use, quality products. Very glad I spent a little extra for the swirled bottle.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the picture fool you, there is only one size bottle.  With that said, the bottles were easy to fill and the roller was easy to install. One important thing I needed was the dropper so I am glad they included it; however, they only included one and it did not last through the filling of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting some additional droppers if you are transfer requires them, the one won&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the roller bottles.</li>
            <li> Came quick, the bottles look nice. The packaging could use some more padding but everything arrived just in time so I am happy.</li>
            <li> They do what you buy them for and the price is good, but I have had two bottles so far where the balls fell out when using them.  One was a gift to my sister.  Not cool.</li>
            <li> The roller balls on these are so tight they don&#x27;t roll. Worthless.</li>
            <li> Out of my 12 bottles, nine caps didn&#x27;t fit correctly and would not screw down all the way. Very disappointing</li>
            <li> had a couple leak. thought it just might be operator error so I paid extra close attention to them when I refilled but when I snapped in the roller part, it wasn&#x27;t a tight seal. Threw those ones away and the others worked perfectly and do the trick for my essential oils</li>
            <li> I ordered Fancy Swirl bottles. The sticker on the bag says Fancy Swirl bottles. They are not Fancy Swirl bottles. They are plain bottles. It&#x27;s not worth the hassle for me to return them. I will be avoiding this seller in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plain bottles that arrived do seem to work just fine. It&#x27;s just disappointing that what I ordered is not what I received.</li>
            <li> These all have varying degrees of roll-ability. They are very handy if you like to make beauty concoctions or carry oils to roll on. I filled mine with avocado oil for under my eyes, and am planning to make more for friends. They would work well for perfume oils, I haven&#x27;t tried liquid perfumes but I think it would work. These would work great for cuticle oil. I like the decorative look of the bottles. The tops don&#x27;t look quite as sturdy as I had hoped but they aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> was plain bottles, not fancy at all</li>
            <li> Love these roll on doTERRA oil bottles.  Perfect for taking in your purse or travel when applying doTerra oils.  My daughter noticed I had gotten them in the mail and helped herself to a couple as well.  They roll on smooth and work perfect.  No leaking!!  Arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> These are surprisingly sturdy! They arrived quickly and well packaged. I was concerned I would break these easily, but actually, having the experience of dropping them a few times, they have all held up well to my chaotic home! I&#x27;m almost out of them already, making up roller bottles of my favorite oil blends.</li>
            <li> Purchased these to mix my own essential oil scents for perfume. Love the bottles!! Very nice looking and also refillable.</li>
            <li> Product was as described.  Great price and they shipped very fast.  Very satisfied with this purchase.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  The perfumes stay contained.  Also saves on perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I never liked perfume spray.  I think it sprays too much perfume.  Putting them on a roll on helps me control how much I put on.</li>
            <li> This took me thru a lot of searching (2 months in all) but with the shipping cost it was the same as the other products but the wonderful thing about it is the amount, you get 12 bottles, and I thought I was only getting 7 at the most but reading this one review I ventured into buying it regardless of the shipping, I am truly SOLD, wonderful wonderful deal, and all worth it, trust me you won&#x27;t be disappointed. With the shipping you pay the same as for e prime but I think a better deal!!,</li>
            <li> Ordered this product to split my giant bottle of perfume so that I can carry with me in the purse. Works great.:)</li>
            <li> Nice bottles with thick glass and easy to fill.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for roller bottles for essentials oils (which is what I&#x27;m using them for).  Very happy!!!</li>
            <li> I had a rollerball applicator of expensive perfume that I lost. I could not find a replacement at any store. Thank goodness I found these roll on  refillable bottles on Amazon. I just filled it from my perfume bottle and can take it with me.it does not leak and is just the right size for my purse.</li>
            <li> No more oils where you dont want them, no spills!  No mess, no worry about touching your eyes after you apply them.</li>
            <li> These were great and a great price!</li>
            <li> On half of the bottles the roller has fallen off.  I am very disappointed as I read reviews of several different roller bottles and these looked like the best in terms of no paint to fall off and long lasting.  Feel like I was mislead.</li>
            <li> I liked them but didn&#x27;t love them.  They are very nice to look at except, the tops are not straight when they are screwed on.  If this is not a problem for you then it is great for a small quantity.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for mixing essential oils in and making blends for various health and mood relievers.</li>
            <li> I ordered a fancy swirl bottles in 1/3 size. Plain 10 ml bottles arrived. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Love these!  I&#x27;ve been making my own blends and perfumes with essential oils. I carry one in my bag, too!  The only thing I would change is next time I would get a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> I make my own perfumes using essential oils and these bottles are perfect for giving those perfumes as gifts and keeping them in my purse. Thanks!</li>
            <li> When looking at the picture, it looks like two different sizes of bottles. That was not the case for me. They are all same size. I didn&#x27;t mind that. The roller balls work perfectly and go in easily.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find that not only was I paying a fraction of the price of several other places for only one and then receive several of them with out sacrificing quality. These are every bit as good as other more pricey bottles.</li>
            <li> These bottles aren&#x27;t the best.  They have a cheap look and don&#x27;t work well.  You have to keep &#x27;rolling&#x27; the applicator around with some force to actually get the oils out.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> No problems using these to store my perfume. I prefer these to the spray, as it gives me more control over how much perfume I am putting on. Easy to assemble and does not leak. Attractive looking, too. A great deal!</li>
