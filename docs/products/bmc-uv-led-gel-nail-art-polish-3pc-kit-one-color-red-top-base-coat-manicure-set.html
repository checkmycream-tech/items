            <li>These work great with my LED light.  </li>
            <li>the product works great and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of iffy about this.</li>
            <li>It turned out nice.</li>
            <li>She was thrilled, said just as good as Gelish. :-)</li>
            <li>I love love this great quality</li>
            <li>The color is a very bright beautiful red.</li>
            <li>And the color, which I call &amp;#34;Jungle Red,&amp;#34; (if you are into classic movies you know where that comes from) is just beautiful!</li>
            <li>A very good price for so much product.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about the top coat is that it doesn&#x27;t have a tacky layer after curing.</li>
            <li>It lasted 3 weeks so far on my toes and the color is very bright.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>Just top coat is $10 in the store, this is like buy one get two free!</li>
            <li>I love the shine and not tomention</li>
            <li>Just received my 36 watt uv lamp today and was able to test the product and I must say it has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Sooooooo in love &amp;#60;3.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now used it on 2 separate occasions just to be sure.</li>
            <li>The top layer turened in to a glue after2-3 times using it</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t miss closing the top</li>
            <li>love the color.</li>
            <li>The red is the perfect color.</li>
            <li>The quality and wear is okay</li>
            <li>I did my nails about 3 days ago and they seem to look better and better with time.</li>
            <li>I gave them a 4 because I know there are better out there</li>
            <li>so I dont use it any more</li>
            <li>and I have gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li>I wish they have more traditional colors at this excellent price.</li>
            <li>I love this brand better than the gelish.</li>
            <li>Used this on myself and my clients I will purchase more colors.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s real pretty and have a nice shine but does not stay but a day.</li>
            <li>This worked great at not a ridiculous price.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good product from what I received but</li>
            <li>never disappointed with the outcome!</li>
            <li>It set quickly and was a nice even coat.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll use more light in the room to see better.</li>
            <li>I received this on time, in good condition and it works really well,</li>
            <li>Excellent gel, I love this red color, looks so pretty.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to wipe after the top coat it dries clean.</li>
            <li>The top coat of this kit is not so good it doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 days.</li>
            <li>Feels more like bright red with a hint of Orange.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li>My wife had me purchase this polish because the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li>If you have an LED curing light, should be faster thats why I purchased one.</li>
            <li>The red color is great and that is about it.</li>
            <li>Cheap nail polish stays on my nails longer than this.</li>
            <li>Other than that I think this is a very good product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when mine runs out!!</li>
            <li>You should buy the kit if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap n good red gel polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, if you are not used to wearing BRIGHT red on your nails, it will be a shock.</li>
            <li>I really want to buy  more of the product at these prices if it will work.</li>
            <li>and I would get about 2 full weeks of wear and tear and no problems.</li>
            <li>The red color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>There was one brand that chipped off in full nail</li>
            <li>so much I decided to buy a bunch more in all the colors I would wear.  </li>
            <li>uv light 4 min, put another red coat to make it darker, uv light 4 min, then put top coat uv light</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>I am giving the top coat 3 stars because I find it goes yellow very quickly</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are some powerful top/base coats.</li>
            <li>and I find the BMC gel polishes last nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having fun with it.</li>
            <li>This is the only line I own-</li>
            <li>Vibrant and easy to use with the uv lamp</li>
            <li>The polish pulls right off the nail.</li>
            <li>and I am using those colors right now.</li>
            <li>I wasnt sure how long to keep under the light, but I did 2 minutes for each stage and did not have any problems at all.  </li>
            <li>The base coat and the top coat work PERFECTLY with my Royal Nails UV Light (which I purchased on Amazon).</li>
            <li>, I have to say the quality is great, the color could be a red orange if you use just one coat and a deeper red with two coats.</li>
            <li>I love the red color</li>
            <li>Color is more orange than red but still pretty</li>
            <li>The polish is pretty.</li>
            <li>First time doing gel at home.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I could get base coat, top coat and color for one great price.</li>
            <li>Great product, I love the base and top coats.</li>
            <li>My first time</li>
            <li>No real instructions or guide come with this, you DO NOT want to touch the polish until after full cure of the TOP COAT.  </li>
            <li>exactly what error I could have made.  </li>
            <li>nail polish is pretty.</li>
            <li>Two thumbs up, literally, from a first time self-geller.</li>
            <li>Top coat holds well with regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this bundle, stick with their colors and a buy a different top quality base/top coat if you want your nails to last more than a day.</li>
            <li>and I will be definitely buying more products of this brand.</li>
            <li>So I did my nails and not even 5hrs after the whole gel slid right off my thumb finger...</li>
            <li>The base coat and top coat are awesome for the price.</li>
            <li>the base and top coats are awesome!</li>
            <li>However, this top coat and base coat work GREAT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these top and bottom coat with a&lt;br /&gt;UV light for a few months now with no problems.</li>
            <li>I have used this set with brands including Gellish, OPI, Sensational, Sally Hanson, Gelaze, BMC and a few others.</li>
            <li>awesome gel nail top and base</li>
            <li>I have had a positive experience with this product</li>
            <li>I have never tried other more expensive brands, but I don&#x27;t think I need to since these work great!</li>
            <li>They held up really well too.</li>
            <li>Very think solution, this may be the reason it peels off after it chips.</li>
            <li>My nails grow fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the bundle</li>
            <li>It was a bit too much for me, but I like the color</li>
            <li>and it dries really fast.</li>
            <li>You get a base coat top coat and a nice bright red.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t know where to start when it came to gel polishes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving 5 starts because it is such a nice color red</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad color, actually quite pretty</li>
            <li>Its more orange in real life so color is a bit misleading other than that</li>
            <li>a piece of cotton in alcohol and clean all nails after last curing</li>
            <li>Works well with led light Just make sure to do thin layers</li>
            <li>Bold shiny red..</li>
            <li>Decent delivery time.  </li>
            <li>Base and Top coat come in very handy.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply, colors are shiny and bold the only down fall,they chip within a week.</li>
            <li>The color last 2-3 weeks if done right.</li>
            <li>Peels right off the instant it dries.</li>
            <li>but I think if I limit the use to every 2 weeks I will be ok or place a uv top coat on top of a regular polish color and base</li>
            <li>Does not cure under UV LED light like my other gels do.</li>
            <li>the reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because the only color option available is the red.</li>
            <li>She says this is a good deal for a UV Gel base &amp; top</li>
            <li>I needed a good gel base and top coat for my gel nails.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does make my nails shiny  but does not last as long as it claims</li>
            <li>The red is gorg and the top coat is not sticky like other gels.</li>
            <li>My manicure lasted for two weeks, and the daughter used this base and top coal with sensational over her acrylics.</li>
            <li>but I find myself using mainly just the base and top coats because I don&#x27;t always feel like  bright red.</li>
            <li>Its clear</li>
            <li>It cures soft.</li>
            <li>so far so good)&lt;br /&gt;Cure</li>
            <li>As a professional, I would recommend these.</li>
            <li>Color lasted at least 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>I really like it the only</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how well this works for the price.  </li>
            <li>and the gel started hardening even though it is kept in a cool dark place.</li>
            <li>Hope the second round goes better.  </li>
            <li>She has since purchased this set again just for the base &amp; top, but she was pleasantly surprised that she liked the polish also.</li>
            <li>Top and base coats are a joke, but the color is nice.</li>
            <li>The base and top are pretty strong they work well</li>
            <li>We actually only used the base and top coat with some sensational polish that we bought on clearance at Walmart.</li>
            <li>Last a long time will buy other colors,dries fast with the UV light, my friend and family like them for now.</li>
            <li>It this is an okay product... doesn&#x27;t last as long as other gel nail polish.</li>
            <li>This product was a personal purchase at the normal retail price.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it will ever cure at all no latter how much light it gets.</li>
            <li>I love the base coat and top coat, however I&#x27;m not a fan of the red polish.  </li>
            <li>and once it is put under the led light and dries, it is so thick you can peel it off like the kid nail polishes that are peeled off.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not runny like other gels, so it cures very well.</li>
            <li>My nails still look like their wet and the red is so vibrant!</li>
            <li>They do not dry under my led lamp.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, although the substance is a little thick.</li>
            <li>using, make sure to:&lt;br /&gt;Remove blue plastic cover from tray&lt;br /&gt;Apply THIN layers of nail polish (I have only tried BMC brand and</li>
            <li>It works as well as competitors and half the price for twice as much product.</li>
            <li>These polishes are not nearly thick enough to stay on your nails when wet.</li>
            <li>Their products are all great and so much less expensive than other similar products.</li>

            <li> This worked great at not a ridiculous price.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good product from what I received but</li>
            <li> never disappointed with the outcome!</li>
            <li> It set quickly and was a nice even coat.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll use more light in the room to see better.</li>
            <li> I received this on time, in good condition and it works really well,</li>
            <li> Excellent gel, I love this red color, looks so pretty.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to wipe after the top coat it dries clean.</li>
            <li> The top coat of this kit is not so good it doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 days.</li>
            <li> Feels more like bright red with a hint of Orange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li> My wife had me purchase this polish because the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li> If you have an LED curing light, should be faster thats why I purchased one.</li>
            <li> The red color is great and that is about it.</li>
            <li> Cheap nail polish stays on my nails longer than this.</li>
            <li> Other than that I think this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when mine runs out!!</li>
            <li> You should buy the kit if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap n good red gel polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if you are not used to wearing BRIGHT red on your nails, it will be a shock.</li>
            <li> I really want to buy  more of the product at these prices if it will work.</li>
            <li> and I would get about 2 full weeks of wear and tear and no problems.</li>
            <li> The red color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> There was one brand that chipped off in full nail</li>
            <li> so much I decided to buy a bunch more in all the colors I would wear.  </li>
            <li> uv light 4 min, put another red coat to make it darker, uv light 4 min, then put top coat uv light</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I am giving the top coat 3 stars because I find it goes yellow very quickly</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are some powerful top/base coats.</li>
            <li> and I find the BMC gel polishes last nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having fun with it.</li>
            <li> This is the only line I own-</li>
            <li> Vibrant and easy to use with the uv lamp</li>
            <li> The polish pulls right off the nail.</li>
            <li> and I am using those colors right now.</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure how long to keep under the light, but I did 2 minutes for each stage and did not have any problems at all.  </li>
            <li> The base coat and the top coat work PERFECTLY with my Royal Nails UV Light (which I purchased on Amazon).</li>
            <li> , I have to say the quality is great, the color could be a red orange if you use just one coat and a deeper red with two coats.</li>
            <li> I love the red color</li>
            <li> Color is more orange than red but still pretty</li>
            <li> The polish is pretty.</li>
            <li> First time doing gel at home.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I could get base coat, top coat and color for one great price.</li>
            <li> Great product, I love the base and top coats.</li>
            <li> My first time</li>
            <li> No real instructions or guide come with this, you DO NOT want to touch the polish until after full cure of the TOP COAT.  </li>
            <li> exactly what error I could have made.  </li>
            <li> nail polish is pretty.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs up, literally, from a first time self-geller.</li>
            <li> Top coat holds well with regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this bundle, stick with their colors and a buy a different top quality base/top coat if you want your nails to last more than a day.</li>
            <li> and I will be definitely buying more products of this brand.</li>
            <li> So I did my nails and not even 5hrs after the whole gel slid right off my thumb finger...</li>
            <li> The base coat and top coat are awesome for the price.</li>
            <li> the base and top coats are awesome!</li>
            <li> However, this top coat and base coat work GREAT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these top and bottom coat with a&lt;br /&gt;UV light for a few months now with no problems.</li>
            <li> I have used this set with brands including Gellish, OPI, Sensational, Sally Hanson, Gelaze, BMC and a few others.</li>
            <li> awesome gel nail top and base</li>
            <li> I have had a positive experience with this product</li>
            <li> I have never tried other more expensive brands, but I don&#x27;t think I need to since these work great!</li>
            <li> They held up really well too.</li>
            <li> Very think solution, this may be the reason it peels off after it chips.</li>
            <li> My nails grow fast.</li>
            <li> I really like the bundle</li>
            <li> It was a bit too much for me, but I like the color</li>
            <li> and it dries really fast.</li>
            <li> You get a base coat top coat and a nice bright red.</li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t know where to start when it came to gel polishes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 5 starts because it is such a nice color red</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad color, actually quite pretty</li>
            <li> Its more orange in real life so color is a bit misleading other than that</li>
            <li> a piece of cotton in alcohol and clean all nails after last curing</li>
            <li> Works well with led light Just make sure to do thin layers</li>
            <li> Bold shiny red..</li>
            <li> Decent delivery time.  </li>
            <li> Base and Top coat come in very handy.</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply, colors are shiny and bold the only down fall,they chip within a week.</li>
            <li> The color last 2-3 weeks if done right.</li>
            <li> Peels right off the instant it dries.</li>
            <li> but I think if I limit the use to every 2 weeks I will be ok or place a uv top coat on top of a regular polish color and base</li>
            <li> Does not cure under UV LED light like my other gels do.</li>
            <li> the reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because the only color option available is the red.</li>
            <li> She says this is a good deal for a UV Gel base &amp; top</li>
            <li> I needed a good gel base and top coat for my gel nails.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does make my nails shiny  but does not last as long as it claims</li>
            <li> The red is gorg and the top coat is not sticky like other gels.</li>
            <li> My manicure lasted for two weeks, and the daughter used this base and top coal with sensational over her acrylics.</li>
            <li> but I find myself using mainly just the base and top coats because I don&#x27;t always feel like  bright red.</li>
            <li> Its clear</li>
            <li> It cures soft.</li>
            <li> so far so good)&lt;br /&gt;Cure</li>
            <li> As a professional, I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> Color lasted at least 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> I really like it the only</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how well this works for the price.  </li>
            <li> and the gel started hardening even though it is kept in a cool dark place.</li>
            <li> Hope the second round goes better.  </li>
            <li> She has since purchased this set again just for the base &amp; top, but she was pleasantly surprised that she liked the polish also.</li>
            <li> Top and base coats are a joke, but the color is nice.</li>
            <li> The base and top are pretty strong they work well</li>
            <li> We actually only used the base and top coat with some sensational polish that we bought on clearance at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Last a long time will buy other colors,dries fast with the UV light, my friend and family like them for now.</li>
            <li> It this is an okay product... doesn&#x27;t last as long as other gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> This product was a personal purchase at the normal retail price.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will ever cure at all no latter how much light it gets.</li>
            <li> I love the base coat and top coat, however I&#x27;m not a fan of the red polish.  </li>
            <li> and once it is put under the led light and dries, it is so thick you can peel it off like the kid nail polishes that are peeled off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not runny like other gels, so it cures very well.</li>
            <li> My nails still look like their wet and the red is so vibrant!</li>
            <li> They do not dry under my led lamp.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, although the substance is a little thick.</li>
            <li> using, make sure to:&lt;br /&gt;Remove blue plastic cover from tray&lt;br /&gt;Apply THIN layers of nail polish (I have only tried BMC brand and</li>
            <li> It works as well as competitors and half the price for twice as much product.</li>
            <li> These polishes are not nearly thick enough to stay on your nails when wet.</li>
            <li> Their products are all great and so much less expensive than other similar products.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as Sensationail product.</li>
            <li> I bought this set because the price was much lower than other base and top coat kits, plus they throw in a color!</li>
            <li> It started to peel up a little at the new growth of my nail after a week.</li>
            <li> Same quality or maybe better than other expensive brands.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last very long on the nails though as the box stated up to 2 weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually I didn&#x27;t want top n base coat, but they work very well too.</li>
            <li> The next time I will be very careful and try to be neater and apply only to the nail.</li>
            <li> I usually need a new set within those 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Wish the kit came with other color options than red.  </li>
            <li> I am reviewing it solely because I want to share my experience with other potential customers.</li>
            <li> but thats due to the low wattage lamp i use.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I do not like is even though I only apply VERY THIN coats of the color and top coats, it still manages to be thick at the cuticle.</li>
            <li> It took two minutes for each coat to dry.</li>
            <li> The base is really good, I&#x27;m using it with other Polishes without any issue.</li>
            <li> it is still slightly tacky after wiping with alcohol and the shine does not last.</li>
            <li> I costs a lot less than what you pay at the local stores here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This too, only hold for a day and actually less than that.</li>
            <li> They had the wet shiny look.</li>
            <li> I expected it to harden like salon polish, it does not and after about 3 days it starts to peel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent money on this.</li>
            <li> for $28 plus a $14 BMC starter kit (base, top and red shellac)</li>
            <li> I do like using the top and base coat that came in the box with the actual color.</li>
            <li> I mean, it looked like a professional had done it.</li>
            <li> Some will tell you to get the &amp;#34;Starter Kit,&amp;#34; which I almost did, but decided on this instead because it was less money, and it had regular size polish, base, &amp; top coat.</li>
            <li> Once I finally got the excess cleaned up and dried they lasted less than a week before peeling off.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the positive reviewers are using to keep it on, but it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li> But other than that I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Other than that, Can&#x27;t wait to do in another color.</li>
            <li> but the other colors are graet</li>
            <li> Not better than what I have been using and not the same.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews</li>
            <li> I put base coat used uv light for 5 min, then put one red coat on,</li>
            <li> This top and base coat peels off when in the shower or doing dishes and I am very careful not to get this on my skin.</li>
            <li> the red polish is EXTREMELY thick to the point where i cant use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say a step down.</li>
            <li> The top coat was dried out when I got it and the base had been leaking in the box and now the base doesn&#x27;t work very well, it almost pulls back while its drying so it leaves blank spots on my nails and thus makes the color appear lumpy if I don&#x27;t catch it.</li>
            <li> My mother - in -law used Fingerpaints and gelish brand on my nails previously</li>
            <li> Less than 2 days Ship thank you</li>
            <li> brand because they were literally half the price</li>
            <li> so I was a little nervous how it would turn out.</li>
            <li> but I guess that what I get for trying to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> and I thought I could save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my nails salon-gelled a few times and this kit has hit a home run as well.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Reading other people reviews I can only assume they doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> i have used gel nail polish of other brands and this one seems to thick</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the polish, or</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is the lamp or the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure how else to explain it</li>
            <li> I will say like any gel is hard to remove even with soaking them</li>
            <li> This brand sort of sucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick consistency</li>
            <li> Well I not sure if it me or the product !</li>
            <li> Polish runs off the side onto skin before it can dry making an ugly mess.</li>
            <li> Base coat did not dry.  </li>
            <li> but i was not happy with the product</li>
            <li> but thing is the base it didn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> my base coat bottle arrived COMPLETELY empty.  </li>
            <li> did I do it wrong??</li>
            <li> I think I may have put the base coat on my skin surrounding the nail and caused that, not sure.</li>
            <li> My husband got me their color changing gels and I&#x27;m absolutely crazy about them too.</li>
            <li> Does well on artificial nails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the price - this stuff works as well as the pricey bands.</li>
            <li> False advertising!!</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> it looks bad...  </li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been disappointed yet and will continue to shop with them.</li>
            <li> All 3 bottles leaked in the box as they arrived. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the base coat 4 stars, it does the job.</li>
            <li> so I blame the polish not the base.</li>
            <li> Bad product!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as I did my nails yesterday and after washing some dishes 5 nails already started peeling.</li>
            <li> Another HORRIBLE nail product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Well I not sure if it me or the product ! i have attempted this gel polish three times and I&#x27;m not getting good results. The polish pulls right off the nail. I love the red color it&#x27;s real pretty and have a nice shine but does not stay but a day. Help!!  I really want to buy  more of the product at these prices if it will work.</li>
            <li> This polish stayed on without chipping for two months. It set quickly and was a nice even coat. Excellent deal for what you get.</li>
            <li> Bad. Does not cure under UV LED light like my other gels do. Not sure if it will ever cure at all no latter how much light it gets.</li>
            <li> This is a great gel polish kit!  You need a nail dryer for maximum effect!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> This top and base coat peels off when in the shower or doing dishes and I am very careful not to get this on my skin. My mother - in -law used Fingerpaints and gelish brand on my nails previously and I would get about 2 full weeks of wear and tear and no problems. Very disappointed as I did my nails yesterday and after washing some dishes 5 nails already started peeling.</li>
            <li> The top coat of this kit is not so good it doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 days. The base is really good, I&#x27;m using it with other Polishes without any issue. The red color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> So I did my nails and not even 5hrs after the whole gel slid right off my thumb finger... 2 hours after that all the polish on both hands came off like butter! So I thought could it be my nails chemical makeup (nails too oily or not prepped hood enought) did I do it wrong?? So them I did my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;.. nope wasn&#x27;t me; same issue! Bad product!</li>
            <li> It this is an okay product... doesn&#x27;t last as long as other gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> This brand sort of sucks. It cures soft. It never felt done. Disappointed but I guess that what I get for trying to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Good price and quality.</li>
            <li> My wife had me purchase this polish because the price was so cheap. She has since purchased this set again just for the base &amp; top, but she was pleasantly surprised that she liked the polish also. She says this is a good deal for a UV Gel base &amp; top</li>
            <li> My nails looked amazing! They had the wet shiny look. They held up really well too. Just top coat is $10 in the store, this is like buy one get two free!</li>
            <li> Color is more orange than red but still pretty</li>
            <li> Loves it and uses often with all different types of gel colors. Base and Top coat come in very handy. I love the shine and not tomention all the wonderful comments from everyone!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m literally a hand model.</li>
            <li> Not work nor dries at all</li>
            <li> polishes seem great! however, does anyone know what the specific curing times are? i have a 36watt uv lamp and the shellac does not seem to cure properly. it is still slightly tacky after wiping with alcohol and the shine does not last. i cant seem to figure out why this is occuring</li>
            <li> The base coat and top coat are awesome for the price. Just not a fan of the red color that comes with if. Feels more like bright red with a hint of Orange. Me no like.</li>
            <li> Just received my 36 watt uv lamp today and was able to test the product and I must say it has exceeded my expectations. I will update this review after two weeks to review the wearing life of the product. My nails still look like their wet and the red is so vibrant! Sooooooo in love &amp;#60;3.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!!! for $28 plus a $14 BMC starter kit (base, top and red shellac) you can have numerous salon quality manicures for the cost of ONE visit! Absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using, make sure to:&lt;br /&gt;Remove blue plastic cover from tray&lt;br /&gt;Apply THIN layers of nail polish (I have only tried BMC brand and so far so good)&lt;br /&gt;Cure after every layer for the entire 120 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Damp a piece of cotton in alcohol and clean all nails after last curing</li>
            <li> The polish is pretty. I do like using the top and base coat that came in the box with the actual color. The only thing that I do not like is even though I only apply VERY THIN coats of the color and top coats, it still manages to be thick at the cuticle. Other than that I think this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this set because the price was much lower than other base and top coat kits, plus they throw in a color! I have never tried other more expensive brands, but I don&#x27;t think I need to since these work great!</li>
            <li> the base and top coats are awesome! the red polish is EXTREMELY thick to the point where i cant use it.</li>
            <li> Reading other people reviews I can only assume they doing it wrong. I put base coat used uv light for 5 min, then put one red coat on, uv light 4 min, put another red coat to make it darker, uv light 4 min, then put top coat uv light 5 min.  If you have an LED curing light, should be faster thats why I purchased one. Besides that, looks great, salon style. First time doing gel at home.</li>
            <li> I love the base coat and top coat, however I&#x27;m not a fan of the red polish.  But other than that I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> The red color is great and that is about it. The top coat was dried out when I got it and the base had been leaking in the box and now the base doesn&#x27;t work very well, it almost pulls back while its drying so it leaves blank spots on my nails and thus makes the color appear lumpy if I don&#x27;t catch it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give one star was because I knew I was taking a chance when I picked based on the price.</li>
            <li> Love it price was the best purchase but the product is great would buy this again</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I could get base coat, top coat and color for one great price. I haven&#x27;t used the gel polishes before and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot before I knew if I would like them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of iffy about this. There are some pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;1. Good quality (looks like when I&#x27;ve gotten my nails done at the salon)&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Arrived late&lt;br /&gt;2. The &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; is actually orange. On the bottle, it&#x27;s a red dot as pictured online, but after applying it, it is definitely orange. I&#x27;ve now used it on 2 separate occasions just to be sure.</li>
            <li> Wish the kit came with other color options than red.  Great starter kit for uv nail lamp.  Daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> The top layer turened in to a glue after2-3 times using it and I didn&#x27;t miss closing the top</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick. The product was packaged well. The color is a very bright beautiful red. love the color. Works well with led light Just make sure to do thin layers</li>
            <li> Great product, I love the base and top coats. They are just as good as name brand Gelish and a fraction of the price. As a professional, I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> Less than 2 days Ship thank you i love it!!!</li>
            <li> These are some powerful top/base coats. The red is the perfect color. My gel nails stayed on for a month and still had great shine.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal.. Three for the price of one. The red is gorg and the top coat is not sticky like other gels. It&#x27;s a thick consistency it&#x27;s not runny like other gels, so it cures very well.</li>
            <li> I received this on time, in good condition and it works really well, the reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because the only color option available is the red. It&#x27;s not a bad color, actually quite pretty but I find myself using mainly just the base and top coats because I don&#x27;t always feel like  bright red.</li>
            <li> Only used it once. It turned out nice. My first time so I was a little nervous how it would turn out. It had a power shine. The red was on fire. I mean, it looked like a professional had done it. It started to peel up a little at the new growth of my nail after a week. I think I may have put the base coat on my skin surrounding the nail and caused that, not sure. The next time I will be very careful and try to be neater and apply only to the nail.Its clear so I&#x27;ll use more light in the room to see better. Other than that, Can&#x27;t wait to do in another color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the base coat 4 stars, it does the job. The red I&#x27;m giving 5 starts because it is such a nice color red and I find the BMC gel polishes last nicely. I am giving the top coat 3 stars because I find it goes yellow very quickly and the gel started hardening even though it is kept in a cool dark place. The nice thing about the top coat is that it doesn&#x27;t have a tacky layer after curing.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter kit.  Really good products.</li>
            <li> there is somehting in the product that gave me a cuticle fungus and infection every time i used it</li>
            <li> WELL, it says red.  Orange-red maybe.. not my idea of red.  No real instructions or guide come with this, you DO NOT want to touch the polish until after full cure of the TOP COAT.  VS.  salon nails, works different according to the friend that went in on the machine and kit with me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and had the tops of two peel off on days 3 &amp; 4. Not sure if it&#x27;s the polish, or exactly what error I could have made.  My friend gets the gel manicure at the salon and it lasts her 3-4 weeks until it&#x27;s so grown out it looks bad...  I&#x27;d be happy to get 10-14 days with nice looking nails.  Hope the second round goes better.  And we did get a 36W UV Lamp, not a wimpy one, we cured for 4 minutes between each coat.</li>
            <li> The quality and wear is okay but it arrived much later than was stated so I ended up having to keep it for myself when it was intended as a gift.</li>
            <li> These gel polishes were very good. Color lasted at least 2 weeks or more. Will order again. Hope they have specials.</li>
            <li> Base coat did not dry.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> We actually only used the base and top coat with some sensational polish that we bought on clearance at Walmart. My manicure lasted for two weeks, and the daughter used this base and top coal with sensational over her acrylics. We are very pleased.</li>
            <li> nail polish is pretty. I haven&#x27;t had two weeks wear but am working on my application method. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Gel Nail polish chips off after one week. Very think solution, this may be the reason it peels off after it chips.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! The base coat and the top coat work PERFECTLY with my Royal Nails UV Light (which I purchased on Amazon). I haven&#x27;t used the red nail polish yet because I purchased another BMC nail polish set and I am using those colors right now. However, this top coat and base coat work GREAT!</li>
            <li> This is a very good starter kit for beginners learning to do gel polish. I&#x27;m having fun with it. It lasted 3 weeks so far on my toes and the color is very bright. It didn&#x27;t last very long on the nails though as the box stated up to 2 weeks, however I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply, colors are shiny and bold the only down fall,they chip within a week. Gelish harmony last up to 3 weeks with no chips. Not that big of a deal. My nails grow fast. I usually need a new set within those 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Bundle Monster. Their products are all great and so much less expensive than other similar products. My husband got me their color changing gels and I&#x27;m absolutely crazy about them too. Their customer service is wonderful too. I&#x27;ve not been disappointed yet and will continue to shop with them.</li>
            <li> This is trash. I bought these instead of &amp;#34;gelish&amp;#34; brand because they were literally half the price and I thought I could save a few bucks. What a waste of my time. They do not dry under my led lamp. Returning it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my nails salon-gelled a few times and this kit has hit a home run as well. Very easy to apply, although the substance is a little thick. I did my nails about 3 days ago and they seem to look better and better with time. Two thumbs up, literally, from a first time self-geller.</li>
            <li> Does well on artificial nails. Top coat holds well with regular nail polish. But will use again for the time being.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these top and bottom coat with a&lt;br /&gt;UV light for a few months now with no problems. The cleansing wipes takes away the tackiness immediately. I have used this set with brands including Gellish, OPI, Sensational, Sally Hanson, Gelaze, BMC and a few others. There was one brand that chipped off in full nail but it happened with each color so I blame the polish not the base. I am reordering because I am do my mom and daughter&#x27;s nails as well. I gave them a 4 because I know there are better out there but for the price, BMC rocks! I could definitely do with out hthe hooker red tho!!</li>
            <li> All 3 bottles leaked in the box as they arrived. :(</li>
            <li> I really like it the only but thing is the base it didn&#x27;t dry so I dont use it any more but the other colors are graet</li>
            <li> As a gift for my daughter-in-law. She was thrilled, said just as good as Gelish. :-)</li>
            <li> GET THIS LADIES; especially if you are a DIY queen on a budget. This is the only line I own- never disappointed with the outcome!</li>
            <li> These work great with my LED light.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of the price - this stuff works as well as the pricey bands.</li>
            <li> This product was a personal purchase at the normal retail price. I am reviewing it solely because I want to share my experience with other potential customers. I did not purchase it in connection to a review company.  I have received no compensation for my review nor do I have any relationship with the seller or manufacturer of this product.  I have had a positive experience with this product it solved the issue that I purchased it for. I appreciate the opportunity to review this item.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! It lasted me 2weeks and I have gotten many compliments. Bold shiny red..I definitely would recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Decent delivery time.  Pretty good product from what I received but my base coat bottle arrived COMPLETELY empty.  It didn&#x27;t have a drop of polish in the bottle.  The color and top coat work wonderful with my Sally Hansen lamp.</li>
            <li> Last a long time will buy other colors,dries fast with the UV light, my friend and family like them for now.</li>
            <li> I really like the bundle and it is a good value. However, if you are not used to wearing BRIGHT red on your nails, it will be a shock. It was a bit too much for me, but I like the color and it looked good on me.</li>
            <li> The BMC uv led gel nail art polish is very good. Goes on good and dries great. A very good price for so much product.</li>
            <li> I am a newbie in the DIYS Gel manicure world and did my homework on how to start. Some will tell you to get the &amp;#34;Starter Kit,&amp;#34; which I almost did, but decided on this instead because it was less money, and it had regular size polish, base, &amp; top coat. And the color, which I call &amp;#34;Jungle Red,&amp;#34; (if you are into classic movies you know where that comes from) is just beautiful! The color last 2-3 weeks if done right. If you are starting, start with this, and if you need Video instructions, just go on to Youtube and there are plenty to walk you through the process. I am so glad I am doing this myself, I am saving a lot of money, and it is therapeutic to boot!</li>
            <li> Excellent gel, I love this red color, looks so pretty. I wish they have more traditional colors at this excellent price. Same quality or maybe better than other expensive brands.</li>
            <li> You should buy the kit if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap n good red gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect red!&lt;br /&gt;I painted my nails with them 2weeks ago, n the color still stay beautiful on them, never came off yet.&lt;br /&gt;Actually I didn&#x27;t want top n base coat, but they work very well too.</li>
            <li> awesome gel nail top and base</li>
            <li> works AWESOME as my acrylic Iv top coat in my 9 watt Lamp. Does take about 4 minutes each nail but thats due to the low wattage lamp i use. the product works great and goes on smooth. would purchase again</li>
            <li> The base and top are pretty strong they work well and it dries really fast.</li>
            <li> False advertising!! The website says UV/LED!! But the actual product says UV ONLY. So beware and do not use with LED lamp. I cannot believe they can get away with this</li>
            <li> I expected it to harden like salon polish, it does not and after about 3 days it starts to peel. It is easy to use and does make my nails shiny  but does not last as long as it claims</li>
            <li> These polishes are not nearly thick enough to stay on your nails when wet. Polish runs off the side onto skin before it can dry making an ugly mess. Once I finally got the excess cleaned up and dried they lasted less than a week before peeling off. I won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of gel nail polish tools. You get a base coat top coat and a nice bright red. It took two minutes for each coat to dry. I like IBD gel nail polish so much I decided to buy a bunch more in all the colors I would wear.  I costs a lot less than what you pay at the local stores here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this brand better than the gelish. You don&#x27;t have to wipe after the top coat it dries clean. Last for 2 weeks. Used this on myself and my clients I will purchase more colors.</li>
            <li> I love love this great quality</li>
            <li> I needed a good gel base and top coat for my gel nails.  This worked great at not a ridiculous price.  I will definitely buy more when mine runs out!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sensationail base/top coat and decided to try this brand. It was o.k. Not better than what I have been using and not the same. I&#x27;d say a step down. It didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as Sensationail product. Won&#x27;t purchase it again. I&#x27;ll stick w/the one I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> Top and base coats are a joke, but the color is nice. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this bundle, stick with their colors and a buy a different top quality base/top coat if you want your nails to last more than a day.</li>
            <li> I am still experimenting with this uv soak off polish I purchased this as well as the U spicy brand uv lamp to cure. it seems that I have to leave my nails under the lamp for way longer than recommended just to get them to cure. I am not sure if it is the lamp or the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the polish I will say like any gel is hard to remove even with soaking them I still have to do a bit of scraping which in turn weakens my nails a bit but I think if I limit the use to every 2 weeks I will be ok or place a uv top coat on top of a regular polish color and base</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how well this works for the price.  I read the other reviews and it said that the gel did not set, I did not have that problem I wasnt sure how long to keep under the light, but I did 2 minutes for each stage and did not have any problems at all.  It works as well as competitors and half the price for twice as much product.</li>
            <li> works good, but the ph bond should be part of this kit</li>
            <li> Its more orange in real life so color is a bit misleading other than that its beautiful</li>
            <li> i have used gel nail polish of other brands and this one seems to thick and once it is put under the led light and dries, it is so thick you can peel it off like the kid nail polishes that are peeled off. not sure how else to explain it but i was not happy with the product</li>
            <li> I got an UV lamp as a gift but I really didn&#x27;t know where to start when it came to gel polishes so I decided to go not so pricey and try this brand, I have to say the quality is great, the color could be a red orange if you use just one coat and a deeper red with two coats. Does the job and I will be definitely buying more products of this brand.</li>
            <li> Peels right off the instant it dries. Waste of money. Not sure what the positive reviewers are using to keep it on, but it&#x27;s no good. At all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. after a couple days, the paint peals off like a sticker.</li>
            <li> Vibrant and easy to use with the uv lamp</li>
            <li> Another HORRIBLE nail product. I can&#x27;t believe I spent money on this. This too, only hold for a day and actually less than that. Cheap nail polish stays on my nails longer than this.</li>
