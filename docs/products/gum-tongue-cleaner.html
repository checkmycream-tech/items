            <li>i found it good quality tongue scraper and</li>
            <li>Our bodies produce enzymes while we sleep and those enzymes settle on our tongue, so it&#x27;s great to use this in the morning of after certain meals or smoothies.</li>
            <li>We use it morning and night, after brushing our teeth, and it&#x27;s made a huge difference!</li>

            <li>used it for 2 weeks and it works efficiently :)</li>
            <li>I gave my hygienist one for a gift :)</li>
            <li>but so far so good!</li>
            <li>Good deal, very sturdy, works well.</li>
            <li>Easy dual function tool.</li>
            <li>good product I cant live without&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush side is great for brushing your tongue &amp; loosening up all the left overs in your mouth...</li>
            <li>Easy to keep clean by rinsing off with water, or letting it soak in some Listerine Antiseptic once a week</li>
            <li>Works well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Ordered for myself as I enjoy the effect of keeping my tongue clean.</li>
            <li>I rinse it off weekly with peroxide to help keep it clean.  </li>
            <li>If you skip cleaning your tongue, your mouth is never fully clean because whatever is on your tongue after you brush, floss and rinse, will spread throughout your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this tongue cleaner to all of my patients because it keeps your breath fresh and your mouth cleaner.</li>

            <li>Mouth feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I like the dual use of the bristle brush side and the plastic ledge side which really does a thorough job at removing plaque, bacteria, stain and food debris.</li>
            <li>These scrape the eww off of my tongue better than any other cleaner.</li>
            <li>Simply use the brush side first (gently)</li>
            <li>sure how long it will last since its plastic</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much my husband&#x27;s and my breath was after using this for only a couple days!</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>then then other side gently as well and you&#x27;re done.</li>

            <li> long as GUM keeps making these, I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> And these do the trick without being so wide they are gaggers.  </li>
            <li> The other side scrapes all the yuck out.  </li>
            <li> It has 2 sides, one a brush, the other plastic teeth.</li>
            <li> These are getting hard to find lately...</li>
            <li> seriously.  </li>
            <li> Disgusting to see what comes off the tongue, even after I&#x27;ve brushed, but that shows it works.</li>

            <li> The best tongue cleaner ever!</li>
            <li> Good deal, very sturdy, works well.</li>
            <li> I oil pull several  times a week &amp; need a tongue scrapper to get all the left overs out my mouth.  I absolutely love this scraper the best out of all I have used.  I cant even find it in the store any more so I now purchase from Amazon.  The brush side is great for brushing your tongue &amp; loosening up all the left overs in your mouth...seriously.  The other side scrapes all the yuck out.  I rinse it off weekly with peroxide to help keep it clean.  I will definitely be buying these again</li>
            <li> This does the job at the right price.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both really like these tongue cleaners - they are the best we have ever used.  They get the job done!</li>
            <li> i found it good quality tongue scraper and mouth gum cleaner&lt;br /&gt;i think it is the second best in the market</li>
            <li> I love these tongue brushes and can never find them in the stores. They are the only ones I&#x27;ve tried and leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh. Please continue to make these even if the on,y place I can get them is online.</li>
            <li> Built well, sturdy. Like that it has 2 sides, one to brush and one to scrape. Disgusting to see what comes off the tongue, even after I&#x27;ve brushed, but that shows it works. Mouth feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Love me some tongue cleaner................ good product I cant live without&lt;br /&gt;GUM Tongue Cleaner &#x3D; Pack of 3 awesome !!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much my husband&#x27;s and my breath was after using this for only a couple days! We use it morning and night, after brushing our teeth, and it&#x27;s made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> GUM tongue cleaner is my favorite option in the market. I like the dual use of the bristle brush side and the plastic ledge side which really does a thorough job at removing plaque, bacteria, stain and food debris. I recommend this tongue cleaner to all of my patients because it keeps your breath fresh and your mouth cleaner. If you skip cleaning your tongue, your mouth is never fully clean because whatever is on your tongue after you brush, floss and rinse, will spread throughout your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GUM tongue cleaner is manual toothbrush size in length. The rubber grip pads are great for sturdy use. Easy to keep clean by rinsing off with water, or letting it soak in some Listerine Antiseptic once a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as GUM keeps making these, I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> Ordered for myself as I enjoy the effect of keeping my tongue clean. Tied one on to Mom&#x27;s Mothers&#x27; Day Gift, &amp;#34;Cards Against Humanity&amp;#34;, got some laughs.</li>
            <li> I have been using it. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Helps to keep breath fresh. Our bodies produce enzymes while we sleep and those enzymes settle on our tongue, so it&#x27;s great to use this in the morning of after certain meals or smoothies. Simply use the brush side first (gently) then then other side gently as well and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> You can visibly see all the gunk that your toothbrush doesn&#x27;t get with this so you know its helping</li>
            <li> Love these things. Had one before and can&#x27;t find them at any stores. Has a rigid grooved side and a bristle side.</li>
            <li> Wow.  These are getting hard to find lately... I am a tongue &amp;#34;scrapper&amp;#34;.... don&#x27;t like brushing with a toothbrush... feels ... furry... I prefer to scape.  And these do the trick without being so wide they are gaggers.  Just personal preference.</li>
            <li> A step forward in hygiene. Use it several times a day.</li>
            <li> used it for 2 weeks and it works efficiently :)&lt;br /&gt;not sure how long it will last since its plastic but so far so good!</li>
            <li> I wonder why I can&#x27;t find these in the drug stores.  They do an execellent job cleaning my tongue. Try them</li>
            <li> Surpassed my expectations! It has 2 sides, one a brush, the other plastic teeth. I gave my hygienist one for a gift :)</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> These scrape the eww off of my tongue better than any other cleaner.</li>
            <li> Works great with Orabrush Tongue Foam.  Easy dual function tool.</li>
