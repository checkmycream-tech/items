            <li>but this machine is great</li>
            <li>I was so happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall my experience was really great</li>
            <li>Amazing product,easy to use and very effective!</li>
            <li>Over all a very nice piece of equipment in a very nice case.</li>
            <li>But the outcome is amazing!</li>
            <li>Excellent service and love this product.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with a good skin care with apple stem cells, and my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that I got just as good of results with my at home treatment</li>
            <li>The box has flowers embossed on it, simply a beautiful box on its own!&lt;br /&gt;Super easy instructions!</li>
            <li>well, I love my results!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to do more treatments and see how my skin turns out!</li>
            <li>I love that even if I never use the pen again I have already saved myself $700!</li>
            <li>Still, I would like it to work with our own 220v -</li>
            <li>It was also packaged nice too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased honest review.</li>
            <li>It has two separate spots to keep the pen and power supply in their own spots.  </li>
            <li>I started by adding a good amount or vitamin c and hyaluronic acid serum to help the pen glide across my skin and to also help it penetrate better.</li>
            <li>Anyhoo, it&#x27;s very easy to use and put together.  </li>
            <li>ANY MORE!!!&lt;br /&gt;This pen is so easy to use!</li>
            <li>and I could tell that some very fine lines were already filling in.</li>
            <li>and I could tell that some very fine lines were already filling in.</li>
            <li>This is machine is actually pretty great.</li>
            <li>The forehead and brow bone hurt the most.  </li>
            <li>So ok here&#x27;s my advice I decided to do 2 on the rest of my body my thighs and my bum</li>
            <li>I will keep posting my results :)</li>
            <li>Had this shipped to Philippines because I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work with the converter.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at the results, but of course couldn&#x27;t afford more on my college budget.</li>
            <li>However, being an experienced derma roller, I found that this machine doesn&#x27;t penetrate the skin as much.</li>
            <li>The needles didn&#x27;t seem to stamp the skin, more like touch the skin.</li>
            <li>Also, the machine seems better to use on the face than a body part.</li>
            <li>I am SO in love with this derma pen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used derma rollers before which were nice but you can tell a HUGE difference using this derma pen.  </li>
            <li>but I applied more serum after I was done and it helped a lot.</li>
            <li>Now that I am more confident in using this</li>
            <li>but I applied more serum after I was done and it helped a lot.</li>
            <li>Now that I am more confident in using this</li>
            <li>/&gt;a week it sloughed off in the shower to reveal beautiful new skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, very happy I got this Auto derma stamp machine for an honest review, I have fallen in love with this little beauty</li>
            <li>It shipped super fast and inside a beautiful gold Aluminum Box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are a first time user, this product is good for you to start off with, as it will be easy for you to use.</li>
            <li>Works great but kinda loud</li>
            <li>it was more comfortable</li>
            <li>This derma stamp pen arrived in a very nice, hard, latching case with a beautiful flower pattern etched into it.</li>
            <li>I wiped my face clean again with an antiseptic wipe and apply more of my serum</li>
            <li>Despite cord, easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>I believe that this would not have been so easy.</li>
            <li>nice but good luck getting it to all fit back in after use.  </li>
            <li>also in the fine lines.</li>
            <li>I see a HUGE difference in my face.  </li>
            <li>As a medical aesthetician I am so happy whit this item.....</li>
            <li>Product comes with a card that says Download FREE eBook</li>
            <li>(I used Advanced night repair and Ole Hendrickson&#x27;s Truth serum(in the orange bottle) because that is what I already had on</li>
            <li>overall experience with this was great.</li>
            <li>overall experience with this was great.</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use, and saves me a bundle of money, because at the cosmedic center, they charge 600.00 to $800.00 for 4 treatments.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>First off, you must make sure that your face is washed before using this.  </li>
            <li>I continued to move around my face in section removing the numbing cream, and wiping with the antiseptic wipes to keep my skin as clean and sterile as possible,apply the serum and moving the pen all around my face</li>
            <li>Also, clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a great idea to purchase the MyM 30gram topical anesthetic cream to go with it for your more sensitive areas on your face.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re too precious to me, hahaha</li>
            <li>This works super</li>
            <li>You will have much better results with this pen and less damage to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for quality testing*All opinions are my own</li>
            <li>Oxygenic(I think that is the name) of a makeup specifically designed for post procedure that covers red AMAZINGLY and is soothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also purchased numbing cream yesterday, hoping it will be easier and more comfortable the next time I do it.</li>
            <li>After the  serum has absorbed I put on some Moisturizer(I</li>
            <li>Honestly, for me, it only lasts about 10-15 minutes and than it goes away.  </li>
            <li>If you do it right, it will hurt.</li>
            <li>In the nice little carrying case there is the pen as well as 10 replacement heads, it all fit it there</li>
            <li>I suggest for new users that you start off with something light just so you get use to it.  </li>
            <li>I just did this for the first time after watching videos.reading and purchasing numbing cream and serum.  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend not going higher than 1.5 until you experiment with the lower settings.</li>
            <li>So not starting off too confidently here.</li>
            <li>tried this on my hand first, not knowing what to expect?</li>
            <li>they are asking questions about what I am doing that&#x27;s making my face glow and look healthier, younger and more even complexion.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, functional and very well made product!  </li>
            <li>tried this for the first time today.</li>
            <li>The first time it touched my skin</li>
            <li>was a bit more red than my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I know next time I will have better results.</li>
            <li>was a bit more red than my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I know next time I will have better results.</li>
            <li>The needles are real and they do hurt!</li>
            <li>Thanks Son!</li>
            <li>After I brought them in a little it was more comfortable</li>
            <li>It was not difficult and was not painful, even without numbing cream, although, if you&#x27;re sensitive I recommend it.</li>
            <li>skin feels plum and healthy like new cells are forming and coming alive, kind of &amp;#34;zippy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;A little redness after</li>
            <li>First off my Micro Needler came EXTREMELY FAST (before my amazon prime stuff).  </li>
            <li>I was pretty aggressive, did my whole face and the leather part (too much sun)</li>
            <li>It took me about 40 minutes and serum is an absolute must.  </li>
            <li>I tried all the serums, IPL, Microdermabrasion, chemical peels, absolutely everything.  </li>
            <li>I will tell my friends, and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I could tell if I started to move the pen too fast because it would tug my skin</li>
            <li>You really have to give your skin ample time to recover or</li>
            <li>The pen is a nice size and isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li>I am sure it hurts less on the face than it does on the hips/butt.</li>
            <li>You will have much better results with this pen and less damage to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for quality</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the numbing cream that is suggested, especially on the upper lip and forehead area.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY suggest using a lot of serum.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend getting the numbing cream because with out it</li>
            <li>Currently, My face is bright red and feels like a fierce sunburn, but I can tell it isn&#x27;t going to hurt very long.  </li>
            <li>Ok so I decided to do my stretch marks as well and got a little carried away</li>
            <li>I love this little machine!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a derma roller for a few months now and love the results I am getting from it</li>
            <li>I turned on the pen at a fairly high speed (since I have already had it done before) and went across and diagonal and up and down all around my forehead where I removed the numbing cream until it was nice and red</li>
            <li>and I can already tell where I have a scar on my face, that its slowly going away which is amazing.  </li>
            <li>the normal price) for 3 treatments</li>
            <li>hand.)&lt;br /&gt;Afterward by skin was VERY red and tender, like it was suppose to bed the bleeding stopped immediately and pretty much just looked like I had</li>
            <li>Of course when you get closer to your eyes or sensitive areas like that, there is a little bit more pain to it</li>
            <li>Thankfully, it was a very simple and not very painful experience.</li>
            <li>Before use, make sure to put some of the anesthetic cream on your sensitive areas and let it sit for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have enough at first and the needles tended to catch.  </li>
            <li>It feels just like you have had a professional treatment!</li>
            <li>so I went slowly, but it was pretty comfortable even on the highest speed and NO PAIN.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Since I had these treatment done professionally before I had</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised, NO</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find out that it didn&#x27;t hurt, at all.</li>
            <li>I had the needles to far out</li>
            <li>My esthetician has been professionally trained to use Dermapen.</li>
            <li>This unit has a true up and down stamping motion.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely more sensitive and you can tell at the first touch if you have the depth wrong.</li>
            <li>on my upper chest, mostly at high speed.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone, especially those who use a derma roller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone, especially those who use a derma roller.</li>
            <li>Finally one day my dermatologist suggested I try something new called &amp;#34;Micro-Needling&amp;#34</li>

            <li> I was pretty aggressive, did my whole face and the leather part (too much sun)</li>
            <li> It took me about 40 minutes and serum is an absolute must.  </li>
            <li> I tried all the serums, IPL, Microdermabrasion, chemical peels, absolutely everything.  </li>
            <li> I will tell my friends, and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I could tell if I started to move the pen too fast because it would tug my skin</li>
            <li> You really have to give your skin ample time to recover or</li>
            <li> The pen is a nice size and isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li> I am sure it hurts less on the face than it does on the hips/butt.</li>
            <li> You will have much better results with this pen and less damage to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for quality</li>
            <li> Be sure to use the numbing cream that is suggested, especially on the upper lip and forehead area.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY suggest using a lot of serum.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend getting the numbing cream because with out it</li>
            <li> Currently, My face is bright red and feels like a fierce sunburn, but I can tell it isn&#x27;t going to hurt very long.  </li>
            <li> Ok so I decided to do my stretch marks as well and got a little carried away</li>
            <li> I love this little machine!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a derma roller for a few months now and love the results I am getting from it</li>
            <li> I turned on the pen at a fairly high speed (since I have already had it done before) and went across and diagonal and up and down all around my forehead where I removed the numbing cream until it was nice and red</li>
            <li> and I can already tell where I have a scar on my face, that its slowly going away which is amazing.  </li>
            <li> the normal price) for 3 treatments</li>
            <li> hand.)&lt;br /&gt;Afterward by skin was VERY red and tender, like it was suppose to bed the bleeding stopped immediately and pretty much just looked like I had</li>
            <li> Of course when you get closer to your eyes or sensitive areas like that, there is a little bit more pain to it</li>
            <li> Thankfully, it was a very simple and not very painful experience.</li>
            <li> Before use, make sure to put some of the anesthetic cream on your sensitive areas and let it sit for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have enough at first and the needles tended to catch.  </li>
            <li> It feels just like you have had a professional treatment!</li>
            <li> so I went slowly, but it was pretty comfortable even on the highest speed and NO PAIN.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Since I had these treatment done professionally before I had</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, NO</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out that it didn&#x27;t hurt, at all.</li>
            <li> I had the needles to far out</li>
            <li> My esthetician has been professionally trained to use Dermapen.</li>
            <li> This unit has a true up and down stamping motion.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely more sensitive and you can tell at the first touch if you have the depth wrong.</li>
            <li> on my upper chest, mostly at high speed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> This unit has a true up and down stamping motion.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> As a medical aesthetician I am so happy whit this item.....</li>
            <li> Amazing product,easy to use and very effective! My skin looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> I just did this for the first time after watching videos.reading and purchasing numbing cream and serum.  I was pretty aggressive, did my whole face and the leather part (too much sun) on my upper chest, mostly at high speed.  The forehead and brow bone hurt the most.  It took me about 40 minutes and serum is an absolute must.  I didn&#x27;t have enough at first and the needles tended to catch.  Currently, My face is bright red and feels like a fierce sunburn, but I can tell it isn&#x27;t going to hurt very long.  I will update in a day or two, but so far, as someone who has  had the derma roller done in a spa, this feels like it worked and was a lot less painful!</li>
            <li> Holy s*** excuse my language but this machine is great I did my face on 1 and I was a little nervous because I was a few martini in when I started and my face was so red but it went down within a hour. Ok so I decided to do my stretch marks as well and got a little carried away I used 1.5 on my belly and I am still red today I did the treatments last night. So ok here&#x27;s my advice I decided to do 2 on the rest of my body my thighs and my bum and I started bleeding like a lot I didn&#x27;t feel anything because of the numbing cream and the martini. If your going to use this machine you will need numbing cream and I would recommend not going higher than 1.5 until you experiment with the lower settings.</li>
            <li> This works super well, I love my results!</li>
            <li> Product comes with a card that says Download FREE eBook Now It directs you to [...] and that website is unavailable. So not starting off too confidently here.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for a few weeks now, and I didn&#x27;t expect to see results so soon. I see an improvement in the plumpness of my skin&lt;br /&gt;and also in the fine lines. Be sure to use the numbing cream that is suggested, especially on the upper lip and forehead area. I use it in conjunction with a good skin care with apple stem cells, and my skin is glowing. I did experience some dryness which was to be expected, but after about&lt;br /&gt;a week it sloughed off in the shower to reveal beautiful new skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you are hesitant, give it a try. I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and a few days ago, someone said she thought I was in my 40&#x27;s, so I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> My derma pen arrived the next day! This is machine is actually pretty great. I have terrible marks on my hips and butt. I had a derma pen treatment done a few months ago with a dermatologist. It cost $525 in Los Angeles. I was told I would need at least 6 treatments, which is insanely expensive. I decided to try this one from amazon. I had doubts because the only pictures I saw with the reviews did not look  the same way my treatments at the office looked. I took some pictures. I use the machine at 2.5. The results felt and looked the same way as it did at the dermatologist!!! I was so happy. The only thing is, it does hurt. If you do it right, it will hurt. It is hard to keep going once it starts to burn. Keep in mind I am talking about deep stretch marks on my butt not my face. I am sure it hurts less on the face than it does on the hips/butt. Depending on what number you change it to. You can adjust it. The great news is that it works! I also purchased numbing cream yesterday, hoping it will be easier and more comfortable the next time I do it. I am letting the area heal (2 weeks tops) I will keep posting my results :)</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use, and saves me a bundle of money, because at the cosmedic center, they charge 600.00 to $800.00 for 4 treatments.</li>
            <li> The vid review did it for me. I almost bought another model and found out almost too late that it only &#x27;vibrated&#x27; and not stamp as it should. Had this shipped to Philippines because I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work with the converter. Still, I would like it to work with our own 220v - It even says on the product flyer &#x27;Do not use it on the power other than AC 220v&amp;#34; and the adaptor says 110v-240v but I&#x27;m too scared I might wreck it. You&#x27;re too precious to me, hahaha</li>
            <li> I have battled Hyper-pigmentaion for a very long time as well as some deep acne scarring.  I tried all the serums, IPL, Microdermabrasion, chemical peels, absolutely everything.  Finally one day my dermatologist suggested I try something new called &amp;#34;Micro-Needling&amp;#34; I was skeptical at first, but desperate, I just wanted to be able to leave the house without make up and not get starred at.  So, I gave in.  $500(1/3 the normal price) for 3 treatments I was amazed at the results, but of course couldn&#x27;t afford more on my college budget. So I gave up, I started doing research on at home machines, I was pretty wary about it, for one it&#x27;s VERY PAINFUL even at the dermatologist office I was extremely uncomfortable(even with numbing creme).  I decided to bite the bullet and buy this bad boy, I also ordered Numb Master numbing cream because it was suggested on many websites and some antiseptic wipes.  First off my Micro Needler came EXTREMELY FAST (before my amazon prime stuff).  In the nice little carrying case there is the pen as well as 10 replacement heads, it all fit it there nice but good luck getting it to all fit back in after use.  You get what you pay for so the needle head made me a little nervous because it didn&#x27;t twist on very tightly but held in place efficiently during the whole process.&lt;br /&gt;I am not licensed at anything nor am I a medical professor but here it the step I took.&lt;br /&gt;1. I cleaned my face removing ALL MY MAKE UP&lt;br /&gt;2. Applied my numbing cream for 25 minutes (Which ended up drying awkwardly on my skin, but I was VERY numb.)&lt;br /&gt;3. I took the antiseptic wipes and paper towels and removed the numbing cream on my forehead ONLY.&lt;br /&gt;4. On my forehead I then applied a lot of serum (the needles push it into the skin as well as helps the pen glide over the skin.&lt;br /&gt;5. I turned on the pen at a fairly high speed (since I have already had it done before) and went across and diagonal and up and down all around my forehead where I removed the numbing cream until it was nice and red, there were some small spots with little needle point of blood, but that is normal to my knowledge and heals almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;6. I continued to move around my face in section removing the numbing cream, and wiping with the antiseptic wipes to keep my skin as clean and sterile as possible,apply the serum and moving the pen all around my face I varied between 1.5 and 2 for the needle depth because of my deep scarring.&lt;br /&gt;7. Once I had done all of my face I wiped my face clean again with an antiseptic wipe and apply more of my serum (I used Advanced night repair and Ole Hendrickson&#x27;s Truth serum(in the orange bottle) because that is what I already had on hand.)&lt;br /&gt;8. After the  serum has absorbed I put on some Moisturizer(I used Sheer Transformation because that is what I had on hand.)&lt;br /&gt;Afterward by skin was VERY red and tender, like it was suppose to bed the bleeding stopped immediately and pretty much just looked like I had a really bad sun burn (which is the same as when I got the professional treatments done)&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I was still red and tender I washed my face with Purity face wash and applied the same serum and the a moisturizer with a SPF of 30 I think it was by Juice.  Since I had these treatment done professionally before I had Oxygenic(I think that is the name) of a makeup specifically designed for post procedure that covers red AMAZINGLY and is soothing.&lt;br /&gt;Overall my experience was really great I was amazed that I got just as good of results with my at home treatment then I did at the dermatologist&#x27;s.  The pen itself is a passable, I wish the control switch was on the pen and not on the cord that is my main complaint and really my only one.  I can&#x27;t wait to do more treatments and see how my skin turns out! I love that even if I never use the pen again I have already saved myself $700!</li>
            <li> I love this little machine!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a derma roller for a few months now and love the results I am getting from it but it is not consistent.&lt;br /&gt;I had spots on my face that I could control the pressure manually, and other spots where I would loose control and press harder or softer.&lt;br /&gt;NOT ANY MORE!!!&lt;br /&gt;This pen is so easy to use! It shipped super fast and inside a beautiful gold Aluminum Box.&lt;br /&gt; The box has flowers embossed on it, simply a beautiful box on its own!&lt;br /&gt;Super easy instructions! all you do is open a cartridge of twelve sterilized needles.&lt;br /&gt;insert it into the pen and twist to lock.&lt;br /&gt;plug into outlet and dial your speed! Its that easy!&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on my hand first, not knowing what to expect? I was pleasantly surprised, NO PAIN!&lt;br /&gt;It has 9 speeds so I went slowly, but it was pretty comfortable even on the highest speed and NO PAIN.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels plum and healthy like new cells are forming and coming alive, kind of &amp;#34;zippy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;A little redness after but it only lasted about 15mins. about the same as getting my eyebrows done, not a bother.&lt;br /&gt;comes with 10 cartridges of 12 needles.&lt;br /&gt;Very, very happy I got this Auto derma stamp machine for an honest review, I have fallen in love with this little beauty box!&lt;br /&gt;I hate to share my secret derma pen with others but it&#x27;s my responsibility so... I will tell my friends, and recommend it highly! they are asking questions about what I am doing that&#x27;s making my face glow and look healthier, younger and more even complexion. I told them to derma roll! now I can recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I have used this pen about 5 times now. It is working. I have really deep wrinkles so I know it is going to take a while before I get the results I want.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Despite cord, easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using derma rollers and stamps for years now, so I wanted to try the electric version. However, being an experienced derma roller, I found that this machine doesn&#x27;t penetrate the skin as much. The up &amp; down motion seemed to not be as beneficial as I had expected. The needles didn&#x27;t seem to stamp the skin, more like touch the skin. If you are a first time user, this product is good for you to start off with, as it will be easy for you to use. Also, the machine seems better to use on the face than a body part.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, functional and very well made product!  Five Stars!</li>
            <li> Excellent service and love this product.</li>
            <li> Works great but kinda loud</li>
            <li> I am SO in love with this derma pen. I&#x27;ve used derma rollers before which were nice but you can tell a HUGE difference using this derma pen.  First off, you must make sure that your face is washed before using this.  Also, it&#x27;s a great idea to purchase the MyM 30gram topical anesthetic cream to go with it for your more sensitive areas on your face.  Anyhoo, it&#x27;s very easy to use and put together.  Everyones first reaction is \\&quot;how scary this machine looks because of the needles\\&quot;. That is NOT the case at all.  Of course when you get closer to your eyes or sensitive areas like that, there is a little bit more pain to it but that is what the anesthetic cream is for.  Before use, make sure to put some of the anesthetic cream on your sensitive areas and let it sit for a few minutes.  Once that is done, use the derma pen on your face in up &amp;down, diagonal, and circle motions.  Now your face will turn red a little bit and will feel like a sun burn in a way.  Honestly, for me, it only lasts about 10-15 minutes and than it goes away.  I feel that this product gets a lot deeper than your regular derma roller.  I see a HUGE difference in my face.  I&#x27;ve used this for a few days now and I can already tell where I have a scar on my face, that its slowly going away which is amazing.  There is a speed setting on this and how deep you want the needles to go in. I suggest for new users that you start off with something light just so you get use to it.  Also, clean up is a breeze. This product also comes in a BEAUTIFUL case so no one can tell whats in it.  It was also packaged nice too. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased honest review.*</li>
            <li> This derma stamp pen arrived in a very nice, hard, latching case with a beautiful flower pattern etched into it. It has two separate spots to keep the pen and power supply in their own spots.  There are 3 different products in the case- the pen, the power supply and a set of 10 12needle cartridges. The pen is a nice size and isn&#x27;t too heavy. The power supply plugs into the bottom of the pen and has an adjustable speed dial with 9 speeds. All of the disposable needle cartridges come in individual, sterile packages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this for the first time today. I was expecting something very difficult and painful but I was wrong. It was not difficult and was not painful, even without numbing cream, although, if you&#x27;re sensitive I recommend it. It reminded me of a tattoo gun so putting something similar on my face had me a little nervous. Thankfully, it was a very simple and not very painful experience. I looked up better instructions online because the ones that are provided are very vague and pretty much useless. I started by adding a good amount or vitamin c and hyaluronic acid serum to help the pen glide across my skin and to also help it penetrate better. I HIGHLY suggest using a lot of serum. If I hit a spot that was dry it was quite uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out on my cheek with the needle depth in the middle of .25 and .50. I turned the speed up to the second setting. I then started using the pen in lines going horizontal and then vertical. The first time it touched my skin I was surprised to find out that it didn&#x27;t hurt, at all. I could feel the pressure of the pen but the needles did not hurt. I could tell if I started to move the pen too fast because it would tug my skin and I knew to slow down. After doing both cheeks I started on my forehead. It is definitely more sensitive and you can tell at the first touch if you have the depth wrong. I had the needles to far out and it felt like they were bounding off my bone. After I brought them in a little it was more comfortable and I continued with no issues except my forehead was a bit more red than my cheeks. My entire face took about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall experience with this was great. My skin instantly started to plump up and I could tell that some very fine lines were already filling in. I only had a slight burning sensation that lasted for about 15 minutes but I applied more serum after I was done and it helped a lot. Now that I am more confident in using this I know next time I will have better results. I highly recommend this to everyone, especially those who use a derma roller. You will have much better results with this pen and less damage to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for quality testing*All opinions are my ownttle it was more comfortable and I continued with no issues except my forehead was a bit more red than my cheeks. My entire face took about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall experience with this was great. My skin instantly started to plump up and I could tell that some very fine lines were already filling in.

            <li> Saying 24 to 48 hour recovery time is misleading. My esthetician has been professionally trained to use Dermapen. It is only recommended for use every 3-4 weeks as a means to build up collagen(because it takes that long for your cells to react to the treatment as Collagen Induction Therapy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If however, your goal is scar removal I would recommend every 10 days and no sooner. You really have to give your skin ample time to recover or the treatment is counter-productive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any improvement</li>
            <li> This is a miracle worker! I will add pictures later I am having an issue with my technologies. But I wanted  to go ahead and do my review of what I thought of the product. It is no walk in the park. The needles are real and they do hurt! But the outcome is amazing! It feels just like you have had a professional treatment! I would highly recommend getting the numbing cream because with out it I believe that this would not have been so easy. Over all a very nice piece of equipment in a very nice case. I was given the opportunity to review this product and it has drastically lightened my darkest stretchmark... Thanks Son!</li>
