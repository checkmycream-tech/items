            <li>You can very easily pass an infection on to someone if you choose to share these</li>
            <li>I am so glad that i ordered these.</li>
            <li>I watch too many drpimplepopper videos on IG.  </li>
            <li>It worked better than the lancet I paid $10 for.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>Received these on time and am pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>For the most part it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>These are an ok item.</li>
            <li>I havent used yet, but Im sure it will suffice for the time being.</li>
            <li>Spend a dollar and get something better</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me and didn&#x27;t feel too pleasant either....</li>
            <li>this tool is very good at the time of a cleansing facial.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Just make sure to soak them in a bit of isopropyl alcohol aftward, please.&amp;#34; Turned out she wasn&#x27;t familiar with how to use them &amp; instead of showing her, I gave her verbal step by step instructions.</li>
            <li>For the price, the product is pretty nice to use.</li>
            <li>It works excellent, i love these to keep my face clean and without impurities, no more blackheads in my face.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic for the price.</li>
            <li>In fairness, this actually works great in removing my blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li>Came quick, easy to use.</li>
            <li>The next day, being the good daughter that I am, I decided I&#x27;d go by &amp; check on her.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t really get many blackheads out</li>
            <li>These extractors work great, just watch whose hands they get into &amp; I am not talking about little kids here.</li>
            <li>I am glad this was so inexpensive, because it certainly isnt worth much.</li>
            <li>&amp; I can&#x27;t imagine Staff being any fun on your face, if you&#x27;re using these yourself.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted but just took a minute to get here</li>
            <li>Overall, product was okay, the pointed edge was somewhat bent but considering the price you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>The open side is Great for blackheads but the spoon end will only take out soft pimples.</li>
            <li>Easy enough I thought.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, just as described.</li>
            <li>I had so much stuff come out of my pores that the strips weren&#x27;t getting.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Except one of the tools, I had no need for it since it really didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s really important for the fact that blackheads are future pimples.</li>
            <li>It went straight in the garbage.</li>
            <li>Of the two I avoid using the pointed sharp end because it looks more like a weapon of harm than anything else.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it works extremely well with ingrown hairs and blackheads also.</li>
            <li>High quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li>Hurts and doesn&#x27;t really work on normal size blackheads.</li>
            <li>Got it early and the product is exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to be.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I suggest spending a little more and getting something of higher quality that will actually work-</li>
            <li>Popped black head out easily</li>
            <li>For first time users I&#x27;d recommend to watch a demonstation at YouTube for the proper uses of these pimple poppers.</li>
            <li>Both tools have the exact same loop on one end.</li>
            <li>With my higher quality tool, it fits over the entire pimple/whitehead/blackhead and puts pressure on it to extract it.</li>
            <li>Both of these stainless steel extractors hygenically and safety remove both white/black heads without leaving permanent scarrings and contacting facial infections</li>
            <li>I waited weeks for this to come in the mail and in the meantime I bought a similar tool made by Revlon, which was worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>It is kind of weird</li>
            <li>As far as the straight end of it, I&#x27;m not sure what purpose this serves either besides poking holes into your skin.</li>

            <li> Other than having to wait a long time to get  them, i just got them and they work.</li>
            <li> and if you are&#x27;t used to being rough with your face</li>
            <li> and i had a rough time trying to get the area&#x27;s that were in the crease of the nose</li>
            <li> If you choose it, just be careful is all I&#x27;m saying.</li>
            <li> Never got it package was empty</li>
            <li> They are not stainless steel just so you know.  </li>
            <li> The opening on the blackhead remover part is a bit bigger than usual</li>
            <li> Help kept down da minimal of black heads and spot caused by break n of skin with hands....</li>
            <li> Well, this was a waste of the little money I spent.</li>
            <li> Shipping time takes less than what it says.</li>
            <li> and i bought these for less than $1.</li>
            <li> The piece is SO small you cannot even get it over a blemish to squeeze anything out.</li>
            <li> this is a WASTE!</li>
            <li> Took just shy of 2 months to finally get the product.</li>
            <li> But from my experience, you have to push down very hard to even BEGIN to get blackheads out.</li>
            <li> so it makes it hard to remove them.</li>
            <li> I soon discovered I had quite of few white ones around the base of my nose.</li>
            <li> I have used three different types of extractors and find this set to be the easiest and least painful to use.</li>
            <li> The design is poorly done.</li>
            <li> By the wrong hands, I&#x27;ll explain.</li>
            <li> Postage would have been too expensive for a Return to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t believe how much nasty stuff comes out of the nose area.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very happy &amp; satisfied with these efficient tools to remove those pesky pimple heads. I watched on YouTube where people had issues with these conditions and to my surprise I soon discovered I had quite of few white ones around the base of my nose. They looked like tiny snow peaks when I observed using a magnifying glass (Yuck !!! ) Both of these stainless steel extractors hygenically and safety remove both white/black heads without leaving permanent scarrings and contacting facial infections It&#x27;s an alternative method than using your fingers or nails to unclog them. Of the two I avoid using the pointed sharp end because it looks more like a weapon of harm than anything else. But it&#x27;s made specifically to pierce blackheads. For first time users I&#x27;d recommend to watch a demonstation at YouTube for the proper uses of these pimple poppers. Again very happy with this bargain purchase and both shipping and handling met with positive expectations. A must have in clearing out facial inflammatories.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not as great as I hoped though,</li>
            <li> Other than having to wait a long time to get  them, i just got them and they work. I haven&#x27;t used them before until i just got them. It is kind of weird and if you are&#x27;t used to being rough with your face then it will make your eyes water. I used it on my nose area and i had a rough time trying to get the area&#x27;s that were in the crease of the nose but i eventually got in the area and it worked out great.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how much nasty stuff comes out of the nose area. I had so much stuff come out of my pores that the strips weren&#x27;t getting. I am so glad that i ordered these. Now i am hooked and i will be sending my friends some as well!</li>
            <li> Horrible! Did not work</li>
            <li> Perfect item was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> this tool is very good at the time of a cleansing facial. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> got this cause I watch too many drpimplepopper videos on IG.  Works better than expected.  Good product.  Took two weeks to deliver.</li>
            <li> Great product. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I love this!!!  worked so well, my girls love it too!!!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank u..</li>
            <li> Shipping was slow&lt;br /&gt;And product doesn&#x27;t work well and broke</li>
            <li> Hurts and doesn&#x27;t really work on normal size blackheads.</li>
            <li> package came under criticism, the bag broke, and utensils doubt</li>
            <li> Came quick, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Well as a blackhead remover it works alright. My husband has sworn it off though because he says that it hurts when he tries to use it and the outcome is a very red face. We have a couple of toddlers though who like to go barefoot often outside so they get splinters here and there. This works wonders on those. The kids do not even care that we are trying to get splinters out.</li>
            <li> This is not the best product, the pushers on the ends of the tool did not work. But the pointed end on one of the tools works well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price stop you from ordering. I had my doubts that it wasnt going to be good, til I received it. It worked better than the lancet I paid $10 for. I went ahead and ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> Received these on time and am pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted but just took a minute to get here</li>
            <li> The open side is Great for blackheads but the spoon end will only take out soft pimples.</li>
            <li> 1. This is spot-sqeezer. One spot at a time.&lt;br /&gt;2. Shipping time takes less than what it says. I waited maybe a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;3. Comes with no casing - you get a bubble wrap packet covered by a paper, open it up, that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;4. Very cheap, good buy. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works extremely well with ingrown hairs and blackheads also. And now I don&#x27;t have to use my nails to pop pimples. Great product!</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed. I dont know if I am misusing this product, or if it simply does not work. But from my experience, you have to push down very hard to even BEGIN to get blackheads out. I am glad this was so inexpensive, because it certainly isnt worth much. Avoid</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for the price. I am very pleased.  I recommend ...thank you.</li>
            <li> These extractors work great, just watch whose hands they get into &amp; I am not talking about little kids here. I soak these in alcohol once I use one of them, always! You can very easily pass an infection on to someone if you choose to share these &amp; I can&#x27;t imagine Staff being any fun on your face, if you&#x27;re using these yourself. By the wrong hands, I&#x27;ll explain. My mom asked to borrow them &amp; get rid of a couple of blackheads she had. &amp;#34;Sure&amp;#34;, I said. &amp;#34;Just make sure to soak them in a bit of isopropyl alcohol aftward, please.&amp;#34; Turned out she wasn&#x27;t familiar with how to use them &amp; instead of showing her, I gave her verbal step by step instructions. Easy enough I thought. The next day, being the good daughter that I am, I decided I&#x27;d go by &amp; check on her. My instructions on using the extractor was obviously not good/clear enough. She had long scratches all over her chin &amp; cheeks &amp; come to find out, she had actually drawn blood from a couple. I thought that would be her personal indication to stop, but she said there was no pain &amp; the blackheads were coming out. I had to just throw my hands up with that one. Basically, unless you know what you are doing or are a dermatologist or an esthetician, I don&#x27;t recommend this specific method. If you choose it, just be careful is all I&#x27;m saying.</li>
            <li> Help kept down da minimal of black heads and spot caused by break n of skin with hands....</li>
            <li> I needed something for my blackheads and this was perfect. For the price, the product is pretty nice to use. Except one of the tools, I had no need for it since it really didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> Excellent device for an excellent price. I can&#x27;t just believe that i bought one of these three years ago for $17 and i bought these for less than $1. It works excellent, i love these to keep my face clean and without impurities, no more blackheads in my face. And that&#x27;s really important for the fact that blackheads are future pimples. Love this! I recommend. Item arrived on time. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> Great product and saves me time!</li>
            <li> For the most part it gets the job done. The opening on the blackhead remover part is a bit bigger than usual so it makes it hard to remove them. It also took over a month to arrive but it technically came during the estimated shipping time.</li>
            <li> I still gave not receivef this item.</li>
            <li> High quality stainless steel. Both tools have the exact same loop on one end. Helped unclog a pore on my back, so they do work. Took several weeks to receive because it came from China. I actually forgot I had ordered it.</li>
            <li> Never got it package was empty</li>
            <li> Finally received items after waiting over a month coming from Hong Kong. These are an ok item. They are not stainless steel just so you know.  I havent used yet, but Im sure it will suffice for the time being.</li>
            <li> The design is poorly done. I threw it away. Postage would have been too expensive for a Return to Amazon.</li>
            <li> In fairness, this actually works great in removing my blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Work awesome..get the job done</li>
            <li> its smaller than it looks but not a problem..</li>
            <li> Got it early and the product is exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to be.</li>
            <li> Spend a dollar and get something better</li>
            <li> This is definitely a &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; product. I waited weeks for this to come in the mail and in the meantime I bought a similar tool made by Revlon, which was worth the extra money. The circular side of this tool is supposed to extract blackheads/whiteheads/pimples and it does none of the above. The piece is SO small you cannot even get it over a blemish to squeeze anything out. With my higher quality tool, it fits over the entire pimple/whitehead/blackhead and puts pressure on it to extract it. As far as the straight end of it, I&#x27;m not sure what purpose this serves either besides poking holes into your skin. When purchasing this, I figured I had nothing to lose with the price and miswell take my chances. Well, this was a waste of the little money I spent. It went straight in the garbage. I suggest spending a little more and getting something of higher quality that will actually work- this is a WASTE!</li>
            <li> Took just shy of 2 months to finally get the product. Overall, product was okay, the pointed edge was somewhat bent but considering the price you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Works well enough for its purpose.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, just as described. I have used three different types of extractors and find this set to be the easiest and least painful to use.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t really get many blackheads out</li>
            <li> Popped black head out easily</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me and didn&#x27;t feel too pleasant either....</li>
