            <li>It is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Love this powder!!!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>love the case!!</li>
            <li>Very good for keeping your &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; in place. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and silky smooth upon application and leaves a beautiful and flawless finish.</li>
            <li>very light, very effective.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>It gives my skimpy lashes a lot more length and fullness!  </li>
            <li>I went ahead and tried it anyway (with my own powder brush...which you should know that you have to purchase because the one they provide you is a joke).  </li>
            <li>I think it would be nice for the summer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice to feel the &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; on the skin after putting cc cream..</li>
            <li>kind of cakey.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My suggestion is that you use your own brush to apply it, like maybe a kabuki or blush brush, or whatever you like to apply powder with.</li>
            <li>so it does a nice job setting your foundation and keeping making it</li>
            <li>This is a nice translucent powder.</li>
            <li>Covers nicely</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it seems to be a very good product and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of finishing powders and this by far is the best.  </li>
            <li>My favorite drugstore powder, has a nice finish.</li>
            <li>My favorite finishing powder.</li>
            <li>As a performer it&#x27;s my favorite part of putting on make-up.</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to try it.  </li>
            <li>Instead this powder covers your foundation and gives your face slightly more coverage.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything better.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite finishing powder.  </li>
            <li>It lasts through most of the day.  </li>
            <li>My covergirl setting powder worked a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love putting this over my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>The transulsent is better than the pigmited ones.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>thank goodness I am able to buy it</li>
            <li>I love it  </li>
            <li>only problem was figuring out how to get the best results, since it felt cakey, but this is also my first time using the product</li>
            <li>I wanted a light finishing powder that didn&#x27;t look like paste when applied.  </li>
            <li>Light and airy.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I ordered Translucent; I received Translucent light,</li>
            <li>And it makes your skin look dewy, smooth, and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the most unusual and refreshing mineral veil powder I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff to much!</li>
            <li>The powder came much quicker then I had expected, which was perfect seeing as that meant I could start using it immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then with a clean mascara wand I brush this powder over my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that the brush is contained on the top of the lid, keeps it clean, easier for traveling purposes.  </li>
            <li>( I was not looking for a true cover up).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on with this cool, creamy feeling that is so soothing.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is great, though a bit messy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice - Truly translucent, unlike the last powder I used.</li>
            <li>I use my own big powder brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flat kind of like a foundation brush, and it&#x27;s retractable.</li>
            <li>This is just right.</li>
            <li>its a little too light for my skin, and most skins I believe, since I have a light skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand of mineral veil finishing powder for about a year now, but have had more and more trouble finding it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t alter the color, and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t last long and the coverage seems good.</li>
            <li>That goes for most loose powders though.</li>
            <li>the seller was fast too.</li>
            <li>so I believe I just put too much on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can tell my t-zone become very oily and shiny after 30 mins ~1</li>
            <li>Also, the powder doesn&#x27;t clump much at all like a lot of powder products I&#x27;ve used (finishing powders, blushes, bronzers,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s synthetic, so you can&#x27;t really soften it that much.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very cakey over liquid makeup.</li>
            <li>It really is.  </li>
            <li>, it feels soft and baby fresh..</li>
            <li>The benefit I see over my go-to translucent hi-def powder is that this will set without taking away as much of the dewy look.</li>
            <li>It feels cool to the face going on and definitely protects my makeup during the day.  </li>
            <li>Feel cool and smoothing when brushed on.</li>
            <li>I use high quality foundation and that is what I want people to see.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like powders that make me look more pale than I already am.</li>
            <li>that was an unexpected sensation!</li>
            <li>It is not meant to be dusted on, with the brush, it is pushed into your skin and doesn&#x27;t catch in your peach fuzz and stay visible, which was the reason I ordered the translucent, but honestly, I don&#x27;t think a well matched tinted powder would show either - unlike a typical dry powder.</li>
            <li>I use a large brush and blend it over my entire face except for my eyes.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, with a soft finish, and is truly translucent.  </li>
            <li>and I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>but keeps make up on and professional.</li>
            <li>I use very little so will take awhile before I need to reorder but I will reorder and if you are just looking for a light finishing powder I do recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>This is light, actually feels cool/almost slightly damp (but is not damp) when applied, gives me the finished look that I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cool on my skin, but it sucks at setting.</li>
            <li>I usually use makeup forever&#x27;s HD powder, and like this just as much and you get a lot more for less money</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Extreme CloseUp HD High Definition Mineral Finishing Powder Makeup instead.</li>
            <li>you put it on, it feels wet and cool, but it&#x27;s definitely dry to the touch.</li>
            <li>Maybe about 1 1/2 inch diameter for the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the brush and slight mess, though, I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have much coverage, but it&#x27;s really not supposed to.</li>
            <li>and I complained, they promptly refunded me for the cost of the item and original shipping cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this powder when it arrived is that it was slightly orange/apricot colored (not white or translucent!).</li>

            <li> and I complained, they promptly refunded me for the cost of the item and original shipping cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this powder when it arrived is that it was slightly orange/apricot colored (not white or translucent!).</li>
            <li> The container is ridiculous; I always decant it into something larger and use a real brush.  </li>
            <li> So sorry this product is no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> Previously I was using a finishing powder which was much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I worry that the wet to dry actually takes the finish off any concealer...</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s far too stiff to be used to apply powder, and far too small to be used for powder all over the face.</li>
            <li> It does feel strange when you put it on (would never have thought powder could feel wet).</li>
            <li> So compact!&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t realized it&#x27;s a wet powder to dry powder...</li>
            <li> It does feel wet going on, but once it&#x27;s on the effect goes away.</li>
            <li> Unlike other, I thought the brush was well suited to the product.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is a small brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> It does go on feeling wet, which is so odd!</li>
            <li> Also, because it&#x27;s retractable, if you press very hard with it, the brush goes back into its casing.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I find this product very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I hit 30 and my once oily skin dried.</li>
            <li> It is NOT translucent on my very pale skin, and instead appears slightly orange.</li>
            <li> I feel like I must be using this product wrong, especially after all the glowing reviews I&#x27;ve seen it receive.</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong item, and when I wrote the seller, they said they&#x27;d pay to ship it back and send me a replacement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about one square inch and maybe 1/3 inch thick.</li>
            <li> Not a good product for darker skin.</li>
            <li> Once it has hit your skin it releases it&#x27;s water, which makes it difficult to sweep across my face as it dampens the bristles of the brush i&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> Wrong color.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like powders that give me an orangey/tan color (looks too fake).</li>
            <li> Overall terrible Revlon is awful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just meant to set your makeup so it doesn&#x27;t crease so badly or run all over the place, which is what it does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I absolutely hate the brush it comes with.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and won&#x27;t be using it again.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite finishing powder. Never looks cakey. Keeps me from looking shiny.</li>
            <li> I wanted a light finishing powder that didn&#x27;t look like paste when applied.  This is light, actually feels cool/almost slightly damp (but is not damp) when applied, gives me the finished look that I wanted.  ( I was not looking for a true cover up).  I really like the fact that the brush is contained on the top of the lid, keeps it clean, easier for traveling purposes.  I use very little so will take awhile before I need to reorder but I will reorder and if you are just looking for a light finishing powder I do recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. It&#x27;s refreshing and silky smooth upon application and leaves a beautiful and flawless finish. As a performer it&#x27;s my favorite part of putting on make-up.</li>
            <li> very light, very effective. It doesn&#x27;t alter the color, and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. Initial feeling of moisture caught me offguard, but now I like the cooling effect</li>
            <li> 1st time using a finishing powder so I have nothing to compare it to. So far I like it. But, I do not feel it locks my makeup on so I&#x27;ll have to try others and get back to you.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this powder when it arrived is that it was slightly orange/apricot colored (not white or translucent!). I went ahead and tried it anyway (with my own powder brush...which you should know that you have to purchase because the one they provide you is a joke).  I should have known better than to try it.  I use high quality foundation and that is what I want people to see. Instead this powder covers your foundation and gives your face slightly more coverage. The purpose of a translucent finishing powder is to set your makeup so it stays put longer, not to add color. I was very disappointed and won&#x27;t be using it again.  I highly recommend Extreme CloseUp HD High Definition Mineral Finishing Powder Makeup instead.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. the seller was fast too. i do recommend it. its a little too light for my skin, and most skins I believe, since I have a light skin.</li>
            <li> The powder came much quicker then I had expected, which was perfect seeing as that meant I could start using it immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem was figuring out how to get the best results, since it felt cakey, but this is also my first time using the product so I believe I just put too much on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it seems to be a very good product and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff to much!</li>
            <li> Great product. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything better. It keeps everywhere where it needs to be. Light and airy.</li>
            <li> I feel like I must be using this product wrong, especially after all the glowing reviews I&#x27;ve seen it receive. Firstly, I find this product very difficult to use. Once it has hit your skin it releases it&#x27;s water, which makes it difficult to sweep across my face as it dampens the bristles of the brush i&#x27;m using. It just doesn&#x27;t feel smooth. Secondly is the color in this product. It is NOT translucent on my very pale skin, and instead appears slightly orange. I do, however, like the feeling of it. I think it would be nice for the summer.</li>
            <li> This is the most unusual and refreshing mineral veil powder I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It feels cool to the face going on and definitely protects my makeup during the day.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand of mineral veil finishing powder for about a year now, but have had more and more trouble finding it.  Thank you, Amazon, for carrying the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice - Truly translucent, unlike the last powder I used. However, don&#x27;t use a brush that&#x27;s too full.&lt;br /&gt;I love the case!! So compact!&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t realized it&#x27;s a wet powder to dry powder... that was an unexpected sensation! I worry that the wet to dry actually takes the finish off any concealer... But I have yet to find a solution to this.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of finishing powders and this by far is the best.  I will buy a different brand to try it out but always, always come back to this.  Make your face look flawless.</li>
            <li> It does feel strange when you put it on (would never have thought powder could feel wet). But it doesn&#x27;t last long and the coverage seems good. Will have to see if I get used to it, or if it remains a bit disconcerting.</li>
            <li> Revlon colorstay aquatm mineral finishing powder ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to feel the &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; on the skin after putting cc cream..&lt;br /&gt;I used this mineral finishing poweder for 2 weeks..&lt;br /&gt;My skin had a lot of break out on my cheeks and a lot white heads on my nose .. eww&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it&#x27;s my skincare then I noted that whenever I apply this mineral finishing powder .. I can tell my t-zone become very oily and shiny after 30 mins ~1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I stop using this .. My skin did&#x27;t have anymore white heads or break out..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase this item again.</li>
            <li> can make darker skin look ashy</li>
            <li> This is my favorite finishing powder.  It&#x27;s lightweight, with a soft finish, and is truly translucent.  It lasts through most of the day.  The container is ridiculous; I always decant it into something larger and use a real brush.  So sorry this product is no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> Wrong color.  I ordered Translucent; I received Translucent light,</li>
            <li> This product feels just like water when applying. Very good for keeping your &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; in place. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, though a bit messy. That goes for most loose powders though. Also, the powder doesn&#x27;t clump much at all like a lot of powder products I&#x27;ve used (finishing powders, blushes, bronzers, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;When you put it on, it feels wet and cool, but it&#x27;s definitely dry to the touch. It might take some getting used to for some. I like it because regular powders make me feel kind of cakey.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have much coverage, but it&#x27;s really not supposed to. It&#x27;s just meant to set your makeup so it doesn&#x27;t crease so badly or run all over the place, which is what it does. It also doesn&#x27;t appear to have any shimmer like some Revlon products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I absolutely hate the brush it comes with. It&#x27;s about one square inch and maybe 1/3 inch thick. It&#x27;s flat kind of like a foundation brush, and it&#x27;s retractable. I think it&#x27;s far too stiff to be used to apply powder, and far too small to be used for powder all over the face. The shape also isn&#x27;t convenient for its purpose. Also, because it&#x27;s retractable, if you press very hard with it, the brush goes back into its casing. It&#x27;s synthetic, so you can&#x27;t really soften it that much. My suggestion is that you use your own brush to apply it, like maybe a kabuki or blush brush, or whatever you like to apply powder with. Not too big, though, since that will make the powder even messier. Maybe about 1 1/2 inch diameter for the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the brush and slight mess, though, I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cool on my skin, but it sucks at setting. My covergirl setting powder worked a lot better. I Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love putting this over my liquid foundation. It mattes it and I have naturally oily skin so it does a nice job setting your foundation and keeping making it so my oily skin is not a shiney</li>
            <li> Love this powder!!! I hit 30 and my once oily skin dried. Poweder would flame or lay in lines under my eyes. This doesn&#x27;t do that! The transulsent is better than the pigmited ones. Feel cool and smoothing when brushed on. I can&#x27;t comment on the brush it comes with I never use it I use my own big powder brush.</li>
            <li> Not a good product for darker skin. Doesn&#x27;t blend well at all and it&#x27;s very cakey over liquid makeup. Overall terrible Revlon is awful</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works great. I usually use makeup forever&#x27;s HD powder, and like this just as much and you get a lot more for less money</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  They no longer sell it in stores where I am, so thank goodness I am able to buy it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on with this cool, creamy feeling that is so soothing.  And it makes your skin look dewy, smooth, and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People never think I am wearing any makeup when I use this product.  It is wonderful!  It really is.  Of all the translucent powders I have tried, this is my favourite.</li>
            <li> I love it  I put over make up and it sets it all day, it feels soft and baby fresh..but keeps make up on and professional.</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong item, and when I wrote the seller, they said they&#x27;d pay to ship it back and send me a replacement. When the label was (i presume) lost in the mail and I complained, they promptly refunded me for the cost of the item and original shipping cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I didn&#x27;t receive this color (or lack or color), but I did try it out to see how it compared to the reviews. Unlike other, I thought the brush was well suited to the product. It is not meant to be dusted on, with the brush, it is pushed into your skin and doesn&#x27;t catch in your peach fuzz and stay visible, which was the reason I ordered the translucent, but honestly, I don&#x27;t think a well matched tinted powder would show either - unlike a typical dry powder. It does feel wet going on, but once it&#x27;s on the effect goes away. If you don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s short lived. The benefit I see over my go-to translucent hi-def powder is that this will set without taking away as much of the dewy look.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to try expecting not to like it. Previously I was using a finishing powder which was much more expensive. And guess what? I absolutely love it! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is a small brush that comes with it. I use a large brush and blend it over my entire face except for my eyes.  I then put on my eyeshadow and liner. Then with a clean mascara wand I brush this powder over my eyelashes. Then I use my mascara. You can repeat the process if you want. It gives my skimpy lashes a lot more length and fullness!  This will definitely be my go to finishing powder! And as an added bonus it gives me some eyelashes!</li>
            <li> My favorite drugstore powder, has a nice finish.</li>
            <li> This is a nice translucent powder. I have fair skin. I don&#x27;t like powders that make me look more pale than I already am. I also don&#x27;t like powders that give me an orangey/tan color (looks too fake). This is just right. It does go on feeling wet, which is so odd! But it only lasts for a fraction of a second. Covers nicely</li>
