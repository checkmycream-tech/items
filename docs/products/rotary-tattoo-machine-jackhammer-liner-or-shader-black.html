            <li>and i dont think i&#x27;ve see nary a single drop of blood, maybe a single tear of joy from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definately recomend this item, i like it way better than the traditional coil machines, as i am a beginner at this, but its way more consistent and less hassel...</li>
            <li>an the people at the company work hard to make sure your happy runs strong and hits hard not much for a liner but</li>
            <li>I love this gun, I have had it for probably 3 months and have done 8 long tattoos with only this gun.</li>
            <li>Just got my new machine.</li>
            <li>but now it seems like a solid machine, hit hard and runs good at a low voltage, worth the money just use a little locktite before running it,</li>

            <li> Do not buy these!! They don&#x27;t work at all they didn&#x27;t even through one tattoo. They just don&#x27;t run right.</li>
            <li> I definately recomend this item, i like it way better than the traditional coil machines, as i am a beginner at this, but its way more consistent and less hassel...jackhammer swashdrive is a great machine...</li>
            <li> Very clean liner. Very quiet Machine. I probably will buy a couple more.</li>
            <li> Love it had to try it right away. Light weight quite shipping was fast.I have bought from you before love your products. Will definitely by more in the future. As described. Priced right.</li>
            <li> Just got my new machine. The only thing that was wrong with it was the screw that holds the tube was bent and cross threaded (cheap aluminum) but I had an extra, better quality, one and replaced it. Quiet and seems like it runs nice. Havnt done any work with it yet tho so we will see</li>
            <li> Super nice for the price, although its generic, first time I ran it screws fell out so I used lock tire and titended them down, haven&#x27;t tattooed yet with it but now it seems like a solid machine, hit hard and runs good at a low voltage, worth the money just use a little locktite before running it, f*ck yes!!!</li>
            <li> This machine worked okay for the first bit of the first session I used it. Then it all went to crap, the lines it layed were s***. If you are looking to try a rotary machine you may want to skip over this one. From now on I&#x27;m staying loyal to the coil!!!!!</li>
            <li> Really loving my new jack hammer rotary. Can&#x27;t wait to get to inking...</li>
            <li> Great little machine I really like mine an the people at the company work hard to make sure your happy runs strong and hits hard not much for a liner but great for solid black work fills and shade really nice I&#x27;ve used mine for about 10 hours now and so fare so good</li>
            <li> This was the machine I ordered but WAS NOT the machine that I have receive in the mail.</li>
            <li> I purchased this machine for my husband and he couldnt even use it due to it being put together incorrectly.</li>
            <li> Seems pretty good so far. Def worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good buy I&#x27;m glad I got this one too cause the other one I bought from Amazon broke before I used it</li>
            <li> That gun broke the same day I got it</li>
            <li> Still Using It Works Like A Charm</li>
            <li> This machine, even as a knock-off, is a charm.  You can tattoo with this gem all day and you would still feel like a thousand bucks afterwards.  So light too.  And the sweet, humdrum sound that is almost nonexistant.  I eventually bought a 2nd one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tattoed a client with this machine numerously and i dont think i&#x27;ve see nary a single drop of blood, maybe a single tear of joy from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Beware of this machine, it hits hard and would be no problem eating throiugh someones skin if you didint know what you were doing. What i use it for it works wonders... for touch-ups, structuring lines and in some cases color packing (not always) But its a damn good design and it lines well</li>
            <li> This machine runs good and tattoos well. I like the fact of lightweight and no headaches of endless tuning like on coils</li>
            <li> Ive only owned this gun for a short period of time and used it in 3 short sessions and the gun already broke so im very unhappy with this product and will not reccomend this machine to anyone.. Now i need to purchase another machine so i can get back into putting down some ink.. Thanku</li>
            <li> I love this gun, I have had it for probably 3 months and have done 8 long tattoos with only this gun. I had order 3 other guns ( not this one) that didn&#x27;t work so I figured this one being cheap wouldn&#x27;t work either. This gun blew me away. I would recommend this to any tattoo artist.</li>
            <li> First rotary gun I&#x27;ve owned and can&#x27;t see why I never purchased sooner. High quality and great price...</li>
            <li> Love my machine it works great no problems very good buy. Delivery was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast,  haven&#x27;t used it yet but i did hook it up an like how quite an smooth sounding it is. Also able to run on a much lower voltage than my coil machines</li>
