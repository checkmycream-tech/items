    <ol>
            <li>Hopefully they keep making this, best stuff I&#x27;ve used in awhile.</li>
            <li>A great buy too!  </li>
            <li>Im not too impressed with the results</li>
            <li>Great news!  </li>
            <li>Excellent value for price and results.</li>
            <li>I came across this product about a year ago by the recommendation of a co-worker, and it IS as great as they said!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with all the Azfasst products and have recommended them to my friends.</li>
            <li>I love Azfasst !!!</li>
            <li>I wish I hadn&#x27;t stopped this product is wonderful for the skin and since I have started using it again I can a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li>Azfasst has done a great job minimizing age/dark spots, and an incredible job minimizing pore size (which had been visible throughout my teens and into adulthood.)  </li>
            <li>great product</li>
            <li>Great value for the price</li>
            <li>Azfasst is a really great product.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product that has fantastic results!  </li>
            <li>I rapidly realized that my face felt rougher and did not look nearly as good.  </li>
            <li>And my skin feels so good.</li>
            <li>But, the price is good and it does tighten up my skin.</li>
            <li>Ordering more today!</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m grateful for the $20 price because like the majority....</li>
            <li>But I am impressed so far.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what it was doing for my face</li>
            <li>Some improvement, hope to see more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 36 yo guy who has dealt with acne most of his life.   </li>
            <li>Give it a try, I&#x27;m ordering a couple more bottles tonight.  </li>
            <li>I love how Azfasst make my skin feel...clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Overall I will say I am very happy with this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve expect a bit more.</li>
            <li>but my face fels so much better already.  </li>
            <li>Would probably not purchase this product again unless I see better results in the weeks to come.</li>
            <li>hehe :)</li>
            <li>It seemed more like putting egg whites on my face.  </li>
            <li>I guess because it my skin looked so much better</li>
            <li>But it has also started adding a nice \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my skin (not oily glow - just a clean, healthy glow).</li>
            <li>I love that it is fragrance free too.  </li>
            <li>Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s easy search.</li>
            <li>This product absorbs into your skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but they are very mild.</li>
            <li>I am an older woman with skin that is still in good condition.</li>
            <li>I ordered two to get free shipping.</li>
            <li>So I have had to stick with using just a mild mild mild soap and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Azfasst is affordable for me, very simple to use, and I do get results that I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
            <li>I even had to buy another bottle because my husband liked it so much he used all of mine.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter is also using it with great results - way fewer breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and that little bottle lasts months!  </li>
            <li>I have bought many items from Amazon for many years and never before had a problem, but the fact that I was ignored when I did makes me more cautious about future purchases.</li>
            <li>i have high hopes! :)</li>
            <li>It leaves no oily or greasy feeling on the skin and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I do still have a mild breakout every now</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and less oily throughout the day, and sun damage is greatly faded.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it is light weight and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>I can see a big difference on both of my cheeks after two days of use, and I can feel the difference when I touch my face with my own fingers.  </li>
            <li>This will sound like a commercial but my husband noticed how much better</li>
            <li>thats what makes it so economical.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I liked the ingredients that are in it, and I liked that it was thin, not oily, and soaked in rather quickly.</li>
            <li>In this day and age when elite skincare products can cost upwards of $75.00 or more, and often need to be purchased as a line of products, Azfasst is a true bargain and amazingly simple to use.      </li>
            <li>At the three month mark, I still have half a bottle left, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.    </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend following the directions for using moisturizers as I experienced that it has a drying effect on my skin type when used alone.</li>
            <li>The main reason I don&#x27;t give it a higher rating is that the bottle leaked during shipment so the bottle wasn&#x27;t full &amp;</li>
            <li>I does exactly what it says....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Saw this on a local TV show and decided I would fork out more money and try it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Where I work, it is always hot.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s not a \\&quot;face product\\&quot; guy, but he really loves this product!</li>
            <li>Azfasst really works on adult acne and it is strong so use aparingly</li>
            <li>I discontinued use and after going back to my old skin care routine, my face is much much better!  </li>
            <li>I have to question some of these positive reviews.</li>
            <li>My experience wasn&#x27;t at all positive.  </li>
            <li>While I do not normally wear makeup on a daily basis, when I do apply it, I like the way it goes on  easily and finishes with a smoother, more balanced look thanks to reduced pore size and softer skin!    </li>
            <li>I am surprised at how quick I can see and feel this product is working on my face......</li>
            <li>clearer, smoother, skin FAST.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything, 1/2 a bottle in and this stuff is working very well.   </li>
            <li>Yes, it doesn&#x27;t take much to use each time, but for 20 bucks....</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>or it will peel you to fast, but</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product to clear up my adult acne and deal with my oily skin.</li>
            <li>Also you don&#x27;t have to use much, it covers entire fast really well with a pea size drop or so.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will continue to use it, although I&#x27;m not sure I can tell much of a result.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it has DEFINITELY cut down on my face getting so oily when I am at work.</li>
            <li>And my face has not had its normal break out from using a new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well like they say live and learn.</li>
            <li>THIS stuff is absolutely amazing, and you only need a little pea-sized drop that spreads evenly on your entire face.  </li>
            <li>AND BEFORE APPLYING MAKE UP BECAUSE IT HELPS TO CLEAR ACNE, DRYS OIL AND REFRESHES SKIN.</li>
            <li>So far the product seems to be working for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I am most upset by the fact that Amazon fulfilled the order &amp; has yet to respond to my complaint over this matter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48 years old, and while I will never have a completely balanced skin tone (freckles, uggggg)</li>
            <li>My personal advise is, save your money and find something that really works.</li>
            <li>My age/sun/dark spots gradually began to fade with further use, most are now barely noticeable, a few are stubborn!</li>
            <li>The very first time I put it on my cheeks, I felt a little bit of discomfort.  </li>
            <li>It is my new and only skin care product.  </li>
            <li>So, I hurried back to order my new bottle, even though I couldn&#x27;t remember the name of it.  </li>
            <li>I live in the St. Louis area and found out about it when a local TV station did a segment on it.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my blotchy skin and prevented the occasional middle age breakout.  </li>
            <li>I am giving it a try &amp; so far (2nd day)</li>
            <li>so I went back to my old product.  </li>
            <li>$60-$80 a year is MUCH cheaper than some of the other products that are out there (ie retin-a).</li>
            <li>My acne has cleared up, my face isn&#x27;t dry, my pores are smaller, my face glows, I don&#x27;t have to wear so much makeup, and I feel like I have my younger complexion back again.  </li>
            <li>After the first few uses, I felt a difference in my skin - softer texture, and pore size shrunk dramatically.  </li>
            <li>and I am a little bit scared too:), unbelievable experience and product.      </li>
            <li>I still have a pimple or 2 every once in awhile, but it keeping my skin clear and not near as red.   </li>

            <li> I still have a pimple or 2 every once in awhile, but it keeping my skin clear and not near as red.   </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and constantly powder my face all day long.</li>
            <li> can not speak about long term yet.</li>
            <li> BUT-I have noticed that it really helps with discolorations due to past breakouts or scars.</li>
            <li> I use this in between my chemical peels and fIine that it does dry my skin out a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Azfasst Green Tea Facial Gel for about two years now, religiously.  </li>
            <li> Once I have used it for several weeks, I will cut down to just once a day.</li>
            <li> All of them dry my face out - which, in turn, makes my skin put out oil with a vengeance!</li>
            <li> I simply cannot spend hundreds of dollars on a product line that has to be re-purchased every few months, or even monthly.  </li>
            <li> But a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> On my 2nd day of use, that discomfort feeling wasn&#x27;t as bad as the first day, and then my daughter had noticed my shining cheeks too.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that it cuts the oil down, because I still find myself blotting or powdering my face.</li>
            <li> After a week of using as directed, my face was broken out worse than normal and red and burning.</li>
            <li> My results began to be visible in less than a month, specifically my skin tone is clearer and brighter and my enlarged pores are minimized which is the result I wanted.</li>
            <li> previously I thought I didn&#x27;t need it anymore.</li>

            <li> I was almost embarrassed when i saw the size of the bottle b/c i almost always check the size/measurements of things but drop the ball on this one!!   It is a like a trail size 8oz bottle for $20. My hubby would flip out if he knew!   I am giving it a try &amp; so far (2nd day) i&#x27;ve noticed my skin is a lil smoother- i have high hopes! :)</li>
            <li> Yes. I&#x27;m checking it out again. Haven&#x27;t used it for a couple years.</li>
            <li> I can see a big difference on both of my cheeks after two days of use, and I can feel the difference when I touch my face with my own fingers.  The very first time I put it on my cheeks, I felt a little bit of discomfort.  On my 2nd day of use, that discomfort feeling wasn&#x27;t as bad as the first day, and then my daughter had noticed my shining cheeks too.    I am surprised at how quick I can see and feel this product is working on my face......and I am a little bit scared too:), unbelievable experience and product.      My mom is using it now.</li>
            <li> You will not believe your skin after a couple of weeks!  I does exactly what it says....clearer, smoother, skin FAST.  I love that it is fragrance free too.  It is my new and only skin care product.  You must try this!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does all that it says.  It dries instantly and you can see and feel instant results. This will sound like a commercial but my husband noticed how much better my complextion has been looking lately,that alone makes it a winner. Try this product  you will not be disappointed.  I love Azfasst !!!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. I wasn&#x27;t sure what it was doing for my face so I went back to my old product.  I rapidly realized that my face felt rougher and did not look nearly as good.  So, I hurried back to order my new bottle, even though I couldn&#x27;t remember the name of it.  Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s easy search.</li>
            <li> So far the product seems to be working for my daughter. Some improvement, hope to see more. The main reason I don&#x27;t give it a higher rating is that the bottle leaked during shipment so the bottle wasn&#x27;t full &amp; the book I ordered with it had damage to the back of it from the acid in the product. I am most upset by the fact that Amazon fulfilled the order &amp; has yet to respond to my complaint over this matter. I have bought many items from Amazon for many years and never before had a problem, but the fact that I was ignored when I did makes me more cautious about future purchases.</li>
            <li> This product absorbs into your skin very quickly.  It makes your skin smoother and definitely makes your pores smaller.  great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 36 yo guy who has dealt with acne most of his life.   I have tried everything, 1/2 a bottle in and this stuff is working very well.   I still have a pimple or 2 every once in awhile, but it keeping my skin clear and not near as red.   Buy a bottle and give it a shot.  I like it because it is light weight and dries fast.  Also you don&#x27;t have to use much, it covers entire fast really well with a pea size drop or so.   Give it a try, I&#x27;m ordering a couple more bottles tonight.  Hopefully they keep making this, best stuff I&#x27;ve used in awhile.</li>
            <li> I love how Azfasst make my skin feel...clean and healthy.  I now use this in place of moisturizer and primer.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that has fantastic results!  It leaves no oily or greasy feeling on the skin and absorbs quickly. I could notice a difference immediately and my skin feels smoother and looks healthier.  A great buy too!  One bottle that I use twice a day has lasted me almost 3 months!</li>
            <li> LIKE TP USE  THE PRODUCT AFTER CLEANSING AND BEFORE APPLYING MAKE UP BECAUSE IT HELPS TO CLEAR ACNE, DRYS OIL AND REFRESHES SKIN.</li>
            <li> I just received my Azfasst today in the mail and I was quite shocked at how small the size is. I ordered two to get free shipping. I&#x27;m hoping it works otherwise I will feel like I just wasted $40.</li>
            <li> Not the biggest bottle for 20 dollars. Im not too impressed with the results but I guess it has helped a litle bit.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am a pharmacist and I have tried all kinds of products on my face. All of them dry my face out - which, in turn, makes my skin put out oil with a vengeance! And that makes my face break out even worse. So I have had to stick with using just a mild mild mild soap and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw this on a local TV show and decided I would fork out more money and try it. I liked the ingredients that are in it, and I liked that it was thin, not oily, and soaked in rather quickly. Also I like that I can put it on and then apply my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I work, it is always hot. I am on my feet from 8 to 12 hours a day. I never stop moving. After I am there for about an hour or so, my face is already shiny. I hate that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for 5 days now and I can honestly say it has DEFINITELY cut down on my face getting so oily when I am at work. If that is all it ever does, I will continue to buy it. But it has also started adding a nice \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my skin (not oily glow - just a clean, healthy glow). And my skin feels so good. I feel it getting a bit tighter. And the surface of my skin has definitely improved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not speak about long term yet. But I am impressed so far. And my face has not had its normal break out from using a new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product twice a day for now. Once I have used it for several weeks, I will cut down to just once a day. Overall I will say I am very happy with this product and would recommend it. The bottle is small. But a little goes a long way. I would suspect it will last me 3-4 months. $60-$80 a year is MUCH cheaper than some of the other products that are out there (ie retin-a). And yes, I tried retin-a. Even at the lowest strength, it made my face break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing works for everyone. But if my story sounds similar to yours, maybe you should try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to mention some of what I have tried:&lt;br /&gt;Retin-A&lt;br /&gt;Retin-A Micro&lt;br /&gt;All kinds of benzoyl peroxide products&lt;br /&gt;Differin gel&lt;br /&gt;Cleocin topical&lt;br /&gt;multiple oral prescription medications&lt;br /&gt;Dozens of salicylic acid products&lt;br /&gt;Tons of over-the-counter acne products&lt;br /&gt;Benzaclin gel&lt;br /&gt;Proactive&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is just to name a few.l  multiple oral prescription medications  Dozens of salicylic acid products  Tons of over-the-counter acne products  Benzaclin gel  Proactive  Witch Hazel    And that is just to name a few.</li>
            <li> Great news!  The Azfasst facial gel product works as advertised.  I saw the physician who created the product on a local TV morning show and decided to try it because it was advertised for all skin types.  I am African American.       I have used only about a fourth of the bottle and I only use it once a day. I use a pea size amount as I read in one of the reviews. The product distributes well.  I apply to face and neck.       My results began to be visible in less than a month, specifically my skin tone is clearer and brighter and my enlarged pores are minimized which is the result I wanted. I expect the results to continue as I use the product.       I definitely recommend following the directions for using moisturizers as I experienced that it has a drying effect on my skin type when used alone. Read all of the Q&amp;A on the web site for the specifics.  Excellent value for price and results.</li>
            <li> I use this in between my chemical peels and fIine that it does dry my skin out a bit. Between my nose and forehead. I have used two bottles now. I&#x27;m sure I will continue to use it, although I&#x27;m not sure I can tell much of a result. But, the price is good and it does tighten up my skin. I have little sun damage and some spots have faded. Just not sure? May need to use this product longer.</li>
            <li> PROS:  Gel formula, 3% Salicylic Acid&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  Felt like using hand sanitizer on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by my dermatologist, it was a waste both time and money for me.</li>
            <li> In this day and age when elite skincare products can cost upwards of $75.00 or more, and often need to be purchased as a line of products, Azfasst is a true bargain and amazingly simple to use.      I purchased the product in Feb. 2011 after seeing it numerous times on a local TV station, and waited to review until I used it for three months (once daily).  At the three month mark, I still have half a bottle left, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.    I&#x27;m 48 years old, and while I will never have a completely balanced skin tone (freckles, uggggg) Azfasst has done a great job minimizing age/dark spots, and an incredible job minimizing pore size (which had been visible throughout my teens and into adulthood.)  I use the product once nightly after cleansing, and apply to my entire face, then moisturize.  After the first few uses, I felt a difference in my skin - softer texture, and pore size shrunk dramatically.  My age/sun/dark spots gradually began to fade with further use, most are now barely noticeable, a few are stubborn! (and again, I have those darn freckles that won&#x27;t go away no matter what).    While I do not normally wear makeup on a daily basis, when I do apply it, I like the way it goes on  easily and finishes with a smoother, more balanced look thanks to reduced pore size and softer skin!    To be honest, I&#x27;m grateful for the $20 price because like the majority....I simply cannot spend hundreds of dollars on a product line that has to be re-purchased every few months, or even monthly.  Azfasst is affordable for me, very simple to use, and I do get results that I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product to clear up my adult acne and deal with my oily skin. After a week of using as directed, my face was broken out worse than normal and red and burning. I discontinued use and after going back to my old skin care routine, my face is much much better!  There&#x27;s a couple of other negatives that I&#x27;d like to point out; one is, that this is a very small bottle for the price. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t take much to use each time, but for 20 bucks....I would&#x27;ve expect a bit more. The consistency of the gel is like smearing hand sanitizer on your face....it even smells like hand sanitizer!   I have to question some of these positive reviews. My experience wasn&#x27;t at all positive.  My personal advise is, save your money and find something that really works.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I came across this product about a year ago by the recommendation of a co-worker, and it IS as great as they said! My pores appear smaller, which minimizes the oily look I&#x27;m constantly fighting. I even had to buy another bottle because my husband liked it so much he used all of mine. He&#x27;s not a \\&quot;face product\\&quot; guy, but he really loves this product! My only issue is that I can&#x27;t seem to use it on my forehead without breaking out. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am an older woman with skin that is still in good condition. I really like this product. It smooths my skin and does tighten it. I use it with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this for about 2 weeks but my face fels so much better already.  Great value for the price</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a month.  See no significant difference. Would probably not purchase this product again unless I see better results in the weeks to come.</li>
            <li> Azfasst is a really great product. I live in the St. Louis area and found out about it when a local TV station did a segment on it. I have oily skin and constantly powder my face all day long. I use Azfasst as a toner-right after my cleanser, and before my acne medication. I haven&#x27;t noticed that it cuts the oil down, because I still find myself blotting or powdering my face. BUT-I have noticed that it really helps with discolorations due to past breakouts or scars. I do still have a mild breakout every now and then (maybe once a month) but they are very mild. In it&#x27;s defense, I don&#x27;t use it every day. I do swap it out with my department-store toner, which I refuse to get rid of! But this stuff cannot be beat for the money!!</li>
            <li> Azfasst really works on adult acne and it is strong so use aparingly or it will peel you to fast, but thats what makes it so economical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Azfasst Green Tea Facial Gel for about two years now, religiously.  I had acquired horrible adult acne (never had it when i was a teenager, so needless to say I was flipping out). I have tried everything from store-bought products to the ones you see on infomercials or now regular commercials.  All of them either made me break out more or dried my face out horribly.  And they were all ungodly expensive!  THIS stuff is absolutely amazing, and you only need a little pea-sized drop that spreads evenly on your entire face.  It&#x27;s wonderful and that little bottle lasts months!  My acne has cleared up, my face isn&#x27;t dry, my pores are smaller, my face glows, I don&#x27;t have to wear so much makeup, and I feel like I have my younger complexion back again.  If I ever met the dermatologist who invented this, I will probably cry and hug her. hehe :)</li>
            <li> It seemed more like putting egg whites on my face.  It just didn&#x27;t change anything for me.  I used daily.</li>
            <li> I have been using Azfasst for about two years and my skin feels tighter. It looks and feels softer and smoother. I&#x27;m very happy with all the Azfasst products and have recommended them to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product of a couple of years and then stopped. I wish I hadn&#x27;t stopped this product is wonderful for the skin and since I have started using it again I can a remarkable difference.I won&#x27;t stop using it again. I guess because it my skin looked so much better previously I thought I didn&#x27;t need it anymore. Well like they say live and learn.This is definately a must have in skin routine.</li>
            <li> Saw this on a morning show and decided to try it.  I have been using it for about a year.  It has really helped my blotchy skin and prevented the occasional middle age breakout.  My skin is smoother and less oily throughout the day, and sun damage is greatly faded.  My teenage daughter is also using it with great results - way fewer breakouts.  Both of us saw results after about 3-4 weeks of use.  Yes, the bottles are small but one bottle lasts about 4 months with once a day use. Ordering more today!</li>
