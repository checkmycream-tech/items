            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m washing my hands many times.</li>
            <li>This product stay on longer than most.</li>
            <li>have bought many tubes of this product, its well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I prefer the Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Hand Cream, but I&#x27;m still on the lookout for the end-all-be-all yet still reasonably-priced hand lotion.</li>
            <li>I was happy I purchased it last night</li>
            <li>This product works for me &amp; keeps hands &amp; nails smooth &amp; supple, but it began disappearing from store shelves.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it after using, and liking, the Curel Original Lotion.</li>
            <li>a great product for dry hands (and feet).</li>
            <li>I keep a tube with me at all times, &amp; find it is GREAT for rough elbows as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really does work better than all the creams that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like most hand lotions because either they have too much fragrance</li>
            <li>Neither holds true for this one.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hand  and body lotions that I use, but this one by far is the best one for my dry hands.</li>
            <li>It is pretty cheap and over the counter and moisturizers your hands without leaving them greasy.</li>
            <li>I buy as many as I can find of the old one.</li>
            <li>Curel is the only handcream that keeps my hands and cuticles healthy.</li>
            <li>This is first rate hand cream.</li>
            <li>This cream smells faintly of roses to me, and I find it very pleasant.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best hand lotion I&#x27;ve bought in a drugstore or paid less than $10.00 for from a drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a better hand lotion to help me deal with my dry hands and fingertips.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, made my cuticles soft and has virtually stopped hangnails.</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my Mom as she says it really helps her cuticles and nails</li>
            <li>my hands are much smoother.</li>
            <li>I will keep an eye out for a product that really does absorb, rather than coat my hands.</li>
            <li>This cream really soaks into your hands and doesn&#x27;t leave them greasy.  </li>
            <li>This cream is rich enough to moisturize but isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>Basic, clean smell</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hand feeling silky smooth without the greasy aftermath like other creams.  </li>
            <li>I live in the Northeast</li>
            <li>I have used the old version of this for a few years and it is much better than the new one.  </li>
            <li>nails are back to a healthy status (no chipping) and my knuckles are no longer raw.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, hard to find lately.</li>
            <li>Got this for my mom for mother&#x27;s day because she said her hands&#x27; always dry and this really helped.</li>
            <li>Her cuticles and nails started getting in rough shape after a few days without it, so I hurried and purchased her some more.</li>
            <li>Wife swears by this product and uses no other</li>
            <li>This cream really helps to keep them soft and within only two days, (cream applied once a day), the dry skin was repaired.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well into your skin with no greasy feeling, just softness, and even keeps your skin soft after multiple hand washing.</li>
            <li>I normally have dry, cracking hands and cuticles in the winter time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even open a door knob unless I wipe the palms of my hands off, and I barely use any--just a pea sized amount.</li>

            <li> What a relief for dry hands.....</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and give it in gifts around Christmas because it really keeps your hands well-moisturized in cold climes or even if you wash your hands frequently (a must during cold and flu season).</li>
            <li> The previous tube she purchased at a local chain store but they no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li> Product as expected.  </li>
            <li> and we are not able to find it at local retailers.  </li>

            <li> It absorbs slower into the skin than other lotions I&#x27;ve tried and after using it I leave greasy fingerprints all over everything for a little while.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced a hand cream that works so well, lasts so long, and not even smell bad.</li>
            <li> one tube is broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse &amp; have the worst of ravaged, dry, raw hands.</li>
            <li> This one was mediocre.</li>
            <li> were it gets a windy and cold.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad stock, but this makes my hands feel sticky for a looooong time afterwards.</li>
            <li> The worst part for me is that it gives my  hands a waxy coating feeling.</li>
            <li> but this time is terrible.</li>

            <li> Curel is the only handcream that keeps my hands and cuticles healthy. No hang nails or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I found this at my local grocery store (Reasor&#x27;s). I&#x27;m always looking for a better hand lotion to help me deal with my dry hands and fingertips. This one was mediocre. The worst part for me is that it gives my  hands a waxy coating feeling. It absorbs slower into the skin than other lotions I&#x27;ve tried and after using it I leave greasy fingerprints all over everything for a little while.  I prefer the Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Hand Cream, but I&#x27;m still on the lookout for the end-all-be-all yet still reasonably-priced hand lotion.</li>
            <li> a great product for dry hands (and feet).</li>
            <li> last time Feb 11 i ordered this hand cream was very good. but this time is terrible. when i received the package. one tube is broken. the cream totally leak out. also the cream smell not like the the one i ordered on Feb 11.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, hard to find lately.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST LOTION. LEAVES HANDS SOFT AND SINKS INTO SKIN VERY WELL. STAYS ON AFTER HAND WASHING. WILL KEEP PURCHASING.</li>
            <li> this hand cream works better than most that I have tried. I decided to try it after using, and liking, the Curel Original Lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is the best of its kind and we are not able to find it at local retailers.  Thus, we searched for it on the internet and found this source.  We use it regularly, even on feet, and it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! It is so good!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Mom as she says it really helps her cuticles and nails: she ran out of it a week ago. The previous tube she purchased at a local chain store but they no longer carry it.  Her cuticles and nails started getting in rough shape after a few days without it, so I hurried and purchased her some more. I was happy I purchased it last night and she received it today!</li>
            <li> I have tried many hand creams over the years but this is the best one out there.  It leaves your hand feeling silky smooth without the greasy aftermath like other creams.  I use this product daily and don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.  Cannot wait to try the foot cream!</li>
            <li> Favorite lotion at an incredible value!</li>
            <li> This is the best hand lotion I have ever experienced. I will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy, not slimy, lasts all day, inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Product as expected.  No problems.</li>
            <li> I just love this Hand and Cuticle Cream. I used to find this in my local drug store all the time. Then I couldn&#x27;t find it any where locally. I have a lot of hand  and body lotions that I use, but this one by far is the best one for my dry hands. Again Amazon has come through for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse &amp; have the worst of ravaged, dry, raw hands. This product works for me &amp; keeps hands &amp; nails smooth &amp; supple, but it began disappearing from store shelves. I was really happy to see it on Amazon, thrilled actually!&lt;br /&gt;My nails are back to a healthy status (no chipping) and my knuckles are no longer raw. I keep a tube with me at all times, &amp; find it is GREAT for rough elbows as well.&lt;br /&gt;I hope to continue seeing it on Amazon, great product!</li>
            <li> My hands are always dry and cracked, so I needed something. What sold me on this is it stated it&#x27;s not greasy. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad stock, but this makes my hands feel sticky for a looooong time afterwards. I can&#x27;t even open a door knob unless I wipe the palms of my hands off, and I barely use any--just a pea sized amount. Otherwise, I think it works great.. my hands are much smoother. Does leave them feeling waxy until it wears off. I will keep an eye out for a product that really does absorb, rather than coat my hands.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This cream really soaks into your hands and doesn&#x27;t leave them greasy.  It also lasts for a few hand-washings.  All it needs now is some SPF.</li>
            <li> I have used the old version of this for a few years and it is much better than the new one.  I buy as many as I can find of the old one.</li>
            <li> Wife swears by this product and uses no other</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is a dermatologist and she recommends this hand cream to all her patients. It is pretty cheap and over the counter and moisturizers your hands without leaving them greasy. Basic, clean smell</li>
            <li> A quality product in my book!  What a relief for dry hands.....good moisture and the protection lasts!&lt;br /&gt;I have bought many tubes of this product, its well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Works! I normally have dry, cracking hands and cuticles in the winter time. Not this year. I live in the Northeast were it gets a windy and cold. I love it. I usually put it on two times a day. It works that well.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells, and usually use fragrance-free products. This cream smells faintly of roses to me, and I find it very pleasant. It does seem to moisturize effectively as well.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had the worst, coldest winter that I can ever remember, along with frequent hand washing, my hands are always dry.  This cream is rich enough to moisturize but isn&#x27;t greasy.  The scent is very pleasant and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always washing my hands and the harsh winter makes my knuckles and fingertips dry and crack. This cream really helps to keep them soft and within only two days, (cream applied once a day), the dry skin was repaired. It absorbs well into your skin with no greasy feeling, just softness, and even keeps your skin soft after multiple hand washing. It really does work better than all the creams that I&#x27;ve tried. It is unscented so it doesn&#x27;t make everything you touch smell like perfume. I recommend this for anyone with dry skin for in instant repair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced a hand cream that works so well, lasts so long, and not even smell bad. And just as the label states, this is excellent therapy for the cuticles. This is first rate hand cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like most hand lotions because either they have too much fragrance or they leave my hands too greasy.  Neither holds true for this one.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It is the best location I have ever used for my hands.  It absorbs quickly, made my cuticles soft and has virtually stopped hangnails.</li>
            <li> I have tried 100s of products and this is the only one that truly works.  I highly recommend this product.  Shipping was fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom for mother&#x27;s day because she said her hands&#x27; always dry and this really helped.</li>

            <li> This product is most excellent. I&#x27;m washing my hands many times. This product stay on longer than most. Walmart had the product 1 time then never restocked. Thank goodness there is Amazon</li>
