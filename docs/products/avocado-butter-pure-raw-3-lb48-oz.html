            <li>Glad I got the 3lb tub.</li>
            <li>Think grainy margarine (sounds gross, I know, but this stuff&#x27;s just way too awesome).</li>

            <li>love this stuff</li>
            <li>BUTTER IS SMOOTH AND MELTS VERY EASILY ON THE SKIN.</li>
            <li>Item was shipped quickly and in a tidy plastic jar.</li>
            <li>but it was a good read loved it and would look for similar</li>
            <li>This one spreads easily.</li>
            <li>No odor, doesn&#x27;t discolor soap, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>it melts easy into the skin when applied</li>
            <li>, also it does not have a strong odor to it which I like that about this product.</li>
            <li>I will purchase again as this will always be a HUGE staple of mine.</li>
            <li>Pretty much odorless and very smooth and has a nice melt to it.  </li>
            <li>This is such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>it is such a phenomenal product and has excellent and multiple benefits for skin and hair.</li>
            <li>just happen to be browsing looking for more products to try on my hair ;-) and viola&#x27; ...</li>
            <li>I use it all the time for a general moisturizer &amp; the price is good.  </li>
            <li>Its a really great moisturizer for dry winter skin and hair.</li>
            <li>More oily than I expected, but needed a good moisturizer for the skin.</li>
            <li>IT IS ALSO GREAT FOR DRY DAMAGED HAIR…</li>
            <li>I had bought one before I got this one, the one I got before was easy to scoop out, my spatula sliced right through it with no problem.</li>
            <li>I will be down to 3 or 4 at the most now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, great on my skin and nails- not too greasy, you can get dressed right away.</li>
            <li>This butter is amazing for natural hair woman that have used bleach it protects and moisturizes the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>Delivery was  quick, packaging was good and sealed properly.</li>
            <li>a naturalista.smell is mild.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M ALMOST 8 MONTHS PREGNANT &amp; HAVE USED THIS BUTTER</li>
            <li>I use avocado oil and love it but because it is messy in the shower I thought I&#x27;d try this after reading the good reviews (like to do my homework)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling super greasy...</li>
            <li>Unlike shea butter avocado butter is smooth and very gentle on hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I prefer to buy a fresh jar every so often.  </li>
            <li>BUT I DONT CARE; THE BENEFITS ARE WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>will say it is an extremely soft butter, more like a jellified oil (which it basically is, since it&#x27;s been dehydrated into a semi-solid), and it has a lot of &#x27;slip&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The butter inside on the first 1/2&amp;#34; layer was very soft &amp; wonderful, like firm vaseline texture.</li>
            <li>Naturalme4c on youtube was right about this!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, their packaging outshines the competition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this in CP soap for the past 6 months and it does make a very nice conditioning ingredient.  </li>
            <li>But underneath that first 1/2&amp;#34; layer, it changed into a very grainy sand paper like texture!</li>
            <li>I only purchase my avocado, illipe and mango butters from Dr Adorable.</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate the resealable tub!</li>
            <li>I will only order from Dr. adorable.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I decided to try avocado butter next.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!</li>
            <li>I love this butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it on the 3rd and received it the 6th.</li>
            <li>A more consistent quality and texture is very needed, and perhaps some new quality control measures or personnel is highly needed and appreciated.</li>
            <li>I only wish it had a pleasant feminine scent, the current smell is a soft natural oil scent which is OK.</li>
            <li>It is still smooth but a little courser than what is on the top of the tub.</li>
            <li>And leaves your skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>so I was secure that i was the first one to open it!</li>
            <li>The real test will be when the Summer rolls in ... will this still be the moisturizer of my choice ...</li>
            <li>This is real avocado butter.</li>
            <li>The is just my point, it doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything.  </li>
            <li>when I got this one it seems a lot more harder, to the point</li>
            <li>so make sure you be careful when opening it.</li>
            <li>But it is very buttery and creamy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot where i live</li>
            <li>Other than that I love this company.</li>
            <li>use!&lt;br /&gt;Avocado butter was recommended for dry hair and this really works well and melts right into my thirsty 4c natural chemical free hair.</li>
            <li>Beware the butter is thin, melted and filled to the top</li>
            <li>This product moisturized and soften my hair leaving it feeling like real natural</li>
            <li>Very creamy &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt so soft, my curl pattern came out and it was easy to detangle my hair (while wet of course).</li>
            <li>(I usually process below 90 degrees) because it thickens quickly when it starts to cool.  </li>
            <li>This butter is awesome..makes my hair very soft and managable as im</li>
            <li>this item came on time, the avocado butter, is very soft and moisturizing</li>
            <li>Then I rubbed some all over my body and my skin was shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>The process was a little drawn out to try to return it, but the company made it right by sending me a new batch, as the first one was completely unusable.</li>
            <li>Fortunately it was inside another plastic bag or there would have been quite a mess.  </li>
            <li>Easy to spread and can be mixed with other butters.  </li>
            <li>I ordered avocado butter years ago from another site and the difference is clear.</li>
            <li>Soft and buttery.</li>
            <li>HOURS LATER MY BELLY IS STILL VERY MOIST.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a firmer butter, this isn&#x27;t it, this is SUPREMELY soft stuff.</li>
            <li>I woke up this morning and my hair is so soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say it enough!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit slow to absorb, which is why it&#x27;s good for massage, and it&#x27;s not as messy as a straight liquefied oil.</li>
            <li>I am a return customer who has a very small happy little all natural company...</li>
            <li>I am a 3c/4a hair type which seems to be pretty dry!</li>
            <li>I have tried several products from Shea butter - which was too heavy and greasy for my hair and Coconut oil - which was way too light for my hair ...</li>
            <li>I had to use a spoon to dig to the bottom, it is that hard and began to bend it, to see if the under layer is smooth or grainy.</li>
            <li>a all natural AA female with type 4 hair.</li>
            <li>I did not realize how much moisture natural black hair required.</li>
            <li>That other seller claimed it was real avocado butter.</li>

            <li> The product is very moisturizing and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> So much for product support :/</li>
            <li> I was looking on amazon for different all natural butters to seal in the moisture in my hair when I stumbled across this little gem!  </li>
            <li> used an old Aveda pomade glass jar for everyday use and stored the rest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Since not much is needed the 3lb container will last a long time and I prefer not to have it that long.</li>
            <li> myself, I use it on painfully dry skin during the winter, and my feet whenever I&#x27;ve waited too long to get a pedicure, plus, this stuff&#x27;s a miracle on busted cuticles like I get from doing dishes</li>
            <li> i was looking for a butter for my mom who has really dry skin</li>
            <li> Very hard like wax, but at least it is smooth and not like sand mixed in.</li>
            <li> It melts beautifully into the skin and doesnt leave that nasty oily greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> at last no more ash my only.</li>
            <li> My only beef is that there&#x27;s little bits of harder stuff in it.</li>
            <li> That one left my hair with a thick, white waxy coat.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got very dry hair, this also helps, but remember: a little goes a very long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It mixes well with other products.</li>
            <li> Did not whip up like other butters</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon a definite \\&quot;keeper\\&quot; ( well for now, at least) to my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> I could just push my finger in and down to the bottom of the tub.</li>
            <li> I did the \\&quot;big chop\\&quot; back in Oct 2013 and needless to say</li>
            <li> I had previously used from Brambleberry.</li>
            <li> When I whipped it up as usual in my kitchenaid mixer, it would not whip forcing me to add other ingredients like shea and cocoa butter to make it firmer.</li>
            <li> My mom has bad psoriasis, and I mix this with neem/hops/marigold tinctures and cocoabutter into semi-hard discs, and it&#x27;s helped clear up and soften many of the thick, rough, painful patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too heavy on the hair.</li>
            <li> 3 LBS IS A LOT, BUT I USE IT EVERYDAY ON MY BELLY.</li>
            <li> The first tub I received, the tub was badly cracked all over/damaged.</li>
            <li> The small container is Prime supported anyway</li>
            <li> That one was waxy and hard.</li>
            <li> But the cracked tub was the least of the problem.</li>
            <li> complaint is i wish it came  with a scooper to help get the product out and a recipe book .</li>
            <li> - it is very hard and waxy and does NOT melt on the skin.</li>

            <li> Order was shipped without delay &amp; packaged well.&lt;br /&gt; Product is very good. I would buy it again although 3lbs is going to take a while to use!&lt;br /&gt;Avocado butter was recommended for dry hair and this really works well and melts right into my thirsty 4c natural chemical free hair. Naturalme4c on youtube was right about this!!!&lt;br /&gt;I find that it replaces most of my products. I will be down to 3 or 4 at the most now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, great on my skin and nails- not too greasy, you can get dressed right away. No scent at all which I love so it doesn&#x27;t compete with or distract from your perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only changes I would make is having a sturdy lid and add something to scoop product out.&lt;br /&gt;I used an old Aveda pomade glass jar for everyday use and stored the rest.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The first tub I received, the tub was badly cracked all over/damaged. That is obviously the shipping&#x27;s fault. But the cracked tub was the least of the problem. The butter inside on the first 1/2&amp;#34; layer was very soft &amp; wonderful, like firm vaseline texture. But underneath that first 1/2&amp;#34; layer, it changed into a very grainy sand paper like texture! The texture felt like someone mixed beach sand in it! It hurt my skin, and when used for my hair, just rinsed sandy stuff back onto my skin. The process was a little drawn out to try to return it, but the company made it right by sending me a new batch, as the first one was completely unusable. The second batch is different altogether. Very hard like wax, but at least it is smooth and not like sand mixed in. I had to use a spoon to dig to the bottom, it is that hard and began to bend it, to see if the under layer is smooth or grainy. It is still smooth but a little courser than what is on the top of the tub. In my other tub it was so soft I could just push my finger in and down to the bottom of the tub. Furthermore, reading on here, it sounds like each batch is strikingly different. A more consistent quality and texture is very needed, and perhaps some new quality control measures or personnel is highly needed and appreciated.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Very good quality butter.  Easy to spread and can be mixed with other butters.  Item was shipped quickly and in a tidy plastic jar.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product! I am a return customer who has a very small happy little all natural company...I only purchase my avocado, illipe and mango butters from Dr Adorable. Right off the bat, their packaging outshines the competition. I use about 8 oz. per batch ( depending upon the item ) and I really appreciate the resealable tub! The product itself is of the highest quality! It melts beautifully into the skin and doesnt leave that nasty oily greasy feeling. Im halfway thru this order already...will reorder!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in CP soap for the past 6 months and it does make a very nice conditioning ingredient.  My only bother was that I bought the 3 pound amount which arrived with a big leaky crack in the bottom of the container.  Fortunately it was inside another plastic bag or there would have been quite a mess.  I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll buy the smaller size this time and hope the container doesn&#x27;t crack again.  The small container is Prime supported anyway and I won&#x27;t have to pay the shipping charge.  Spoiled, Prime lover, that I am.</li>
            <li> love this butter so creamy i was looking for a butter for my mom who has really dry skin i read all the. reviews on  avacoda   butter which got me to order at last no more ash my only. complaint is i wish it came  with a scooper to help get the product out and a recipe book .</li>
            <li> onderful product a really great read who would have known. but it was a good read loved it and would look for similar</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money. Too heavy on the hair.</li>
            <li> I will never be without this Butter.... it is such a phenomenal product and has excellent and multiple benefits for skin and hair. It can be used in my different ways and I&#x27;m so glad I made the purchase. I will purchase again as this will always be a HUGE staple of mine. Yaaayyyy :)</li>
            <li> Great product.  Enhances the smell of any perfume you are wearing.  Not to oily.  Leaves your skin soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> Very nice Butter. I use it to make my hair moisturizing concoction with different oils instead of African Shea butter. Delivery was  quick, packaging was good and sealed properly.</li>
            <li> The product is very moisturizing and a little goes a long way.  I just wish it was sold in smaller containers.  Since not much is needed the 3lb container will last a long time and I prefer not to have it that long. I prefer to buy a fresh jar every so often.  I ended up splitting it with my friend.</li>
            <li> Its a really great moisturizer for dry winter skin and hair. It does wonders for my hands. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I did the \\&quot;big chop\\&quot; back in Oct 2013 and needless to say I did not realize how much moisture natural black hair required. I am a 3c/4a hair type which seems to be pretty dry! I have tried several products from Shea butter - which was too heavy and greasy for my hair and Coconut oil - which was way too light for my hair ... my hair drank that like juice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just happen to be browsing looking for more products to try on my hair ;-) and viola&#x27; ... I stumbled upon a definite \\&quot;keeper\\&quot; ( well for now, at least) to my hair regimen. This product moisturized and soften my hair leaving it feeling like real natural should feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I love it and I think this 3lb tub will last me thru Spring, as I cowash and condition my hair almost daily. The real test will be when the Summer rolls in ... will this still be the moisturizer of my choice ... hmm ... stay tuned!</li>
            <li> This is real avocado butter. Soft and buttery. I love it.I ordered avocado butter years ago from another site and the difference is clear. That one was waxy and hard. This is not. This one spreads easily. That one left my hair with a thick, white waxy coat. That other seller claimed it was real avocado butter. LOL. I will only order from Dr. adorable.</li>
            <li> I make my own body butter and this avocado butter is a nice addition to my concoctions.  I add it to shea butter and it smooths out the body butter consistency.  Pretty much odorless and very smooth and has a nice melt to it.  I will be using this regularly.</li>
            <li> If you have ever used avocado butter before, you might be asking what smell? The is just my point, it doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything.  I ordered this because I could not tolerate the smell of the shea butter I had tried before.  I am so glad I decided to try avocado butter next.  It has a much more neutral aroma.  It also moisturizes well.  In addition the plastic tub it comes in is very handy.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> More oily than I expected, but needed a good moisturizer for the skin. I prefer mixing it with a good body lotion so it&#x27;s not as oily.</li>
            <li> This butter is awesome..makes my hair very soft and managable as im a naturalista.smell is mild.I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS AVOCADO BUTTER !! 3 LBS IS A LOT, BUT I USE IT EVERYDAY ON MY BELLY. I&#x27;M ALMOST 8 MONTHS PREGNANT &amp; HAVE USED THIS BUTTER SINCE I WAS ONLY 7 WEEKS. I HAVE NOT GOTTEN ONE STRETCH MARK. BUTTER IS SMOOTH AND MELTS VERY EASILY ON THE SKIN. HOURS LATER MY BELLY IS STILL VERY MOIST. LIKE ANY BUTTER IT IS GRESSY, BUT I DONT CARE; THE BENEFITS ARE WORTH IT. SO DONT WEAR ANYTHING YOU DONT WANT TO GET GREESE MARKS ON WHILE WEARING THIS BUTTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND !! IT IS ALSO GREAT FOR DRY DAMAGED HAIR… XOXO</li>
            <li> I had bought one before I got this one, the one I got before was easy to scoop out, my spatula sliced right through it with no problem. when I got this one it seems a lot more harder, to the point where Im chiseling it out, I don&#x27;t know if it from the heat during shipping but I don&#x27;t like all the work. Other than that I love this company.</li>
            <li> Great..packaging and also product.. I gave some away tto fmaily and friends and they love it.. It&#x27;s grea ton freashly washed hair..</li>
            <li> Unlike shea butter avocado butter is smooth and very gentle on hair and skin. I use this apart of my hair style regimen.</li>
            <li> This avocado butter is really good. It mixes well with other products. And it is also a good end sealer.</li>
            <li> I use avocado oil and love it but because it is messy in the shower I thought I&#x27;d try this after reading the good reviews (like to do my homework) - it is very hard and waxy and does NOT melt on the skin. - it will have to figure out a way to soften it  as 3lbs is a lot to use up!  I would not advise purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I was given this container by a soap making friend &amp; tried it in CP soap.  I must admit - it is wonderful!!  No odor, doesn&#x27;t discolor soap, easy to use.  I used it at 10%.  You need to process your soap a bit hotter, tho, about 90 - 100 degrees (I usually process below 90 degrees) because it thickens quickly when it starts to cool.  But the resulting soap is AMAZING!!  Very creamy &amp; soft.  I will for sure get more when this tub runs out!!</li>
            <li> I just received the butter. I love it! It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling super greasy... And leaves your skin feeling super soft. I was using avocado and olive oil before. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back. Glad I got the 3lb tub. :o)</li>
            <li> this item came on time, the avocado butter, is very soft and moisturizing, I add this to my skin and hair care products.</li>
            <li> My mom has bad psoriasis, and I mix this with neem/hops/marigold tinctures and cocoabutter into semi-hard discs, and it&#x27;s helped clear up and soften many of the thick, rough, painful patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For myself, I use it on painfully dry skin during the winter, and my feet whenever I&#x27;ve waited too long to get a pedicure, plus, this stuff&#x27;s a miracle on busted cuticles like I get from doing dishes all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it is an extremely soft butter, more like a jellified oil (which it basically is, since it&#x27;s been dehydrated into a semi-solid), and it has a lot of &#x27;slip&#x27;. If you&#x27;re looking for a firmer butter, this isn&#x27;t it, this is SUPREMELY soft stuff. Think grainy margarine (sounds gross, I know, but this stuff&#x27;s just way too awesome). If you&#x27;ve got very dry hair, this also helps, but remember: a little goes a very long way with this stuff. It&#x27;s a bit slow to absorb, which is why it&#x27;s good for massage, and it&#x27;s not as messy as a straight liquefied oil.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use in my body butters. It did not react in the same way as the Avocado butter I had previously used from Brambleberry. When I whipped it up as usual in my kitchenaid mixer, it would not whip forcing me to add other ingredients like shea and cocoa butter to make it firmer. In the middle of mixing it I tried calling the Dr. Adorable business but no one answered the phone. So much for product support :/</li>
            <li> Great product  fast shipping&lt;br /&gt; Good quality products</li>
            <li> Just love it! I use it daily and can&#x27;t get enough of it, my skin drinks it up without being oily. I only wish it had a pleasant feminine scent, the current smell is a soft natural oil scent which is OK. I will buy it again when this is finish.</li>
            <li> AWESOME MOISTURIZER....&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my skin and hair. Its too oily for my face but works well on my arms and legs. This butter is amazing for natural hair woman that have used bleach it protects and moisturizes the hair shaft.♥♡♥♥</li>
            <li> I did not even know they made avocado butter. Looks good. no odor. I like the packaging. Looking forward to using it on my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I love this butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it on the 3rd and received it the 6th. The product came in the tub shown and it had a break away seal so I was secure that i was the first one to open it! Beware the butter is thin, melted and filled to the top so make sure you be careful when opening it. (I spilled some on my hand but thats ok i just rubbed it in)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a all natural AA female with type 4 hair. I was looking on amazon for different all natural butters to seal in the moisture in my hair when I stumbled across this little gem!  I just tried it last night. I washed, deep conditioned, applied leave-in conditioner then I sealed in the moisture with this Avocado butter!! My hair felt so soft, my curl pattern came out and it was easy to detangle my hair (while wet of course). I woke up this morning and my hair is so soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIN&lt;br /&gt;My hands were moisturized while i did my hair. Then I rubbed some all over my body and my skin was shiny and soft! the next day still shiny and soft!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this butter! I really can&#x27;t say it enough!</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say that the product is great! it melts easy into the skin when applied, also it does not have a strong odor to it which I like that about this product. It mix well with oils.I almost forgot to mention that when I open package it was in a plastic zip bag which I like..</li>
            <li> I use it all the time for a general moisturizer &amp; the price is good.  My only beef is that there&#x27;s little bits of harder stuff in it. It&#x27;s hot where i live so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a temperature thing. I&#x27;d buy it again though</li>
            <li> Did not whip up like other butters so I couldn&#x27;t use it for a cosmetic item I make. But it is very buttery and creamy</li>
            <li> I can always count on Dr Adorable products to be organic and on time. love this stuff</li>
            <li> Amazing product and value for the money!</li>
