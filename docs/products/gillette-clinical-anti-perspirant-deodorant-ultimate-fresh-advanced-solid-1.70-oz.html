            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work for anyone, but for those of us who sweat a lot, this is a great solution.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the great price and Gillette for making a very good, needed product.</li>
            <li>Nice smell that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem as effective as it used to be either.  </li>

            <li>way better than cotton-ball sized applicators (degree etc.)</li>
            <li>Excellent product, totally recommended.!</li>
            <li>but definitely one of the best!</li>
            <li>Now I am glad it is gone because I found a much much better alternative.</li>
            <li>I put more on in the morning and this seems to keep the fragrance in place which otherwise fades overnight.</li>
            <li>This is my husbands favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have tried many deodorants, but none have helped me combat sweat.</li>
            <li>Price was a lot better than walmart for the size.</li>
            <li>It just works better than everything else, period.</li>
            <li>What more can I say.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any of the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have tried many Anti-Perspirants and they never work.</li>
            <li>For the price you would expect more usable product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>(Top is always on tight)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wipe off top of deodorant on a towel, and wash one more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like sweating... and this helps eliminate most of my sweatiness.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything yet that worked better.</li>
            <li>If they fix this problem I will gladly up my star to 4.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think that&#x27;s when I sweat the most.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure to read the instructions.  </li>
            <li>this deodorant works great and smells decent.  </li>
            <li>Good price here for a large size.</li>
            <li>So, go gently into this good night.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and works all day.  </li>
            <li>de-stinks my son - pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Works well and has a great scent but is pretty pricey for how much you get</li>
            <li>Only thing that works for me, great product that i will continue to use.</li>
            <li>Works superbly for my husband who perspires heavily.</li>
            <li>To me, that alone is worth more than the price tag.</li>
            <li>and it is good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>All Day Fresh Anti-Perspirant / Deodorant would be a good one to try and see if it benefits you as much as it does me.</li>
            <li>Very nice smell reduce sweat big time</li>
            <li>Clean up shell pieces / whatever I used to chisel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you can find a coupon and get 20 percent off on subscribe-n-save the cost is much more reasonable for the results you get.</li>
            <li>You would expect it to be a bit more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t run off during the day and it last thought the night as well, and it smells good.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every deodorant for both men and women (I&#x27;m a woman) and this is the only one that works good</li>
            <li>Makes you feel and smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>- the top on this is nice n wide for my manly pits</li>
            <li>I have tried many many deodorant products, but found this one to be most satisfying in term of long lasting effect and smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff would work great for athletes who may need something a little stronger.</li>
            <li>This is worth a try for those that sweat plenty.</li>
            <li>Success without crystaline shards of pain in my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions for applying (putting the deodorant on before bedtime) and made sure to rub it in completely.</li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars because the Dove one works right on the spot</li>
            <li>I shower at night and apply this right after I shower.  </li>
            <li>scent on this one is pretty neutral while the sport one is a bit more masculine</li>
            <li>Clinical strength really IS clinical strength and honestly does last through gym class, sports etc!</li>
            <li>May be too strong foursome  sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>If you get night sweats and hot flashes, this will work wonders for you.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Clinical Strength works through the whole day and you still smell fresh after work.</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every product and this is the first one to work.</li>
            <li>Just twist it out a bit before removing the freshness sticker for an even spread the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>The products works well; however, you get more packaging (plastic) in weight than actual product.  </li>
            <li>Wash deodorant in hot water to remove additional shards stuck in holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Open top and apply deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty skinny man</li>
            <li>a.m. - Woke up for first day of senior college classes.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the much larger size for a much better price.  </li>
            <li>I like this product and was glad to find it in an extra large size.</li>
            <li>I think that most people would agree that sweating because of the heat or because you&#x27;re exercising is pretty normal and socially acceptable.</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and smelling great after a very long day.  </li>
            <li>It rolls on easy like a gel yet doesn&#x27;t leave your shirts with giant &amp;#34;gel clumps&amp;#34; as my wife used to call them 4.)</li>
            <li>Yes, this works better than my old antiperspirant (Old Spice High Endurance.)  </li>
            <li>Applying it at night works surprisingly well for staying dry the next day.</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying this now</li>
            <li>It works, however you really have to use it at night before going to bed as indicated.</li>
            <li>Very nervous, but still dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes the skin feel a little waxy at first, but it&#x27;s something most people will get used to over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe you need more or less, so just find what works for you.</li>
            <li>JUST ON THE HIGH END OF PRICE ,NOT FROM THE SELLER</li>
            <li>/ highly recommend</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, the smell is really bad and it doesn&#x27;t perform nearly as well as the older light blue kind, I used to be able to go two days without having to reapply now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m active and sweat easily.  </li>
            <li>,can&#x27;t live without ... Run out faster than normal</li>
            <li>The only one that works for me right now.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m looking for a new brand.</li>
            <li>I actually tried Secret for women that works great at stopping sweat</li>
            <li>The only way you can stay fresh without any funk for nearly 24 hours is this stuff.</li>
            <li>Better than other regular antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>and I usually have to scrape the top every couple</li>
            <li>They have both tried many different brands, scents, non-scented, different strengths, gel, solid, etc.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different and I have had other anti-perspirants work better</li>
            <li>My first day of using the deodorant was the ultimate test:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I work outside and during the summer time it will not last a full 8 hour day.</li>
            <li>The only positive is, I don&#x27;t stink when I use it.  </li>
            <li>It used to be a creamy texture, but now it&#x27;s more watery and a hard crust develops on the applicator.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else worked nearly as well</li>
            <li>I gone so far in considering miraDry or botox, but Gillette has diverted my attention for the time being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps my underarm smell under wraps after a long hot day working.</li>
            <li>I clearly received an old product.</li>
            <li>I think Imho soft solids is heavier than gel..</li>
            <li>It smells a bit more masculine than my normal Secret,  but the smell goes away and eventually gets covered with my normal deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Old Review:</li>
            <li>I can be sitting completely still in an air-conditioned room and still be soaking my shirt.</li>
            <li>Sweating nearly everywhere, but underarms still dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is really the only deodarant that works well for me.  </li>
            <li>I have tried almost every antiperspirant out there - this one is by far the most effective and by far the least irritating to the skin.  </li>
            <li>FYI - if you put on more than the recommended amount, it will stick to and destroy your shirts after several applications.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say if it is on sale, it is well worth it and competitive with other clinical strength antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with excessive sweating most my life,  this totally eliminates that!</li>
            <li>and I was not pleased when it began disappearing off the shelves and now is no longer available from amazon either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was probably a mistake buying this because now I can never go back to normal priced deodorant again.</li>
            <li>TÃ­a is a brand New but bigger.</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and smelling fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, 1 2.6 oz container will last me 6 months or so, 1 click is more than enough for me.</li>
            <li>I usually purchase the regular Gillette clear gel Cool Wave deodorant.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and 16-year old son use this deodorant and have been for the last couple years or so.</li>
            <li>The flaw I have is that this isn&#x27;t enough to make my sweating disappear completely even if I am not doing anything to sweat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Really, really works even after a gruelling, active day out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot naturally and this keeps me dry all day.  </li>
            <li>(1) I get lots of white residue on my clothes and (2) it is a pretty inefficient design and lots of the product gets wasted.</li>
            <li>The comments about it working even after exercising seemed ridiculous but its actually true.</li>

            <li> In fact, I think that&#x27;s when I sweat the most.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure to read the instructions.  </li>
            <li> this deodorant works great and smells decent.  </li>
            <li> Good price here for a large size.</li>
            <li> So, go gently into this good night.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and works all day.  </li>
            <li> de-stinks my son - pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Works well and has a great scent but is pretty pricey for how much you get</li>
            <li> Only thing that works for me, great product that i will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Works superbly for my husband who perspires heavily.</li>
            <li> To me, that alone is worth more than the price tag.</li>
            <li> and it is good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> All Day Fresh Anti-Perspirant / Deodorant would be a good one to try and see if it benefits you as much as it does me.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell reduce sweat big time</li>
            <li> Clean up shell pieces / whatever I used to chisel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you can find a coupon and get 20 percent off on subscribe-n-save the cost is much more reasonable for the results you get.</li>
            <li> You would expect it to be a bit more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t run off during the day and it last thought the night as well, and it smells good.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every deodorant for both men and women (I&#x27;m a woman) and this is the only one that works good</li>
            <li> Makes you feel and smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> - the top on this is nice n wide for my manly pits</li>
            <li> I have tried many many deodorant products, but found this one to be most satisfying in term of long lasting effect and smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff would work great for athletes who may need something a little stronger.</li>
            <li> This is worth a try for those that sweat plenty.</li>
            <li> Success without crystaline shards of pain in my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions for applying (putting the deodorant on before bedtime) and made sure to rub it in completely.</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because the Dove one works right on the spot</li>
            <li> I shower at night and apply this right after I shower.  </li>
            <li> scent on this one is pretty neutral while the sport one is a bit more masculine</li>
            <li> Clinical strength really IS clinical strength and honestly does last through gym class, sports etc!</li>
            <li> May be too strong foursome  sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> If you get night sweats and hot flashes, this will work wonders for you.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Clinical Strength works through the whole day and you still smell fresh after work.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every product and this is the first one to work.</li>
            <li> Just twist it out a bit before removing the freshness sticker for an even spread the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> The products works well; however, you get more packaging (plastic) in weight than actual product.  </li>
            <li> Wash deodorant in hot water to remove additional shards stuck in holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Open top and apply deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty skinny man</li>
            <li> a.m. - Woke up for first day of senior college classes.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the much larger size for a much better price.  </li>
            <li> I like this product and was glad to find it in an extra large size.</li>
            <li> I think that most people would agree that sweating because of the heat or because you&#x27;re exercising is pretty normal and socially acceptable.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and smelling great after a very long day.  </li>
            <li> It rolls on easy like a gel yet doesn&#x27;t leave your shirts with giant &amp;#34;gel clumps&amp;#34; as my wife used to call them 4.)</li>
            <li> Yes, this works better than my old antiperspirant (Old Spice High Endurance.)  </li>
            <li> Applying it at night works surprisingly well for staying dry the next day.</li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying this now</li>
            <li> It works, however you really have to use it at night before going to bed as indicated.</li>
            <li> Very nervous, but still dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes the skin feel a little waxy at first, but it&#x27;s something most people will get used to over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe you need more or less, so just find what works for you.</li>
            <li> JUST ON THE HIGH END OF PRICE ,NOT FROM THE SELLER</li>
            <li> / highly recommend</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> , the smell is really bad and it doesn&#x27;t perform nearly as well as the older light blue kind, I used to be able to go two days without having to reapply now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m active and sweat easily.  </li>
            <li> ,can&#x27;t live without ... Run out faster than normal</li>
            <li> The only one that works for me right now.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m looking for a new brand.</li>
            <li> I actually tried Secret for women that works great at stopping sweat</li>
            <li> The only way you can stay fresh without any funk for nearly 24 hours is this stuff.</li>
            <li> Better than other regular antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> and I usually have to scrape the top every couple</li>
            <li> They have both tried many different brands, scents, non-scented, different strengths, gel, solid, etc.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different and I have had other anti-perspirants work better</li>
            <li> My first day of using the deodorant was the ultimate test:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I work outside and during the summer time it will not last a full 8 hour day.</li>
            <li> The only positive is, I don&#x27;t stink when I use it.  </li>
            <li> It used to be a creamy texture, but now it&#x27;s more watery and a hard crust develops on the applicator.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else worked nearly as well</li>
            <li> I gone so far in considering miraDry or botox, but Gillette has diverted my attention for the time being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps my underarm smell under wraps after a long hot day working.</li>
            <li> I clearly received an old product.</li>
            <li> I think Imho soft solids is heavier than gel..</li>
            <li> It smells a bit more masculine than my normal Secret,  but the smell goes away and eventually gets covered with my normal deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Old Review:</li>
            <li> I can be sitting completely still in an air-conditioned room and still be soaking my shirt.</li>
            <li> Sweating nearly everywhere, but underarms still dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is really the only deodarant that works well for me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried almost every antiperspirant out there - this one is by far the most effective and by far the least irritating to the skin.  </li>
            <li> FYI - if you put on more than the recommended amount, it will stick to and destroy your shirts after several applications.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say if it is on sale, it is well worth it and competitive with other clinical strength antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with excessive sweating most my life,  this totally eliminates that!</li>
            <li> and I was not pleased when it began disappearing off the shelves and now is no longer available from amazon either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was probably a mistake buying this because now I can never go back to normal priced deodorant again.</li>
            <li> TÃ­a is a brand New but bigger.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and smelling fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, 1 2.6 oz container will last me 6 months or so, 1 click is more than enough for me.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase the regular Gillette clear gel Cool Wave deodorant.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and 16-year old son use this deodorant and have been for the last couple years or so.</li>
            <li> The flaw I have is that this isn&#x27;t enough to make my sweating disappear completely even if I am not doing anything to sweat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Really, really works even after a gruelling, active day out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot naturally and this keeps me dry all day.  </li>
            <li> (1) I get lots of white residue on my clothes and (2) it is a pretty inefficient design and lots of the product gets wasted.</li>
            <li> The comments about it working even after exercising seemed ridiculous but its actually true.</li>
            <li> Gillette take notice of all the negative reviews they are 100% right</li>
            <li> My last two antiperspirant deodorants were not clinical strength, but still high in aluminum (15-17%), so I didn&#x27;t think that going up a few extra percent in a clinical strength deodorant would make a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a solid deodorant, so try to apply it and allow a bit of time to dry before putting on a shirt, or else you&#x27;ll get the white marks on the inside of your shirt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the &amp;#34;3 clicks&amp;#34; - that seemed too much for me.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting.</li>
            <li> This was a reorder from last year, and expected same product (s).</li>
            <li> I used only a little bit under each arm especially on the third day.</li>
            <li> Product (Gillette Clinical Strength All Day Fresh Anti-Perspirant / Deodorant 2.6 Oz), arrived broken.</li>
            <li> As a partial Anhidrosis individual, my body perspires in limited areas, one which is the underarms.</li>
            <li> It does seem to dry and flake on the dispenser  </li>
            <li> my boyfriends loves this, works all day and keeps him dry.</li>
            <li> The product suggests applying it before you go to bed, but my morning routine requires a shower, so I have to apply after I dry myself</li>
            <li> If you are moderately active, it can last up to 24 hours or even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that works on my teenage son so whenever it&#x27;s on sale I grab a few!  </li>
            <li> Use this after your nightly shower and once again in the morning, and as long as you&#x27;re not a profuse sweater or extremely physically active, you will emit no body odor at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It actually hurts to put it on because of the shards that are created or it leaves little balls in his hair.</li>
            <li> Pits are wet 5 minutes after application.</li>
            <li> But, it still leaves my armpits wet.  </li>
            <li> After 3 days of use this glue stick Gillette calls deodorant went feverishly into the trash.</li>
            <li> so my metabolism has always caused me to sweat more than normal, had a terrible time trying to find an  Anti-Perspirant / Deodorant that would work all day keeping me dry and smelling</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a woman who typically uses secret clinical strength and received this Gillette clinical strength after my pops passed away and left a new Gillette still in box.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and still end up sweating a bit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an extreme case, however.  </li>
            <li> Even days I&#x27;m extremely active and sweat a lot, I have very minimal arm-pit odor.</li>
            <li> Turn knob a little bit to get hardened shards partially out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it will only come out in the corners the first couple of uses and you will get frustrated trying to spread it out to cover your pit area.</li>
            <li> I notice others have complained about this same thing.  </li>
            <li> i am looking into essential oil type deodorants as i&#x27;m finding that conventional deodorants and antiperspirants are odor &amp;#34;staining&amp;#34; my clothes such that they smell terrible even when i put on clean.</li>
            <li> I immediately quit using it and washed it off and in a day the swelling had gone down.</li>
            <li> When I put it on, it &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; and crusts up, raining down onto the floor like sand.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll take the slight problems because I am no longer dealing with drenched/stained clothes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; as my previous one and works well.</li>
            <li> I contacted Gillette to let them know, but I&#x27;m not sure if they will do anything to fix the problem other than sending me a couple coupons.</li>
            <li> I got a little rash from it.</li>
            <li> It usually lasts between 12-18 hours if you are active.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but if you have BO and no other options work for you, you&#x27;ve got to give this a shot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of some type of stink kryptonite that repels raw odor like nothing else.</li>
            <li> Gillette clinical works unbelievably well for me.</li>
            <li> Well, look no more, if your anything like me than this Gillette Clinical Strength</li>
            <li> I can wear t-shirts with confidence - no more secretly checking for wet marks or body odor.</li>
            <li> I bought a small stick of this at the grocery store for $14 and was blown away with the results.  </li>
            <li> and I sweat very heavy.</li>
            <li> lasts for around 12 hours but less if I do a tough workout.</li>
            <li> Hard to describe</li>
            <li> Amazon seems to be at least a buck cheaper than Fred Meyer.</li>
            <li> The lymph nodes under my arms were badly swollen the second day I used this.</li>
            <li> I have overactive armpits, and this baby feels like 10-inch thick armor separating my pits from my expensive shirts.</li>
            <li> I have used other clinical strength deodorants, but for some reason I had a painful reaction to this one.</li>
            <li> Update: 4/27/2017, the new formula is terrible</li>
            <li> It therefore does not stay on your skin like it used to, and it also makes it uncomfortable to apply.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, i&#x27;m a nervous sweater.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t find the deodorant to be sticky or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t find it helpful at all, and if it gets on my hands, they feel terrible for a long time even after washing (some function of the sweat gland-clogging chemistry, i guess).  </li>
            <li> It has turned into expensive junk!</li>
            <li> Too expensive!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because I&#x27;ve used this for years</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bad shipment, but I have ordered ~6 of them</li>
            <li> but I hate how I feel like my pits are slimy for a while after applying it.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with my purchases.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Yet another thing that gets delivered via Subscribe and Save.  Love the service and this product. Because it keeps my husband from smelling.  Nobody likes a smelly husband.</li>
            <li> Good price here for a large size. My husband uses this. Keeps him from sweating, he said. Better than other regular antiperspirants. No skin irritation.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that works on my teenage son so whenever it&#x27;s on sale I grab a few!  Clinical strength really IS clinical strength and honestly does last through gym class, sports etc!</li>
            <li> way better than cotton-ball sized applicators (degree etc.) - the top on this is nice n wide for my manly pits</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Really, really works even after a gruelling, active day out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you get night sweats and hot flashes, this will work wonders for you. You&#x27;re supposed to put it on at night after you shower and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;3. It usually lasts between 12-18 hours if you are active. If you are moderately active, it can last up to 24 hours or even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It does leave a chalky stain on the insides of darker clothes, especially gym-wear.&lt;br /&gt;2. It does seem to dry and flake on the dispenser  and I usually have to scrape the top every couple days.&lt;br /&gt;3. Makes the skin feel a little waxy at first, but it&#x27;s something most people will get used to over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say if it is on sale, it is well worth it and competitive with other clinical strength antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant for me.  I&#x27;m active and sweat easily.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and still end up sweating a bit.  This is the only brand that&#x27;s worked for me.  I get it.  Different products work differently for all of us.  This is worth a try for those that sweat plenty.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, totally recommended.!</li>
            <li> It helps me to stop sweeter</li>
            <li> leaves deodorant stains on shirts when putting on</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I usually purchase the regular Gillette clear gel Cool Wave deodorant. I work outside and during the summer time it will not last a full 8 hour day. The Gillette Clinical Strength works through the whole day and you still smell fresh after work. I use the regular stuff on days I don&#x27;t work because, well, It&#x27;s not necessary. This stuff would work great for athletes who may need something a little stronger. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Goes on clumpy. If I rub my hand over my pits after application, chunks of white stuff roll off onto the floor.  Pits are wet 5 minutes after application. Leaves white residue on my colored shirts.  The only positive is, I don&#x27;t stink when I use it.  My search continues.......</li>
            <li> Great deodorant for a great price</li>
            <li> Only thing that works for me, great product that i will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This is very good, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this deodorant, but Gillette has changed something with the formula resulting in the deodorant to crust over. It actually hurts to put it on because of the shards that are created or it leaves little balls in his hair. It has turned into expensive junk!</li>
            <li> This product works! I have tried just about every product and this is the first one to work. I am not giving it 5 stars for two reasons:  (1) I get lots of white residue on my clothes and (2) it is a pretty inefficient design and lots of the product gets wasted. I have been using this product for about two years and I&#x27;ll take the slight problems because I am no longer dealing with drenched/stained clothes.</li>
            <li> Perfect antiperspirant in every way. Does what it says it will do, and smells great doing it. I have overactive armpits, and this baby feels like 10-inch thick armor separating my pits from my expensive shirts. Just twist it out a bit before removing the freshness sticker for an even spread the first time you use it. Otherwise, it will only come out in the corners the first couple of uses and you will get frustrated trying to spread it out to cover your pit area.</li>
            <li> I actually tried Secret for women that works great at stopping sweat and I sweat very heavy. Smells good though just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This was a reorder from last year, and expected same product (s). I received 1 for $10.77 this reorder and received 3 for $9.49 last order. The $10.77 is $3-5 dollars MORE expensive at Walmart.Make sure you read the product description closely so you DON&#x27;T GET RIPPED OFF!!!</li>
            <li> Well what can I say about a deodorant? This one just works.  No gross stickiness or smells - this is called a solid but squeezes through a screen so it behaves like a gel in my opinion.  Goes on easy and works all day.  Nice smell that is not overpowering.  Pricey but definitely one of the best!</li>
            <li> Use this after your nightly shower and once again in the morning, and as long as you&#x27;re not a profuse sweater or extremely physically active, you will emit no body odor at the end of the day. Even days I&#x27;m extremely active and sweat a lot, I have very minimal arm-pit odor. It&#x27;s expensive, but if you have BO and no other options work for you, you&#x27;ve got to give this a shot. If you can find a coupon and get 20 percent off on subscribe-n-save the cost is much more reasonable for the results you get.</li>
            <li> For years I have used Mitchum rollon. Nothing else worked nearly as well and I was not pleased when it began disappearing off the shelves and now is no longer available from amazon either. Now I am glad it is gone because I found a much much better alternative. Gillette clinical works unbelievably well for me. Applying it at night works surprisingly well for staying dry the next day. I put more on in the morning and this seems to keep the fragrance in place which otherwise fades overnight.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite deodorant. All others make him breakout but not this one. Thanks for carrying this now you just need to keep it coming through subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I like this product and was glad to find it in an extra large size.</li>
            <li> Do not buy the chemicals in it were separating and it was junk!! Would never buy again!!</li>
            <li> A  very good product.</li>
            <li> Great price for size/quantity!</li>
            <li> this deodorant works great and smells decent.  I&#x27;m repurchasing it for a third time.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and smelling fresh all day long. A must for the summer months.  My go to for all day protection.</li>
            <li> One of the best Clinical Anti-Perspirant Deodorants out! As a partial Anhidrosis individual, my body perspires in limited areas, one which is the underarms. I have tried many deodorants, but none have helped me combat sweat. I gone so far in considering miraDry or botox, but Gillette has diverted my attention for the time being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note, this deodorant is tricky to take off even after showering and scrubbing for minutes. I still do not know how to fully remove the deodorant. This is a bit concerning, as the deodorant is not letting the underarms breath. Nonetheless, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great. No problems of sweating on undershirts anymore. Probably will sign up for automatic transactions. Price was a lot better than walmart for the size. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with my purchases. Product (Gillette Clinical Strength All Day Fresh Anti-Perspirant / Deodorant 2.6 Oz), arrived broken. And I was not refunded. Asked to return the products, but they were so damaged that I had to throw away.</li>
            <li> I switched to this over a year ago. It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; as my previous one and works well. The subscription service is convenient too. Amazon seems to be at least a buck cheaper than Fred Meyer.</li>
            <li> Showed up on time as part of a subscription, but always arrived defective. Hard to describe but it appeared to be heat damaged, maybe from storage or shipping? Worked alright, but was sticky and flaky.</li>
            <li> Yes, this works better than my old antiperspirant (Old Spice High Endurance.)  But, it still leaves my armpits wet.  I&#x27;m an extreme case, however.  I&#x27;m going to keep searching.</li>
            <li> It just works better than everything else, period.</li>
            <li> Finally, a deodorant product that works!  What more can I say.  It&#x27;s better than any of the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is, hands-down, the best clinical-strength deodorant and antiperspirant on the market. I&#x27;ve used numerous products over the years, but have been using this one for two years now. Hopefully they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many Anti-Perspirants and they never work. Once I start to sweat, they stop working. This one does great, strong great smell that lasts. Keeps my underarm smell under wraps after a long hot day working.</li>
            <li> The only one that works for me right now.</li>
            <li> TÃ­a is a brand New but bigger. It is awesome.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it works!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t find it helpful at all, and if it gets on my hands, they feel terrible for a long time even after washing (some function of the sweat gland-clogging chemistry, i guess).  i am looking into essential oil type deodorants as i&#x27;m finding that conventional deodorants and antiperspirants are odor &amp;#34;staining&amp;#34; my clothes such that they smell terrible even when i put on clean.</li>
            <li> Best anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve ever used. Deodorant smells great tooâ€”not perfumey. Makes you feel and smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every antiperspirant out there - this one is by far the most effective and by far the least irritating to the skin.  Will not use anything else any longer.</li>
            <li> The products works well; however, you get more packaging (plastic) in weight than actual product.  For the price you would expect more usable product.  This sort of deodorant has been on the market for several years.  You would expect it to be a bit more reasonably priced.  Too expensive!</li>
            <li> The best deodorant I have ever used. No smell. No wetness. Not ever.&lt;br /&gt;It was probably a mistake buying this because now I can never go back to normal priced deodorant again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well.  Tends to chunk up.  Once you turn the knob to get some to come out, you have to smack it so it comes out.  Then it goes flying all over.  I clearly received an old product.</li>
            <li> Love it. Very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and always get compliments on the smell.  Works good too</li>
            <li> It works, however you really have to use it at night before going to bed as indicated. I give it 3 stars because the Dove one works right on the spot so next time i&#x27;ll go for the dove. Great product anyway and the size is generous.</li>
            <li> Works well and has a great scent but is pretty pricey for how much you get</li>
            <li> Something has changed in the manufacturing of this product.  It used to be a creamy texture, but now it&#x27;s more watery and a hard crust develops on the applicator.  It doesn&#x27;t seem as effective as it used to be either.  This started with product I purchased around Feb 2015.  It&#x27;s too bad because I&#x27;ve used this for years and now I&#x27;m looking for a new brand.</li>
            <li> This deodorant was great.  Then something along the way changed. I have been using it for about a year now. I thought it was a bad shipment, but I have ordered ~6 of them and they all have the same issues now.  Another couple of reviews have mentioned this, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant hardens to glass shard like texture and will literally scratch your armpits / cause irritation.  The following is my daily routine with this deodorant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Chisel to break the shell the deodorant creates around the applicator portion. (Top is always on tight)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Clean up shell pieces / whatever I used to chisel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Turn knob a little bit to get hardened shards partially out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Wash deodorant in hot water to remove additional shards stuck in holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Wipe off top of deodorant on a towel, and wash one more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Use 1-2 clicks of the knob to push deodorant out and apply to armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) Wait 5 minutes to brush shards that have formed in armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Repeat 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9) Hope I have enough deodorant left on me to accomplish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to another clinical brand and my routine is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Open top and apply deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Success without crystaline shards of pain in my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again will I be buying this brand!</li>
            <li> Works well for smelly teenage boys!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like sweating... and this helps eliminate most of my sweatiness. I ignore the instructions and put two clicks on in the morning instead of at night, and it works great anyway.</li>
            <li> I have used other clinical strength deodorants, but for some reason I had a painful reaction to this one. The lymph nodes under my arms were badly swollen the second day I used this. I immediately quit using it and washed it off and in a day the swelling had gone down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years, I think.  Initially, I would have rated it 5 stars.  However, earlier this year, something changed about the product.  When I put it on, it &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; and crusts up, raining down onto the floor like sand.  It therefore does not stay on your skin like it used to, and it also makes it uncomfortable to apply.  I notice others have complained about this same thing.  I contacted Gillette to let them know, but I&#x27;m not sure if they will do anything to fix the problem other than sending me a couple coupons.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell reduce sweat big time,can&#x27;t live without ... Run out faster than normal I think Imho soft solids is heavier than gel..so volume for same weight is less.meaning it would run out faster</li>
            <li> the choose a 5 star because this product is very good.  for any man this is a must have!  my boyfriends loves this, works all day and keeps him dry.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a woman who typically uses secret clinical strength and received this Gillette clinical strength after my pops passed away and left a new Gillette still in box.  I took it home for my husband who didn&#x27;t need it so I gave it a try.  Works even better than secret!  I&#x27;ll switch to buying this from now on!  It smells a bit more masculine than my normal Secret,  but the smell goes away and eventually gets covered with my normal deodorant.  Definitely recommend. Ladies,  you can use it too! I&#x27;ve struggled with excessive sweating most my life,  this totally eliminates that!</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT, DOES THE JOB WELL JUST ON THE HIGH END OF PRICE ,NOT FROM THE SELLER BUT OVERALL ,THATS WHY I GAVE  4 STARS NOT 5. I WOULD GIVE THE SELLER A 5 STAR RATING. THEY DID A GREAT JOB.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, effective, clinical strength deodorant. Both my husband and 16-year old son use this deodorant and have been for the last couple years or so. Very pleased with this brand. They have both tried many different brands, scents, non-scented, different strengths, gel, solid, etc. and this is the one they both prefer.</li>
            <li> Great size and price.  Not the best fragrance for me, but not bad.</li>
            <li> this works great and it is good for sensitive skin / highly recommend</li>
            <li> Update: 4/27/2017, the new formula is terrible, the smell is really bad and it doesn&#x27;t perform nearly as well as the older light blue kind, I used to be able to go two days without having to reapply now I stink by the afternoon.  I will no longer be buying this anymore.  Gillette take notice of all the negative reviews they are 100% right you screwed up on this one  Old Review: Here is why I like this product  1.) It works well and eliminates sweating. 2.) It smells good which makes it a hit with my wife 3.) It rolls on easy like a gel yet doesn&#x27;t leave your shirts with giant &amp;#34;gel clumps&amp;#34; as my wife used to call them 4.) A little goes a long way, 1 2.6 oz container will last me 6 months or so, 1 click is more than enough for me.</li>
            <li> I got a little rash from it. May be too strong foursome  sensitive skin types. It works however!</li>
            <li> It is the best deodorant you can you use when you sweat like I do.  It don&#x27;t run off during the day and it last thought the night as well, and it smells good.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty skinny man so my metabolism has always caused me to sweat more than normal, had a terrible time trying to find an  Anti-Perspirant / Deodorant that would work all day keeping me dry and smelling ok. Well, look no more, if your anything like me than this Gillette Clinical Strength All Day Fresh Anti-Perspirant / Deodorant would be a good one to try and see if it benefits you as much as it does me. Thanks Amazon for the great price and Gillette for making a very good, needed product.</li>
            <li> Works superbly for my husband who perspires heavily. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> The price was excellent for the bonus size.</li>
            <li> I have perspiration problems, and tried this out to see if it would help. I have noticed a decrease in the amount of sweat I&#x27;ve been getting, but I still end up with pit stains at the end of the day. The product suggests applying it before you go to bed, but my morning routine requires a shower, so I have to apply after I dry myself off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid deodorant, so try to apply it and allow a bit of time to dry before putting on a shirt, or else you&#x27;ll get the white marks on the inside of your shirt.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different and I have had other anti-perspirants work better but this does a good job if applied correctly.</li>
            <li> Out of all the over the counter deodarants this one has worked the best. Haven&#x27;t found anything yet that worked better.</li>
            <li> I use this every day for my deodorant. The flaw I have is that this isn&#x27;t enough to make my sweating disappear completely even if I am not doing anything to sweat. If they fix this problem I will gladly up my star to 4.</li>
            <li> Does its job but sometimes it goes on a bit slimy. The fragrance is great but I hate how I feel like my pits are slimy for a while after applying it. This occurs even when I use it spareingly. I will keep using it though, it does work well and smell nice.</li>
            <li> I sweat constantly.  I sweat for no reason.  This is a Godsend.  It keeps me dry and smelling great after a very long day.  The comments about it working even after exercising seemed ridiculous but its actually true.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many deodorant products, but found this one to be most satisfying in term of long lasting effect and smell.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that there are different types of sweating. You might sweat because the temperature is too hot, because you&#x27;re physically exerting yourself, or because you&#x27;re anxious or nervous. I think that most people would agree that sweating because of the heat or because you&#x27;re exercising is pretty normal and socially acceptable. Unfortunately, i&#x27;m a nervous sweater. In fact, I think that&#x27;s when I sweat the most. I can be sitting completely still in an air-conditioned room and still be soaking my shirt. And sometimes I felt that putting on antiperspirant just made me sweat more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My last two antiperspirant deodorants were not clinical strength, but still high in aluminum (15-17%), so I didn&#x27;t think that going up a few extra percent in a clinical strength deodorant would make a difference. But boy, did it. I followed the directions for applying (putting the deodorant on before bedtime) and made sure to rub it in completely. I&#x27;m not sure about the &amp;#34;3 clicks&amp;#34; - that seemed too much for me. Maybe you need more or less, so just find what works for you. Oh, and I started taking showers before bed instead of the morning. That way, I can shower, apply the deodorant, and then not have to worry about it washing off in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers say that they re-applied the deodorant in the morning or later in the day. I did not. And I definitely didn&#x27;t need to. My first day of using the deodorant was the ultimate test:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 a.m. - Woke up for first day of senior college classes. Very nervous, but still dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 p.m. - Done with classes. Driving home in 90 degree weather (with no air conditioner). Sweating nearly everywhere, but underarms still dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 p.m. - Time to exercise. To my surprise, the deodorant still worked all the way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find the deodorant to be sticky or uncomfortable. Later in the day, as it&#x27;s working, I can tell it is there. It isn&#x27;t sticky for me, but it is a bit noticeable - a bit thicker than I&#x27;m used to. Oh, and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with this product. I can wear t-shirts with confidence - no more secretly checking for wet marks or body odor. To me, that alone is worth more than the price tag.</li>
            <li> Works great! My husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a glue stick to glue your armpits together this is the product for you! After 3 days of use this glue stick Gillette calls deodorant went feverishly into the trash. For the last 3 evenings while showering I have scrubbed with soap and wash cloth under each arm to remove the residual deodorant from under my arms. Problem is, even after scrubbing with plenty of soap, my armpits are left sticky. I can actually feel my arm skin sticking to my torso skin. Is this stuff glue? Yes, yes it is! Its pleasant smelling glue! I used only a little bit under each arm especially on the third day. I&#x27;m going back to Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used and smells great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best antiperspirant / deodorant that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I sweat like a beast and had to do some research on what the best solution was.  I bought a small stick of this at the grocery store for $14 and was blown away with the results.  Amazon has the much larger size for a much better price.  I set it up for a subscription service based on my results.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work for anyone, but for those of us who sweat a lot, this is a great solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every deodorant for both men and women (I&#x27;m a woman) and this is the only one that works good enough.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a regular deodorant meaning I put it on after I shower in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for around 12 hours but less if I do a tough workout. I also like the sport version.&lt;br /&gt;The scent on this one is pretty neutral while the sport one is a bit more masculine but I can still get away with wearing both.</li>
            <li> I have used Gilette clinical for over 3 years now.  It is really the only deodarant that works well for me.  I sweat a lot naturally and this keeps me dry all day.  Make sure to read the instructions.  I shower at night and apply this right after I shower.  i don&#x27;t need to apply it in the morning and it last all day!  Great product!</li>
            <li> The only way you can stay fresh without any funk for nearly 24 hours is this stuff. It&#x27;s made of some type of stink kryptonite that repels raw odor like nothing else. Would highly recommend. FYI - if you put on more than the recommended amount, it will stick to and destroy your shirts after several applications. So, go gently into this good night.</li>
            <li> Gillette deodorants are very good for people with problem B.O. and that sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> de-stinks my son - pretty amazing.</li>
