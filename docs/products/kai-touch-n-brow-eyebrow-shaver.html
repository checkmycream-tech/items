            <li>No random cuts but does the job for the pesky lip stash and nose too</li>
            <li>You might have to go over it a couple times, but these are gentle and just get that fuzz right off.  </li>
            <li>tho I&#x27;m new at shaving the peach fuzz off my face (it&#x27;s light, and I don&#x27;t have a lot, but it&#x27;s been bothering me as I get older...)  </li>
            <li>Cannot use on large area.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty new at the womens&#x27; &amp;#34;face shaving&amp;#34;</li>

            <li>Came in early!</li>
            <li>No one can probably see it, but I&#x27;m so self conscious of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten anywhere near the results I have with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trust me, there is no other product on the face of this earth that even come close to this product.</li>
            <li>Use them at a slight angle and gently go over the areas where you want to remove your hair.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a razor, what do I have to say? I see that this is recommended a lot by people whose eyebrows I found flawless, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I use this to get rid of my subtle facial hair, and to shape my eyebrows. It&#x27;s been working great so far. A tad overpriced here, but it&#x27;s a little hard to find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> My local Beauty Supply and Drug Store stopped carrying these.  No random cuts but does the job for the pesky lip stash and nose too I have ordered 10 pks just in case some one decides not to sell these any more</li>
            <li> Great product! fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Perfect for removing unwanted facial hair not just for eyebrows</li>
            <li> Awesome . Easy to use !</li>
            <li> Cannot use on large area.  Blade gets dull rapidly.</li>
            <li> They do their job well if you hold them around 45 degrees to the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this in my sewing business. Learned about it from magazine to rip out seams. will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I read about it in my sewing magazine &amp;#34;Threads&amp;#34;.  I use it for ripping seams (un-sewing) without cutting myself nor ruining my fabric.</li>
            <li> I, too, saw a video on You Tube where a gal used these to remove the peach fuzz from her face.  My peach fuzz has really been bothering me for a few years, especially in my sideburn area down to the jaw bone.  No one can probably see it, but I&#x27;m so self conscious of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I just received these yesterday and love them!!  Use them at a slight angle and gently go over the areas where you want to remove your hair.  You might have to go over it a couple times, but these are gentle and just get that fuzz right off.  Pull the skin taut if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so, so happy!  I feel less furry and more ladylike.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> These do work great for removing facial hair.  Very easy.</li>
            <li> Works great for facial hair!</li>
            <li> These are GREAT!!  I&#x27;m pretty new at the womens&#x27; &amp;#34;face shaving&amp;#34; thing.  Have recently discovered this trick via YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW!  I&#x27;ve only tried 3 brands and this is THE best!  (there were 2 different types I purchased at Target and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with either of them - I don&#x27;t remember the brands but I ended up returning them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even tho I&#x27;m new at shaving the peach fuzz off my face (it&#x27;s light, and I don&#x27;t have a lot, but it&#x27;s been bothering me as I get older...)  - anyway, I&#x27;ve never nicked or cut myself with this brand.  It is extremely effective.  Super simple to use and I love that the design itself is so simple, so basic, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  I bought mine at Sally Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to use this tool as an &amp;#34;eyebrow shaver&amp;#34; and that doesn&#x27;t interest me anyway.  I just use it for facial hair removal.  I have tried waxing - the sugar waxes and a couple other brands.  I might not be very good at the waxing of face but really, it shouldn&#x27;t be that difficult!  I&#x27;ve never gotten anywhere near the results I have with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is so clean, super smooth, much fresher looking AND foundation and/or bb creams, etc., just GLIDE on and it&#x27;s soooo nice to have baby smooth face skin now!  Makes my makeup look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand is AMAZING!!!!  I am so glad I learned about it, and so glad I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also ordered the Tickle brand from Amazon because of the high reviews.  Looks like shipping might take a while, in the meantime THIS IS A WINNER!!!  If you have facial hair, you won&#x27;t regret going with this razor!!  What a difference this shaving makes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the fact that these razors also provide some exfoliation is a win-win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note, I have not had my hair grow in any differently since using this.  It&#x27;s still light hair as always.  It&#x27;s not thicker OR coarser.  So no worries on that!  If you were to use a regular shaver - Bic or any of the legshavers then you would have a problem with thick, coarse re-growth.  But with these instruments, BEAUTIFUL!)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without the Kai Touch N Brow! I have been using them for years and I have found nothing else that even compares to them.  I order them often and use them daily! They work great on the brow area or anywhere on the face. Trust me, there is no other product on the face of this earth that even come close to this product.</li>
            <li> Never had to shave in my life but when I was told it would be a good idea I looked for options. First, was peel and stick sheets which nearly took my skin off. My beautician gave me a set of these shavers and what a difference. Cleans the baby fuzz off easely with no nicks or scuffs. When hair grows back it&#x27;s not dark, course, or excessive - just the same baby fuzz. Just love this shaver.</li>
            <li> terrible waste of money</li>
            <li> I mistakenly bought these thinking they were the brand &amp;#34;Tinkle&amp;#34;. They are definitely better than some you find in grocery stores.</li>
            <li> the price on these use to be really good now its gone up way too much. Looking for another supplier.</li>
            <li> Came in early! Works great!</li>
