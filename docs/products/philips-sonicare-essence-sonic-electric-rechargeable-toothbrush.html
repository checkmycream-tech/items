            <li>Works perfect :)</li>
            <li>However, it works great, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t mind the maintenance, it&#x27;s a good option.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really good tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I chose to buy from good companies, not sleazy ones.</li>
            <li>A good product but not if you have arthritis in your hands.</li>
            <li>Its quality is great and i am really satisfied.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, love it.</li>
            <li>Love my Soniccare!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>works much better than a manual!</li>
            <li>I admit that it is my own fault</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of different electronic toothbrushes, and I think this one is the best for the price.  </li>
            <li>I love this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with the way the Sonic care toothbrush cleans teeth.</li>
            <li>I love gadgets, and this is just another gadget that I&#x27;ve incorporated in to my life that works</li>
            <li>I would have paid more if I had known.</li>
            <li>This, along with &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; mouthwash, keeps my gums healthy.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m using it twice a day for better oral health.</li>
            <li>I purchased another because I have so many of the brush replacements.  </li>
            <li>Since most of the world uses 220 electric rather than 110, why isn&#x27;t the charger dual voltage?</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I really did help me improve my gums issues and the dentist is happy about that</li>
            <li>This is a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Use every day, love it.</li>
            <li>My son brushes SOOOOO much better now.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of periodontal problems, and this is the perfect toothbrush (as long as I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; !!).</li>
            <li>What more do you want than clean shiny teeth and healthy gums?  </li>
            <li>Been working great so far</li>
            <li>I like the shape of the Sonicare toothbrush head better than I do the Oral B, and I think it is more powerful yet gentler than the Oral B.</li>
            <li>and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Works fine as claimed.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the toothbrush is fine.</li>
            <li>arrived on time and works fine</li>
            <li>Fine.</li>
            <li>Does a great job...can feel the difference with the extra power.</li>
            <li>But, since I now understand the process, I enjoy using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how good it helps next dentist visit, so far so good leaves teeth feeling much clean!</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>and i fell in love with it from the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>My teeth never felt so clean before.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean like the dentist.</li>
            <li>Clean it or replace it.</li>
            <li>Very user friendly, leaves teeth feeling very clean and well polished.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cleaned it, verified the charger works and charged it for two full days.</li>
            <li>Our 6 and 9 year old are thrilled with these &amp;#34;zizzy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>a quick warning: If you turn this on before you put in in your mouth, toothpaste and water will go everywhere.</li>
            <li>There is already a timer for 2 minute shut-off, this is a beeper/buzzer mechanism, I am 100% sure that all the  electronics are inside to provide the quadrant timer, and Philips went out of their way to disable it via their internal software, all so they could up-sell to a more profitable model.</li>
            <li>Works great, teeth feel like just had a cleaning after brushing with sonicare brush, love the two minute feature so that you know you are brushing long enough.</li>
            <li>Its pretty powerful and because of its power output, I feel extremely clean and refresh after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What really gets my goat is that Philips could have provided this important health feature with zero added expense, but deliberately chose not to.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money</li>
            <li>Just like my old one that I owned for more than 15 years, I should get another 15 years from this one...</li>
            <li>I love it, just like my old one that quit.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my old one that died after more than 7 years.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and my dental hygienist highly recommends it.</li>
            <li>I returned it right away.  </li>
            <li>I can reach the back teeth better and and able to keep the brush in place to really clean my back teeth.</li>
            <li>Same great quality as the last one.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses it every day and likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Works fine easy to use and just as good as the earlier, much more expensive Sonicares</li>
            <li>Yesterday, was the first day I had to plug the unite in since I received the toothbrush over a month ago.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my dentist recommended .</li>
            <li>it has a big brush head to cover more</li>
            <li>This was helpful in judging how to progress with the brushing and making sure everything was brushed at the end of the two minutes.</li>
            <li>likewise, when removing the toothbrush, turn it off first.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to a friend :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally bought it</li>
            <li>The Series 2 model (and above models, except for the &amp;#34;Healthy White&amp;#34; I believe) say they are 6X better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted 16 years.</li>
            <li>So, when the first one died, I bought another one.</li>
            <li>Considering this model cost more than a similar model that didn&#x27;t have a travel pouch, I&#x27;m pretty pissed.</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare lasted about 8 years.  </li>
            <li>After the initial adjustment period, you will love it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what one person needs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sleep deprived new mom with a deployed hubs who ended up with a face full of toothpaste...</li>
            <li>,I can actually see a very noticeable difference in my teeth vs a regular toothbrush, but I think it makes brushing your teeth a lot more interesting.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this, but just make sure you only turn it on and off INSIDE your mouth.</li>
            <li>really, really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is too bulky and takes up too much room.</li>
            <li>came fast.  </li>
            <li>really cleans your teeth  .</li>
            <li>and I can really feel the effects.  </li>
            <li>I really think that not only does this toothbrush clean your teeth really well</li>
            <li>It is much better than the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; I had previously.</li>
            <li>I more or less get fooled.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this type of tooth brush (this one particular model).</li>
            <li>is, according to the packaging, it&#x27;s only 2X better at cleaning your teeth of tarter over manual brushing as the next model up is.</li>
            <li>Love this little toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is a good toothbrush but not great.</li>
            <li>Have been using a rotary rechargeble for over 20 years so this is a new experience.</li>
            <li>They vibrate at a high frequency, a loud hum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars because the first one broke after just 2 years of use.  </li>
            <li>My first Sonicare finally gave up the ghost, and this is my replacement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those that have crooked teeth like me, it has enough power to clean it up in one attempt</li>
            <li>But this is clearly a company that does not care about their customer&#x27;s health, just the bottom line.</li>
            <li>The old model has a designer flaw.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for an old one.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace a 5+ year old model that just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore</li>
            <li>old one lasted 15 years,</li>
            <li>/&gt;2 - Price of brush heads - these screw on brush heads for the Essense are more expensive to replace than for the higher end models of Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- Last, but definitely NOT least - The biggest reason I would not recommend this model</li>
            <li>Expect the same of my new one.  </li>
            <li>had to finally buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>The brush works by resonating, and any gunk makes it much less powerful.</li>
            <li>It was several years old!</li>
            <li>This is where the seal is not tight enough.</li>

            <li> and I can really feel the effects.  </li>
            <li> I really think that not only does this toothbrush clean your teeth really well</li>
            <li> It is much better than the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; I had previously.</li>
            <li> I more or less get fooled.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this type of tooth brush (this one particular model).</li>
            <li> is, according to the packaging, it&#x27;s only 2X better at cleaning your teeth of tarter over manual brushing as the next model up is.</li>
            <li> Love this little toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a good toothbrush but not great.</li>
            <li> Have been using a rotary rechargeble for over 20 years so this is a new experience.</li>
            <li> They vibrate at a high frequency, a loud hum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars because the first one broke after just 2 years of use.  </li>
            <li> My first Sonicare finally gave up the ghost, and this is my replacement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those that have crooked teeth like me, it has enough power to clean it up in one attempt</li>
            <li> But this is clearly a company that does not care about their customer&#x27;s health, just the bottom line.</li>
            <li> The old model has a designer flaw.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an old one.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a 5+ year old model that just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore</li>
            <li> old one lasted 15 years,</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 - Price of brush heads - these screw on brush heads for the Essense are more expensive to replace than for the higher end models of Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - Last, but definitely NOT least - The biggest reason I would not recommend this model</li>
            <li> Expect the same of my new one.  </li>
            <li> had to finally buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> The brush works by resonating, and any gunk makes it much less powerful.</li>
            <li> It was several years old!</li>
            <li> This is where the seal is not tight enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few issues I have with this particular</li>
            <li> My son was NOT brushing long enough.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> : The base is still kind of bigger than what I am used to with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Have used one for nearly as long as they have been on the market and can&#x27;t travel without one!</li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning your teeth, but as others have noted, the handle collects fluids and gets disgusting and moldy inside so needs constant cleaning.</li>
            <li> When you brush with this you can just feel things shaking loose from between your teeth,</li>
            <li> My previous ones had four 30 second time periods separated by a momentary stop.</li>
            <li> works well but handle a little big for an arthritic hand.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t realised that this model is missing a key feature we expect in rechargeable toothbrushes - does not notify you every 20 or 30 seconds to relocate the brush.</li>
            <li> Since the same info materials are used for all Sonicare toothbrushes, it took me some time to realise my toothbrush wasn&#x27;t broken but that his model simply did not have what I consider to be an essential feature.</li>
            <li> The test is to wet the brush and turn it on.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I do like Sonicare and think it works well.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake on the other review.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have the timer as my other one, but less costly.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get accustomed to it, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> it loosening fillings and crowns due to the ultrasonic vibs!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Series 2 is no more expensive than this model, plus the replacement brush heads are considerably cheaper to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of a no brainer - get a Sonicare Series 2 or above!</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s way less costly than the newer models, so</li>
            <li> My previous one lasted me over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect previously used a competitive brand.</li>
            <li> Brush head is quite small and it doesn&#x27;t have quadriant timer for brushing like my previous model.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m going to keep it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this one yet.  </li>
            <li> The heads need to be removed and rinsed at least weekly, and gelatin from the toothpaste will seep in and gunk it up.</li>
            <li> Engine a bit slow but does the job after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t read the description closely enough, but I am still very disappointed this model does NOT have the 30 second, quadrant timer feature.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether there is something wrong with it, or not.  </li>
            <li> I solved the gross-gunk problem by taking a disposable glove, cutting off one finger, cutting a small hole in the tip of the finger, and slipping it over the toothbrush, covering the space where the brush and handle connect.</li>
            <li> I find out that, disappointingly, this one have a little to do with plaque control, but rather gum health.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a few months &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> It works but makes a weird noise when I push the on button.  </li>
            <li> It works as well as the expensive Sonicare.</li>
            <li> They are expensive, so try soaking overnight in water, then shaking or tapping.</li>
            <li> I was totally skeptical.</li>
            <li> FAIL.</li>
            <li> Disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Repalcement heads are very expensive..........</li>
            <li> SOOO disappointed.</li>
            <li> After about 3 months of use, the parts becomes very filthy.</li>

            <li> this is the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; sonicare. It does a great job cleaning your teeth, but as others have noted, the handle collects fluids and gets disgusting and moldy inside so needs constant cleaning. Still, it&#x27;s way less costly than the newer models, so if you don&#x27;t mind the maintenance, it&#x27;s a good option. I solved the gross-gunk problem by taking a disposable glove, cutting off one finger, cutting a small hole in the tip of the finger, and slipping it over the toothbrush, covering the space where the brush and handle connect. This is where the seal is not tight enough. I then used medical tape to tighten the seal further. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Philips Sonicare Essence Rechargeable toothbrush for several weeks now and I like it. I can reach the back teeth better and and able to keep the brush in place to really clean my back teeth. Yesterday, was the first day I had to plug the unite in since I received the toothbrush over a month ago. I am really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My previous one lasted me over 10 years.  Expect the same of my new one.  I used to have problems with gum disease but since using my Sonicare I have impressed my dentist.</li>
            <li> What more do you want than clean shiny teeth and healthy gums?  This does it well.</li>
            <li> Has made a world of difference in my oral health.</li>
            <li> Love this little toothbrush. It is very powerful and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different electronic toothbrushes, and I think this one is the best for the price.  I like the shape of the Sonicare toothbrush head better than I do the Oral B, and I think it is more powerful yet gentler than the Oral B.</li>
            <li> had to finally buy a new one.  this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Been using these for 10 years - need to replace about every 4 because of battery recharge limit</li>
            <li> Engine a bit slow but does the job after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those that have crooked teeth like me, it has enough power to clean it up in one attempt</li>
            <li> I would not buy this type of tooth brush (this one particular model). The water will build up in the part where the head connected with the bottom. This is a design flaw. I bought four for my family, one for each member. After about 3 months of use, the parts becomes very filthy. The water has nowhere to go so the toothbrush will smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to replace them all with a newer model, (Philips Sonicare 2 Series Plaque Control Rechargeable Toothbrush). This one never build up the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy an electric tooth brush, buy the newer model. The old model has a designer flaw.</li>
            <li> Have had it for over a month now.  Holds a charge for a long, long time.  Does a great job.  Ansolutely no complaints.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Works fine as claimed.  This doesn&#x27;t have the timer as my other one, but less costly.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get accustomed to it, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> works well but handle a little big for an arthritic hand.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my dentist recommended . Good price and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I thought the toothbrush would beep after each quadrant was brushed. The details when I ordered the unit were unclear.</li>
            <li> I love this electric toothbrush. I ordered it because my dentist told me i should get one and i fell in love with it from the first time i used it. Its worth the money and i would re-order it if mine breaks. Its quality is great and i am really satisfied.</li>
            <li> It was an awesome gift I love it! It came just in time for fathers day</li>
            <li> Have been using a rotary rechargeble for over 20 years so this is a new experience. Not sure if I&#x27;m going to keep it. I&#x27;m concernedwith it loosening fillings and crowns due to the ultrasonic vibs! Repalcement heads are very expensive..........</li>
            <li> Use it-you will get a great &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> Its pretty powerful and because of its power output, I feel extremely clean and refresh after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Power and it has a big brush head to cover more area.&lt;br /&gt;Con: The base is still kind of bigger than what I am used to with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with the way the Sonic care toothbrush cleans teeth. This is my third one over probably twenty years. My previous ones had four 30 second time periods separated by a momentary stop. This was helpful in judging how to progress with the brushing and making sure everything was brushed at the end of the two minutes. This one does not have that feature and goes for two minutes without the 30 second intervals.</li>
            <li> My teeth never felt so clean before.  Can&#x27;t wait to hear what my dental hygienist says about it.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  My teeth feel clean like the dentist.</li>
            <li> The only thing this unit doesn&#x27;t have is the 30-second alerts.  I just keep brushing until it stops.  Don&#x27;t have to think about it anymore.</li>
            <li> Just like my old one that I owned for more than 15 years, I should get another 15 years from this one...What a value</li>
            <li> used them for years, great product!</li>
            <li> I really think that not only does this toothbrush clean your teeth really well,I can actually see a very noticeable difference in my teeth vs a regular toothbrush, but I think it makes brushing your teeth a lot more interesting. I love gadgets, and this is just another gadget that I&#x27;ve incorporated in to my life that works really, really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick warning: If you turn this on before you put in in your mouth, toothpaste and water will go everywhere. Put the toothbrush in your mouth and then turn it on. likewise, when removing the toothbrush, turn it off first.</li>
            <li> Does a great job...can feel the difference with the extra power.</li>
            <li> This rechargeable toothbrush does a great job in cleaning my teeth.  It took me a while to get used to taking it out of my mouth without splattering toothpaste all over my clothes and the sink.  But, since I now understand the process, I enjoy using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is the second Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Toothbrush I have owned.  I am not sure about this one yet.  It works but makes a weird noise when I push the on button.  I am not sure whether there is something wrong with it, or not.  Time will tell I guess.</li>
            <li> I love it, just like my old one that quit. It was several years old!</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare is excellent! Didn&#x27;t know what to expect previously used a competitive brand.</li>
            <li> Replacement unit for same Sonicare purchased 4 years ago.  Husband uses it and is happy.</li>
            <li> Mine broke within a week of purchase! It just turns itself off after 10 seconds. I&#x27;ve cleaned it, verified the charger works and charged it for two full days. What a piece of junk, getting my money back.</li>
            <li> Love my Soniccare!  Have used one for nearly as long as they have been on the market and can&#x27;t travel without one!</li>
            <li> Our 6 and 9 year old are thrilled with these &amp;#34;zizzy&amp;#34; toothbrushes.  We have noticed an immediate and lasting difference in the whiteness of their teeth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really good tooth brush. The only think is that I thought that it has a timing set.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and my dental hygienist highly recommends it. My last cleaning showed an improvement in my gum health.</li>
            <li> This works superbly! Very user friendly, leaves teeth feeling very clean and well polished.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it every day and likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush, cleans way better than a manual brush ever could. Would definitely recommend to a friend :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way cheaper than the others from the same brand and works just as well.  I like it alot.</li>
            <li> This brush is too bulky and takes up too much room.</li>
            <li> Everyone with a Sonicare always raved about them, and now I see why.  When you brush with this you can just feel things shaking loose from between your teeth, things that only got out with a stubborn flossing before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this, but just make sure you only turn it on and off INSIDE your mouth.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t realised that this model is missing a key feature we expect in rechargeable toothbrushes - does not notify you every 20 or 30 seconds to relocate the brush. It didn&#x27;t indicate in the Amazon ad and even on the Philips Sonicare info materials that it did not do so. Since the same info materials are used for all Sonicare toothbrushes, it took me some time to realise my toothbrush wasn&#x27;t broken but that his model simply did not have what I consider to be an essential feature. I would have paid more if I had known. Otherwise, the toothbrush is fine.</li>
            <li> My dentist thinks I floss daily. This, along with &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; mouthwash, keeps my gums healthy. This is the lowest cost version of Sonicare. It works as well as the expensive Sonicare. They vibrate at a high frequency, a loud hum. Compare sanding a piece of wood by hand to using a power sander. This is a similar principle. It runs for 2 minutes, so you don&#x27;t rush through it. The heads need to be removed and rinsed at least weekly, and gelatin from the toothpaste will seep in and gunk it up. The brush works by resonating, and any gunk makes it much less powerful. The test is to wet the brush and turn it on. If the water does not shake off the bristles in a second, the head has a problem. Clean it or replace it. They are expensive, so try soaking overnight in water, then shaking or tapping.</li>
            <li> Been working great so far</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, love it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist so I&#x27;m using it twice a day for better oral health.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a few months &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> My family uses the Sonicare regularly.  I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars because the first one broke after just 2 years of use.  My sister has her Oral B electric toothbrushes for over 10 years.  I would expect them to last longer.  I purchased another because I have so many of the brush replacements.  Other than that, I do like Sonicare and think it works well.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare finally gave up the ghost, and this is my replacement. I have a lot of periodontal problems, and this is the perfect toothbrush (as long as I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; !!). I just let the rotating brush do the work. Great product.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an old one.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake on the other review.  I reviewed the brush heads and not the toothbrush itself.  Since most of the world uses 220 electric rather than 110, why isn&#x27;t the charger dual voltage?</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Sonicare years ago. I&#x27;m glad I finally bought it and Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> this is the only toothbrush that I use.  came fast.  I love it</li>
            <li> This is a good toothbrush but not great. I started using this model after being convinced by my dentist. I really did help me improve my gums issues and the dentist is happy about that and so am I. I have used this one since 2008 and it is still going strong. I always store it in the charger when I am not using it and I have had NO problems with the unit so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few issues I have with this particular model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Gunk &amp; slime - this gross black/grey gunk stuff accumulates up inside the brush head over time. I resorted to unscrewing the brush head after every use, which helped. It did not eliminate the issue however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - Price of brush heads - these screw on brush heads for the Essense are more expensive to replace than for the higher end models of Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - Last, but definitely NOT least - The biggest reason I would not recommend this model is, according to the packaging, it&#x27;s only 2X better at cleaning your teeth of tarter over manual brushing as the next model up is. The Series 2 model (and above models, except for the &amp;#34;Healthy White&amp;#34; I believe) say they are 6X better than a manual toothbrush. The Sonicare Series 2 is no more expensive than this model, plus the replacement brush heads are considerably cheaper to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of a no brainer - get a Sonicare Series 2 or above!</li>
            <li> Works fine easy to use and just as good as the earlier, much more expensive Sonicares</li>
            <li> arrived on time and works fine</li>
            <li> Great price. Works great. Never go back to manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush. My first one lasted 16 years. So, when the first one died, I bought another one. Will it last 16 years also? I don&#x27;t know, but I knew I had to have another. It is much better than the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; I had previously.</li>
            <li> This is the basic Sonicare...does not have the 30 second &amp;#34;pacing&amp;#34; feature. However, it works great, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Brush head is quite small and it doesn&#x27;t have quadriant timer for brushing like my previous model.</li>
            <li> I was totally skeptical. Now I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular toothbrush. Love it! My teeth feel so clean!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uh, just remember to turn it off before you take it out of your mouth. I&#x27;m a sleep deprived new mom with a deployed hubs who ended up with a face full of toothpaste...</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a 5+ year old model that just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore (it happens to all batteries eventually) and I still had 6 E-Series replacement heads. I admit that it is my own fault, I didn&#x27;t read the description closely enough, but I am still very disappointed this model does NOT have the 30 second, quadrant timer feature. What really gets my goat is that Philips could have provided this important health feature with zero added expense, but deliberately chose not to. There is already a timer for 2 minute shut-off, this is a beeper/buzzer mechanism, I am 100% sure that all the  electronics are inside to provide the quadrant timer, and Philips went out of their way to disable it via their internal software, all so they could up-sell to a more profitable model. Yes, they are in business not to please customers but to make money, I understand this. Fine. But this is clearly a company that does not care about their customer&#x27;s health, just the bottom line. In 18 months, after I&#x27;ve used up my supply of replacement heads, I&#x27;ll be buying one of their competitor&#x27;s models and will never buy another Philips product. I chose to buy from good companies, not sleazy ones.</li>
            <li> On the official cite, the comparison between the products goes like this: http://www.usa.philips.com/etc/philips/b2c/compareproducts.html?locale&#x3D;en_US&amp;ctn&#x3D;HX6211/07,HX5611/01,HX6921/04 I find out that, disappointingly, this one have a little to do with plaque control, but rather gum health. As the Amazon page does not say it, I fee l I more or less get fooled. However, again Amazon cares customers and they let me return it even I have already used it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> SOOO disappointed. I got this for my son to take to college since we have Sonicare at home. The product info shows a travel pouch but it just arrived and there is no travel pouch. Considering this model cost more than a similar model that didn&#x27;t have a travel pouch, I&#x27;m pretty pissed. I would&#x27;ve just ordered the cheaper one had I known. FAIL.</li>
            <li> Works great. old one lasted 15 years, hope this one does as well.</li>
            <li> Works great, teeth feel like just had a cleaning after brushing with sonicare brush, love the two minute feature so that you know you are brushing long enough.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted about 8 years.  (It still works, just won&#x27;t hold a charge)  This toothbrush is the best.  It takes some getting used to.  After the initial adjustment period, you will love it.</li>
            <li> Been using this brand for 10 years. It is the BEST. Will save you trips to the dentist</li>
            <li> The product description states &amp;#34;Batteries 1 Lithium ion batteries required.&amp;#34; but the actual device says NiMH. I&#x27;m not bothering to return it, but I bought this model specifically because it claimed to use newer battery tech. You&#x27;d think you could rely on the basic facts in the product description, but not this time.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this took brush for my Wife and she loves it  . I plan on getting my children one next really cleans your teeth  .</li>
            <li> I returned it right away.  So noisy!</li>
            <li> Love this Sonicare!!  Bought this to replace my old one that died after more than 7 years.  Same great quality as the last one.  Leaves your teeth feeling like you just got them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how good it helps next dentist visit, so far so good leaves teeth feeling much clean!</li>
            <li> Use every day, love it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works perfect :)</li>
            <li> Great product.  Simple to use,  and I can really feel the effects.  I will be buying sonicares for my family.</li>
            <li> Exactly what one person needs</li>
            <li> This toothbrush just stopped working (it no longer will charge) after only 2 months.  Disappointment.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> A good product but not if you have arthritis in your hands.</li>
            <li> OH THANK HEAVENS!  My son was NOT brushing long enough.  Not not not.  At the recommendation from a friend who told me the brush goes for TWO minutes, I purchased.  My son brushes SOOOOO much better now.  In addition, the Sonicare brush is a great brush - his teeth have never looked so good!</li>
            <li> works much better than a manual!</li>
