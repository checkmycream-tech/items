            <li> Been using &amp;#34;5 day&amp;#34; 40 years and it is still the best on the market</li>
            <li> The deodorant arrived on time and is just as advertised.  I&#x27;m happy and will continue to shop through Amazon.com.  Thanks for the reliable service.</li>
            <li> Overpriced for one unit...Probably why none are available in there normally handled retail stores....</li>
            <li> I had used 5 Day for decades, but was unable to find it locally anymore. No other product works as well for me. So happy to have it again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, most deodorants were too perfumed and not effective in keeping me dry and clean smelling and their perfumes irritated my skin.  5 Day is the best underarm deodorant I have ever used.  Protection lasts all day and does not irritate my skin!  Yayyyyy!</li>
            <li> I have tried many deodorants on the market. I was a HBA buyer for 35 years and had access to all the new items from the largest makers in the country. But I still went back to this. No one can beat this formula. I always thought it was the name that hurt the marketing of this outstanding product and still do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you dont use it once every 5 days. Since this product has been around for so long I guess their original thought was if god forbid you could not shower for 5 days you would still smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I go again on the search for this item as I am almost out. But hey I have at least 10 days to go if I only use it twice....lol</li>
            <li> Only product that works for mr</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in the roll on, but I received the pads.  The pads work, but dry out after opening.  The whole point was to get the roll on. When you order, you should get what is pictured.</li>
            <li> It actually works. I must say, after using it for some months, I started using it daily (with a cold hair dryer) for it to work for me. But nothing for day usage has helped me like this.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant ever made.  Period!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the Best deodorant/antiperspirant available! I don&#x27;t glisten when I hike. I sweat-alot. So uncomfortable. 5 Day Fresh actually keeps me dry without any odor at all. Incredible. I&#x27;ve sold so many people on it w/o one complaint. I was devastated when Rite Aid stopped carrying it, &amp; I had to go back to being uncomfortably wet &amp; smelly w/ all the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength crap that does nothing for me. SO happy to find it on Amazon!! Trust me &amp; try it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even last 8 hours.</li>
            <li> The best deodorant. I have used this product for probably 30+ years and when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores I tried a number of products which I just wasn&#x27;t happy with. Some stained clothing, some caused irritation and some just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My wife enjoys using the product. The roll-on isn&#x27;t readily available in stores (typically the &amp;#34;pad&amp;#34; vesrion). Easy to use; lasts a long time. Convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with sweating. This is the first deodorant that has kept me dry all day. The pads work great too, but the roll on isn&#x27;t as messy.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years as it works for me.  I have tried many other brands over the years and they don&#x27;t work as well as 5 Day Antiperspirant Deodorant.</li>
            <li> My Mom&#x27;s favorite, I&#x27;ve come to count on the protection this deodorant. I&#x27;m trusting the roll-on will be just as effective as the pads Mom used for decades.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years and cannot buy it in stores in my area.  Every once in a while I try another name brand and they do not work good on me. 5 day keeps me dry and odorless all day. I just wish it was more available in my area.</li>
            <li> love this deodorant. easy to use! and it works!</li>
