            <li>This tri-section makeup brush holder is huge!</li>
            <li>Now all of her stuff is in there with room for more.</li>
            <li>Great product and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I thought that it would hold more though.</li>
            <li>I bought this to hold my make up brushes, and found more use for it than just those.</li>
            <li>It holds all of them and more.</li>
            <li>This are the most practical items for make up utensils....</li>
            <li>This is holds more than the picture would indicate.</li>
            <li>Feels sturdy and looks stylish.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>the plus is that the design makes my vanity look even more elegant.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s still more room..</li>
            <li>Better than I could have hoped and</li>
            <li>It holds more stuff than I thought it would</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It fits all 35 of my makeup brushes with I dare say room for a couple more.</li>
            <li>I wanted something attractive but something that didn&#x27;t draw too much attention.</li>
            <li>The acrylic material of which they&#x27;re made will not break any time soon, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I love how it accommodates shorter brushes and longer brushes as well.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this item.</li>

            <li>Very unique acrylic container for so many uses around the house esp in the bathroom</li>
            <li>This got here so quick and is so cute!</li>
            <li>it is because it looks so unique!</li>
            <li>The 3 compartments are tiered so really short brushes will fit perfectly too.</li>
            <li>Perfect organizer for brushes and other cosmetics. :)</li>
            <li>The drawer is filled with stuff that just wouldn&#x27;t be able to go anywhere else</li>
            <li>It is a great thick quality, and it looks beautiful no matter what you have in it.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and good looking, holds all my brushes.</li>
            <li>Everything fits perfectly, it takes up little space, and my make-up table is so much better organized.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to access the items in it.</li>
            <li>Strong material</li>
            <li>This organizer help me to put all my cosmetic and brushes and order, pretty nice equipment and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>its perfect for my small vanity in the guest bath and looks pretty good too</li>
            <li>The material is sturdy, it&#x27;s clean and crispy clear and looks great on my vanity.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to need three, but these two will do just fine.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quick!</li>
            <li>I like having all my brushes, pencils, lip glosses, shadow sticks, concealer sticks, hair brush, and more right in easy reach and view.</li>
            <li>Holds more than expected, the gf was happy with this brush, lip balm holder</li>
            <li>When ordering something acrylic online, there is always the danger that it will look cheap.</li>
            <li>Worth the money and stores many brushes.</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy like I have.</li>
            <li>It is not as useful as you would think, but you know that since you see it in the pic, plus it is better to have your stuff there look neat than on the counter of your bathroom.</li>
            <li>It does not look cheap</li>
            <li>All 37 MAC BRUSHES FIT</li>
            <li>But once I put my brushes in the the container(and saw that they fit) and sat it on my vanity table</li>
            <li>I can fit brushes in each holder, and they don&#x27;t topple out.</li>
            <li>It was my quest for organizers tools which lead me to this fabulous product.</li>
            <li>:) It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Very useful.  </li>
            <li>Clear, crisp and attractive.</li>
            <li>Love this so much!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth buying!</li>
            <li>I think it looks pretty stylish too.  </li>
            <li>I use it to hold small - medium size lotion bottles &amp; it works great keeping them contained in one area !!</li>
            <li>Great for long brushes!</li>
            <li>I use it to clean up my bathroom countertop by just keeping every day makeup out and putting the rest away for when I need it.</li>
            <li>It is made from top quality acrylic and looks very stylish and even like piece of modern art with all these curves and clear sides.</li>
            <li>Good size for tall and short brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall good stuff for what i paid</li>
            <li>Cool way to store all sizes of brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice clear plastic-acrylic material.</li>
            <li>I like the more modern twisty look to it.</li>
            <li>But then was very happy to discover that this small container held my truly gigantic makeup brush collection with room to spare!  </li>
            <li>Sturdy and super well-made.</li>
            <li>This item is super chic and durable.</li>
            <li>My hope is that I can get this out of my house with minimal money lost in the process :P</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Super useful makeup brush holder.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my holding my brushes with very short AND long handles.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m slowly moving to improve the quality (and quantity) of my storage - this is going to make a beautiful, durable, and unique addition.</li>
            <li>This Lumsing Top Quality Large Wavy Acrylic Makeup Brush and Cosmetic Holder is really a treasure for one who want to keep cosmetics in place.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box, I was pleasantly surprised at its quality and heft, and how elegant it looked.</li>
            <li>Of good quality, and was as expected.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and super easy to clean, which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li>The center (larger part) is ideal for all of your makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many cosmetic organizers, &amp; they never hold enough brushes, or they are never the right height.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty to look at too.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the pic..</li>
            <li>I love that it has 3 different heights/sizes of cylinders and how sleek and graceful it looks.</li>
            <li>looks exactly like on the picture.</li>
            <li>And I love that there are 3 different sized compartments.</li>
            <li>still use the one I purchased last year, and I&#x27;ve still yet to find a better way to hold my brushes.</li>
            <li>It looks so cute in the middle of my vanity surrounded by my perfumes.</li>
            <li>This item is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Wish I was more bigger</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted thank you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a few of these for gifts and they&#x27;ve loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a good weight and is sturdy, hence is not easy to tip over...</li>
            <li>Much smaller than expected, but looks great on my table anyway.</li>
            <li>I have all sorts of brushes from Mac, bare minerals to some from sephora and they all fit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as pretty as the picture and very convenient .</li>
            <li>I really love walking into the bathroom now and seeing everything neat and accessible; and because the two items that replaced the big wicker basket are acrylic (see through), the bathroom actually FEELS</li>
            <li>but it also seems like it could easily be given a different look with some stick on pearls or lace tape (for all you DIY-ers and arts and crafts folks out there)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up a large footprint on the counter.</li>
            <li>it fits all my brushes like 25 to 30 of them in the large  section and one side section with plenty of room.. and</li>
            <li>The plastic is very thick and iridescent - not hazy like some cheap acrylic containers can be - and makes a lovely artistic addition for any vanity/makeup/storage area.</li>
            <li>I really  love this, it holds my brushes nicely, and it&#x27;s small enough to not take up too much space.</li>
            <li>I filled mine with little beads to use as a Make up Brush holder and it works fine</li>
            <li>The medium opening I use for my Real Techniques brushes and the shortest opening holds my large collection of Nyx lip</li>
            <li>the material feels really hard and in good quality.</li>
            <li>as these brushes are very tall.</li>
            <li>I got it for my sister who really needed one.</li>
            <li>It fits everything really well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I started to use for my brushes with filler beads and it didn&#x27;t hold them very well however</li>
            <li>also It is very functional..</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>And it is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you have alot of brushes!</li>
            <li>(I got a lipstick holder with a whole bunch of square slots...</li>
            <li>I really like this make up brush holder.</li>
            <li>was very speedy.</li>
            <li>fast shipping 👍</li>
            <li>Not too heavy looks nice on my dresser.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this, very worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was excited that the main compartment is large enough to hold all my brushes plus a tube of hand cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly what I imagined, but I&#x27;m using it for way more stuff than I ever imagined.</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly on top of my other make-up organizer.</li>
            <li>So cute and this can hold all of my brushes and even other makeup products like mascara, eyeprimer, and concealer sticks.</li>
            <li>This holder has a larger footprint than I expected and is not as attractive with brushes and cosmetics in it as it is as a freestanding piece.</li>
            <li>It looks bigger in the picture than in real life, but the dimensions are accurate and I looked at a ruler before I bought it, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li>so I was constantly having to shuffle around a surface area full of primers, mascaras, foundation, etc.</li>
            <li>Was better then what I expected!!</li>
            <li>used to have a large wicker basket on top of the back of my toilet, but I&#x27;ve removed that and put this holder and an acrylic unit with drawers in its place.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend investing in one for your vanity table or bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>This is high end quality for sure!!!Love it😊</li>
            <li>I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>I can fit 13 brushes easily in the larger back section, 7 mascaras and 4 eyeliners in the front left portion and my sponge, eye brow brushes, and powder brush in the smaller front right section.</li>
            <li>I really love this little, yet sturdy, piece that holds my cosmetic brushes in one place.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the size of your hand and its nice and thick so</li>
            <li>The way they are designed, their lines and the lack of any unnecessary corners will make it easy to keep them clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to grab any brush due to the various angles at which the brushes can lay and the clear container makes it look abstract and pretty.</li>
            <li>The other two openings are relatively short so you won&#x27;t be able to use all three openings for TALL brushes.</li>
            <li>Keeps my makeup organized in such a pretty way.</li>
            <li>It fits a ton of brushes  and its pretty solid as well.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have a small vanity set in my bathroom and it sits perfectly on top and has plenty room for all my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>and it looked really nice, although the 2 small containers are too short for my brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to fit about 50 brushes in (a mixture of large barreled and small barreled brushes).</li>
            <li>large enough for my brushes</li>
            <li>clear and  sturdy  .</li>
            <li>B001JKTTVQ SHANY Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch,</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s room for 20 more at least.</li>
            <li>Stuff was constantly getting knocked over was reduced my desktop surface too much.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I was surprised by the size even though I read the measurements before I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Classy.</li>
            <li>but the two smaller &amp;#34;swirls&amp;#34; or holders have a small gap where the beads can fall out if you put to many in there.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and looks more expensive than it is.  </li>
            <li>I purchased two of these organizers and was surprised to find that they are bigger than they appear to be in the picture, a definite plus.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient on vanity &amp; very well made thick acrylic</li>
            <li>- I hated the hassle to try and return it, but thankfully the company got back to me and was apologetic and is currently trying to help me figure out what happened and see how we can best resolve this.</li>
            <li>holder is more expensive than I would have preferred but, since it is a quality product, it didn&#x27;t end up being a major fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bigger area in the back keep my brushes, the smaller left side for my beauty blenders, and in the small right side i have my lip, eyeliner, and eyebrow pencils and my tweezers hanging on the side.</li>
            <li>Its a very thick plastic,so it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.</li>
            <li>A little larger than I wanted but really keeps me organized.</li>

            <li> Now all of her stuff is in there with room for more.</li>
            <li> Great product and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I thought that it would hold more though.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold my make up brushes, and found more use for it than just those.</li>
            <li> It holds all of them and more.</li>
            <li> This are the most practical items for make up utensils....</li>
            <li> This is holds more than the picture would indicate.</li>

            <li> the plus is that the design makes my vanity look even more elegant.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s still more room..</li>
            <li> Better than I could have hoped and</li>
            <li> It holds more stuff than I thought it would</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It fits all 35 of my makeup brushes with I dare say room for a couple more.</li>
            <li> I wanted something attractive but something that didn&#x27;t draw too much attention.</li>
            <li> The acrylic material of which they&#x27;re made will not break any time soon, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I love how it accommodates shorter brushes and longer brushes as well.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> This got here so quick and is so cute!</li>
            <li> it is because it looks so unique!</li>
            <li> The 3 compartments are tiered so really short brushes will fit perfectly too.</li>
            <li> Perfect organizer for brushes and other cosmetics. :)</li>
            <li> The drawer is filled with stuff that just wouldn&#x27;t be able to go anywhere else</li>

            <li> I like having all my brushes, pencils, lip glosses, shadow sticks, concealer sticks, hair brush, and more right in easy reach and view.</li>
            <li> Holds more than expected, the gf was happy with this brush, lip balm holder</li>
            <li> When ordering something acrylic online, there is always the danger that it will look cheap.</li>
            <li> Worth the money and stores many brushes.</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy like I have.</li>
            <li> It is not as useful as you would think, but you know that since you see it in the pic, plus it is better to have your stuff there look neat than on the counter of your bathroom.</li>
            <li> It does not look cheap</li>
            <li> All 37 MAC BRUSHES FIT</li>
            <li> But once I put my brushes in the the container(and saw that they fit) and sat it on my vanity table</li>
            <li> I can fit brushes in each holder, and they don&#x27;t topple out.</li>
            <li> It was my quest for organizers tools which lead me to this fabulous product.</li>
            <li> :) It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very useful.  </li>
            <li> Clear, crisp and attractive.</li>
            <li> Love this so much!</li>

            <li> I think it looks pretty stylish too.  </li>
            <li> I use it to hold small - medium size lotion bottles &amp; it works great keeping them contained in one area !!</li>
            <li> Great for long brushes!</li>
            <li> I use it to clean up my bathroom countertop by just keeping every day makeup out and putting the rest away for when I need it.</li>
            <li> It is made from top quality acrylic and looks very stylish and even like piece of modern art with all these curves and clear sides.</li>
            <li> Good size for tall and short brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall good stuff for what i paid</li>
            <li> Cool way to store all sizes of brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice clear plastic-acrylic material.</li>

            <li> Sturdy and super well-made.</li>
            <li> This item is super chic and durable.</li>

            <li> Super useful makeup brush holder.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my holding my brushes with very short AND long handles.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m slowly moving to improve the quality (and quantity) of my storage - this is going to make a beautiful, durable, and unique addition.</li>
            <li> This Lumsing Top Quality Large Wavy Acrylic Makeup Brush and Cosmetic Holder is really a treasure for one who want to keep cosmetics in place.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I was pleasantly surprised at its quality and heft, and how elegant it looked.</li>
            <li> Of good quality, and was as expected.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and super easy to clean, which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> The center (larger part) is ideal for all of your makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many cosmetic organizers, &amp; they never hold enough brushes, or they are never the right height.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty to look at too.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the pic..</li>
            <li> I love that it has 3 different heights/sizes of cylinders and how sleek and graceful it looks.</li>
            <li> looks exactly like on the picture.</li>
            <li> And I love that there are 3 different sized compartments.</li>
            <li> still use the one I purchased last year, and I&#x27;ve still yet to find a better way to hold my brushes.</li>
            <li> It looks so cute in the middle of my vanity surrounded by my perfumes.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Wish I was more bigger</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few of these for gifts and they&#x27;ve loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a good weight and is sturdy, hence is not easy to tip over...</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected, but looks great on my table anyway.</li>
            <li> I have all sorts of brushes from Mac, bare minerals to some from sephora and they all fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as pretty as the picture and very convenient .</li>
            <li> I really love walking into the bathroom now and seeing everything neat and accessible; and because the two items that replaced the big wicker basket are acrylic (see through), the bathroom actually FEELS</li>
            <li> but it also seems like it could easily be given a different look with some stick on pearls or lace tape (for all you DIY-ers and arts and crafts folks out there)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up a large footprint on the counter.</li>
            <li> it fits all my brushes like 25 to 30 of them in the large  section and one side section with plenty of room.. and</li>
            <li> The plastic is very thick and iridescent - not hazy like some cheap acrylic containers can be - and makes a lovely artistic addition for any vanity/makeup/storage area.</li>
            <li> I really  love this, it holds my brushes nicely, and it&#x27;s small enough to not take up too much space.</li>
            <li> I filled mine with little beads to use as a Make up Brush holder and it works fine</li>
            <li> The medium opening I use for my Real Techniques brushes and the shortest opening holds my large collection of Nyx lip</li>
            <li> the material feels really hard and in good quality.</li>
            <li> as these brushes are very tall.</li>
            <li> I got it for my sister who really needed one.</li>
            <li> It fits everything really well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I started to use for my brushes with filler beads and it didn&#x27;t hold them very well however</li>
            <li> also It is very functional..</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> And it is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you have alot of brushes!</li>
            <li> (I got a lipstick holder with a whole bunch of square slots...</li>
            <li> I really like this make up brush holder.</li>
            <li> was very speedy.</li>
            <li> fast shipping 👍</li>
            <li> Not too heavy looks nice on my dresser.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this, very worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was excited that the main compartment is large enough to hold all my brushes plus a tube of hand cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I imagined, but I&#x27;m using it for way more stuff than I ever imagined.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on top of my other make-up organizer.</li>
            <li> So cute and this can hold all of my brushes and even other makeup products like mascara, eyeprimer, and concealer sticks.</li>
            <li> This holder has a larger footprint than I expected and is not as attractive with brushes and cosmetics in it as it is as a freestanding piece.</li>
            <li> It looks bigger in the picture than in real life, but the dimensions are accurate and I looked at a ruler before I bought it, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li> so I was constantly having to shuffle around a surface area full of primers, mascaras, foundation, etc.</li>
            <li> Was better then what I expected!!</li>
            <li> used to have a large wicker basket on top of the back of my toilet, but I&#x27;ve removed that and put this holder and an acrylic unit with drawers in its place.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend investing in one for your vanity table or bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This is high end quality for sure!!!Love it😊</li>
            <li> I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> I can fit 13 brushes easily in the larger back section, 7 mascaras and 4 eyeliners in the front left portion and my sponge, eye brow brushes, and powder brush in the smaller front right section.</li>
            <li> I really love this little, yet sturdy, piece that holds my cosmetic brushes in one place.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the size of your hand and its nice and thick so</li>
            <li> The way they are designed, their lines and the lack of any unnecessary corners will make it easy to keep them clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to grab any brush due to the various angles at which the brushes can lay and the clear container makes it look abstract and pretty.</li>
            <li> The other two openings are relatively short so you won&#x27;t be able to use all three openings for TALL brushes.</li>
            <li> Keeps my makeup organized in such a pretty way.</li>
            <li> It fits a ton of brushes  and its pretty solid as well.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have a small vanity set in my bathroom and it sits perfectly on top and has plenty room for all my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> and it looked really nice, although the 2 small containers are too short for my brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to fit about 50 brushes in (a mixture of large barreled and small barreled brushes).</li>
            <li> large enough for my brushes</li>
            <li> clear and  sturdy  .</li>
            <li> B001JKTTVQ SHANY Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch,</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s room for 20 more at least.</li>
            <li> Stuff was constantly getting knocked over was reduced my desktop surface too much.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was surprised by the size even though I read the measurements before I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Classy.</li>
            <li> but the two smaller &amp;#34;swirls&amp;#34; or holders have a small gap where the beads can fall out if you put to many in there.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and looks more expensive than it is.  </li>
            <li> I purchased two of these organizers and was surprised to find that they are bigger than they appear to be in the picture, a definite plus.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient on vanity &amp; very well made thick acrylic</li>
            <li> - I hated the hassle to try and return it, but thankfully the company got back to me and was apologetic and is currently trying to help me figure out what happened and see how we can best resolve this.</li>
            <li> holder is more expensive than I would have preferred but, since it is a quality product, it didn&#x27;t end up being a major fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bigger area in the back keep my brushes, the smaller left side for my beauty blenders, and in the small right side i have my lip, eyeliner, and eyebrow pencils and my tweezers hanging on the side.</li>
            <li> Its a very thick plastic,so it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.</li>
            <li> A little larger than I wanted but really keeps me organized.</li>
            <li> mainly use it for my night routine and for a few brushes if I need them in the day.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this holder as long as you keep in mind that the only tall opening is the center one.</li>
            <li> I was expecting some cheap plastic container, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s suprisingly heavy and atttractive clear acrylic.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s sort of like a medium quality plastic), and the 2 shorter compartments are a bit shorter than expected, but overall it does</li>
            <li> It even hold my brushes with extra wide handles.</li>
            <li> The small one is SUPER small.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this, but they sent me the wrong thing</li>
            <li> I put my roll brush and flat brush in the largest compartment and use the other compartments for styling products like shine spray and hair spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller</li>
            <li> I use the smaller 2 for my eye brushes and shorter brushes, and the larger one for the long-handled brushes (and I&#x27;ve got at least 25 brushes).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid acrylic, expensive looking and very functional.</li>
            <li> am using the tall center opening for my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy enough that I would never worry about it tipping over.</li>
            <li> I will attach a few pics so you can get an idea of how many each of these holds with thick handles, &amp; also thin handles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little less sturdy and solid than I was hoping</li>
            <li> Fits a lot of my brushes and other containers too</li>
            <li> I keep a stack of cosmetic cotton pads on one side, Q-tips on the other, and all my brushes in the largest compartment.  </li>
            <li> it holds my brushes and other items that I may need to get to quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had been using candle jars for my makeup brushes and small cylindrical makeup products (stick concealers daily eyeliners etc)</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, would def buy again if i need to...fits all my 15 brushes plus some other stuff like mascaras</li>
            <li> I actually use it for my toothbrush, toothpaste, brush and other odds and ends that usually find their way to his side of the counter.</li>
            <li> but it works to take the overflow from some of the other acrylic organizers my girlfriend has for makeup.</li>
            <li> This organizer is made of heavy duty acrylic that is 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick and looks like it will last me a very long time.  </li>
            <li> other small one I have put my Urban Decay, Estee Lauder etc eye liners with few lip and eyebrow pencils..</li>
            <li> have a small vanity with only one long shallow drawer.</li>
            <li> but I did not expect less for what I payed.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> I was unimpressed with the quality of some of the make-up storage containers I had previously purchased (not on Amazon).</li>
            <li> My husband will tell you, I am a mess.</li>
            <li> May be you know the feeling when sun&#x27;s ray highlighted the mess on your table and you think- I should organize it.</li>
            <li> Yes I do have at least 10 with wide handles.</li>
            <li> So much better then the stupid box I had before!</li>
            <li> and I was never able to use them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews and pictures posted here and was still not entirely sure it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be prepared, although the measurements are given, it&#x27;s really hard to determine the truth berth and weight of this wonder.</li>
            <li> Thick plastic</li>
            <li> I am slowly working on growing my makeup and storage abilities.</li>
            <li> It feels sturdy and was way less expensive than others that I have seen.</li>
            <li> I have approximately 24 brushes in the holder.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was shocked by how small it seemed.  </li>
            <li> I hold all my brushes in this bad boy and I have a LOT of brushes - at least 40-50.</li>
            <li> I use it for my dirty make up brushes and the side ones</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good size for tall and short brushes.</li>
            <li> love this nicely made</li>
            <li> Very Attractive. I like artistic design, especially important as I keep this on counter.</li>
            <li> Looks very nice on my bathroom counter and I can now easily find the brush I want without having to search through all the brushes in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Excellent and beautiful, I even dropped it down my steps by accident, no damage at all.</li>
            <li> When ordering something acrylic online, there is always the danger that it will look cheap. That was NOT an issue with this makeup holder. When I opened the box, I was pleasantly surprised at its quality and heft, and how elegant it looked. I love the design; it is both attractive and useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the tall center opening for my [[ASIN:B001JKTTVQ SHANY Professional 13-Piece Cosmetic Brush Set with Pouch, Set of 12 Brushes and 1 Pouch, Red]] as these brushes are very tall. The medium opening I use for my Real Techniques brushes and the shortest opening holds my large collection of Nyx lip pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a large wicker basket on top of the back of my toilet, but I&#x27;ve removed that and put this holder and an acrylic unit with drawers in its place. It looks so nice! I really love walking into the bathroom now and seeing everything neat and accessible; and because the two items that replaced the big wicker basket are acrylic (see through), the bathroom actually FEELS bigger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this holder as long as you keep in mind that the only tall opening is the center one. The other two openings are relatively short so you won&#x27;t be able to use all three openings for TALL brushes. You could use them for lipstick, nail polish, all kinds of things...just not anything too tall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holder is more expensive than I would have preferred but, since it is a quality product, it didn&#x27;t end up being a major fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.5 stars</li>
            <li> I like it a lot holds all my brushes and lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Loves it! Perfect holder for my makeup brushes, I used beans to ensure that the brushes would remain standing. I have approximately 24 brushes in the holder.</li>
            <li> Fits a lot of my brushes and other containers too</li>
            <li> as described. does the job.</li>
            <li> I keep a stack of cosmetic cotton pads on one side, Q-tips on the other, and all my brushes in the largest compartment.  Everything fits perfectly, it takes up little space, and my make-up table is so much better organized.</li>
            <li> love love love this!!!! its perfect for my small vanity in the guest bath and looks pretty good too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, fancy, and spacious. I got it for my sister who really needed one. Now all of her stuff is in there with room for more. It serves its purpose and is great for the price.</li>
            <li> I really love this little, yet sturdy, piece that holds my cosmetic brushes in one place.  I also use if for eyeliners, etc.  It looks great and keeps things organized!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for separating make brushes and looks extremely nice.</li>
            <li> Great product and very sturdy. Worth the money and stores many brushes.</li>
            <li> Keeps my makeup organized in such a pretty way. Love this so much!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and good looking, holds all my brushes. Plus the smallest section has saved my smaller/travel sized brushes, since they used to get lost in the brush cups that I used to have and I was never able to use them. I also use the smallest section to store my tweezers and scissors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neat. I thought that it would hold more though.</li>
            <li> the material feels really hard and in good quality.</li>
            <li> clear and  sturdy  . i use it for eye makeup tools  (liners, mascara and brushes) .</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my brushes and pencils.  It fits everything really well.  Its a very thick plastic,so it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold my make up brushes, and found more use for it than just those. The bigger area in the back keep my brushes, the smaller left side for my beauty blenders, and in the small right side i have my lip, eyeliner, and eyebrow pencils and my tweezers hanging on the side. Gives me more room in my makeup drawers and it looks great on top of any makeup storage containers you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> Fits all my brushes, hair brush and toothpaste perfectly. It&#x27;s an awesome space saver. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Perfect organizer for brushes and other cosmetics. :)</li>
            <li> I needed something to hold my makeup brushes, eyeliner, tweezers, etc. This acrylic holder does the job. It&#x27;s suprisingly heavy and atttractive clear acrylic. I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually using it as a pencil holder. It&#x27;s a little less sturdy and solid than I was hoping (it&#x27;s sort of like a medium quality plastic), and the 2 shorter compartments are a bit shorter than expected, but overall it does it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;s pretty to look at too. So I&#x27;m happy, considering the affordable price.</li>
            <li> Super useful makeup brush holder. I use the smaller 2 for my eye brushes and shorter brushes, and the larger one for the long-handled brushes (and I&#x27;ve got at least 25 brushes). It holds all of them and more. Easy to grab any brush due to the various angles at which the brushes can lay and the clear container makes it look abstract and pretty. Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Love it! large enough for my brushes</li>
            <li> This are the most practical items for make up utensils.... I would recommend this for anyone who uses a lot of make up brushes.</li>
            <li> Very cute and can fit many many brushes! Great buy. Perfect to fit face brushes, eyeshadow brushes, lipliners, lipglosses, whatever you have!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my makeup brushes. It holds all ove them and keeps them sorted how I like. Thick plastic and does not feel flimsy. It looks very nice on my vanity.</li>
            <li> The only reason it gets 4 stars from me is the shortness. I started to use for my brushes with filler beads and it didn&#x27;t hold them very well however, they&#x27;re a great holder for lip liners, eyeliners and I put my brow and eyelash utinsels in it. It&#x27;s great because it being clear makes it easy to find the colors beautifully! Yes I&#x27;d recommend because its durability. It&#x27;s the size of your hand and its nice and thick so in the event you dropped it you&#x27;ll have no worries. Hope you enjoy like I have. ;)</li>
            <li> Smaller  thn what i though  but it does the work. Overall good stuff for what i paid</li>
            <li> I love this make up brush holder! Reason i bought it is because it looks so unique! Everything fits perfectly and looks really nice</li>
            <li> This got here so quick and is so cute! Hold all of my brushes and then some... And I have a lot it brushes. Good size, good price, no hassle.</li>
            <li> This is holds more than the picture would indicate. It holds tons of brushes. I have about 20 brushes of all sizes in it and there&#x27;s room for 20 more at least. Doesn&#x27;t take up a large footprint on the counter. The 3 compartments are tiered so really short brushes will fit perfectly too.</li>
            <li> It is not as useful as you would think, but you know that since you see it in the pic, plus it is better to have your stuff there look neat than on the counter of your bathroom. It does not look cheap but I did not expect less for what I payed.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and no cracks or scratches.</li>
            <li> I am super happy with this product for the price. It stores a ton of brushes and pencils along with bigger items such as makeup remover, eyelash curler, nail tools etc. It feels sturdy and was way less expensive than others that I have seen. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Perfect size, doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my counter but holds all my brushes (probably like 15?) with room to spare. Feels sturdy and looks stylish. I love it.</li>
            <li> Cool way to store all sizes of brushes.</li>
            <li> Love this holder... very artistic.. and looks good on my vanity.. also It is very functional.. I just don&#x27;t use it for brushes.. I place my foundation, concealer in one holder.. great buy.. Highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size, looks attractive and holds all my brushes. I have three kabuki brushes in the tall section. I use one of the sections for eyeshadow primer and mascara. It&#x27;s heavy enough that I would never worry about it tipping over. If you like the appearance it&#x27;s worth buying!</li>
            <li> This is a life saver! My makeup is now organized because of this cosmetic holder. I was able to put some of my brushes in this holder. I love the shape and style of this holder. It is affordable and I would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> This is cute and small but not too small. I have all sorts of brushes from Mac, bare minerals to some from sephora and they all fit. I was also able to have my eyeliners on here.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT...All 37 MAC BRUSHES FIT and I still have room for more! This is a God Send and the plus is that the design makes my vanity look even more elegant.</li>
            <li> I hold all my brushes in this bad boy and I have a LOT of brushes - at least 40-50. The material is sturdy, it&#x27;s clean and crispy clear and looks great on my vanity. Perfect size, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good for so many items on my makeup table.</li>
            <li> I really  love this, it holds my brushes nicely, and it&#x27;s small enough to not take up too much space.</li>
            <li> Of good quality, and was as expected. I use it for my dirty make up brushes and the side ones I put my nail polish remover in. So it works great for me :-)</li>
            <li> I have multiple foundation, blush, shadow and eye liner brushes and this holds them all without smashing the bristles of the brushes together!</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the pic..If you are hesitating to get this,then don&#x27;t, I say just buy it and you won&#x27;t regret the decision.. it fits all my brushes like 25 to 30 of them in the large  section and one side section with plenty of room.. and other small one I have put my Urban Decay, Estee Lauder etc eye liners with few lip and eyebrow pencils.. and there&#x27;s still more room.. Well worth the price..</li>
            <li> Great for makeup brush storage. The small one is SUPER small. I use it to hold misc items like a lighter or scissors</li>
            <li> Excellent organizer for make up brushes.  A little larger than I wanted but really keeps me organized.</li>
            <li> Great for long brushes!</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This thing is BRILLIANT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a small vanity with only one long shallow drawer. The drawer is filled with stuff that just wouldn&#x27;t be able to go anywhere else so I was constantly having to shuffle around a surface area full of primers, mascaras, foundation, etc. Stuff was constantly getting knocked over was reduced my desktop surface too much. I purchased this based on the reviews and pictures posted here and was still not entirely sure it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does! Better than I could have hoped and I think it looks pretty stylish too.  It holds more stuff than I thought it would and it&#x27;s easy to access the items in it. The price is a very nice bonus and I&#x27;m tempted to order another (1) or (2) for brushes or pencils.</li>
            <li> Great size to hold brushes, eyeliners and much more.</li>
            <li> This is a great holder for brushes, liners, tubes, etc. The plastic is very thick and iridescent - not hazy like some cheap acrylic containers can be - and makes a lovely artistic addition for any vanity/makeup/storage area. Be prepared, although the measurements are given, it&#x27;s really hard to determine the truth berth and weight of this wonder. I am slowly working on growing my makeup and storage abilities. I was unimpressed with the quality of some of the make-up storage containers I had previously purchased (not on Amazon). They are already showing showing scratches and haze after just a month! As I&#x27;m slowly moving to improve the quality (and quantity) of my storage - this is going to make a beautiful, durable, and unique addition.</li>
            <li> This is actually a very stylish holder. I gave it a 4 because I think it is not tall enough for my make up brushes, but aside from that I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The design is nice it holds my brushes and other items that I may need to get to quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use it for my night routine and for a few brushes if I need them in the day. It looks very decorative and fits everything perfect. I had no problems with this seller and everything came on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller then it appears on the pic but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I imagined, but I&#x27;m using it for way more stuff than I ever imagined. I like having all my brushes, pencils, lip glosses, shadow sticks, concealer sticks, hair brush, and more right in easy reach and view.</li>
            <li> This is a great holder! I have several makeup brushes plus ALL my lip &amp; eyeliner pencils in it! Better for longer brushes (do read dimensions!) I love having this holder! Very convenient on vanity &amp; very well made thick acrylic</li>
            <li> I had been using candle jars for my makeup brushes and small cylindrical makeup products (stick concealers daily eyeliners etc) but when one of them broke, I bought this to replace the 2 glass jars I had going. I love that it has 3 different heights/sizes of cylinders and how sleek and graceful it looks. It&#x27;s a solid acrylic, expensive looking and very functional. It holds all my makeup brushes with room to spare. If you&#x27;re lookning for something to corral your brushes and products definitely get this.</li>
            <li> looks exactly like on the picture. I like it a lot, would def buy again if i need to...fits all my 15 brushes plus some other stuff like mascaras</li>
            <li> This Wavy Design is Unique &amp; looks great on my bathroom counter !  I use it to hold small - medium size lotion bottles &amp; it works great keeping them contained in one area !!</li>
            <li> I love my purchase! The center (larger part) is ideal for all of your makeup brushes. I use the side compartments for my perfume samples and various small-sized lotions. This cosmetic holder is the perfect solution to all of your daily utensils: eyelash curler, tweezers and all fit perfectly draped over the sides. I highly recommend investing in one for your vanity table or bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> My husband will tell you, I am a mess. We have a dual vanity and every day my stuff creeps closer and closer to his side. When I got this brush and cosmetic holder, he was thrilled. I was happy with the look. It&#x27;s so chic and goes perfectly with my bathroom decor, but it also keeps me organized! I actually use it for my toothbrush, toothpaste, brush and other odds and ends that usually find their way to his side of the counter. He&#x27;s happy. I&#x27;m happy. It&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on top of my other make-up organizer. Sturdy and super well-made. One of the front parts even holds my Clarisonic perfectly! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It fits all 35 of my makeup brushes with I dare say room for a couple more. Yes I do have at least 10 with wide handles. It&#x27;s as pretty as the picture and very convenient . No issue with cracks or imperfections.</li>
            <li> So much better then the stupid box I had before!</li>
            <li> Very unique acrylic container for so many uses around the house esp in the bathroom&lt;br /&gt;for toiletries or makeup ! I love mine !</li>
            <li> This makeup brush holder is great. I have tried so many cosmetic organizers, &amp; they never hold enough brushes, or they are never the right height. This one has it all! It even hold my brushes with extra wide handles. And I love that there are 3 different sized compartments. Perfect for my holding my brushes with very short AND long handles. And it is very sturdy. I&#x27;ve dropped it accidentally, &amp; it didn&#x27;t break. I highly recommend this if you have alot of brushes! ***Update! I now own 3 of these, I still love them. I will attach a few pics so you can get an idea of how many each of these holds with thick handles, &amp; also thin handles. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This holder has a larger footprint than I expected and is not as attractive with brushes and cosmetics in it as it is as a freestanding piece.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! It looks bigger in the picture than in real life, but the dimensions are accurate and I looked at a ruler before I bought it, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised. I use it to clean up my bathroom countertop by just keeping every day makeup out and putting the rest away for when I need it. It is very nice looking</li>
            <li> I was given this cosmetic organizer as a gift, but after seeing it, I would have purchased it myself just to get one.  I was expecting some cheap plastic container, but I was wrong.  This organizer is made of heavy duty acrylic that is 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick and looks like it will last me a very long time.  I was excited that the main compartment is large enough to hold all my brushes plus a tube of hand cream. I&#x27;m very happy with this organizer!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember buying this but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> I got this and it looked really nice, although the 2 small containers are too short for my brushes.</li>
            <li> really beautiful holder</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to put my hair brushes in and put it on my vanity table. I wanted something attractive but something that didn&#x27;t draw too much attention. When it arrived I was surprised by the size even though I read the measurements before I ordered it. I guess it just seemed larger in the picture. But once I put my brushes in the the container(and saw that they fit) and sat it on my vanity table I had no problems with it at all.  It looks great as is but it also seems like it could easily be given a different look with some stick on pearls or lace tape (for all you DIY-ers and arts and crafts folks out there)</li>
            <li> It works well to organize my makeup.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this, but they sent me the wrong thing (I got a lipstick holder with a whole bunch of square slots... maybe if I was a mary-kay consultant or something I could use it (lol) but I don&#x27;t even wear lipstick) - I hated the hassle to try and return it, but thankfully the company got back to me and was apologetic and is currently trying to help me figure out what happened and see how we can best resolve this. My hope is that I can get this out of my house with minimal money lost in the process :P bummer...</li>
            <li> I love this makeup brush holder! It&#x27;s the perfect addition to my vanity and helps me keep organized. I like that it can hold a number of products and brushes in a variety of sizes. It&#x27;s very sturdy and super easy to clean, which is a definite plus. It&#x27;s definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> Recieved this in good time.  I like this product.  hold every think I need and is made of sturdy quality material</li>
            <li> I can fit brushes in each holder, and they don&#x27;t topple out. It fits a ton of brushes  and its pretty solid as well.</li>
            <li> Cute! Love it! Strong material</li>
            <li> This is high end quality for sure!!!Love it😊</li>
            <li> I really like this make up brush holder. It&#x27;s design is very nice and holds all my brushes. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these organizers and was surprised to find that they are bigger than they appear to be in the picture, a definite plus.  The way they are designed, their lines and the lack of any unnecessary corners will make it easy to keep them clean.  I thought I was going to need three, but these two will do just fine.  They&#x27;re beautiful and functional and the right size. The acrylic material of which they&#x27;re made will not break any time soon, I&#x27;m sure. I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> May be you know the feeling when sun&#x27;s ray highlighted the mess on your table and you think- I should organize it. It was my quest for organizers tools which lead me to this fabulous product. This Lumsing Top Quality Large Wavy Acrylic Makeup Brush and Cosmetic Holder is really a treasure for one who want to keep cosmetics in place. It is made from top quality acrylic and looks very stylish and even like piece of modern art with all these curves and clear sides. It also has a great price for me. I definitely recommend this, very worth the money.</li>
            <li> The wife loved it awesome</li>
            <li> love it! i use it for my lip liners, brow pencils &amp; eyeliners!</li>
            <li> This organizer help me to put all my cosmetic and brushes and order, pretty nice equipment and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few of these for gifts and they&#x27;ve loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use the one I purchased last year, and I&#x27;ve still yet to find a better way to hold my brushes. I love how it accommodates shorter brushes and longer brushes as well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product for your vanity. As it turned out, I did not end up using this for brushes but it makes a great holder for hair products. I put my roll brush and flat brush in the largest compartment and use the other compartments for styling products like shine spray and hair spray. It keeps things neat and organized and I can see everything. I also does not use a lot of space.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Was better then what I expected!!</li>
            <li> This item is super chic and durable. It looks so cute in the middle of my vanity surrounded by my perfumes. I use it to hold make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick! Great quality!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality! Clear, crisp and attractive. I use this to hold all my pens, pencils, etc on my desk. Would look attractive to any make-up collection! This product is eye-appealing and can be on any counter, table or desk.</li>
            <li> Wow! a great way to have brushes, etc. in a neat space.</li>
            <li> Love it. I use each of the three holders for different sized makeup brushes. Much smaller than expected, but looks great on my table anyway.</li>
            <li> Very attractive.  Sized well for makeup brushes and cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this item. It is a great thick quality, and it looks beautiful no matter what you have in it. Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this, it looks nice on my vanity. It&#x27;s large enough to fit about 50 brushes in (a mixture of large barreled and small barreled brushes). It&#x27;s a nice clear plastic-acrylic material. I will say the design kind of makes all the brushes come together if you have a lot of brushes in each compartment.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy looks nice on my dresser.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was shocked by how small it seemed.  But then was very happy to discover that this small container held my truly gigantic makeup brush collection with room to spare!  I am so happy I bought this!</li>
            <li> It perfectly fits on my vanity and gives that chicness that you really can never get from an acrylic holder. I filled mine with little beads to use as a Make up Brush holder and it works fine but the two smaller &amp;#34;swirls&amp;#34; or holders have a small gap where the beads can fall out if you put to many in there.</li>
            <li> This makeup holder is just what I needed. It is very nicely designed and holds lots of makeup brushes and supplies. Now my vanity table looks neat and organized with this holder and that means I can find just what I need without rummaging through a big pile of brushes and makeup on my table. Looks really nice too! :) It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Classy. elegant and holds makeup brushes flawlessly. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Fits my brushes, lipsticks, mascara, etc. perfectly and doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what I needed.  It is very sturdy and looks more expensive than it is.  It looks like it is made of glass rather than acrylic.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very speedy.</li>
            <li> This product is a great product. Very elegant on my dresser and it serves the purpose well. It has a good weight and is sturdy, hence is not easy to tip over...I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my vanity. I have a small vanity set in my bathroom and it sits perfectly on top and has plenty room for all my makeup brushes. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> A fairly solid piece of acrylic. It is not big so you can&#x27;t put tons of stuff in there but it works to take the overflow from some of the other acrylic organizers my girlfriend has for makeup. She likes it.</li>
            <li> This tri-section makeup brush holder is huge! I can fit 13 brushes easily in the larger back section, 7 mascaras and 4 eyeliners in the front left portion and my sponge, eye brow brushes, and powder brush in the smaller front right section. There is still room to spare! This makeup brush holder is made of acrylic and is heavier than I thought it would be. Great quality and very useful!</li>
            <li> Holds more than expected, the gf was happy with this brush, lip balm holder</li>
            <li> Very nice holder for my cosmetics.  I like the more modern twisty look to it.</li>
            <li> So cute and this can hold all of my brushes and even other makeup products like mascara, eyeprimer, and concealer sticks.</li>
            <li> Love this item.  Better than described - quality is wonderful.  Very useful.  Will order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! I am so glad I bought it! Because everything is so much more organized! I got a sections for brushes and another for my lip liners and brow pencils! I recommend! I think the price is 5 stars too! Wish I was more bigger so I could fit more! Lol but it fits a good amount so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Love it for organizing makeup</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted thank you</li>
            <li> very big and lots of space. i love it. fast shipping 👍</li>
