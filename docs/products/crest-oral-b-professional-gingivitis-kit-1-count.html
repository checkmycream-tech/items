    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>so you can try a variety to find what works best for you.</li>
            <li>An excellent buy!</li>
            <li>Excellent electric tooth brush with oral health kit!</li>
            <li>If you do not like any alcohol based mouthwash, then Crest Pro Health Rinse is an excellent alternative.</li>
            <li>If you do not like any alcohol based mouthwash, then Crest Pro Health Rinse is an excellent alternative.</li>
            <li>If you know someone fighting gingivitis, this would make an excellent gift.</li>
            <li>Superb!</li>
            <li>There is a selection of four brush heads included, and I like the spinning head the best.  </li>
            <li>This is a great gift!</li>
            <li>Everything is included to get started and the way the kit is put together is very attractive.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t come with that brush head) because with the amount of power it puts out,  that brush head should work very good.</li>
            <li>If my dentist offered this kit at a good price I&#x27;s snap it up in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li>Includes everything needed - a great gift for college students.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great system.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste, floss and mouthwash that come with this set are also really great.  </li>
            <li>mouthwash is great for gums.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B 5000 is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>will do a great job for you.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is great.</li>
            <li>This would be a great gift or a nice item to pick up for yourself!</li>
            <li>But the star of the kit, the best thing about it for sure, is the enclosed clock and brushing &amp;#34;meter&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to add this to your gift list as it&#x27;s perfect for gift-giving.</li>

            <li>Works great, plenty of power, easy to use, love the brush!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happily using a series 4000 for over a year now and was thrilled to have a chance to try out this kit which includes the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>GREAT for kids, but really nice for adults, too.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it seems like a good toothpaste.</li>
            <li>you are going to invest in a good toothbrush, this is THE ONE to buy.</li>

            <li>As stated, it is superior than manual brushing.</li>
            <li>They are clearly good products that can help your oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;Overall VERY pleased with this kit.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>course, the star of the set is the amazing electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Totally amazing to me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Totally amazing to me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro-Health mouthwash is alcohol free, but seems to do a great job of keeping my mouth germ-free.  </li>

            <li>all, a great set that would be better if it were more affordable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice as it contains no alcohol and keeps your breath feeling nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes a nice packaging for gift</li>
            <li>This makes a nice packaging for gift</li>
            <li>Included is a nice travel case with storage for two heads.</li>
            <li>I liked the floss, toothpaste and mouthwash and have repurchased all of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But let&#x27;s be honest, brushing around the gum line when you have Gingivitis causes bleeding and can leave it feeling tender, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and convenient to know I have a selection of brush heads to choose from rather than hoping my one toothbrush could hopefully get all the jobs</li>
            <li>NIce kit for dental care.</li>
            <li>If you use your own preferred paste, floss, and mouthwash, then just purchase this electric tooth brush separately - it will be cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>If you use your own preferred paste, floss, and mouthwash, then just purchase this electric tooth brush separately - it will be cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The separate display portion is kind of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>the bundle is nice but it seems a pricey way to add toothpaste, rinse and floss.  </li>
            <li>Finally, The toothbrush comes with a great charging stand that also stores toothbrush heads; everything comes in a nice Crest faux fabric bag with a gifting name tag: great attention to detail!  </li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to try this Oral B Gingivitis Kit for that</li>
            <li>-a tooth brush that just turns off is just as effective</li>
            <li>No question the full bundle would make a great gift but if buying for myself I&#x27;d prefer to purchase the toothbrush separately from the accompanying products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whether it is more cost effective to buy the kit or the toothbrush alone, probably varies, but as a gift, the kit is really nice.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 is an excellent electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Honestly, in my mind, they are advertising more Crest products and should give these items away with every brush, not charge</li>
            <li>The perfect, complete package for that person that needs an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love the electric toothbrush - I had an old one that needed replacing and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is an amazing value and an awesome kit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an interesting concept and one that will help a lot of people brush more effectively.  </li>
            <li>The system is easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $50 for this set.  </li>
            <li>I love Braun&#x27;s Oral-B electric toothbrush line.</li>
            <li>He claims it does a much better job then the old-fashioned type of floss and can get into tighter spaces, leaving teeth and gums cleaner and healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He claims it does a much better job then the old-fashioned type of floss and can get into tighter spaces, leaving teeth and gums cleaner and healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She describes it as powerful and that it does a good job cleaning her teeth.  </li>
            <li>suffer from Gingivitis and my dentist is always pushing me to brush along the gum line and floss more.</li>
            <li>Supposedly the rapid movement cleans your teeth better than just moving a toothbrush around in your mouth manually.  </li>
            <li>I am convinced that &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; or vibrating toothbrushes are better than a manual toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>with the annoyance of the dripping fluids, I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>with the annoyance of the dripping fluids, I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>; kit are top notch products.  </li>
            <li>But I gave this one a try and am quite pleased, and will keep using it.</li>
            <li>The brush keeps a good charge for several days, so it is great for travel.</li>
            <li>I love this electric toothbrush and kit.  </li>
            <li>I love the timer that comes with this set.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I was able to try this out</li>
            <li>and I feel I am taking better care of it with this system.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is just wonderful and comes with plenty of heads for different cleaning/issues..</li>
            <li>If you have gum issues, or just want to take better care of your gums, this is the kit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Previously I was using Sonicare Diamondclean and I was in love with it.</li>
            <li>The smaller part of the head that moves separately is an awesome addition.</li>
            <li>I like that it is a more vigorous cleaning than with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not.</li>
            <li>I thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent system for improving daily dental cleaning and routines.  </li>
            <li>Certainly it is much, much better than the manual ones.</li>
            <li>To charge fully, you need to put it on the charger for more than 15 hours.</li>
            <li>To charge fully, you need to put it on the charger for more than 15 hours.</li>
            <li>I love being able to try them out.</li>
            <li>The Crest mouthwash has replaced Listerine as one of my staple hygiene products and the toothpaste has a nice, light minty flavor.  </li>
            <li>It’s wider too, so it does more every time you use it.</li>
            <li>that times your brushing in each quadrant, forcing you to take your time and brush more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B for years and didn&#x27;t think my experience could get much better.</li>
            <li>I expect when I see my dentist in a couple weeks he too will notice how much better my teeth and gums are looking.</li>
            <li>And, I have noticed a difference in his teeth which to me means everything because he is getting a better and deeper cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and/or someone who is experiencing some gum/teeth issues and a dentist has recommended a more thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The most interesting thing in the kit is the electronic “SmartGuide” device to assist with brushing technique that communicates wirelessly with the toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I did notice a better result.</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed the feedback from the device.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to receive one to review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be completely honest, if you&#x27;re interested in this toothbrush, just buy it on its own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great system and comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great system and comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Like my Sonicare, the toothbrush pauses and beeps when it&#x27;s time to move to a new area of your mouth which is a great feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really seems to do a great job of getting my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>The sensitive mode and brush head would also be great for children.</li>
            <li>Complete with toothpaste, floss and mouthwash, this would be a great gift.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The kit really doesn&#x27;t bring anything else good to the table.</li>
            <li>I noticed that there was also a whitening kit, which for the right person might make a nice gift, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The system is easy to use with the instructions.  </li>
            <li>And it is easy to hold being slim.</li>
            <li>brush tips change easily but don&#x27;t come off under use</li>
            <li>The device was easy to set the clock and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to think of it as a gimmick, but the smart guide is truly smart and a great way to get feedback and build better habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need to buy something for your traveling student?  </li>
            <li>but it is a good way to try new products or get everything you need with one purchase.</li>
            <li>biggest gripe with my Sonicare is that sometimes it doesn&#x27;t clean as effectively as I&#x27;d like right up by my gum line.</li>
            <li>I like them all fine.</li>
            <li>so it is comfortable and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>I like a bit more bold mint flavor</li>
            <li>I like a bit more bold mint flavor</li>
            <li>I have been using glide for years as it works best with my teeth which are a little close</li>
            <li>The rechargeable battery is replaceable - this is huge</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is one of those issues that will remedy itself as I get used to this brush but thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is packaged with separate covered case for 4 brush heads that can fit around the charger.  </li>
            <li>The brush grip is comfortable.</li>
            <li>I also like the variety of heads available.  </li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t get them to fit</li>
            <li>It has five cleaning modes with multiple heads and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>fit</li>
            <li>I find this very useful as I brush.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>I find this very useful as I brush.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>The 7000 was very impressive and the first Oral B to really make me switch from Sonicare, but just too loud.</li>
            <li>The 7000 was very impressive and the first Oral B to really make me switch from Sonicare, but just too loud.</li>
            <li>Sonicare brushes work by emitting a sonic vibration that vibrates the bristles quickly, cleaning your teeth far more effectively than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have a charger with an integrated flip up 4 brush tower holder that I like very much because it is much more compact.</li>
            <li>first impression of this brush is that it&#x27;s heavier and more stout than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The wireless SmartGuide would be a great incentive for children to brush as long as they should and also doubles as a clock.</li>
            <li>toothbrush has a unique vibration about every 30 seconds that provide a guide to moving quadrants in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>The included brush timer would be great for kids so that they can learn how long to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li>It is always nice to learn new things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>combining the toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss along with the electric toothbrush, you come away with an amazingly clean feeling mouth.</li>
            <li>After using this combination for a couple of weeks, I noticed just how clean everything felt when I accidentally fell asleep on the sofa and didn&#x27;t brush.</li>

            <li>After using this combination for a couple of weeks, I noticed just how clean everything felt when I accidentally fell asleep on the sofa and didn&#x27;t brush.</li>
            <li>which I think is okay, but I like the round brushes, which I think do a great job around my canine teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel SO CLEAN after brushing with this one.</li>
            <li>According to the box, this brush actually pulsates to break up plaque rather than just vibrating, which sounds more effective to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, my teeth felt really clean afterwards though I think it will take some practice to get used to.  </li>
            <li>personally think the price is worth it for this amazing bundle!</li>
            <li>The next morning my mouth felt amazingly good for not brushing for about 24 hours</li>

            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush for so many years already I don&#x27;t see myself using this device very often.</li>
            <li>Toothpaste and floss are full sized.</li>
            <li>So you are ready to start a healthy oral hygiene.</li>

            <li>The connected timer is very helpful with making sure</li>
            <li>The toothbrush that is the real core of this set does a wonderful job of getting teeth clean, and encouraging a formerly reluctant pre-teen to develop much more regular brushing habits.</li>
            <li>There are extra modes and the smart guide timer (which works wirelessly) is a great feedback mechanism</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the other for about 10 years and it has done a great job for me and lasted.  </li>
            <li>I really like the brush holder, which provides a great place to hold your various toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mouthwash and the floss also got used quickly.  </li>

            <li>The mouthwash and the floss also got used quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like the flossing head in particular (the one with the rubbery flaps), but the gentle head is also nice.  </li>
            <li>I decided I better get a new power brush.</li>
            <li>If you feel you don&#x27;t need the timer then the 4000 is a great alternative for you at a slightly lower cost.  </li>
            <li>toothpaste is pretty good, although I think I will stick to my regular whitening toothpaste.</li>

            <li>all, I love Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric brush!</li>
            <li>all, I love Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric brush!</li>
            <li>This is a great tooth brush by itself without all of the gimmicky extras.  </li>
            <li>It has brush attachments available for basic cleaning needs:  daily, deep-clean, and a great flossing attachment.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, this model warns about using too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>But for my six year old, the stars have been a boon to getting him to brush more</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by the rotating head on Oral B&#x27;s brush, thinking that perhaps the rotating action would do a better job at cleaning these areas.</li>
            <li>rotating action did actually do a better job at thoroughly cleaning my teeth than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the mouthwash since I use ACT instead but everything else was a nice addition to my daily brushing health</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice electric toothbrush that comes with four heads to let you get different kinds of brushing experiences.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well-designed, powerful and ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>I always found that feature to be just as useful.  </li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job cleaning your teeth and gives many options with the brush heads and settings so that you can have a personalized brushing experience from gentle to deep clean.</li>
            <li>It keeps things feeling clean and fresh all day long and really makes your whole mouth feel pleasant.</li>
            <li>It keeps things feeling clean and fresh all day long and really makes your whole mouth feel pleasant.</li>
            <li>Or if it was a &#x27;get all this other stuff free when you buy the toothbrush&#x27; kind of thing.</li>
            <li>I just feel like my whole mouth is clean and fresh after using the Oral</li>
            <li>They claim it doesn&#x27;t sting, and they&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>A toothbrush that gives you a smiley face for brushing the right amount of time.  </li>
            <li>The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic</li>
            <li>Crest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit is pretty interesting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal Philips Sonicare user (my current model being the Sonicare Flexcare) for many years.</li>
            <li>Very pleased overall and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already been using both the Crest toothpaste and mouthwash, but the Oral-B system has really been an amazing addition to my daily cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great feedback and the visual actually makes the time to brush go by quicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mean... that doesn&#x27;t really sound like a good time</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic toothbrush that has significantly strengthened my gums and whitened my teeth in the last 30 days.  </li>
            <li>Because of this action, however, the toothbrush vibrates a LOT more than my Sonicare and the vibrations are more rough.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush with SmartGuide is available separately and you are not saving any money by buying the bundle</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you&#x27;re interested in the brush, look for it as a separate purchase.  </li>
            <li>Every two minutes the brush has a longer vibration indicating two minutes of brushing, which may be sufficient for people with healthy gums and teeth, in combination with flossing and regular dental checkups.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition to the multiple brushes and holders are Glide dental floss, Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, Crest Pro-Health mouthwash, and a lovely bag to put the goodies into.  </li>

            <li>Within the first week I had already noticed a difference in the amount of plaque buildup on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>love that I can actually feel it working on my gums.</li>
            <li>The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise.</li>
            <li>The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first time I used an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this toothbrush and was excited to give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was excited about the floss action toothbrush because my flossing habits are not too dependable.  </li>
            <li>The timer and various cleaning timed programs are an excellent aid for cleaning long enough.  </li>
            <li>For an item that is constantly getting wet this is a great feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another useful feature is the pressure sensor that stops brush-pulsing and triggers a red light when brushing too vigorously (a practice that can eventually erode the gum line).  </li>
            <li>so eventually I got used to it, although I never really did feel like they were really scrubbing as much as I liked.</li>
            <li>In all actuality, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth the extremely high price point.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty much foolproof.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t interested in the whole set, you can buy the toothbrush, floss, etc.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t interested in the whole set, you can buy the toothbrush, floss, etc.</li>
            <li>The brush seems to hold its charge for quite a long time; I can go a week or more without recharging.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush boasts 5 brushing modes (Deep Clean, Massage, Easy/Sensitive Clean, Daily Clean and Whitening/Polishing) that allow for varying pulsations and spins, depending on the mode chosen.  </li>
            <li>toothbrush has five  brushing modes (Deep Clean, Massage, Easy/Sensitive Clean, Daily Clean and Whitening/</li>
            <li>I think it is worth looking at too, if you are in the market for a new power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but it certainly completes the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes with a Smart Guide which tells you what mode you are in, the time that you&#x27;ve been brushing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As a forewarning, you can expect a fair amount of gum soreness in the initial days/week of use-- particularly if your gums are not used to so much mechanical stimulation (similar to when you get your teeth cleaned).</li>
            <li>First, it includes a high-quality electric toothbrush, which alone is worth most of the price of this kit; next you get a Crest mouthwash, toothpaste, floss, a tooth brushing timer and extra toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush operates just fine without using the SmartGuide device which I personally appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;smart guide&amp;#34; does seem like a little bit of overkill and is unlikely to be used very often as soon as the novelty wears off, but the brush itself is an excellent machine for helping your family be sure to keep brushing correctly and often.</li>
            <li>The tote would be a great way for dorm students using a shared bathroom to carry all of their toiletries back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;The product information on this page gives very complete information on the toothbrush and all the other products</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; really doesn&#x27;t add that much value, and I really didn&#x27;t care for the toothpaste and mouthwash that come with</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Crest Pro-Health mouthwash and Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, both of which I use daily.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a brush alone.  </li>
            <li>The whole set is convenient, with a countertop charger and no batteries being required.  </li>
            <li>It also will let you know if you are putting too much pressure on your brush when brushing -</li>
            <li>SmartGuide device is really neat.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy another Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy another Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>so you know how much time to spend on each area of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>It really feels like a gum massage.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash in the Waterpik really helps with all of the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I much prefer this 5000 version.</li>

            <li>but I much prefer this 5000 version.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is fabulous that it comes with 4 different brushes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the timer feature</li>
            <li>It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He also will not go to a dentist unless there is a REAL need for him to go....</li>
            <li>very reason!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;And, after using it for a couple of weeks he REALLY likes it.  </li>
            <li>It lets you know when you are brushing with too much pressure (smiley face turns to frowney face) and even serve as a clock when not in use.  </li>
            <li>general, I like this toothbrush and adapted to the differences between it and the Sonicare quickly.  </li>
            <li>general, I like this toothbrush and adapted to the differences between it and the Sonicare quickly.  </li>
            <li>items included in this kit (small bottle of mouthwash, toothpaste, and dental floss) are nice for sampling these products but don&#x27;t really add much value to this kit.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I have been a long-time Philips Sonicare user.  </li>
            <li>With the rounded head, you can focus on each tooth more since it covers one tooth at a time (but for those who prefer elongated head, the kit comes with additional elongated head as well with 3 other types of head).</li>
            <li>Every time you turn on the brush it will default to basic clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it is an effective flosser</li>
            <li>And having a clock in the bathroom was new to me, and very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush has 5 modes: Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Massage and Whitening.</li>
            <li>My most recent Sonicare finally died and I acquired this kit.  </li>
            <li>My husband does brush daily, but he had been using a manual toothbrush all his life and wasn&#x27;t about to change even though I had bought him different types over the years, mostly store brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are  four unique brush heads that provided;  there are other types available for sale, but they only included four in the kit.  </li>
            <li>, you should have high expectations …</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!our brushing.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste, mouthwash and floss included are equally high quality.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this as a gift.</li>
            <li>The bag is a reusable tote style bag and having one in this size has actually come in handy for other things though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is quite helpful as you get used to it, so that you will not clean one section more than others.</li>
            <li>the CREST + ORAL-B PROFESSIONAL GINGIVITIS KIT certainly delivers.ent a tooth/gum care kit</li>
            <li>the CREST + ORAL-B PROFESSIONAL GINGIVITIS KIT certainly delivers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all you need for a healthy mouth in a re-usable little tote.</li>
            <li>And if you happen to be a dentist looking at this, there is cute little &#x27;luggage tag&#x27; attached to it that has a sleeve for your business card.</li>
            <li>I had a Colgate toothbrush that claimed to do the hard work for you and while it did FEEL like it was (not to mention the softness of the brush was nice too)</li>
            <li>I prefer the sensitive setting, as I recently had gum surgery and am now very aware of how hard I am brushing, which leads me into that nice feature.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to see my dentist in the new year to see if he notices the difference</li>
            <li>I had some staining which was new for me.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush is an upgrade for me from my older Oral B brush set.  </li>
            <li>The four unique brush heads that are provided only add to the value of the kit as they can be costly if purchased individually.  </li>
            <li>so I finally assumed I needed to use the Daily Clean mode.  </li>
            <li>Again, for some the extra modes, and particularly having 5 vs. 4, won&#x27;t make that much difference and in that case you have the 4000 option.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are concerned about putting too much pressure on your teeth and gums while brushing, no more need to worry, as there is an indicator light that will alert you if you push too hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I wanted to do the gum line I would go with Sensitive if I was after a deeper clean, obviously I would go with Deep Sweep and so on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I wouldn&#x27;t say the kit with the small extras is worth the additional expense but the toothbrush itself is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I probably only last the full two minutes because I want the smiley.</li>
            <li>I realize that you may prefer other oral hygiene products over these, but these are not bad at all.</li>

            <li>Initially, I thought the Oral-B was less refined than the Sonicare because the vibrations seemed greater than the Sonicare and the Oral-B was noisier.  </li>
            <li>The Glide floss is a high quality floss, but because of its relatively high cost, I have several alternatives that I routinely use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>

            <li>a quick assessment of the other products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the different levels of cleaning, because I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>This is a complete set to get you started with the Electric toothbrush (for two to share)....</li>
            <li>* Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush with SmartGuide</li>
            <li>This brush comes complete with 5 heads, 5 settings, a timer, a charging station that can be used with or without the head storage, and a carrying/storage case for the brush.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really feel like it was CLEANING at the same time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not get sore spots anymore and the sensitive areas are gone.</li>
            <li>-B rechargable toothbrush with floss action head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Tooth Brush with SmartGuide</li>
            <li>work the price up too much over the regular toothbrush-only option.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a bit much with the display, personally.  </li>
            <li>The sensitive mode is noticeably gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it would be very helpful to teach a child how to brush; the visual reinforcement is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>brush itself is quite a step up from the professional grade brush I bought from my dentist about 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>think this kit is a terrific idea for someone just learning to really take care of their teeth</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features.</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features.</li>
            <li>If you need the extra \\&quot;coaching\\&quot; to get the job done right then spring for the extra cost and get the 5000 model.  </li>
            <li>- I mean I really LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>- I mean I really LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>But, within a few days you will be completely hooked on the &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; clean feel you get from this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The small brush probably does a good job of getting into small spaces and gaps, but it takes such a long time to clean each space that flossing is faster.  </li>
            <li>At least when new, the battery will last for more than week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt clean, but there was just something missing.</li>
            <li>I typically buy the $1 disposables and just toss them every week or two when they (quickly) wear out.  </li>
            <li>two dental-care powerhouses join forces to present a tooth/gum care kit, you should have high expectations …</li>
            <li>and I tend to spend a bit too long on the right side of my mouth versus the left side.  </li>
            <li>It also has these tiny little gaskets that fit on the brush head</li>
            <li>Floss Action, Deep Sweep, Sensitive and Power Tip.</li>
            <li>I like the round brush heads available for the Oral-B, whereas the Sonicare that I have just has a standard toothbrush configuration.  </li>
            <li>I like the round brush heads available for the Oral-B, whereas the Sonicare that I have just has a standard toothbrush configuration.  </li>
            <li>Every time you restart the toothbrush, it starts over at the first setting, so I have to press the arrow down to get to the sensitive setting.  </li>
            <li>Also, she feels the unit is a little on the bulky side, but other than those two things, she is pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The major difference between the 5000 and 4000 is the wireless timer</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean and no more</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, there is one of those toothbrushes that syncs with a fun little device that tells you how you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li>It actually took me a long time to get used to the gentle cleaning that Sonicare toothbrushes give.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend starting out using the gentle cycle, though, especially with the flossing head, as the regular vibration speed plus that head can lead to sore and bleeding gums.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush (includes charging stand, 4 different tootbrush heads and an electronic “SmartGuide” device to assist with brushing technique).&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sensitive mode which I used gives you a 30 second time per quadrant.  </li>
            <li>There are several brushing modes, including one for sensitive teeth and a mode with longer brushing times.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes; it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by just how solid this set is!  </li>
            <li>This kit includes an Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush with a charging stand and four different toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>The bag it all came in made for a nice presentation of the product but fails to serve any purpose as soon as you unpack its contents for use.</li>

            <li> There is a selection of four brush heads included, and I like the spinning head the best.  </li>
            <li> This is a great gift!</li>
            <li> Everything is included to get started and the way the kit is put together is very attractive.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t come with that brush head) because with the amount of power it puts out,  that brush head should work very good.</li>
            <li> If my dentist offered this kit at a good price I&#x27;s snap it up in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> Includes everything needed - a great gift for college students.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great system.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s nice as it contains no alcohol and keeps your breath feeling nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This makes a nice packaging for gift</li>
            <li> Included is a nice travel case with storage for two heads.</li>
            <li> I liked the floss, toothpaste and mouthwash and have repurchased all of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But let&#x27;s be honest, brushing around the gum line when you have Gingivitis causes bleeding and can leave it feeling tender, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and convenient to know I have a selection of brush heads to choose from rather than hoping my one toothbrush could hopefully get all the jobs</li>
            <li> NIce kit for dental care.</li>
            <li> If you use your own preferred paste, floss, and mouthwash, then just purchase this electric tooth brush separately - it will be cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> If you use your own preferred paste, floss, and mouthwash, then just purchase this electric tooth brush separately - it will be cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The separate display portion is kind of a hassle.  </li>
            <li> the bundle is nice but it seems a pricey way to add toothpaste, rinse and floss.  </li>
            <li> Finally, The toothbrush comes with a great charging stand that also stores toothbrush heads; everything comes in a nice Crest faux fabric bag with a gifting name tag: great attention to detail!  </li>
            <li> so I was thrilled to try this Oral B Gingivitis Kit for that</li>
            <li> -a tooth brush that just turns off is just as effective</li>
            <li> No question the full bundle would make a great gift but if buying for myself I&#x27;d prefer to purchase the toothbrush separately from the accompanying products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether it is more cost effective to buy the kit or the toothbrush alone, probably varies, but as a gift, the kit is really nice.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 is an excellent electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Honestly, in my mind, they are advertising more Crest products and should give these items away with every brush, not charge</li>
            <li> The perfect, complete package for that person that needs an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love the electric toothbrush - I had an old one that needed replacing and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is an amazing value and an awesome kit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an interesting concept and one that will help a lot of people brush more effectively.  </li>
            <li> The system is easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $50 for this set.  </li>
            <li> I love Braun&#x27;s Oral-B electric toothbrush line.</li>
            <li> He claims it does a much better job then the old-fashioned type of floss and can get into tighter spaces, leaving teeth and gums cleaner and healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He claims it does a much better job then the old-fashioned type of floss and can get into tighter spaces, leaving teeth and gums cleaner and healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She describes it as powerful and that it does a good job cleaning her teeth.  </li>
            <li> suffer from Gingivitis and my dentist is always pushing me to brush along the gum line and floss more.</li>
            <li> Supposedly the rapid movement cleans your teeth better than just moving a toothbrush around in your mouth manually.  </li>
            <li> I am convinced that &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; or vibrating toothbrushes are better than a manual toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> with the annoyance of the dripping fluids, I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> with the annoyance of the dripping fluids, I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> ; kit are top notch products.  </li>
            <li> But I gave this one a try and am quite pleased, and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> The brush keeps a good charge for several days, so it is great for travel.</li>
            <li> I love this electric toothbrush and kit.  </li>
            <li> I love the timer that comes with this set.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I was able to try this out</li>
            <li> and I feel I am taking better care of it with this system.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is just wonderful and comes with plenty of heads for different cleaning/issues..</li>
            <li> If you have gum issues, or just want to take better care of your gums, this is the kit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previously I was using Sonicare Diamondclean and I was in love with it.</li>
            <li> The smaller part of the head that moves separately is an awesome addition.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a more vigorous cleaning than with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not.</li>
            <li> I thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent system for improving daily dental cleaning and routines.  </li>
            <li> Certainly it is much, much better than the manual ones.</li>
            <li> To charge fully, you need to put it on the charger for more than 15 hours.</li>
            <li> To charge fully, you need to put it on the charger for more than 15 hours.</li>
            <li> I love being able to try them out.</li>
            <li> The Crest mouthwash has replaced Listerine as one of my staple hygiene products and the toothpaste has a nice, light minty flavor.  </li>
            <li> It’s wider too, so it does more every time you use it.</li>
            <li> that times your brushing in each quadrant, forcing you to take your time and brush more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B for years and didn&#x27;t think my experience could get much better.</li>
            <li> I expect when I see my dentist in a couple weeks he too will notice how much better my teeth and gums are looking.</li>
            <li> And, I have noticed a difference in his teeth which to me means everything because he is getting a better and deeper cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and/or someone who is experiencing some gum/teeth issues and a dentist has recommended a more thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The most interesting thing in the kit is the electronic “SmartGuide” device to assist with brushing technique that communicates wirelessly with the toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I did notice a better result.</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed the feedback from the device.</li>
            <li> so I was very excited to receive one to review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be completely honest, if you&#x27;re interested in this toothbrush, just buy it on its own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great system and comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great system and comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Like my Sonicare, the toothbrush pauses and beeps when it&#x27;s time to move to a new area of your mouth which is a great feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really seems to do a great job of getting my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> The sensitive mode and brush head would also be great for children.</li>
            <li> Complete with toothpaste, floss and mouthwash, this would be a great gift.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The kit really doesn&#x27;t bring anything else good to the table.</li>
            <li> I noticed that there was also a whitening kit, which for the right person might make a nice gift, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The system is easy to use with the instructions.  </li>
            <li> And it is easy to hold being slim.</li>
            <li> brush tips change easily but don&#x27;t come off under use</li>
            <li> The device was easy to set the clock and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to think of it as a gimmick, but the smart guide is truly smart and a great way to get feedback and build better habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need to buy something for your traveling student?  </li>
            <li> but it is a good way to try new products or get everything you need with one purchase.</li>
            <li> biggest gripe with my Sonicare is that sometimes it doesn&#x27;t clean as effectively as I&#x27;d like right up by my gum line.</li>
            <li> I like them all fine.</li>
            <li> so it is comfortable and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> I like a bit more bold mint flavor</li>
            <li> I like a bit more bold mint flavor</li>
            <li> I have been using glide for years as it works best with my teeth which are a little close</li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery is replaceable - this is huge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is one of those issues that will remedy itself as I get used to this brush but thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is packaged with separate covered case for 4 brush heads that can fit around the charger.  </li>
            <li> The brush grip is comfortable.</li>
            <li> I also like the variety of heads available.  </li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get them to fit</li>
            <li> It has five cleaning modes with multiple heads and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> fit</li>
            <li> I find this very useful as I brush.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I find this very useful as I brush.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> The 7000 was very impressive and the first Oral B to really make me switch from Sonicare, but just too loud.</li>
            <li> The 7000 was very impressive and the first Oral B to really make me switch from Sonicare, but just too loud.</li>
            <li> Sonicare brushes work by emitting a sonic vibration that vibrates the bristles quickly, cleaning your teeth far more effectively than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have a charger with an integrated flip up 4 brush tower holder that I like very much because it is much more compact.</li>
            <li> first impression of this brush is that it&#x27;s heavier and more stout than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The wireless SmartGuide would be a great incentive for children to brush as long as they should and also doubles as a clock.</li>
            <li> toothbrush has a unique vibration about every 30 seconds that provide a guide to moving quadrants in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> The included brush timer would be great for kids so that they can learn how long to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> It is always nice to learn new things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> combining the toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss along with the electric toothbrush, you come away with an amazingly clean feeling mouth.</li>
            <li> After using this combination for a couple of weeks, I noticed just how clean everything felt when I accidentally fell asleep on the sofa and didn&#x27;t brush.</li>

            <li> After using this combination for a couple of weeks, I noticed just how clean everything felt when I accidentally fell asleep on the sofa and didn&#x27;t brush.</li>
            <li> which I think is okay, but I like the round brushes, which I think do a great job around my canine teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel SO CLEAN after brushing with this one.</li>
            <li> According to the box, this brush actually pulsates to break up plaque rather than just vibrating, which sounds more effective to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, my teeth felt really clean afterwards though I think it will take some practice to get used to.  </li>
            <li> personally think the price is worth it for this amazing bundle!</li>
            <li> The next morning my mouth felt amazingly good for not brushing for about 24 hours</li>

            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush for so many years already I don&#x27;t see myself using this device very often.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste and floss are full sized.</li>
            <li> So you are ready to start a healthy oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> So you are ready to start a healthy oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> The connected timer is very helpful with making sure</li>
            <li> The toothbrush that is the real core of this set does a wonderful job of getting teeth clean, and encouraging a formerly reluctant pre-teen to develop much more regular brushing habits.</li>
            <li> There are extra modes and the smart guide timer (which works wirelessly) is a great feedback mechanism</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the other for about 10 years and it has done a great job for me and lasted.  </li>
            <li> I really like the brush holder, which provides a great place to hold your various toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mouthwash and the floss also got used quickly.  </li>

            <li> The mouthwash and the floss also got used quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like the flossing head in particular (the one with the rubbery flaps), but the gentle head is also nice.  </li>
            <li> I decided I better get a new power brush.</li>
            <li> If you feel you don&#x27;t need the timer then the 4000 is a great alternative for you at a slightly lower cost.  </li>
            <li> toothpaste is pretty good, although I think I will stick to my regular whitening toothpaste.</li>

            <li> all, I love Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric brush!</li>
            <li> all, I love Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric brush!</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush by itself without all of the gimmicky extras.  </li>
            <li> It has brush attachments available for basic cleaning needs:  daily, deep-clean, and a great flossing attachment.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, this model warns about using too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> But for my six year old, the stars have been a boon to getting him to brush more</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the rotating head on Oral B&#x27;s brush, thinking that perhaps the rotating action would do a better job at cleaning these areas.</li>
            <li> rotating action did actually do a better job at thoroughly cleaning my teeth than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the mouthwash since I use ACT instead but everything else was a nice addition to my daily brushing health</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice electric toothbrush that comes with four heads to let you get different kinds of brushing experiences.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well-designed, powerful and ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> I always found that feature to be just as useful.  </li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job cleaning your teeth and gives many options with the brush heads and settings so that you can have a personalized brushing experience from gentle to deep clean.</li>
            <li> It keeps things feeling clean and fresh all day long and really makes your whole mouth feel pleasant.</li>
            <li> It keeps things feeling clean and fresh all day long and really makes your whole mouth feel pleasant.</li>
            <li> Or if it was a &#x27;get all this other stuff free when you buy the toothbrush&#x27; kind of thing.</li>
            <li> I just feel like my whole mouth is clean and fresh after using the Oral</li>
            <li> They claim it doesn&#x27;t sting, and they&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> A toothbrush that gives you a smiley face for brushing the right amount of time.  </li>
            <li> The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic</li>
            <li> Crest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit is pretty interesting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Philips Sonicare user (my current model being the Sonicare Flexcare) for many years.</li>
            <li> Very pleased overall and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already been using both the Crest toothpaste and mouthwash, but the Oral-B system has really been an amazing addition to my daily cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great feedback and the visual actually makes the time to brush go by quicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean... that doesn&#x27;t really sound like a good time</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush that has significantly strengthened my gums and whitened my teeth in the last 30 days.  </li>
            <li> Because of this action, however, the toothbrush vibrates a LOT more than my Sonicare and the vibrations are more rough.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush with SmartGuide is available separately and you are not saving any money by buying the bundle</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you&#x27;re interested in the brush, look for it as a separate purchase.  </li>
            <li> Every two minutes the brush has a longer vibration indicating two minutes of brushing, which may be sufficient for people with healthy gums and teeth, in combination with flossing and regular dental checkups.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to the multiple brushes and holders are Glide dental floss, Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, Crest Pro-Health mouthwash, and a lovely bag to put the goodies into.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to the multiple brushes and holders are Glide dental floss, Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, Crest Pro-Health mouthwash, and a lovely bag to put the goodies into.  </li>
            <li> Within the first week I had already noticed a difference in the amount of plaque buildup on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> love that I can actually feel it working on my gums.</li>
            <li> The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise.</li>
            <li> The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first time I used an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this toothbrush and was excited to give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was excited about the floss action toothbrush because my flossing habits are not too dependable.  </li>
            <li> The timer and various cleaning timed programs are an excellent aid for cleaning long enough.  </li>
            <li> For an item that is constantly getting wet this is a great feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another useful feature is the pressure sensor that stops brush-pulsing and triggers a red light when brushing too vigorously (a practice that can eventually erode the gum line).  </li>
            <li> so eventually I got used to it, although I never really did feel like they were really scrubbing as much as I liked.</li>
            <li> In all actuality, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth the extremely high price point.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty much foolproof.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t interested in the whole set, you can buy the toothbrush, floss, etc.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t interested in the whole set, you can buy the toothbrush, floss, etc.</li>
            <li> The brush seems to hold its charge for quite a long time; I can go a week or more without recharging.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush boasts 5 brushing modes (Deep Clean, Massage, Easy/Sensitive Clean, Daily Clean and Whitening/Polishing) that allow for varying pulsations and spins, depending on the mode chosen.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush has five  brushing modes (Deep Clean, Massage, Easy/Sensitive Clean, Daily Clean and Whitening/</li>
            <li> I think it is worth looking at too, if you are in the market for a new power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but it certainly completes the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes with a Smart Guide which tells you what mode you are in, the time that you&#x27;ve been brushing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As a forewarning, you can expect a fair amount of gum soreness in the initial days/week of use-- particularly if your gums are not used to so much mechanical stimulation (similar to when you get your teeth cleaned).</li>
            <li> First, it includes a high-quality electric toothbrush, which alone is worth most of the price of this kit; next you get a Crest mouthwash, toothpaste, floss, a tooth brushing timer and extra toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush operates just fine without using the SmartGuide device which I personally appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;smart guide&amp;#34; does seem like a little bit of overkill and is unlikely to be used very often as soon as the novelty wears off, but the brush itself is an excellent machine for helping your family be sure to keep brushing correctly and often.</li>
            <li> The tote would be a great way for dorm students using a shared bathroom to carry all of their toiletries back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;The product information on this page gives very complete information on the toothbrush and all the other products</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; really doesn&#x27;t add that much value, and I really didn&#x27;t care for the toothpaste and mouthwash that come with</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Crest Pro-Health mouthwash and Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, both of which I use daily.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Crest Pro-Health mouthwash and Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, both of which I use daily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a brush alone.  </li>
            <li> The whole set is convenient, with a countertop charger and no batteries being required.  </li>
            <li> It also will let you know if you are putting too much pressure on your brush when brushing -</li>
            <li> SmartGuide device is really neat.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy another Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy another Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so you know how much time to spend on each area of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> It really feels like a gum massage.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash in the Waterpik really helps with all of the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I much prefer this 5000 version.</li>

            <li> but I much prefer this 5000 version.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is fabulous that it comes with 4 different brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the timer feature</li>
            <li> It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He also will not go to a dentist unless there is a REAL need for him to go....</li>
            <li> very reason!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, after using it for a couple of weeks he REALLY likes it.  </li>
            <li> It lets you know when you are brushing with too much pressure (smiley face turns to frowney face) and even serve as a clock when not in use.  </li>
            <li> general, I like this toothbrush and adapted to the differences between it and the Sonicare quickly.  </li>
            <li> general, I like this toothbrush and adapted to the differences between it and the Sonicare quickly.  </li>
            <li> items included in this kit (small bottle of mouthwash, toothpaste, and dental floss) are nice for sampling these products but don&#x27;t really add much value to this kit.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I have been a long-time Philips Sonicare user.  </li>
            <li> With the rounded head, you can focus on each tooth more since it covers one tooth at a time (but for those who prefer elongated head, the kit comes with additional elongated head as well with 3 other types of head).</li>
            <li> Every time you turn on the brush it will default to basic clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it is an effective flosser</li>
            <li> And having a clock in the bathroom was new to me, and very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush has 5 modes: Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Massage and Whitening.</li>
            <li> My most recent Sonicare finally died and I acquired this kit.  </li>
            <li> My husband does brush daily, but he had been using a manual toothbrush all his life and wasn&#x27;t about to change even though I had bought him different types over the years, mostly store brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are  four unique brush heads that provided;  there are other types available for sale, but they only included four in the kit.  </li>
            <li> , you should have high expectations …</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!our brushing.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste, mouthwash and floss included are equally high quality.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this as a gift.</li>
            <li> The bag is a reusable tote style bag and having one in this size has actually come in handy for other things though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is quite helpful as you get used to it, so that you will not clean one section more than others.</li>
            <li> the CREST + ORAL-B PROFESSIONAL GINGIVITIS KIT certainly delivers.ent a tooth/gum care kit</li>
            <li> the CREST + ORAL-B PROFESSIONAL GINGIVITIS KIT certainly delivers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all you need for a healthy mouth in a re-usable little tote.</li>
            <li> And if you happen to be a dentist looking at this, there is cute little &#x27;luggage tag&#x27; attached to it that has a sleeve for your business card.</li>
            <li> I had a Colgate toothbrush that claimed to do the hard work for you and while it did FEEL like it was (not to mention the softness of the brush was nice too)</li>
            <li> I prefer the sensitive setting, as I recently had gum surgery and am now very aware of how hard I am brushing, which leads me into that nice feature.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to see my dentist in the new year to see if he notices the difference</li>
            <li> I had some staining which was new for me.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush is an upgrade for me from my older Oral B brush set.  </li>
            <li> The four unique brush heads that are provided only add to the value of the kit as they can be costly if purchased individually.  </li>
            <li> so I finally assumed I needed to use the Daily Clean mode.  </li>
            <li> Again, for some the extra modes, and particularly having 5 vs. 4, won&#x27;t make that much difference and in that case you have the 4000 option.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are concerned about putting too much pressure on your teeth and gums while brushing, no more need to worry, as there is an indicator light that will alert you if you push too hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I wanted to do the gum line I would go with Sensitive if I was after a deeper clean, obviously I would go with Deep Sweep and so on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I wouldn&#x27;t say the kit with the small extras is worth the additional expense but the toothbrush itself is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I probably only last the full two minutes because I want the smiley.</li>
            <li> I realize that you may prefer other oral hygiene products over these, but these are not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I realize that you may prefer other oral hygiene products over these, but these are not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Initially, I thought the Oral-B was less refined than the Sonicare because the vibrations seemed greater than the Sonicare and the Oral-B was noisier.  </li>
            <li> The Glide floss is a high quality floss, but because of its relatively high cost, I have several alternatives that I routinely use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>

            <li> a quick assessment of the other products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the different levels of cleaning, because I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> This is a complete set to get you started with the Electric toothbrush (for two to share)....</li>
            <li> * Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush with SmartGuide</li>
            <li> This brush comes complete with 5 heads, 5 settings, a timer, a charging station that can be used with or without the head storage, and a carrying/storage case for the brush.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really feel like it was CLEANING at the same time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not get sore spots anymore and the sensitive areas are gone.</li>
            <li> -B rechargable toothbrush with floss action head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Tooth Brush with SmartGuide</li>
            <li> work the price up too much over the regular toothbrush-only option.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a bit much with the display, personally.  </li>
            <li> The sensitive mode is noticeably gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it would be very helpful to teach a child how to brush; the visual reinforcement is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> brush itself is quite a step up from the professional grade brush I bought from my dentist about 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> think this kit is a terrific idea for someone just learning to really take care of their teeth</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features.</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features.</li>
            <li> If you need the extra \\&quot;coaching\\&quot; to get the job done right then spring for the extra cost and get the 5000 model.  </li>
            <li> - I mean I really LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> - I mean I really LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> But, within a few days you will be completely hooked on the &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; clean feel you get from this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The small brush probably does a good job of getting into small spaces and gaps, but it takes such a long time to clean each space that flossing is faster.  </li>
            <li> At least when new, the battery will last for more than week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt clean, but there was just something missing.</li>
            <li> I typically buy the $1 disposables and just toss them every week or two when they (quickly) wear out.  </li>
            <li> two dental-care powerhouses join forces to present a tooth/gum care kit, you should have high expectations …</li>
            <li> and I tend to spend a bit too long on the right side of my mouth versus the left side.  </li>
            <li> It also has these tiny little gaskets that fit on the brush head</li>
            <li> Floss Action, Deep Sweep, Sensitive and Power Tip.</li>
            <li> I like the round brush heads available for the Oral-B, whereas the Sonicare that I have just has a standard toothbrush configuration.  </li>
            <li> I like the round brush heads available for the Oral-B, whereas the Sonicare that I have just has a standard toothbrush configuration.  </li>
            <li> Every time you restart the toothbrush, it starts over at the first setting, so I have to press the arrow down to get to the sensitive setting.  </li>
            <li> Also, she feels the unit is a little on the bulky side, but other than those two things, she is pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The major difference between the 5000 and 4000 is the wireless timer</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean and no more</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, there is one of those toothbrushes that syncs with a fun little device that tells you how you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li> It actually took me a long time to get used to the gentle cleaning that Sonicare toothbrushes give.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend starting out using the gentle cycle, though, especially with the flossing head, as the regular vibration speed plus that head can lead to sore and bleeding gums.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush (includes charging stand, 4 different tootbrush heads and an electronic “SmartGuide” device to assist with brushing technique).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sensitive mode which I used gives you a 30 second time per quadrant.  </li>
            <li> There are several brushing modes, including one for sensitive teeth and a mode with longer brushing times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes; it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by just how solid this set is!  </li>
            <li> This kit includes an Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush with a charging stand and four different toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> The bag it all came in made for a nice presentation of the product but fails to serve any purpose as soon as you unpack its contents for use.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a decent taste, but it was extremely harsh on my mouth.  </li>
            <li> have very sensitive gums and tight teeth, so dental care is not something I just &#x27;happen to do&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The mint lasts just long enough, with some others it spoils your taste buds for hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you like flat ribbon flosses, you&#x27;ll like this.  </li>
            <li> It displays each quadrant of your mouth, and the timer that indicates how long you have left.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush will slow and the red light will come on if you are brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> What it does is keeps track of how long you brush, giving you four stars for 30 seconds on each mouth quadrant.  </li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s a minor thing to get used to, but</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to charge the brush.</li>
            <li> But this is minor</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to charge the brush.</li>
            <li> But this is minor</li>
            <li> It comes with a separate display that keeps track of how long you are brushing, and also has a clock.  </li>
            <li> Using this kit combination over the last month I&#x27;ve noticed next to no gum tenderness at any point during the month (ladies understand me here) and zero of the bleeding I&#x27;d typically get at times.</li>
            <li> I prefer a little more of a simplistic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste works well but leaves your mouth feeling a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I have learned to keep my head tilted back slightly to prevent fluids from dripping onto surfaces that I would prefer to avoid cleaning after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> have a very dry mouth</li>
            <li> The 5000 will not fit on that charging base and the way the new case is designed takes up much more space.</li>
            <li> other minor point about this is you have to brush with your mouth tightly closed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a personal preference as I used a lower model Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and it times you with a little vibration stutter every thirty seconds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model will alert when a 30 or 45 second brushing time per quadrant has finished, by pulsing and with the little radio timer.  </li>
            <li> It will even tell you if you are brushing too hard or soft.</li>
            <li> , there are just a few things I would prefer be different.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush sets nicely on the charging base and charges with no exposed metal parts.</li>
            <li> charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This kit includes a precision 5000 toothbrush with charger, optional brush head storage area with lid (that can be easily connected/removed to the charging base), four different brush heads, a SmartGuide device and a travel/storage case for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I do need the whitening benefits due to cigarette smoking.</li>
            <li> and I do need the whitening benefits due to cigarette smoking.</li>
            <li> The other added benefit of the 5000 vs. the 4000 is the massage mode.  </li>
            <li> It actually communicates with the toothbrush and tells you if you&#x27;re pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a complaint necessarily, just an observation.</li>
            <li> toothbrush was scary at first when I used it, as I was afraid it was going to break my teeth, (I have osteoporosis and a few fillings), because it is really powerful.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, I have days when I get a lot of soft plaque covering my teeth which is irritating my gums and thus increasing my gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> Because of my braces, I tend to get gaps between my teeth down at the gumline.</li>
            <li> included toothpaste is slightly runny for a stand-up tube, but tastes fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> I put some in my Waterpik (half mouthwash/half water) and I can tell a difference in the health and appearance of my gums.</li>
            <li> I had also tried the Oral B 7000 (black)</li>
            <li> It is sleek looking in black, but I just prefer the 5000</li>

            <li> It is sleek looking in black, but I just prefer the 5000</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is an accessory that fits over the charging base to hold extra toothbrush heads which some may find useful as well as a carrying case.  </li>
            <li> Unnecessarily complicated  - I&#x27;d rather have had extra brushes than one of 5 different kinds.  </li>
            <li> I will even give this toothbrush a slight edge over my previous Sonicare because of the rotating brush heads, though the edge is very slight.  </li>

            <li> Price might be little prohibitive for someone who does not need all the stuff.</li>
            <li> It comes packaged very attractively in a little carrying bag.  </li>
            <li> The little additions (mouthwash, toothpaste, floss, bag I’ll never need again...)</li>
            <li> It takes about 7 seconds, so you have wasted that time with the brush out of your mouth, trying to find the correct setting you</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral-B 1000 model for a few weeks so can compare it to this high-end 5000 model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  </li>
            <li> just considers it a waste of money......</li>
            <li> Other than clock function and a means of making you feel guilty by not brushing for the entire four segments, I found this device</li>
            <li> The clock was really hard to set and a waste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is</li>
            <li> After every brush with it, I&#x27;d end up with (sorry for the grossness) white residue in my mouth that turned out to be the inside lining of my cheeks peeling off.  </li>
            <li> They also throw in a tube of toothpaste, dental floss, rinse and a small tote bag.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how they chose these four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it tears while flossing, it just breaks in half, no flossy mess!!!</li>
            <li> It did take my base unit a bit longer to charge at first, but now holds the charge the way it should.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;SmartGuide&amp;#34; lets you know when you are brushing too hard, and it tells you when you should move quadrants in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I learned that I do not press too hard with the toothbrush</li>
            <li> I always feel the smoothness of my teeth all around, even the wisdom teeth that is hard to reach.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I used another brand and my dental hygienist kept asking me to watch how hard I brush because I had enamel wear.</li>
            <li> that times me at 30 seconds per side and also indicates if I am pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with that feeling, but when used with the rinse, it goes</li>
            <li> biggest complaint about this brush is that the shafts of the brush heads have openings in them.</li>
            <li> instructions are a mix of pictures and text which I felt to be confusing.  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t like the charging base so much.  </li>
            <li> I mean, a Crest tote bag?  </li>
            <li> Due to the bag and extras, it seems like an expensive, quality gift.</li>
            <li> do not intend to go back to Sonicare after having used this Oral B. I NEVER thought I would say that.et in there from eating and it can be painful and stay sore for a while.</li>
            <li> Others may find it annoying or forget to watch the display while they think about other things.  </li>
            <li> The mouthwash left a horrible, licorice aftertaste in my mouth for hours after I used it, and even rinsing with water didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with Oral-B and either the 4000 or 5000</li>
            <li> Debris get in there from eating and it can be painful and stay sore for a while.</li>
            <li> These heads can be changed with the brush base.</li>
            <li> The kit also comes with a base for charging the toothbrush along with holder slots for the heads you&#x27;re not using at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing I found slightly annoying is that the brush heads have openings that allow liquids to flow through the brush into undesirable locations.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a complete set to get you started with the Electric toothbrush (for two to share)....four brush attachments, toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss.  But the star of the kit, the best thing about it for sure, is the enclosed clock and brushing &amp;#34;meter&amp;#34;.  What it does is keeps track of how long you brush, giving you four stars for 30 seconds on each mouth quadrant.  You can also get a fifth star (for tongue) if you go a total of 2 1/2 minutes.  For me, that&#x27;s not a big deal.  But for my six year old, the stars have been a boon to getting him to brush more thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He brushes with enthusiasm now, and I&#x27;ve noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a brush alone.  For me, it&#x27;s a helpful reminder to brush longer than I was used to.  The whole set is convenient, with a countertop charger and no batteries being required.  And having a clock in the bathroom was new to me, and very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, two things keep me from giving it five stars.  One, the price point.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $50 for this set.  In all actuality, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth the extremely high price point.  I mean, a Crest tote bag?  What am I going to do with that?  I don&#x27;t think the set warrants the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other minor point about this is you have to brush with your mouth tightly closed or you get watery toothpaste sprayed all over the mirror and counter.  Not to mention your face!  My son has to brush before he dresses or his school shirts get ruined.  So, it&#x27;s a minor thing to get used to, but sort of annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, a great set that would be better if it were more affordable.</li>
            <li> I love Braun&#x27;s Oral-B electric toothbrush line. I&#x27;ve been happily using a series 4000 for over a year now and was thrilled to have a chance to try out this kit which includes the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush with SmartGuide&lt;br /&gt;* Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse&lt;br /&gt;* Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;* Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Clinical Protection Dental Floss&lt;br /&gt;* Crest/Oral-B Tote Bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the star of the set is the amazing electric toothbrush. This brush comes complete with 5 heads, 5 settings, a timer, a charging station that can be used with or without the head storage, and a carrying/storage case for the brush. It does a fantastic job cleaning your teeth and gives many options with the brush heads and settings so that you can have a personalized brushing experience from gentle to deep clean. If you are concerned about putting too much pressure on your teeth and gums while brushing, no more need to worry, as there is an indicator light that will alert you if you push too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer times each quadrant and lets you know you&#x27;ve brushed for 30 seconds and can move on to the next. It also will let you know if you are putting too much pressure on your brush when brushing - so it&#x27;s pretty much foolproof. If you don&#x27;t want to use the timer, you have that option as the brush can be set to let you know when to move on to the next quadrant by a short off/on pulse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a quick assessment of the other products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse does the job without the sting. It&#x27;s nice as it contains no alcohol and keeps your breath feeling nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste works well but leaves your mouth feeling a bit dry. I&#x27;m not thrilled with that feeling, but when used with the rinse, it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Clinical Protection Dental Floss - This is the floss my dentist recommends. He claims it does a much better job then the old-fashioned type of floss and can get into tighter spaces, leaving teeth and gums cleaner and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Tote bag is reusable and is made of a tyvek type fabric - something like the reusable grocery/market bags. This makes a nice packaging for gift giving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When combining the toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss along with the electric toothbrush, you come away with an amazingly clean feeling mouth. It keeps things feeling clean and fresh all day long and really makes your whole mouth feel pleasant.

            <li> As part of my participation in the Amazon Vines program, I received this for review.  It was a gift for my wife.  She describes it as powerful and that it does a good job cleaning her teeth.  She doesn&#x27;t like the charging base so much.  It seems like it is set up backwards.  Also, she feels the unit is a little on the bulky side, but other than those two things, she is pleased with it.</li>
            <li> If my dentist offered this kit at a good price I&#x27;s snap it up in a heartbeat! Or if it was a &#x27;get all this other stuff free when you buy the toothbrush&#x27; kind of thing. It&#x27;s all you need for a healthy mouth in a re-usable little tote. And if you happen to be a dentist looking at this, there is cute little &#x27;luggage tag&#x27; attached to it that has a sleeve for your business card. In six months when your client is using the tote for groceries, they just might look at that tag and remember to make an appointment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now lets look at what&#x27;s inside.&lt;br /&gt;First, there is one of those toothbrushes that syncs with a fun little device that tells you how you&#x27;re brushing. GREAT for kids, but really nice for adults, too. It will even tell you if you are brushing too hard or soft. I love it! It does everything but reach in your mouth and brush FOR you.&lt;br /&gt;The included toothpaste is slightly runny for a stand-up tube, but tastes fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Next there is the Crest mouthwash. They claim it doesn&#x27;t sting, and they&#x27;re right. The mint lasts just long enough, with some others it spoils your taste buds for hours.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, some dental floss. I prefer flossing picks but it certainly completes the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a terrific promo item or gift!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Philips Sonicare user (my current model being the Sonicare Flexcare) for many years. Sonicare brushes work by emitting a sonic vibration that vibrates the bristles quickly, cleaning your teeth far more effectively than a manual toothbrush. The difference is like night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe with my Sonicare is that sometimes it doesn&#x27;t clean as effectively as I&#x27;d like right up by my gum line. I was intrigued by the rotating head on Oral B&#x27;s brush, thinking that perhaps the rotating action would do a better job at cleaning these areas. I really had high hopes for this toothbrush and was excited to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit includes a precision 5000 toothbrush with charger, optional brush head storage area with lid (that can be easily connected/removed to the charging base), four different brush heads, a SmartGuide device and a travel/storage case for the toothbrush. According to the manual this brush will hold a charge through 20 uses (twice per day for 10 days) so for shorter trips there&#x27;s no need to bring the charger along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of this brush is that it&#x27;s heavier and more stout than my Sonicare. This isn&#x27;t a complaint necessarily, just an observation. The toothbrush sets nicely on the charging base and charges with no exposed metal parts. For an item that is constantly getting wet this is a great feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating action did actually do a better job at thoroughly cleaning my teeth than my Sonicare. Because of this action, however, the toothbrush vibrates a LOT more than my Sonicare and the vibrations are more rough. This is something that I&#x27;m getting used to though. Like my Sonicare, the toothbrush pauses and beeps when it&#x27;s time to move to a new area of your mouth which is a great feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SmartGuide device is really neat. It actually communicates with the toothbrush and tells you if you&#x27;re pressing too hard. It also displays the quadrants of your mouth and helps guideyou to which quadrant you should be brushing during each interval. Since I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush for so many years already I don&#x27;t see myself using this device very often. The toothbrush operates just fine without using the SmartGuide device which I personally appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint about this brush is that the shafts of the brush heads have openings in them. I&#x27;m not sure why this is but these openings allow liquefied toothpaste and whatnot to escape your mouth while brushing and it can end up on your toothbrush and/or hand. Gross. I&#x27;m sure this is one of those issues that will remedy itself as I get used to this brush but thought it was worth mentioning. My Sonicare brush has no such openings on the brush heads so I wasn&#x27;t expecting this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The items included in this kit (small bottle of mouthwash, toothpaste, and dental floss) are nice for sampling these products but don&#x27;t really add much value to this kit. The bag it all came in made for a nice presentation of the product but fails to serve any purpose as soon as you unpack its contents for use. The bag is a reusable tote style bag and having one in this size has actually come in handy for other things though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I wouldn&#x27;t say the kit with the small extras is worth the additional expense but the toothbrush itself is definitely worth it. Great product!</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush with SmartGuide is available separately and you are not saving any money by buying the bundle but it is a good way to try new products or get everything you need with one purchase. The tote would be a great way for dorm students using a shared bathroom to carry all of their toiletries back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;The product information on this page gives very complete information on the toothbrush and all the other products so I will just add my impressions. The 5000 is a feature packed toothbrush with a choice of 5 brushing modes. The wireless SmartGuide would be a great incentive for children to brush as long as they should and also doubles as a clock. The sensitive mode and brush head would also be great for children. The SmartGuide will visually let you know what brushing mode you choose. Every time you turn on the brush it will default to basic clean and you press the mode button to cycle through the different settings. You can mount it to a surface with an included bracket and double-sided tape. I chose to just keep it on a shelf in the medicine cabinet. Included is a nice travel case with storage for two heads. There are 4 different brush heads so you can try a variety to find what works best for you. I liked the floss, toothpaste and mouthwash and have repurchased all of them.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years and it was already my preferred brand. The toothbrush is packaged with separate covered case for 4 brush heads that can fit around the charger.  That brings me to the only thing I did not like about this toothbrush. I have a charger with an integrated flip up 4 brush tower holder that I like very much because it is much more compact. The 5000 will not fit on that charging base and the way the new case is designed takes up much more space.</li>
            <li> The Crest + Oral-B Gingivitis kit comes with a grip of stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it comes with four different brush heads: Floss Action, Deep Sweep, Sensitive and Power Tip. These heads can be changed with the brush base. It also comes with a timer, toothpaste, floss and a mouthwash. I didn&#x27;t use the mouthwash since I use ACT instead but everything else was a nice addition to my daily brushing health care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from Gingivitis and my dentist is always pushing me to brush along the gum line and floss more. But let&#x27;s be honest, brushing around the gum line when you have Gingivitis causes bleeding and can leave it feeling tender, so I mean... that doesn&#x27;t really sound like a good time right? I had a Colgate toothbrush that claimed to do the hard work for you and while it did FEEL like it was (not to mention the softness of the brush was nice too) it didn&#x27;t really feel like it was CLEANING at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because you can change the heads of the brush, you can set it to whatever you need to do during that brush. If I wanted to do the gum line I would go with Sensitive if I was after a deeper clean, obviously I would go with Deep Sweep and so on. It&#x27;s nice and convenient to know I have a selection of brush heads to choose from rather than hoping my one toothbrush could hopefully get all the jobs done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally think the price is worth it for this amazing bundle!</li>
            <li> To be completely honest, if you&#x27;re interested in this toothbrush, just buy it on its own.  The &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; really doesn&#x27;t add that much value, and I really didn&#x27;t care for the toothpaste and mouthwash that come with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the brush:  It&#x27;s a nice electric toothbrush that comes with four heads to let you get different kinds of brushing experiences.  I like the flossing head in particular (the one with the rubbery flaps), but the gentle head is also nice.  I&#x27;d recommend starting out using the gentle cycle, though, especially with the flossing head, as the regular vibration speed plus that head can lead to sore and bleeding gums.  The brush seems to hold its charge for quite a long time; I can go a week or more without recharging.  The kit also comes with a base for charging the toothbrush along with holder slots for the heads you&#x27;re not using at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the extra stuff:  The floss is... well, floss.  I already use this type of ribbon floss, and I like it.  If you like flat ribbon flosses, you&#x27;ll like this.  The toothpaste has a decent taste, but it was extremely harsh on my mouth.  After every brush with it, I&#x27;d end up with (sorry for the grossness) white residue in my mouth that turned out to be the inside lining of my cheeks peeling off.  So... yeah.  I definitely didn&#x27;t like the toothpaste, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  The mouthwash left a horrible, licorice aftertaste in my mouth for hours after I used it, and even rinsing with water didn&#x27;t help.  If I used it at night, I&#x27;d wake up with that godawful taste in my mouth.  Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re interested in the brush, look for it as a separate purchase.  The kit really doesn&#x27;t bring anything else good to the table.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I have been a long-time Philips Sonicare user.  My most recent Sonicare finally died and I acquired this kit.  Initially, I thought the Oral-B was less refined than the Sonicare because the vibrations seemed greater than the Sonicare and the Oral-B was noisier.  Both toothbrushes work similarly, by vibrating portions of the toothbrush rapidly.  Supposedly the rapid movement cleans your teeth better than just moving a toothbrush around in your mouth manually.  I was initially unconvinced, but years of glowing reviews by my dentist and oral hygienist (in combination with routine daily flossing) have made me a believer.  I am convinced that &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; or vibrating toothbrushes are better than a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has a unique vibration about every 30 seconds that provide a guide to moving quadrants in your mouth.  Every two minutes the brush has a longer vibration indicating two minutes of brushing, which may be sufficient for people with healthy gums and teeth, in combination with flossing and regular dental checkups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;SmartGuide&amp;#34; wireless display is supposed to coach you in brushing your teeth.  The &amp;#34;SmartGuide&amp;#34; lets you know when you are brushing too hard, and it tells you when you should move quadrants in your mouth.  I suspect some people will like the high-tech guide.  Others may find it annoying or forget to watch the display while they think about other things.  I learned that I do not press too hard with the toothbrush and I tend to spend a bit too long on the right side of my mouth versus the left side.  It is always nice to learn new things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with all sorts of goodies.  I have tried the &amp;#34;deep sweep brush,&amp;#34; which I think is okay, but I like the round brushes, which I think do a great job around my canine teeth.  The small brush probably does a good job of getting into small spaces and gaps, but it takes such a long time to clean each space that flossing is faster.  I really like the brush holder, which provides a great place to hold your various toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the multiple brushes and holders are Glide dental floss, Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, Crest Pro-Health mouthwash, and a lovely bag to put the goodies into.  I forget where the bag went; it disappeared into the house somewhere.  The mouthwash and the floss also got used quickly.  I am a huge fan of Crest Pro-Health mouthwash and Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, both of which I use daily.  The Crest Pro-Health mouthwash is alcohol free, but seems to do a great job of keeping my mouth germ-free.  The Glide floss is a high quality floss, but because of its relatively high cost, I have several alternatives that I routinely use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I like this toothbrush and adapted to the differences between it and the Sonicare quickly.  I like the round brush heads available for the Oral-B, whereas the Sonicare that I have just has a standard toothbrush configuration.  One thing I found slightly annoying is that the brush heads have openings that allow liquids to flow through the brush into undesirable locations.  I have learned to keep my head tilted back slightly to prevent fluids from dripping onto surfaces that I would prefer to avoid cleaning after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the annoyance of the dripping fluids, I love this toothbrush.  I will even give this toothbrush a slight edge over my previous Sonicare because of the rotating brush heads, though the edge is very slight.  I would absolutely buy another Oral-B toothbrush.  In fairness, I would also buy another Sonicare.  Which will I buy when the Oral-B inevitably breaks?  I will probably have to do a lot of internet searching to see which one has the lead at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!that flossing is faster.

            <li> Crest and Oral B teamed up to provide a Gingivitis/Gum Care Toothbrush Kit that includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush (includes charging stand, 4 different tootbrush heads and an electronic “SmartGuide” device to assist with brushing technique).&lt;br /&gt;- One Tube of Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;- Standard-sized container of Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Clinical Protection Dental Floss.&lt;br /&gt;- Medium-sized bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse&lt;br /&gt;- Carrying tote&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meat-and-potatoes of this ensemble is the toothbrush itself.  My dentists always suggest Oral B electric toothbrushes for teeth cleaning and the Precision 5000 is the Cadillac of toothbrushes.  This toothbrush boasts 5 brushing modes (Deep Clean, Massage, Easy/Sensitive Clean, Daily Clean and Whitening/Polishing) that allow for varying pulsations and spins, depending on the mode chosen.  Another useful feature is the pressure sensor that stops brush-pulsing and triggers a red light when brushing too vigorously (a practice that can eventually erode the gum line).  The four unique brush heads that are provided only add to the value of the kit as they can be costly if purchased individually.  The power charging base includes storage for four cleaning heads, so you’ll need some space on your countertop to park it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SmartGuide device (made by Braun) dictates recommended brushing times for each mode and divides the total time four segments … it is also a clock.  At the end of each segment, the timer beeps and the toothbrush pauses before starting the next segment.  Other than clock function and a means of making you feel guilty by not brushing for the entire four segments, I found this device rather unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest accessories (toothpaste, rinse and floss) complement the toothbrush nicely, especially the alcohol-free rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When two dental-care powerhouses join forces to present a tooth/gum care kit, you should have high expectations … the CREST + ORAL-B PROFESSIONAL GINGIVITIS KIT certainly delivers.ent a tooth/gum care kit, you should have high expectations … the CREST + ORAL-B PROFESSIONAL GINGIVITIS KIT certainly delivers.</li>
            <li> Gosh!  A toothbrush that gives you a smiley face for brushing the right amount of time.  This is a great tooth brush by itself without all of the gimmicky extras.  It really seems to do a great job of getting my teeth clean.  I really like the different levels of cleaning, because I have sensitive teeth and it does have a setting for that.  The only difference between the regular and plus brushing modes is the length of time that the guide sets for you to brush.  On the regular mode it gives you 30 seconds per quadrant and on the plus level it gives you 45 seconds per quadrant.  The sensitive mode which I used gives you a 30 second time per quadrant.  I brush longer than that just naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crest products that came as a bonus in the &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34; kit are top notch products.  You can get the toothbrush without the kit of products.  I have been using glide for years as it works best with my teeth which are a little close together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have resisted an electric toothbrush for years.  But I gave this one a try and am quite pleased, and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> NIce kit for dental care. Includes everything needed - a great gift for college students. I love the electric toothbrush - I had an old one that needed replacing and this one is perfect. The brush grip is comfortable. The brush keeps a good charge for several days, so it is great for travel. The included brush timer would be great for kids so that they can learn how long to brush their teeth. 30 seconds for each quadrant. An excellent buy!</li>
            <li> I love this electric toothbrush and kit.  Within the first week I had already noticed a difference in the amount of plaque buildup on my teeth.  My dentist has tried to get me to get an electric toothbrush for years because of plaque build-up and I now see why.  I love the timer that comes with this set.  It beeps for every 30 seconds so you know how much time to spend on each area of your mouth.  It&#x27;s a great system.  I also like the variety of heads available.  The toothpaste, floss and mouthwash that come with this set are also really great.  The toothbrush hold the charge well, and it&#x27;s charger is compact.  The system is easy to use and effective.  I am so glad I was able to try this out and I can&#x27;t wait to see my dentist in the new year to see if he notices the difference and I think he will.  I definitely have.  My mouth feels cleaner and fresher and I feel I am taking better care of it with this system.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is an amazing value and an awesome kit. The toothbrush is just wonderful and comes with plenty of heads for different cleaning/issues.. The mouthwash is a smaller sized bottle, but plenty to see if you like it and if it works well for you. Toothpaste and floss are full sized. This is a mouth transformation kit. If you have gum issues, or just want to take better care of your gums, this is the kit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I was using Sonicare Diamondclean and I was in love with it. Once I tried this Oral B toothbrush, I gave up on my Sonicare. I am 37, I smoke cigarettes, drink A LOT of energy drinks, and have braces. I NEED extra gum care and this toothbrush along with the mouthwash and toothpaste give me that. I would say that the toothbrush alone has made a big difference from when I was using the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can actually feel it working on my gums. It really feels like a gum massage. The smaller part of the head that moves separately is an awesome addition. That is where I feel the extra attention and the gum care. My teeth feel SO CLEAN after brushing with this one. I like that it is a more vigorous cleaning than with the Sonicare. It actually took me a long time to get used to the gentle cleaning that Sonicare toothbrushes give. I had been using Sonicare for about 10 years, so eventually I got used to it, although I never really did feel like they were really scrubbing as much as I liked. My teeth felt clean, but there was just something missing. This Oral B fills in the gap and gives me everything I am looking for, and then some. I just feel like my whole mouth is clean and fresh after using the Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouthwash is great for gums. I put some in my Waterpik (half mouthwash/half water) and I can tell a difference in the health and appearance of my gums. I do not get sore spots anymore and the sensitive areas are gone. Because of my braces, I tend to get gaps between my teeth down at the gumline. Debris get in there from eating and it can be painful and stay sore for a while. This mouthwash in the Waterpik really helps with all of the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is pretty good, although I think I will stick to my regular whitening toothpaste. I like a bit more bold mint flavor and I do need the whitening benefits due to cigarette smoking. Otherwise, it seems like a good toothpaste. It is a smoother mint flavor and seems to have almost a soothing effect on sore areas of the gum and mouth, so that is a plus when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mainly, I am just super impressed with the toothbrush. I had also tried the Oral B 7000 (black) but I much prefer this 5000 version. The 7000 was very impressive and the first Oral B to really make me switch from Sonicare, but just too loud. The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise. I thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not. It is sleek looking in black, but I just prefer the 5000 - I mean I really LOVE IT. The attention to the gums and the way it cleans so thoroughly and literally reaches every surface of the tooth, (even all around my braces!!!) is just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to invest in a good toothbrush, this is THE ONE to buy. if you need the extra gum care and attention this is the kit to buy. You can buy the toothbrush separate if you do not want all of the extra products, but for the price, you might as well get the bundle and try out the mouthwash, toothpaste and floss and see how you like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not intend to go back to Sonicare after having used this Oral B.

            <li> Package contains:&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B rechargable toothbrush with floss action head.  (Comes with 4 diff heads, there are 7 total)&lt;br /&gt;  Crest Pro-Health gum protection toothpaste (prevents or reverses gingivitis in 4 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;  Crest Pro-Health mouthwash (fights plaque and and gingivitis, kills germs, no alcohol burn)&lt;br /&gt;  Oral-B Glide floss&lt;br /&gt;  Comes with a Smart Guide which tells you what mode you are in, the time that you&#x27;ve been brushing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very dry mouth so I was excited about the floss action toothbrush because my flossing habits are not too dependable.  For some reason, I have days when I get a lot of soft plaque covering my teeth which is irritating my gums and thus increasing my gingivitis.  According to the box, this brush actually pulsates to break up plaque rather than just vibrating, which sounds more effective to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are a mix of pictures and text which I felt to be confusing.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out which mode to use the floss head on.  It has 5 modes so I finally assumed I needed to use the Daily Clean mode.  It also has these tiny little gaskets that fit on the brush head but I couldn&#x27;t get them to fit so stuck it on the shaft of the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush was scary at first when I used it, as I was afraid it was going to break my teeth, (I have osteoporosis and a few fillings), because it is really powerful.  However, my teeth felt really clean afterwards though I think it will take some practice to get used to.  I&#x27;m not sure how it is an effective flosser but we&#x27;ll see in time.  I&#x27;m gonna buy the polishing head (it doesn&#x27;t come with that brush head) because with the amount of power it puts out,  that brush head should work very good.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent system for improving daily dental cleaning and routines.  I&#x27;ve already been using both the Crest toothpaste and mouthwash, but the Oral-B system has really been an amazing addition to my daily cleaning.  It has brush attachments available for basic cleaning needs:  daily, deep-clean, and a great flossing attachment.  The timer and various cleaning timed programs are an excellent aid for cleaning long enough.  The system is easy to use with the instructions.  It did take my base unit a bit longer to charge at first, but now holds the charge the way it should.</li>
            <li> Excellent electric tooth brush with oral health kit! The Kit comes with:&lt;br /&gt;*Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Tooth Brush with SmartGuide&lt;br /&gt;*Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;*Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse&lt;br /&gt;*Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Clinical Protection Dental Floss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 is an excellent electric tooth brush. Certainly it is much, much better than the manual ones. Personally speaking, I prefer rounded head than the elongated head. With the rounded head, you can focus on each tooth more since it covers one tooth at a time (but for those who prefer elongated head, the kit comes with additional elongated head as well with 3 other types of head). It also has automatic timer built in: It is programmed for 2 mins total, and 2 mins are divided into 4 (30sec) durations. Each duration covering 1/4 (quadrant) of your teeth. This is quite helpful as you get used to it, so that you will not clean one section more than others. The brush is waterproof and rechargeable. And it is easy to hold being slim. It is also MADE IN GERMANY. The rechargeable battery is replaceable - this is huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;2. The brush has 5 modes: Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Massage and Whitening. Each mode works differently in speed of the oscillation with different types of head that is designed for specific purpose. You will feel the difference in each mode.&lt;br /&gt;3. It cleans well. As stated, it is superior than manual brushing. I always feel the smoothness of my teeth all around, even the wisdom teeth that is hard to reach.&lt;br /&gt;4. It comes with travel case to protect the electric brush and SmartGuide to show the progress of each brushing. It displays each quadrant of your mouth, and the timer that indicates how long you have left. It can be also used as digital clock. There is no extra work involved. Just put the batteries in and start brushing, then it automatically indicates the mode of your brushing. I find this very useful as I brush.&lt;br /&gt;5. The kit comes with toothpaste, floss, and a mouthwash. So you are ready to start a healthy oral hygiene. I realize that you may prefer other oral hygiene products over these, but these are not bad at all. If you do not like any alcohol based mouthwash, then Crest Pro Health Rinse is an excellent alternative. They are clearly good products that can help your oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price might be little prohibitive for someone who does not need all the stuff. If you use your own preferred paste, floss, and mouthwash, then just purchase this electric tooth brush separately - it will be cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes a long time to charge the brush. To charge fully, you need to put it on the charger for more than 15 hours. But this is minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I love Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric brush! Highly recommended!our brushing. I find this very useful as I brush.&lt;br /&gt;5. The kit comes with toothpaste, floss, and a mouthwash. So you are ready to start a healthy oral hygiene.

            <li> I used another brand and my dental hygienist kept asking me to watch how hard I brush because I had enamel wear. My dentist and his staff recommend Crest and Oral-B. Last time I was in I had some staining which was new for me. I decided I better get a new power brush. I planned to get an Oral-B so I was very excited to receive one to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit is pretty interesting. If you know someone fighting gingivitis, this would make an excellent gift. I have received samples of the mouthwash, toothpaste, and floss from the dentist so I have used them before. I like them all fine. Of course the toothbrush is the star of the show. It is fabulous that it comes with 4 different brushes. I love being able to try them out. I like to change from one to another often. My teeth feel really clean and no more staining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the timer. It gives you a smiley face if you brush for two minutes. I probably only last the full two minutes because I want the smiley. (-:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it is more cost effective to buy the kit or the toothbrush alone, probably varies, but as a gift, the kit is really nice. I noticed that there was also a whitening kit, which for the right person might make a nice gift, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I got this one, I was looking for an Oral-B toothbrush and I noticed the 7000 series. I think it is worth looking at too, if you are in the market for a new power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.  I typically buy the $1 disposables and just toss them every week or two when they (quickly) wear out.  But, this toothbrush has made me a believer.  This is a fantastic toothbrush that has significantly strengthened my gums and whitened my teeth in the last 30 days.  As a forewarning, you can expect a fair amount of gum soreness in the initial days/week of use-- particularly if your gums are not used to so much mechanical stimulation (similar to when you get your teeth cleaned). But, within a few days you will be completely hooked on the &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; clean feel you get from this toothbrush. The toothpaste, mouthwash and floss included are equally high quality.  The Crest mouthwash has replaced Listerine as one of my staple hygiene products and the toothpaste has a nice, light minty flavor.  Very pleased overall and would highly recommend.  It comes packaged very attractively in a little carrying bag.  This would be a great gift or a nice item to pick up for yourself!</li>
            <li> Superb! Works great, plenty of power, easy to use, love the brush!!!! The little additions (mouthwash, toothpaste, floss, bag I’ll never need again...) work the price up too much over the regular toothbrush-only option. Honestly, in my mind, they are advertising more Crest products and should give these items away with every brush, not charge more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this as a gift. Due to the bag and extras, it seems like an expensive, quality gift. If you have never tried Glide Floss, get you some!!! If it tears while flossing, it just breaks in half, no flossy mess!!! It’s wider too, so it does more every time you use it. I’d never go back to regular, standard floss.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush that is the real core of this set does a wonderful job of getting teeth clean, and encouraging a formerly reluctant pre-teen to develop much more regular brushing habits. The &amp;#34;smart guide&amp;#34; does seem like a little bit of overkill and is unlikely to be used very often as soon as the novelty wears off, but the brush itself is an excellent machine for helping your family be sure to keep brushing correctly and often.</li>
            <li> The perfect, complete package for that person that needs an electric toothbrush.  Complete with toothpaste, floss and mouthwash, this would be a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has 5 settings, and it lists them in the description.  I prefer the sensitive setting, as I recently had gum surgery and am now very aware of how hard I am brushing, which leads me into that nice feature.  This toothbrush will slow and the red light will come on if you are brushing too hard.  I like that, because it reminds me to use lighter pressure.  It comes with a separate display that keeps track of how long you are brushing, and also has a clock.  The brush pauses when it is time to switch sides.  I like the carrying case, as you can place the unit and the separate brushes in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a bit much with the display, personally.  The separate display portion is kind of a hassle.  I also wish it had a setting memory.  Every time you restart the toothbrush, it starts over at the first setting, so I have to press the arrow down to get to the sensitive setting.  It takes about 7 seconds, so you have wasted that time with the brush out of your mouth, trying to find the correct setting you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, it works well, there are just a few things I would prefer be different.  I prefer a little more of a simplistic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B 5000 is a great toothbrush.  It has five cleaning modes with multiple heads and does a great job.  It&#x27;s well-designed, powerful and ergonomic.  The major difference between the 5000 and 4000 is the wireless timer that times your brushing in each quadrant, forcing you to take your time and brush more thoroughly.  It&#x27;s an interesting concept and one that will help a lot of people brush more effectively.  If you feel you don&#x27;t need the timer then the 4000 is a great alternative for you at a slightly lower cost.  It&#x27;s a personal preference as I used a lower model Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and it times you with a little vibration stutter every thirty seconds. I always found that feature to be just as useful.  The other added benefit of the 5000 vs. the 4000 is the massage mode.  Again, for some the extra modes, and particularly having 5 vs. 4, won&#x27;t make that much difference and in that case you have the 4000 option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with Oral-B and either the 4000 or 5000 will do a great job for you.  If you need the extra \\&quot;coaching\\&quot; to get the job done right then spring for the extra cost and get the 5000 model.  One final comment:  the bundle is nice but it seems a pricey way to add toothpaste, rinse and floss.  No question the full bundle would make a great gift but if buying for myself I&#x27;d prefer to purchase the toothbrush separately from the accompanying products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B for years and didn&#x27;t think my experience could get much better. With this kit it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive gums and tight teeth, so dental care is not something I just &#x27;happen to do&#x27;. Using this kit combination over the last month I&#x27;ve noticed next to no gum tenderness at any point during the month (ladies understand me here) and zero of the bleeding I&#x27;d typically get at times. The connected timer is very helpful with making sure I get those two minutes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall VERY pleased with this kit. I expect when I see my dentist in a couple weeks he too will notice how much better my teeth and gums are looking.</li>
            <li> The Crest + Oral-Professional Gingivitis Kit has an electric toothbrush plus timer and case, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash in a disposable tote bag. There is a selection of four brush heads included, and I like the spinning head the best.  I have been using an Oral-B 1000 model for a few weeks so can compare it to this high-end 5000 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts. At least when new, the battery will last for more than week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings. There are several brushing modes, including one for sensitive teeth and a mode with longer brushing times.  The sensitive mode is noticeably gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model will alert when a 30 or 45 second brushing time per quadrant has finished, by pulsing and with the little radio timer.  I don&#x27;t really like the timer feature but it would be very helpful to teach a child how to brush; the visual reinforcement is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush tips change easily but don&#x27;t come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users. The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip. It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems. I would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes; it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque. Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  Fortunately, this model warns about using too much pressure.  I find this helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an accessory that fits over the charging base to hold extra toothbrush heads which some may find useful as well as a carrying case.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t bother with the weight and bulk when traveling and will continue to carry a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the handle shows water and toothpaste residue and the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush. I do think it&#x27;s worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features. An electric toothbrush would be especially helpful for anyone with arthritis in the hands.e residue and the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush.

            <li> I was surprised by just how solid this set is!  First, it includes a high-quality electric toothbrush, which alone is worth most of the price of this kit; next you get a Crest mouthwash, toothpaste, floss, a tooth brushing timer and extra toothbrush heads. Finally, The toothbrush comes with a great charging stand that also stores toothbrush heads; everything comes in a nice Crest faux fabric bag with a gifting name tag: great attention to detail!  All these products together, that focus on fighting gingivitis?!?  Yes, please!  I would definitely recommend this product,</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush is an upgrade for me from my older Oral B brush set.  I&#x27;ve had the other for about 10 years and it has done a great job for me and lasted.  The brush heads from that one fit this handle just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is quite a step up from the professional grade brush I bought from my dentist about 10 years ago.  There are extra modes and the smart guide timer (which works wirelessly) is a great feedback mechanism that times me at 30 seconds per side and also indicates if I am pressing too hard.  It&#x27;s great feedback and the visual actually makes the time to brush go by quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to think of it as a gimmick, but the smart guide is truly smart and a great way to get feedback and build better habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need to buy something for your traveling student?  This is a great gift!</li>
            <li> My husband does brush daily, but he had been using a manual toothbrush all his life and wasn&#x27;t about to change even though I had bought him different types over the years, mostly store brands. The &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; battery kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also will not go to a dentist unless there is a REAL need for him to go....just considers it a waste of money......so, combine manual toothbrushing with not so regular dental cleanings plus senior in years and you have a potential gum problem in the making so I was thrilled to try this Oral B Gingivitis Kit for that very reason!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, after using it for a couple of weeks he REALLY likes it.  That&#x27;s saying something!  And, I have noticed a difference in his teeth which to me means everything because he is getting a better and deeper cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this kit is a terrific idea for someone just learning to really take care of their teeth and/or someone who is experiencing some gum/teeth issues and a dentist has recommended a more thorough cleaning.  Everything is included to get started and the way the kit is put together is very attractive.</li>
            <li> This kit includes an Oral-B Professional Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush with a charging stand and four different toothbrush heads. They also throw in a tube of toothpaste, dental floss, rinse and a small tote bag.  The most interesting thing in the kit is the electronic “SmartGuide” device to assist with brushing technique that communicates wirelessly with the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  toothbrush has five  brushing modes (Deep Clean, Massage, Easy/Sensitive Clean, Daily Clean and Whitening/Polishing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SmartGuide device has a timer that splits the session into four segments. It lets you know when you are brushing with too much pressure (smiley face turns to frowney face) and even serve as a clock when not in use.  The device was easy to set the clock and otherwise  set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are  four unique brush heads that provided;  there are other types available for sale, but they only included four in the kit.  I am not sure how they chose these four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first time I used an electric toothbrush and I did notice a better result. Really enjoyed the feedback from the device.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is great. Has a display unit that times you while you brush to ensure you get each quadrant. The toothpaste is thorough in cleaning. The mouthwash is non-alcohol so no burn. The floss is a tape style floss. Gets the gunk out. There is a carry bag if you like.&lt;br /&gt;All around good set.</li>
            <li> Unnecessarily complicated  - I&#x27;d rather have had extra brushes than one of 5 different kinds.  The clock was really hard to set and a waste -a tooth brush that just turns off is just as effective</li>
