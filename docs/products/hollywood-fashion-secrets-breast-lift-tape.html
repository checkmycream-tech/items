            <li>A girls best friend!</li>
            <li>This is a great product!!</li>
            <li>Now ladies you can&#x27;t just where them with a V-cut tank and think everything is going to look perfect.</li>
            <li>I loved it!</li>
            <li>I saw this product on TV and what they described sounded great.</li>
            <li>They worked surprisingly well and provided good lift (not like a bra)</li>
            <li>Great product even for a full size girl!</li>
            <li>Omg This product was AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Great to wear with that special outfit out or just running around doing errands.</li>
            <li>It was one of those things that was too good to be true!</li>
            <li>These work great just make sure u are dry off real good  </li>
            <li>When lifting the breast it causes a wrinkle on top of the breast to accommodate the stretch.</li>
            <li>Works okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect when you have a dress that has no back to it!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Ordering more.</li>
            <li>Ideal for smaller breastfed women.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your lotion and oil free when applying.</li>
            <li>(super cute and sexy).</li>
            <li>Applying it is easy</li>
            <li>My sister is a B cup and they worked fine for her.</li>
            <li>Basically ladies, if you have (real) large breasts then you probably should stay away from backless clothing items or save your money for breast implants !</li>
            <li>Sounded fantastic.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve discovered if I use silicone nipple covers plus the lift tape, I stay headlight-free and comfortably in place.</li>
            <li>I wore these with a tub top and for the first time ever I had bottom boob cleavelege</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a full C</li>
            <li>This tape doesn&#x27;t lift a full C cup.  </li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>It easily becomes wrinkled and you better get the tape in the correct position the first time or else you need to start with a new tape because once you remove it, there is not resticking.</li>
            <li>Was really pleased with the lift I got (I&#x27;m a B cup but also 50 yrs old</li>
            <li>Got to learn how they work, because right now it&#x27;s not working.</li>
            <li>This lift take sticks and gets the job done with a natural and comfortable look.</li>
            <li>Totally did the trick:-)</li>
            <li>It is only good for A cup definitely not larger.</li>
            <li>and it did do much lifting or hding for me.</li>
            <li>They work really well.</li>
            <li>is really all about how you put it on.  </li>
            <li>It took a few tries &amp; more than just &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; piece to create the breast lift I desired, but I can honestly say it worked quite well</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sucks that you only get one shot at getting it on right, but for busty girls that want to wear a dress that requires not wearing a bra or a strapless bra and that honestly can&#x27;t because of their endowed gifts, this will work wonders!</li>
            <li>only suggestion would be to create a larger size for fuller more ample breasts women.</li>
            <li>If you have DDD-cup breasts or larger, I don&#x27;t think this is the right product for you.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think it made my chest look much better, and I felt better having at least some support, not overly perky like when you have a push-up bra on, but not saggy like going totally bra-less.  </li>
            <li>These actually work better than expected.</li>
            <li>It does not work for us d cups or larger because our breasts weigh too much.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised with how well these worked.</li>
            <li>Only thing is, depends on the dress additional nipple covers might be necessary haha</li>
            <li>If you have an average size chest, can&#x27;t wear a bra with a certain outfit, and are uncomfortable with them jostling around under your clothes, these are a good temporary fix (I wore them for 5-6 hours, never fell off or shifted).  </li>
            <li>I will use them again with clothing that no other bra will work with.</li>
            <li>It was a little tricky positioning the tape just right to not have the tape showing and also not make a noticeable wrinkle.  </li>
            <li>To me it was worth having that very slight irritation because I don&#x27;t intend to wear them often.</li>
            <li>it holds for a the first few hours but it eventually looses its grip.</li>

            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about these is that they can be difficult to apply smoothly on your skin so they can appear ripply which can be seen under thin/tight clothing.</li>
            <li> (because I only had 3 of them), with a black plunging halter dress.  </li>
            <li> but overall, I like them aside from a few things.</li>
            <li> A must buy &amp; money well spent.</li>
            <li> I feel like the wrinkling that other reviewers are upset about</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> And finally, if the fabric you&#x27;re wearing is thin, definitely grab some nipple pasties too.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the cost-too expensive to wear everyday-and the fact that if you do try and wear them every day, you will get red and tender on the sides of your breasts.  </li>
            <li> However they did leave slight irritation around the edges after removal (just as I won get from a bandage).  </li>
            <li> They are a little bit hard to get flat.</li>
            <li> If you want to wear a tank top with these bad boys you can&#x27;t show cleavage at all!</li>
            <li> and you could see them a little.</li>
            <li> so a little droopy).  </li>
            <li> A little hard to take off afterwards, but they work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a B cup which is not a lot but enough that it is noticeable and uncomfortable if I don&#x27;t wear a bra.</li>
            <li> The dress I had to wear had thin fabric</li>
            <li> That causes a big wrinkle which is both uncomfortable and visible!!!</li>
            <li> I gotta keep these bad boys like panties.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> Well, this product might work for someone else, but for my needs, it didn&#x27;t lift anything  :(</li>
            <li> Terrible product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I saw this product on TV and what they described sounded great. I could wear some of my tops without an actual bra but receive the benefits of the bra!!! It was supposed to give me a lift and no bands to show. Sounded fantastic. IT DOES NOT WORK. When lifting the breast it causes a wrinkle on top of the breast to accommodate the stretch. That causes a big wrinkle which is both uncomfortable and visible!!! Also the adhesive is not working, it came off in couple of minutes. It was one of those things that was too good to be true!</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people don&#x27;t like these but overall, I like them aside from a few things. I&#x27;m a B cup which is not a lot but enough that it is noticeable and uncomfortable if I don&#x27;t wear a bra. So, I&#x27;ve discovered if I use silicone nipple covers plus the lift tape, I stay headlight-free and comfortably in place. I have not had a problem with them unsticking, they stay put until I remove them. I wipe off with witch hazel before application. What I don&#x27;t like about these is that they can be difficult to apply smoothly on your skin so they can appear ripply which can be seen under thin/tight clothing.</li>
            <li> These work great just make sure u are dry off real good  and it will hold u up</li>
            <li> Not meant for women with larger breasts.</li>
            <li> This lift take sticks and gets the job done with a natural and comfortable look. The adhesive removes well and does not hurt coming off. Great product even for a full size girl!</li>
            <li> Works okay. Made for women with smaller breasts. I&#x27;m a full C and it did do much lifting or hding for me. My sister is a B cup and they worked fine for her.</li>
            <li> it holds for a the first few hours but it eventually looses its grip. using a body glue helps keep it in place longer but its definitely not an all day wear.</li>
            <li> Ideal for smaller breastfed women. It does not work for us d cups or larger because our breasts weigh too much.</li>
            <li> They work really well. A little hard to take off afterwards, but they work.</li>
            <li> I have C-cup breasts, and I only wore these lifts once (because I only had 3 of them), with a black plunging halter dress.  It was a little tricky positioning the tape just right to not have the tape showing and also not make a noticeable wrinkle.  Overall I think it made my chest look much better, and I felt better having at least some support, not overly perky like when you have a push-up bra on, but not saggy like going totally bra-less.  I feel like the wrinkling that other reviewers are upset about is really all about how you put it on.  It&#x27;s not a miracle, anti-gravity product.  You need to use these within reason.  If you have DDD-cup breasts or larger, I don&#x27;t think this is the right product for you.  If you have an average size chest, can&#x27;t wear a bra with a certain outfit, and are uncomfortable with them jostling around under your clothes, these are a good temporary fix (I wore them for 5-6 hours, never fell off or shifted).  And finally, if the fabric you&#x27;re wearing is thin, definitely grab some nipple pasties too.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised with how well these worked. I had a backless bridesmaid dress that I had to wear in the July temperatures of 95 degrees, and they still stayed on! I was shocked. They are a little bit hard to get flat. The dress I had to wear had thin fabric and you could see them a little. Also, they don&#x27;t cover your nipples, so I had to get something to do that too. Those two things keep it from being give stars.</li>
            <li> Was really pleased with the lift I got (I&#x27;m a B cup but also 50 yrs old so a little droopy).  However they did leave slight irritation around the edges after removal (just as I won get from a bandage).  To me it was worth having that very slight irritation because I don&#x27;t intend to wear them often.</li>
            <li> I am a 34c and used these for lift in a backless dress.  They worked surprisingly well and provided good lift (not like a bra), my breasts didn&#x27;t look like they were sagging and they lasted all evening.  I will use them again with clothing that no other bra will work with.</li>
            <li> Got to learn how they work, because right now it&#x27;s not working.</li>
            <li> Well, this product might work for someone else, but for my needs, it didn&#x27;t lift anything  :(</li>
            <li> These actually work better than expected. I&#x27;m a 40DD and was pretty desperate to find something to work for my full figure. Creativity is key here ladies! It took a few tries &amp; more than just &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; piece to create the breast lift I desired, but I can honestly say it worked quite well and it&#x27;s better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion would be to create a larger size for fuller more ample breasts women.</li>
            <li> A girls best friend! I am a 36DD and this tape holders the girls up and in place!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect when you have a dress that has no back to it! Then it lifts up your bras so no one can see the bra lines.</li>
            <li> This tape doesn&#x27;t lift a full C cup.  Applying it is easy but when you get to step #2 and lift the last piece of tape and lift, it doesn&#x27;t stick well to the skin.  It easily becomes wrinkled and you better get the tape in the correct position the first time or else you need to start with a new tape because once you remove it, there is not resticking. Basically ladies, if you have (real) large breasts then you probably should stay away from backless clothing items or save your money for breast implants !</li>
            <li> This is a great product!! It sucks that you only get one shot at getting it on right, but for busty girls that want to wear a dress that requires not wearing a bra or a strapless bra and that honestly can&#x27;t because of their endowed gifts, this will work wonders! Only thing is, depends on the dress additional nipple covers might be necessary haha</li>
            <li> It is only good for A cup definitely not larger. Be careful!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It does what is supposed to do (yes, you can even go bra-less). The only down side is the cost-too expensive to wear everyday-and the fact that if you do try and wear them every day, you will get red and tender on the sides of your breasts.  Great to wear with that special outfit out or just running around doing errands.</li>
            <li> I was so exited about trying out this product, as I was in a beauty pageant and intended to wear a low plunge dress. BIG MISTAKE. After following the directions for using this product I realized that I could have gotten the same results from using masking tape. Using this &#x27;lift tape&#x27; will cause your skin to buckle and the &#x27;lift&#x27; lasts for all of 5 minutes. Terrible product! Lucky for me I used all four pairs to practice with instead of waiting until pageant day. Thank goodness for &#x27;butt glue&#x27;! Totally did the trick:-)</li>
            <li> Omg This product was AMAZING. Now ladies you can&#x27;t just where them with a V-cut tank and think everything is going to look perfect. If you want to wear a tank top with these bad boys you can&#x27;t show cleavage at all! I wore these with a tub top and for the first time ever I had bottom boob cleavelege (super cute and sexy). Just make sure your lotion and oil free when applying. I loved it! Ordering more. I gotta keep these bad boys like panties.</li>
            <li> Amazed that these actually worked especially for women with larger breast. A must buy &amp; money well spent.</li>
