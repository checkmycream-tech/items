            <li>The best description i have for it is in the title.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasier (best I can describe it) but not as good as their Shaggy Look in my opinion.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s Great.</li>

            <li>Better off without it, myself!</li>
            <li>The scent is great- not too overpowering but a nice and clean fragrance!</li>
            <li>Often I have to re-examine and touch-up because this doesn&#x27;t adhere to damp hair as best as it could unless you apply it very liberally.  </li>
            <li>your rub it in your hands to warm it up</li>
            <li>This stuff smells really good, and the tea tree extract helps with healthier and better looking hair.</li>
            <li>First of all this stuff is doesn&#x27;t have a very good hold, it won&#x27;t hold my hair up without the help of a hairdryer.</li>
            <li>It has a good holding capability, and it gives a light texture/</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to work into hair!</li>
            <li>It keepss your hair feeling soft, smells great, yet has a good strong hold!</li>
            <li>My husband has tried various hair products and this is the one that he has liked the best.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the tradeoff, but it feels better to put this on than feeling like the hair pulling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for all types of hair, the whole house is using it now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In order to get the best results I would recommend following the steps above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not my husband&#x27;s favorite hair product - but i like the smell better than some others out there</li>
            <li>I tried this not expecting much, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has more of a thicker lotion consistency</li>
            <li>I love the way this product smells, and the scent lingers for awhile.</li>
            <li>This one is definitely my favorite of the cheaper selections.</li>
            <li>As a result, this may not be great if you&#x27;re looking for a \\&quot;Grab-and-Go\\&quot; product which works well for a fast application and running out the door.  </li>
            <li>Thus, if you apply this and leave some on your ears, you will surely look like Ben Stiller&#x27;s character in \\&quot;Something About</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>First of all, this stuff seemed pricey when I went to purchase it, but I&#x27;ve heard too many good things about it.</li>
            <li>sniff of this product is nice and again it is better and closer to my old beloved \\&quot;Slick\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I find that Tresemme or Aussie &amp;#34;Miraculously Smooth&amp;#34; seem to provide the best volume and hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you worried about glue in your hair whether you continue to waste money on this or make your own home mix, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin this is great for you</li>
            <li>This goes on easy with damp hair.</li>
            <li>A favorite styling product that gives clean control.</li>
            <li>smells strong &amp; gross....threw it away</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Axe, so I assumed it would smell way too strongly and make my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li>The Axe cream feels light on your hair, has a pleasant smell and gives a very natural look while holding the style throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I find that it looks best when my hair is about 2&amp;#34; in length or less.</li>
            <li>Even still, it does an pretty impressive job of holding the position you comb it into for the entire day, without any flakes or whiteness by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of using any product in my hair, but this cream is really light and won&#x27;t leave my hands all sticky if I run my hands through my hair.  </li>
            <li>B/c of this, I do not feel comfortable traveling with it.</li>
            <li>Good hold, natural look, smells wonderous.</li>
            <li>I have been using my new Axe Styling Cream and am very pleased at the results I can get with this product.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Great hair product and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>I bought it because the product had so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>If it adhered to the hair better and had a little more hold it would be a 5-Star-Affair for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another pretty good product which works well for my hair is: \\&quot;Retro</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how much I liked this product.</li>
            <li>The hold isn&#x27;t magnificent but it&#x27;ll keep my thick head of hair up for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^^UPDATE^^^&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have heard only good things about it</li>
            <li>I have heard only good things about it</li>
            <li>It takes a good deal of soap to rinse out of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: avoid daily use.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and light.  </li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>a quick comb-through will rejuvenate the cream quite a bit..</li>
            <li>The scent also goes away fairly quickly, about 1 or 2 hours.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the product very much.</li>
            <li>To my surprise it actually has a pleasant smell and worked very well.</li>
            <li>The greatest fault if this product is that it is very hard to wash out.</li>
            <li>and i would recommend it for most others though if they are looking for lower cost hair product that is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with pomade to keep natural look but get more hold.</li>
            <li>have found a far better hair product than this.</li>
            <li>Favorite hair product, by far.</li>
            <li>It does leave your hair looking more naturally styled.</li>
            <li>Good price, product as expected</li>
            <li>It is definetly worth the price</li>
            <li>The hold is great and not too stiff.</li>
            <li>This one is just right for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I must do 2-3 applications in order to get the look right</li>
            <li>Pretty cool, exactly what the product is.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product because I know that a little bit more money could be paid for a far superior product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash off easy with water like most other hair products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This stuff, unlike anything else I&#x27;ve used, has great hold, but doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or hard feeling in your hair.</li>
            <li>Holds pretty well &amp; doesn&#x27;t alter hair texture.</li>
            <li>I like it because it doesn&#x27;t look like I have product on my hair but keeps it in place pretty well.</li>
            <li>Good Product and much easier to apply than the Suave Brand that I was previously using.  </li>
            <li>This gives good shaping and hold for my longer style without feeling stiff.  </li>
            <li>The hold isn&#x27;t very strong but that was to be expected with the product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much but was blown away how it&#x27;s exactly how advertised.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes when it dries, even if you rub it.</li>
            <li>I decided to raise this item to 5 stars because it actually works very well now and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, leaves your hair molded without too much of a hard or gelled look (provided you apply the directed amount.)</li>
            <li>the price for what it really is...</li>
            <li>I really like the matte finish that this product provides.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to style.</li>
            <li>This cream works really well for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff really bonds my hair together to get the look</li>
            <li>However, it feels very greasy.</li>
            <li>This axe styling cream works very well, and does not leave you with a greasy look.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a cream, I find it much easier to evenly rub throughout my hair when it&#x27;s damp, so I avoid having product clump up on me in one spot.  </li>
            <li>It does very well.  </li>
            <li>If you were to throw a percentage on how much body my hair has it would be around 10%.  </li>
            <li>Holds well without leaving too much residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wash out and holds for a long time.</li>
            <li>It leaves it with a very natural look but exactly in the position I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Axe Natural Look Hair Cream does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>But I dislike getting ripped off to an extraordinary level by paying for the fancy marketing on two other very basic and cheap products just mixed together in a colorful tub.</li>
            <li>This hair creme works okay with a few flaws.</li>
            <li>Pretty much your standard surfer haircut.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the only Axe product I&#x27;d ever buy, but it works well.</li>
            <li>its fair works but not great</li>
            <li>On its own I would say it only lasts about half the day for me.</li>
            <li>This works just as good as some other more expensive creams I have used.  </li>
            <li>Scent was nice and subtle - now it smells like I just rubbed one of those dollar pine scented car air fresheners all over my head.</li>
            <li>I imagine it would be possible for the Axe research labs to be able to bring a little more hold to the Axe Natural product w/out all the crunchiness and stickiness of other creams, pastes etc?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if the natural look is what you&#x27;re after.</li>
            <li>Very natural look, just like its name.</li>
            <li>The hair looks very natural, still being held well in place.  </li>
            <li>So this stuff actually works pretty well...</li>
            <li>my hair feels far softer than normal.</li>
            <li>A jar lasts quite a long time, so it is quite economical.  </li>
            <li>;) and a tub lasts me about 2 months of daily weekday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for what it is, but I was led to believe based on other reviews here that it leaves your hair soft and natural feeling.</li>
            <li>Has good hold, but fades away later in the day, a bit too natural if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>You can wet your hands and run them through your hair for a quick touch</li>
            <li>(i.e. majority of hairs covered w/out dry lifeless patches) and get the HOLD right.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely has more HOLD than the Axe Natural Look product but the cost is that it can leave your hair a bit stiffer and less \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Much easier than American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li>I thought it would leave my hair soft and natural.</li>
            <li>So far this product seems to work for me.  </li>
            <li>Never feels sticky or greasy, and my hair stays soft.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend if you still want your hair to be soft or natural feeling/looking.</li>
            <li>No glue or hair product is going to make your hair fall out or turn gray early...</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to...holds things in place and looks natural.</li>
            <li>As it names indicates the feel and looks are natural without leaving flakes or making the hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, this product somehow holds your hair in place but makes it look and feel soft and natural.  </li>
            <li>Dampen your hands, run them through your hair and you can completely redo the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though I have used a gel habitually to style my hair, I always preferred a lighter textured natural look, which don&#x27;t always come from the gelled hair.  </li>
            <li>(i.e. running whole hand thru and working on smaller groups of strands of hair).  </li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair looking/feeling SOFT and NATURAL, just as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I leave one Axe Natural at home and one at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>than anything I&#x27;ve found in professional salons.  </li>
            <li>I will update on if American Crew is worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I FIRMLY work the cream into most of the strands of hair in various manners</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this styling \\&quot;cream\\&quot; works on my relatively thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The hold is not super strong--on a windy day it&#x27;ll get blown out of place, but the product makes it easy to fix back with just my hand.</li>
            <li>at the ingredients on the back of the tub, and you will see PVP (POLYVINYLPYRROLIDONE)...this is THE MAIN CHEMICAL IN GLUESTICKS...</li>
            <li>i have 2-inch long straight hair as a reference.</li>
            <li>I went to the local market to buy my normal hair product</li>
            <li>I will be finding a new hair cream after this last jar is done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very transparent (in both the good and the bad way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine, fairly thick, borderline body-less medium-length hair.  </li>
            <li>I get my hair DAMP, not wet</li>
            <li>It rarely likes product except for few brands such as Axe natural understated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again this stuff is okay, not great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly scented and is probably one of the less cloying products in this line (I&#x27;d put it third, behind the Smooth Look Pomade and the Buzzed Look Cream).</li>
            <li>really helps keep hair in that natural look while adding a little hold.</li>
            <li>There is an initial shine when first application dries, but if you run your hand through your hair a couple few times, the shine disappears and it truly does appear to be entirely natural with no product.  </li>
            <li>If I do not FIRMLY apply it, it tends to glide over certain parts of hair and then the final result shows the \\&quot;lack of coverage\\&quot; and some areas look DRY and some areas have the WET LOOK.  </li>
            <li>First I get my hair soaking wet and then lightly dry</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the idea of glue, try just plain conditioner...it actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li>is how I use the product - with my hair a little damp, I work the product in fairly well and put my hair in a slightly exaggerated position.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick and very dense, straight hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apply little product if your hair is thick and straight like that of a horse (such as mine) either after shower or when your hair is clean and dry.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great hair product and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I bought it because the product had so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> If it adhered to the hair better and had a little more hold it would be a 5-Star-Affair for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another pretty good product which works well for my hair is: \\&quot;Retro</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how much I liked this product.</li>
            <li> The hold isn&#x27;t magnificent but it&#x27;ll keep my thick head of hair up for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^^UPDATE^^^&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have heard only good things about it</li>
            <li> I have heard only good things about it</li>
            <li> It takes a good deal of soap to rinse out of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: avoid daily use.</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and light.  </li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> a quick comb-through will rejuvenate the cream quite a bit..</li>
            <li> The scent also goes away fairly quickly, about 1 or 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product very much.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it actually has a pleasant smell and worked very well.</li>
            <li> The greatest fault if this product is that it is very hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> and i would recommend it for most others though if they are looking for lower cost hair product that is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with pomade to keep natural look but get more hold.</li>
            <li> have found a far better hair product than this.</li>
            <li> Favorite hair product, by far.</li>
            <li> It does leave your hair looking more naturally styled.</li>
            <li> Good price, product as expected</li>
            <li> It is definetly worth the price</li>
            <li> The hold is great and not too stiff.</li>
            <li> This one is just right for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I must do 2-3 applications in order to get the look right</li>
            <li> Pretty cool, exactly what the product is.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product because I know that a little bit more money could be paid for a far superior product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wash off easy with water like most other hair products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This stuff, unlike anything else I&#x27;ve used, has great hold, but doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or hard feeling in your hair.</li>
            <li> Holds pretty well &amp; doesn&#x27;t alter hair texture.</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t look like I have product on my hair but keeps it in place pretty well.</li>
            <li> Good Product and much easier to apply than the Suave Brand that I was previously using.  </li>
            <li> This gives good shaping and hold for my longer style without feeling stiff.  </li>
            <li> The hold isn&#x27;t very strong but that was to be expected with the product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much but was blown away how it&#x27;s exactly how advertised.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes when it dries, even if you rub it.</li>
            <li> I decided to raise this item to 5 stars because it actually works very well now and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, leaves your hair molded without too much of a hard or gelled look (provided you apply the directed amount.)</li>
            <li> the price for what it really is...</li>
            <li> I really like the matte finish that this product provides.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to style.</li>
            <li> This cream works really well for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff really bonds my hair together to get the look</li>
            <li> However, it feels very greasy.</li>
            <li> This axe styling cream works very well, and does not leave you with a greasy look.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a cream, I find it much easier to evenly rub throughout my hair when it&#x27;s damp, so I avoid having product clump up on me in one spot.  </li>
            <li> It does very well.  </li>
            <li> If you were to throw a percentage on how much body my hair has it would be around 10%.  </li>
            <li> Holds well without leaving too much residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wash out and holds for a long time.</li>
            <li> It leaves it with a very natural look but exactly in the position I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Axe Natural Look Hair Cream does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> But I dislike getting ripped off to an extraordinary level by paying for the fancy marketing on two other very basic and cheap products just mixed together in a colorful tub.</li>
            <li> This hair creme works okay with a few flaws.</li>
            <li> Pretty much your standard surfer haircut.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the only Axe product I&#x27;d ever buy, but it works well.</li>
            <li> its fair works but not great</li>
            <li> On its own I would say it only lasts about half the day for me.</li>
            <li> This works just as good as some other more expensive creams I have used.  </li>
            <li> Scent was nice and subtle - now it smells like I just rubbed one of those dollar pine scented car air fresheners all over my head.</li>
            <li> I imagine it would be possible for the Axe research labs to be able to bring a little more hold to the Axe Natural product w/out all the crunchiness and stickiness of other creams, pastes etc?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if the natural look is what you&#x27;re after.</li>
            <li> Very natural look, just like its name.</li>
            <li> The hair looks very natural, still being held well in place.  </li>
            <li> So this stuff actually works pretty well...</li>
            <li> my hair feels far softer than normal.</li>
            <li> A jar lasts quite a long time, so it is quite economical.  </li>
            <li> ;) and a tub lasts me about 2 months of daily weekday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for what it is, but I was led to believe based on other reviews here that it leaves your hair soft and natural feeling.</li>
            <li> Has good hold, but fades away later in the day, a bit too natural if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> You can wet your hands and run them through your hair for a quick touch</li>
            <li> (i.e. majority of hairs covered w/out dry lifeless patches) and get the HOLD right.  </li>
            <li> This product definitely has more HOLD than the Axe Natural Look product but the cost is that it can leave your hair a bit stiffer and less \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Much easier than American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> I thought it would leave my hair soft and natural.</li>
            <li> So far this product seems to work for me.  </li>
            <li> Never feels sticky or greasy, and my hair stays soft.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend if you still want your hair to be soft or natural feeling/looking.</li>
            <li> No glue or hair product is going to make your hair fall out or turn gray early...</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to...holds things in place and looks natural.</li>
            <li> As it names indicates the feel and looks are natural without leaving flakes or making the hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, this product somehow holds your hair in place but makes it look and feel soft and natural.  </li>
            <li> Dampen your hands, run them through your hair and you can completely redo the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I have used a gel habitually to style my hair, I always preferred a lighter textured natural look, which don&#x27;t always come from the gelled hair.  </li>
            <li> (i.e. running whole hand thru and working on smaller groups of strands of hair).  </li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair looking/feeling SOFT and NATURAL, just as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I leave one Axe Natural at home and one at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> than anything I&#x27;ve found in professional salons.  </li>
            <li> I will update on if American Crew is worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I FIRMLY work the cream into most of the strands of hair in various manners</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this styling \\&quot;cream\\&quot; works on my relatively thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The hold is not super strong--on a windy day it&#x27;ll get blown out of place, but the product makes it easy to fix back with just my hand.</li>
            <li> at the ingredients on the back of the tub, and you will see PVP (POLYVINYLPYRROLIDONE)...this is THE MAIN CHEMICAL IN GLUESTICKS...</li>
            <li> i have 2-inch long straight hair as a reference.</li>
            <li> I went to the local market to buy my normal hair product</li>
            <li> I will be finding a new hair cream after this last jar is done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very transparent (in both the good and the bad way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine, fairly thick, borderline body-less medium-length hair.  </li>
            <li> I get my hair DAMP, not wet</li>
            <li> It rarely likes product except for few brands such as Axe natural understated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again this stuff is okay, not great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightly scented and is probably one of the less cloying products in this line (I&#x27;d put it third, behind the Smooth Look Pomade and the Buzzed Look Cream).</li>
            <li> really helps keep hair in that natural look while adding a little hold.</li>
            <li> There is an initial shine when first application dries, but if you run your hand through your hair a couple few times, the shine disappears and it truly does appear to be entirely natural with no product.  </li>
            <li> If I do not FIRMLY apply it, it tends to glide over certain parts of hair and then the final result shows the \\&quot;lack of coverage\\&quot; and some areas look DRY and some areas have the WET LOOK.  </li>
            <li> First I get my hair soaking wet and then lightly dry</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the idea of glue, try just plain conditioner...it actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li> is how I use the product - with my hair a little damp, I work the product in fairly well and put my hair in a slightly exaggerated position.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and very dense, straight hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply little product if your hair is thick and straight like that of a horse (such as mine) either after shower or when your hair is clean and dry.  </li>
            <li> There is no real scent, and when the product is in my particular hair a kind of feels rough as if my hair is artificial and still, like something you&#x27;d feel in a wig.  </li>
            <li> This has little to no smell, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling or looking greasy, and it provides decent hold.</li>
            <li> For less money for the volume, you can really just mix a bottle of Tresemme or some other thick conditioner and squeeze about 10-25% Elmer&#x27;s glue in depending on your desired hold, shake it up, and have almost 20 times the exact same product for about the same price.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the look it gave for me at least.</li>
            <li> They have literally just taken the main ingredient in gluestick glue and mixed it into some sort of cream / hair conditioner (I can tell because I actually usually just use Tresemme&#x27; hair conditioner to style my hair, and this stuff feels the same except just slightly stickier), and they have jacked up the price.  </li>
            <li> the long term test of time will determine whether or not I buy it again though.</li>
            <li> I expected to open it and have that seal to peel and leave in place, but there was none at all.</li>
            <li> Provides firm hold and humidity resistance but leaves hair looking shiny and natural.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and straight.</li>
            <li> and I personally didn&#x27;t like it as much as other types I have used.  </li>
            <li> Lastly if I need a little bit of extra hold</li>
            <li> I use several other Axe products and decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various other makers including Redken, Crew etc etc etc and</li>
            <li> To maintain that style I blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when I blow dry my hair the hold still starts to get loose towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li> little of this goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> next everyday hair</li>
            <li> so it will probably be my next everyday hair product.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to use it in wet hair.</li>
            <li> The effect of the natural look hair cream is just to make your hair is thick an oily.  </li>
            <li> I get by putting on other waxes</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t describe my hair as afro like, but it is extremely poofy.</li>
            <li> begin with a small amount and re-apply if necessary.  </li>
            <li> I let it fully dry for a few minutes then &amp;#34;mess</li>
            <li> Left my hair in hard clumps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to tell if a person using this cream is actually using product in their hair.</li>
            <li> I have been growing out my hair, and so no more &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; because it is too long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled to find a product that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking brown or dark red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very strong product.</li>
            <li> Then I rub a half pea sized amount of the product in my hands until it turns</li>
            <li> I like this because it is not to heavy &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I also like how little of the product you have to use.</li>
            <li> After that, I don&#x27;t seem to have as food of results, so I tend to switch to a little cheaper product (Suave Professionals, Men&#x27;s Styling Paste, 1.75Ounce).</li>
            <li> Tried the product for a few day&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Now for the few things that I do like.</li>
            <li> My hair is on the thin side, medium short length and without product it looks frizzy.</li>
            <li> As a result, I require a MEDIUM-HOLD hair cream which isn&#x27;t too heavy...</li>
            <li> I also am not a huge fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> Holds in place well, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff or brittle.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair look naturally tame .  </li>
            <li> usually do a come over with my &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; standing up but flowed over.</li>
            <li> This is almost the same quality as some of the expensive ones that my hairdresser uses on me.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that it didn&#x27;t come sealed in anyway.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too sticky or thick.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so it gets annoyingly &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; unless I use some sort of product to hold it into shape.</li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical because of the AXE name and their usual target audience.  </li>
            <li> I hate gels and similar products because they just make you look like you have plastic hair</li>
            <li> Its a bit tough to get through your hair, but it holds all day once its in!</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s lousy.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and hate my hair feeling stiff.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;such a bad product ...</li>
            <li> It takes two seconds to apply (I hate messing with my hair).  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good hold, natural look, smells wonderous. Makes me feel like zoolander frolicking through a tea tree forest in the spring.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s not bad.  I have really thick hair though and I personally didn&#x27;t like it as much as other types I have used.  But that could just be me and i would recommend it for most others though if they are looking for lower cost hair product that is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical because of the AXE name and their usual target audience.  You see, I&#x27;m a middle age man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this stuff works!  It takes two seconds to apply (I hate messing with my hair).  It holds all day.  And looks like hair with nothing in it - a critical element for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m gushing about a hair product.  But my wavy hair has been needing something like this for a loooong time.  Don&#x27;t let your bias against inexpensive, mass-market products targeted towards teenagers deter you.  It works.</li>
            <li> This goes on easy with damp hair. Much easier than American Crew Fiber. However, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as you&#x27;d like. That&#x27;s the tradeoff, but it feels better to put this on than feeling like the hair pulling I get by putting on other waxes is going to cause premature hairloss.</li>
            <li> A favorite styling product that gives clean control.</li>
            <li> Tried the product for a few day&#x27;s. Left my hair in hard clumps. I thought it would leave my hair soft and natural. I bought it because the product had so many positive reviews. Maybe I was supposed to brush my hair for awhile?  I eventually went to a hair product store that recommended a product called Vitapoint. So far this product seems to work for me.  Gene T.</li>
            <li> Never feels sticky or greasy, and my hair stays soft.</li>
            <li> Holds well without looking greasy. They changed the scent though. Been using this stuff for over a year. Scent was nice and subtle - now it smells like I just rubbed one of those dollar pine scented car air fresheners all over my head. Now it&#x27;s lousy. I will be finding a new hair cream after this last jar is done.</li>
            <li> smells strong &amp; gross....threw it away</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for what it is, but I was led to believe based on other reviews here that it leaves your hair soft and natural feeling. It definitely does not. It hardens almost immediately and feels a lot like hairspray. Would not recommend if you still want your hair to be soft or natural feeling/looking.</li>
            <li> really helps keep hair in that natural look while adding a little hold. I use it in combination with pomade to keep natural look but get more hold. On its own I would say it only lasts about half the day for me. i have 2-inch long straight hair as a reference.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  It makes your hair look naturally tame .  The only complain is that it leaves residue on your hands, even after your rinse your hands and wash with soap.</li>
            <li> So this stuff actually works pretty well...I have no complaints about its function.  The reason I am rating this only 2/5 stars?...the price for what it really is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***THIS STUFF IS LITERALLY JUST CONDITIONER AND GLUE!!!***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at the ingredients on the back of the tub, and you will see PVP (POLYVINYLPYRROLIDONE)...this is THE MAIN CHEMICAL IN GLUESTICKS...go ahead, take a second to Google it.  They have literally just taken the main ingredient in gluestick glue and mixed it into some sort of cream / hair conditioner (I can tell because I actually usually just use Tresemme&#x27; hair conditioner to style my hair, and this stuff feels the same except just slightly stickier), and they have jacked up the price.  For less money for the volume, you can really just mix a bottle of Tresemme or some other thick conditioner and squeeze about 10-25% Elmer&#x27;s glue in depending on your desired hold, shake it up, and have almost 20 times the exact same product for about the same price. If you don&#x27;t like the idea of glue, try just plain conditioner...it actually works pretty well. I find that Tresemme or Aussie &amp;#34;Miraculously Smooth&amp;#34; seem to provide the best volume and hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you worried about glue in your hair whether you continue to waste money on this or make your own home mix, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it. No glue or hair product is going to make your hair fall out or turn gray early...that is all strictly based on your genetics and stress level...nothing to do with product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, do I dislike this product?...no.  But I dislike getting ripped off to an extraordinary level by paying for the fancy marketing on two other very basic and cheap products just mixed together in a colorful tub.</li>
            <li> I stuck a key in a plug socket as a child and have since had frizzy hair.  It is a pain in the butt since I just want to hop out of the shower and not have to worry about fixing it up or anything.  I hate gels and similar products because they just make you look like you have plastic hair and it flakes everywhere like dandruff when your head is brushed.  If you have a similar plight, you should try this stuff.  The Axe cream doesn&#x27;t make your head feel like you&#x27;re wearing a helmet and it doesn&#x27;t flake at all.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to...holds things in place and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked... It&#x27;s great for all types of hair, the whole house is using it now.  The shine and smell  it gives everyones hair is great. We&#x27;ll be adding this to our weekly shopping list.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how much I liked this product. It&#x27;s Axe, so I assumed it would smell way too strongly and make my hair feel greasy. To my surprise it actually has a pleasant smell and worked very well. I am going to continue to use it and the long term test of time will determine whether or not I buy it again though.</li>
            <li> This hair creme works okay with a few flaws. First of all this stuff is doesn&#x27;t have a very good hold, it won&#x27;t hold my hair up without the help of a hairdryer. Even when I blow dry my hair the hold still starts to get loose towards the end of the day. The greatest fault if this product is that it is very hard to wash out. I have medium length hair and it takes 3 shampooings to get all of the creme washed out. I also am not a huge fan of the smell. Now for the few things that I do like. Throughout the day you can always run your hands through your hair and not get an oily or sticky feeling all over your hands. When I run my hands through my hair my hair feels far softer than normal. I also like how little of the product you have to use. Now here is how I apply the product to my hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. First I get my hair soaking wet and then lightly dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Then I rub a half pea sized amount of the product in my hands until it turns white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. After that I run my hands throughout my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Proceeding that step I comb my hair into a spiked up type style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. To maintain that style I blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Lastly if I need a little bit of extra hold I spray my hair with some hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to get the best results I would recommend following the steps above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again this stuff is okay, not great. After this product is gone I will try American Crew&#x27;s Pomade. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product because I know that a little bit more money could be paid for a far superior product. I will update on if American Crew is worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Update) I decided to raise this item to 5 stars because it actually works very well now and washes out easily. The hold isn&#x27;t magnificent but it&#x27;ll keep my thick head of hair up for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^^UPDATE^^^&lt;br /&gt;I have found a far better hair product than this. It is called &amp;#34;Paul Mitchell Medium Hold Hair Cream&amp;#34; Please check this out! You won&#x27;t be disappointed! I am also going to try Tgi bed head and see how that turns out. I have heard only good things about it so it will probably be my next everyday hair product.out! You won&#x27;t be disappointed! I am also going to try Tgi bed head and see how that turns out. I have heard only good things about it so it will probably be my next everyday hair product.</li>
            <li> Good Product and much easier to apply than the Suave Brand that I was previously using.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is not made for this product, but I don&#x27;t see any benefit to using this in my experience.  The effect of the natural look hair cream is just to make your hair is thick an oily.  There is no real scent, and when the product is in my particular hair a kind of feels rough as if my hair is artificial and still, like something you&#x27;d feel in a wig.  All smoothness that I have prior when I take a shower is lost after using this stuff.  Better off without it, myself!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and hate my hair feeling stiff.  This gives just enough hold and conditioning properties to keep it from being all frizzy!</li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t buy you will lose all of your hair&lt;br /&gt;such a bad product ...</li>
            <li> Axe Natural Look Hair Cream does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  A jar lasts quite a long time, so it is quite economical.  I highly recommend it if the natural look is what you&#x27;re after.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I cannot find Axe Shaggy Look. It is a bit greasier (best I can describe it) but not as good as their Shaggy Look in my opinion. If anyone has a handle on where to get my Shaggy Look I would appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I really like the matte finish that this product provides. I find that it looks best when my hair is about 2&amp;#34; in length or less. After that, I don&#x27;t seem to have as food of results, so I tend to switch to a little cheaper product (Suave Professionals, Men&#x27;s Styling Paste, 1.75Ounce).</li>
            <li> Favorite hair product, by far. Very natural look, just like its name.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to tell if a person using this cream is actually using product in their hair. It&#x27;s very transparent (in both the good and the bad way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a wax. It doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue in your hair. It&#x27;s a water-based cream, so a spritz of water and a quick comb-through will rejuvenate the cream quite a bit.. It&#x27;s lightly scented and is probably one of the less cloying products in this line (I&#x27;d put it third, behind the Smooth Look Pomade and the Buzzed Look Cream). The scent also goes away fairly quickly, about 1 or 2 hours. It doesn&#x27;t take much to style. I keep my hair fairly short (~2&amp;#34;) and a tub lasts me about 2 months of daily weekday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, with all this, there comes drawbacks. It&#x27;s not a very strong product. It won&#x27;t hold a look like gel or pomade. It also doesn&#x27;t last very long. It will lose its hold after 4 or 5 hours, faster if it&#x27;s humid or you&#x27;re outdoors, and even faster if it&#x27;s windy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product with its fair share of drawbacks, but the positives of the cream outweigh the negatives.</li>
            <li> This cream works really well for my curly hair. I wouldn&#x27;t describe my hair as afro like, but it is extremely poofy. This stuff really bonds my hair together to get the look I&#x27;m going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually do a come over with my &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; standing up but flowed over. Pretty much your standard surfer haircut.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and straight. It rarely likes product except for few brands such as Axe natural understated.  As it names indicates the feel and looks are natural without leaving flakes or making the hair look greasy. Do not touch your hair after applying the product as instructed or else you&#x27;ll end up with greasy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply little product if your hair is thick and straight like that of a horse (such as mine) either after shower or when your hair is clean and dry.  It takes a good deal of soap to rinse out of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: avoid daily use. Give yourself a day or two to rest using another brand, as I noticed that my hair falls after continuing use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of using any product in my hair, but this cream is really light and won&#x27;t leave my hands all sticky if I run my hands through my hair.  Plus ordering on line is way cheaper than buying in store. It&#x27;s the only product I keep on a Prime subscription.</li>
            <li> Holds pretty well &amp; doesn&#x27;t alter hair texture.</li>
            <li> not my husband&#x27;s favorite hair product - but i like the smell better than some others out there and he says it works well enough.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the look it gave for me at least.</li>
            <li> There is an initial shine when first application dries, but if you run your hand through your hair a couple few times, the shine disappears and it truly does appear to be entirely natural with no product.  Even still, it does an pretty impressive job of holding the position you comb it into for the entire day, without any flakes or whiteness by the end of the day.  And I&#x27;m only using a tiny amount on two finger tips, rubbed into my hands, then onto my damp hair.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I use several other Axe products and decided to give this a try. I have been using my new Axe Styling Cream and am very pleased at the results I can get with this product. My hair is on the thin side, medium short length and without product it looks frizzy. I have used gels, but they tend to get flakey and always have that gel look.  The Axe cream feels light on your hair, has a pleasant smell and gives a very natural look while holding the style throughout the day. You can wet your hands and run them through your hair for a quick touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets 5 stars from me because the quality, the price and the results.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I like the thickness (thicker than gel, but not clay-like). It holds well without getting crispy. However, it feels very greasy. It doesn&#x27;t wash off easy with water like most other hair products I&#x27;ve used. I need to wash with soap just to get the greasy feeling off of my fingers. For that reason, I am never buying again.</li>
            <li> I tried this not expecting much, but it works great.  It comes in a variety of formulas with varying degrees of hold.  This one is just right for me.  Holds in place well, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff or brittle.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried various hair products and this is the one that he has liked the best. It is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes when it dries, even if you rub it.</li>
            <li> This axe styling cream works very well, and does not leave you with a greasy look. The hold isn&#x27;t very strong but that was to be expected with the product. I enjoy the product very much.</li>
            <li> I found this product by accident and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I went to the local market to buy my normal hair product but this was all they had.  I didn&#x27;t expect much but was blown away how it&#x27;s exactly how advertised. As others have mentioned, this product somehow holds your hair in place but makes it look and feel soft and natural.  If your hair does get messed up, just can even just use your hands to put your hair back how you like.  Dampen your hands, run them through your hair and you can completely redo the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I use the product - with my hair a little damp, I work the product in fairly well and put my hair in a slightly exaggerated position.  I let it fully dry for a few minutes then &amp;#34;mess up&amp;#34; my hair.  It leaves it with a very natural look but exactly in the position I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference I have very thick and very dense, straight hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used in my hair. I have naturally curly hair, so it gets annoyingly &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; unless I use some sort of product to hold it into shape. I&#x27;ve used gels for years, but those always leave my hair feeling either gummy or flaky (or both). This stuff is great! My wife gives a thumbs up on how my hair looks too!</li>
            <li> Has good hold, but fades away later in the day, a bit too natural if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> This product works great! It&#x27;s has more of a thicker lotion consistency so it&#x27;s easy to work into hair! The hold is great and not too stiff. It&#x27;s easy to wash out and holds for a long time. The scent is great- not too overpowering but a nice and clean fragrance! I would definitely buy this product again! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Pretty much the only Axe product I&#x27;d ever buy, but it works well. I&#x27;ve got thick hair. This has little to no smell, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling or looking greasy, and it provides decent hold. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t look like I have product on my hair but keeps it in place pretty well. Because it&#x27;s a cream, I find it much easier to evenly rub throughout my hair when it&#x27;s damp, so I avoid having product clump up on me in one spot.  The hold is not super strong--on a windy day it&#x27;ll get blown out of place, but the product makes it easy to fix back with just my hand.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, leaves your hair molded without too much of a hard or gelled look (provided you apply the directed amount.) My one complaint is that it didn&#x27;t come sealed in anyway. I expected to open it and have that seal to peel and leave in place, but there was none at all. B/c of this, I do not feel comfortable traveling with it.</li>
            <li> tried man products and all make you feel greasy....not this.  if you have sensitive skin this is great for you</li>
            <li> Provides firm hold and humidity resistance but leaves hair looking shiny and natural.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells, and the scent lingers for awhile. Its a bit tough to get through your hair, but it holds all day once its in!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different hair pastes, creams, waxes, etc. This one is definitely my favorite of the cheaper selections. This is almost the same quality as some of the expensive ones that my hairdresser uses on me. It&#x27;s not too sticky or thick. It does leave your hair looking more naturally styled. Use it after drying your hair. You don&#x27;t want to use it in wet hair. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I like it.  Though I have used a gel habitually to style my hair, I always preferred a lighter textured natural look, which don&#x27;t always come from the gelled hair.  Gel sometimes makes your hair look plasticky.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this styling \\&quot;cream\\&quot; works on my relatively thick hair.  It does very well.  It has a good holding capability, and it gives a light texture/look when applied.  The hair looks very natural, still being held well in place.  The hair doesn&#x27;t look plastic at all. The scent is fresh and light.  Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> its fair works but not great but does it job</li>
            <li> I have been growing out my hair, and so no more &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; because it is too long.  This gives good shaping and hold for my longer style without feeling stiff.  Also, no shine so it doesnt look like &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; in my hair</li>
            <li> Great hair product and lasts a long time! Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Good price, product as expected</li>
            <li> The product still has the Tea Leaf added but they don&#x27;t promote it on the front of the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on the \\&quot;Quest of the Holy Mane\\&quot; since The Body Shop discontinued its \\&quot;Slick\\&quot; hair cream for men.  My hair has never looked the same...and I ran out of my stock in 2008.  I&#x27;ve tried various other makers including Redken, Crew etc etc etc and none we&#x27;re similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t exactly similar in texture but it is very similar in results.  I have fine, fairly thick, borderline body-less medium-length hair.  If you were to throw a percentage on how much body my hair has it would be around 10%.  As a result, I require a MEDIUM-HOLD hair cream which isn&#x27;t too heavy...otherwise it is \\&quot;Bowl-Do City U.S.A.\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply this Axe cream I get my hair DAMP, not wet and I FIRMLY work the cream into most of the strands of hair in various manners (i.e. running whole hand thru and working on smaller groups of strands of hair).  If I do not FIRMLY apply it, it tends to glide over certain parts of hair and then the final result shows the \\&quot;lack of coverage\\&quot; and some areas look DRY and some areas have the WET LOOK.  This product leaves your hair looking/feeling SOFT and NATURAL, just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I begin with a small amount and re-apply if necessary.  As a result, this may not be great if you&#x27;re looking for a \\&quot;Grab-and-Go\\&quot; product which works well for a fast application and running out the door.  Often I have to re-examine and touch-up because this doesn&#x27;t adhere to damp hair as best as it could unless you apply it very liberally.  I&#x27;ve found that I must do 2-3 applications in order to get the look right (i.e. majority of hairs covered w/out dry lifeless patches) and get the HOLD right.  This will \\&quot;blow doors\\&quot; for those seeking to shower, style and go.  I leave one Axe Natural at home and one at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your rub it in your hands to warm it up it takes on a white paste appearance but that goes away once you work it intoyour hair.  The visual of this product isn&#x27;t the prettiest inside the container.  Thus, if you apply this and leave some on your ears, you will surely look like Ben Stiller&#x27;s character in \\&quot;Something About Mary\\&quot;.  Buyer beware...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sniff of this product is nice and again it is better and closer to my old beloved \\&quot;Slick\\&quot; than anything I&#x27;ve found in professional salons.  If it adhered to the hair better and had a little more hold it would be a 5-Star-Affair for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another pretty good product which works well for my hair is: \\&quot;Retro Vinyl\\&quot; by Beyond the Zone (a working paste).  This product definitely has more HOLD than the Axe Natural Look product but the cost is that it can leave your hair a bit stiffer and less \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and soft to the touch.  I imagine it would be possible for the Axe research labs to be able to bring a little more hold to the Axe Natural product w/out all the crunchiness and stickiness of other creams, pastes etc?</li>
            <li> product was the product i purchased. The best description i have for it is in the title. check it out.</li>
            <li> First of all, this stuff seemed pricey when I went to purchase it, but I&#x27;ve heard too many good things about it. This stuff smells really good, and the tea tree extract helps with healthier and better looking hair. This stuff, unlike anything else I&#x27;ve used, has great hold, but doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or hard feeling in your hair. It keepss your hair feeling soft, smells great, yet has a good strong hold! It is definetly worth the price and I&#x27;d definetly reccomend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Great. Pretty cool, exactly what the product is. Looks good on my hair. Ye</li>
            <li> This works just as good as some other more expensive creams I have used.  I like this because it is not to heavy &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Love it. Holds well without leaving too much residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a male with blonde hair I&#x27;ve always struggled to find a product that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking brown or dark red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of this goes a long, long way. The tub will likely last me a year or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 star for the overpowering fragrance</li>
    </ol>
