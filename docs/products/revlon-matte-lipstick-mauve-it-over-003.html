    <ol>
            <li>Perfect color!!</li>
            <li>great nude matte shade.</li>
            <li>This is a great lipstick.</li>
            <li>This product was delivered faster than estimated and it great condition.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find this color on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>a good dupe for this is the NYX matte lip cream in Stockholm.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lipstick for a friend and she loved it, it was a neutral color, that popped out (if that makes sense).</li>
            <li>A great color and a nice dupe for mac&#x27;s velvet teddy.</li>
            <li>(though I wear it after applying a lip balm), and gives a good matte effect.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li>and I think that it is a really good nude for my complexion</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I am very happy with the product</li>
            <li>I love the product! :)</li>
            <li>The lipstick came in good shape and the product worked just fine.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t the greatest for me, kinda makes me look dead, but I am still happy with the product and how it was delivered.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>recommend this product to those who love shades of pinkish nude lipsticks</li>
            <li>Application is pretty smooth and the price is great</li>
            <li>creates a nice natural blush on lips if you are fair.</li>
            <li>I was very excited for this lipstick to come because it&#x27;s very famous within the whole &amp;#34;Kylie Jenner Dupe Lipsticks&amp;#34; and I decided to give this try.</li>
            <li>I like it because it does go on easily and looks the way I want it to.  </li>
            <li>and it works just fine for that purpose.</li>
            <li>I like this lipstick, it&#x27;s  smooth consistency</li>
            <li>My favorite color- can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s really on-</li>
            <li>Not the kind that will drain your face completely.</li>
            <li>The price is just right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect lipstick shade for everyday, I wish Revlon would bring it back.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly as I remembered it.  </li>
            <li>Lasted long and was smooth.</li>
            <li>As a result, this lipstick (Mauve it Over) is more suited for people with lighter skin than dark skin.</li>
            <li>a tiny bit chalky, but with a little lip balm under you should be good to go.</li>
            <li>started using this couple of days ago and am really liking it.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a tint of natural pink color to your lips, making it look fresh and supple .&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like the color but does not stay on for long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a very dark person, but the lipstick looks a lot like my skin color, so it looks as if I have no lips at all from a distance with this lipstick I applied.</li>
            <li>Apparently Revlon is not making this color anymore as I cannot find it anywhere.</li>

            <li> My favorite color- can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s really on- creates a nice natural blush on lips if you are fair.</li>
            <li> This is a great lipstick. I wish they sold them in stores.  I purchased this color because of Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li> really like the color but does not stay on for long.</li>
            <li> Well I learned something about purchasing shades of makeup with which one is not familiar.  Don&#x27;t. Not fault of purveyor but never shade never is as shown on paper</li>
            <li> Exactly as I remembered it.  Perfect color!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect lipstick shade for everyday, I wish Revlon would bring it back.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate nude lipstick for me. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;not my lips but better&amp;#34; nude. Not the kind that will drain your face completely.</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick, it&#x27;s  smooth consistency and it&#x27;s subtle color. Not chalky or drying. I got it to add too other lipsticks as sort of a highlighter and it works just fine for that purpose. The price is just right so I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this lipstick to come because it&#x27;s very famous within the whole &amp;#34;Kylie Jenner Dupe Lipsticks&amp;#34; and I decided to give this try.

Oh well, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have no interest in writing extended reviews of anything I buy off your website.  Please eliminate this requirement and make it voluntary.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I am very happy with the product</li>
            <li> I purchased this lipstick for a friend and she loved it, it was a neutral color, that popped out (if that makes sense). Lasted long and was smooth.</li>
            <li> A great color and a nice dupe for mac&#x27;s velvet teddy. Application is pretty smooth and the price is great</li>
            <li> I like it because it does go on easily and looks the way I want it to.  Usually have to re-apply it about 3/4 of the day through.  I will definitely buy it again.  Norma Heagy</li>
            <li> The color you get is jot what&#x27;s in the picture!!!  It&#x27;s a pale nude. UGLY! Even had to pay for shipping. Never agin...</li>
            <li> This product was delivered faster than estimated and it great condition. The color isn&#x27;t the greatest for me, kinda makes me look dead, but I am still happy with the product and how it was delivered. Thank You.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product used by multiple YouTube gurus and was expecting a pinky nude color, however what I got was a nude color which has not even the slightest hint of mauve! I like the formula if the lipstick, but the color isn&#x27;t a winner.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but it&#x27;s such a hassle to return things, so I guess I&#x27;m stuck with it. Color is not what it looked like online.</li>
            <li> Works great. The lipstick came in good shape and the product worked just fine. The color matches my brown african American skin.</li>
            <li> I got this lipstick after I watched a youtube video where a beauty blogger was raving about it.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this couple of days ago and am really liking it.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a tint of natural pink color to your lips, making it look fresh and supple .&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my lips dry (though I wear it after applying a lip balm), and gives a good matte effect.&lt;br /&gt;Im not giving it a rating of 5, because i Feel it does not last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to those who love shades of pinkish nude lipsticks</li>
            <li> Just as i expected! I love the product! :)</li>
            <li> This lipstick is creamy and I think that it is a really good nude for my complexion which is a MAC NC44/45. It is not drying n the lips at all. I even ordered two seeing that this is discontinued.</li>
