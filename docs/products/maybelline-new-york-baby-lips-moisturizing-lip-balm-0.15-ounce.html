            <li>This has just tge perfect amount of color &amp; moisturizes my lips.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Baby Lips is an awesome product.  </li>
            <li>Baby lips for sure!!!</li>
            <li>the smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Baby lips are amazing!!</li>
            <li>but she said it give her the perfect amount of color and makes her lips feel good!</li>
            <li>This smells very good, and has a tint of color</li>
            <li>Very good color and quality.  </li>
            <li>Very good purchase.  </li>
            <li>Given I have a very fair skin tone, the tint is noticeable but just one swipe is all I need</li>
            <li>This shows that you don&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg for a great, attractive and moisturizing lip product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly pigmented for a lip balm, so I almost treat it like a lipstick.</li>

            <li>Though for those that don&#x27;t care about toxins or unnatural products, it&#x27;s still a good item!</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t listen and get it get a color that would look good on lips!</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy in my book!</li>

            <li>, I got it on time and am happy</li>

            <li>and the company was great with providing tracking information.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great color</li>
            <li>Lip balm never has a great color, but the Baby Lips</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great to have moisturized lips &amp; with some color too.</li>

            <li>Both work great, though I prefer the shade of Peach Kiss to this one.</li>
            <li>Baby lips are great for softening your lips while giving you a pop of color.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Also, it is great if I want a tint of color with my lip balm.</li>

            <li>and it does nothing good for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you want to wear it under lipstick.</li>
            <li>feels good on your lips and it smells good....</li>

            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>, it glides on and it tastes &amp; smells good.</li>

            <li>Very,very good product though</li>

            <li>this is good for you.</li>
            <li>this was an good purchase.</li>
            <li>I heard good reveiws on it from friends and in some of the beaty blogs and magazines I read.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t sticky, it provides immediate moisture and it lasts a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li>It would be best on light and medium-skinned people.</li>
            <li>This balm is really nice and has a great tinted color to it.&lt;br /&gt;I carry around in my pocket and reapply when needed.</li>
            <li>Smooth texture and great flavor/scent!</li>
            <li>Niece loved it. . . . .</li>

            <li>This baby lips doesn&#x27;t look good on anyone in my family.</li>
            <li>the scents they have smell good too.</li>
            <li>I loved this lip balm.</li>
            <li>so this a good replacement</li>
            <li>its a good lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Also a good price.</li>

            <li>Great product, shipped quickly, I love the color.</li>

            <li>so, people who have a darker skin tone it might either be way too bright or just a nice pinky color.</li>
            <li>And the pictures on the case look very cute.</li>
            <li>not that great, just okay</li>
            <li>The product itself is very cute also, which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, looks good on my tan latina complexion, however I have to reapply but not too often</li>
            <li>It gives it just the right amount of shine and it makes my lips look plump and beautiful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice, have a fruited smell, the packaging was nice, I may look to invest in more.</li>

            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>the color shows up really nice and it has a nice good slightly strong scent I love it!!</li>
            <li>Amazing</li>
            <li>Leaves your lips feeling so smooth, great smell and has just a hint of color.</li>
            <li>I also really love the bright tropical scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Baby lips is amazing.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>But this thing smells amazing, it is the most pigmented out of the baby lips I own (Yummy Plummy, Coral Crush, Cherry Me), and it&#x27;s good to layer with if you want to amp up your lips and give your lipstick a neon undertone.</li>
            <li>the color is amazing</li>
            <li>Just like any good lip balm you should apply it more than once a day because it would be like saying &amp;</li>
            <li>and I must say it has A nice color to it.</li>
            <li>But now that I got this chap stick that has a nice smell to it...</li>
            <li>This is a nice lip gloss, but you have to keep re-applying over and over.</li>
            <li>And all the different colors are great and look wonderful on!</li>
            <li>The people who always liked the flavored lip balms.</li>
            <li>Is a nice lip tint, but isn&#x27;t a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>this is nice mix of both when you are on the go.</li>
            <li>It smells so good :)</li>
            <li>I liked that it looked like lipstick</li>
            <li>But I liked the scent.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but not as hydrating as I would expect.</li>
            <li>unpleasant)it smelled kind of like a fruit punch/strawberry smell, so</li>
            <li>It did have a kind of taste to it</li>
            <li>how &#x27;hazardous&#x27; a product is, meaning how toxic the ingredients are.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice light color and smells great.</li>
            <li>Nice lip balm.</li>
            <li>Nice product, came on time.</li>
            <li>This is so nice.</li>
            <li>It is not the best moisturizer, so don&#x27;t count on it so much for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am kind of OCD when it comes to applying chapstick/lip balm throughout the day</li>
            <li>one has a nice, *</li>
            <li>and I liked the taste</li>
            <li>Feels really nice on my lips, keeps them from getting chapped.</li>
            <li>Honestly, these remind me of the &amp;#34;tinker bell&amp;#34; glosses you used to get when you were a preteen years ago..</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve found that after it wears off (which does take a while) it leaves your lips just a tad tinted, so even if you can&#x27;t reapply immediately you still have some color on your lips, which is nice.</li>
            <li>this is a nice thing to always have in your purse.</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 3 because I&#x27;m kind of iffy on whether I like it or not.</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, amazing, unbelievable, perfect, cute, nice, stylish, yummy, delicious-smelling,useful, priceless, acceptable, peacemaking, lovable.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, great price, recognizable brand.</li>
            <li>This is a really super Maybelline product that makes your lips feel great, without being gloppy -- the kind of glop that makes strands of your hair stick to it.</li>
            <li>than that It is a great light product I love the color</li>
            <li>Their ColorSensational HighShine lipstick is also a good choice for moisturizing, but Baby Lips is great since it includes spf 15, and the moisture really lasts.</li>
            <li>I like it, it feels good on my lips and really is cute :)</li>
            <li>Maybelline quality, fair price, and more appealing than lip gloss and lipstick for her age.</li>
            <li>I got a couple of the colorless options and I love those even more!</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s pretty good, that&#x27;s why!</li>
            <li>Love this product! :)</li>
            <li>i was suprised how cute this color was on me, i love it!</li>
            <li>Its bright and not too light, no shimmer, and a fruit punch kinda smell.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and smells soooo good.</li>
            <li>It is the best lip moisturizing balm so far that&#x27;s out their.</li>
            <li>my 8 year old daughter likes to wear it too and its the perfect tint to not look like lipstick</li>
            <li>It is amazing :)</li>
            <li>It is a really good lip balm with a fruit scent and light taste.</li>
            <li>Love it&#x27;s nice color as lipstick</li>
            <li>It is way too light and too bright</li>
            <li>I use it on top of my lipstick and it gives it a nice glossy look.</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely delicious and my lips are considerably softer.  </li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and very girly!</li>
            <li>it seems to be a good fit for the summer</li>
            <li>Very moist, not too greasy and leaves the ideal tint</li>
            <li>The lip balms are smooth, go on easy, and give great color.</li>
            <li>Great product and just what I needed at the right price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried another more cherry colored Baby Lips and liked that one a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I love Baby Lips more than most because it is tinted, and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>but this is very light.</li>
            <li>:P Very, very bright bubblegum pink.</li>
            <li>Even if you have darker lips, (I have very light colored lips)</li>
            <li>I love this color because you can wear it lightly every day, or you can cake it on for nice events, and it always looks nice :)</li>
            <li>People who complain about this probably have a very VERY light shade of lips.</li>
            <li>and it goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>I heard many good things about it, but I was less than impressed.</li>
            <li>it was very inexpensive and very cute!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>There are way better lip tints out there</li>
            <li>This is more like lipstick than chap stick since it colors your lips.</li>
            <li>I thought this was more like a fancy brand of Chapstick, but its actually more than that</li>
            <li>since the day she got it and tried it on, she fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>In love with the color and the silky smooth application!</li>
            <li>Love IT!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love Baby Lips, each time I&#x27;m in the store I have to buy one, even if I already have the shade.</li>
            <li>my two favorite brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You do have to apply it more than once a day, but that is because it is a tinted lip balm NOT a colored lipstick.</li>
            <li>(doesn&#x27;t bother me, but some people don&#x27;t like to do anything more than once a day)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Bath &amp; Body Works has better ones.</li>
            <li>Even Carmex or Chapstick work better than this.</li>
            <li>Nivea is better.</li>
            <li>I do wish it would be more of a chap stick than what it is though.</li>
            <li>I love baby lips and the price on amazon it 2 to 3 dollars cheaper than at a CVS or Wallgreens &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>It is really nice and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and with a hint of color that is nice for my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>love it including the color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome for people who are very low maintenence, too.</li>
            <li>love the color and smell of it.</li>
            <li>I wonder if they were expecting something more.</li>
            <li>I have seen many people recommend this product on YouTube, so I want to try it.</li>
            <li>I love mine</li>
            <li>Baby lips is awesome and you should definitely get it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend:)</li>
            <li>I love just about anything made by Maybelline, so I was overly ecstatic to find this product cheaper here then in the stores.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more of a shiny-glossy lip than color.</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>just apply more if you want a darker color.</li>
            <li>Im Better off getting a Chapstick.</li>
            <li>but it still goes on smooth!</li>
            <li>I love Baby Lips.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great lip balm!</li>
            <li>Many lip products say they do, but don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love Maybelline.</li>
            <li>I love this product, its my go to lip balm.</li>
            <li>I knew that they would love it</li>
            <li>These are ok, that&#x27;s all just ok.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the egg shaped lip balm.</li>
            <li>I love lip gloss and lipstick</li>
            <li>the feel of the gloss is ok</li>
            <li>when I apply it to my lips for some reason, but rubbing my lips together evens out the color and feels better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>guess I though they were more for teenagers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna be ordering some more Baby Lips.</li>
            <li>love love love.</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute product to buy.</li>
            <li>so I love lip glosses.</li>
            <li>This stuff does not offer 8 hours of moisture, more like 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>The more I have to use it, the quicker</li>
            <li>I go through the product, the more product I buy.</li>
            <li>I love baby lips.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it love</li>
            <li>The color is really cute</li>
            <li>much better products out there.</li>
            <li>sure which ones we wanted, so she got,</li>
            <li>This has got to be the most misleading name for a product ever.  </li>
            <li>I was immediately drawn to them because of their bright and fun colors.</li>
            <li>They reminded me of my childhood love for Lisa Frank products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>Thank you, Maybelline, for making such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I love this tinted chapstick.</li>
            <li>I tried out the Revlon Lip Butters and I did not like those because it was more like a lipstick to me.</li>
            <li>love it way more than my revlon lip butters.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love lipbalms, lip glosses, lip sticks, lipstains, etc.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Maybelline Baby Lips--they are moisturizing and add a hint of color.  </li>
            <li>I love lip gloss for the color and shine, but I don&#x27;t like the stickiness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to get away from using so many toxin in my make-up, so I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li>But its better then a lot of lip balms I have now.</li>
            <li>I really love this product it gives me color and moisture to my lips</li>
            <li>Still love you Amazon:)</li>
            <li>Baby Lips is my favorite lip product.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite beauty gurus online recommended baby lips</li>
            <li>I love tinted lip balms.</li>
            <li>my lips have been so so much better.</li>
            <li>and it has a nice light tint.  </li>
            <li>Baby Lips is moisturizing, stylish, and it works.</li>
            <li>But make sure you do NOT lather it on.</li>
            <li>Yet another fantastic product!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>love my baby lips.</li>
            <li>but if you just want to try a lip color and don&#x27;t want to jump straight into lipstick, then this is a great compromise.</li>
            <li>I also love the color this makes my lips.</li>
            <li>These go on very moist and feel great going on.  </li>
            <li>love it product just as described.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it though; I like it.</li>
            <li>However the cute packaging and reviews sold me on this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and intend on purchasing more Baby Lips shades.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE LIPGLOSS</li>
            <li>Love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy, feels great on your lips</li>
            <li>AND I love the color it gives to your lips.</li>
            <li>I Really love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the Baby Lips in Cherry Me</li>
            <li>but this is much more opaque and immediately settles into the vertical creases in the lips, looking like pepto-bismol stripes instead of even color.</li>
            <li>Maybe this shade is ok if you&#x27;re 16</li>
            <li>I love the shade</li>
            <li>but I love the color</li>
            <li>I would say either try one - or stock up, because you are going to love it and want more.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope you love them too.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I love the Baby Lips collection.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite shade.</li>
            <li>I choose this rating because I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I heard many of my friends saying I&#x27;m so in love with this</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>My favorite color from this line.  </li>
            <li>Its nice and smooth on my lips</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok though.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and looks nice.</li>
            <li>I love the cute packaging and</li>
            <li>The packaging is fabulous too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend for sure.</li>
            <li>If I was 15, which I am not, it would be ok.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>I love the way my lips feel after using this product.  </li>
            <li>i would say its more like colored chapstick.</li>
            <li>I love love love this.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li>and i love how it feels on my lips</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m going to purchase again because of the color, and perhaps try the cherry me as well.</li>
            <li>Of course it would not work on someone who needed a more intensive, perhaps medicated lip balm.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that is smells so yummy, almost like Fruit Loops or something.  </li>
            <li>You need to try this :)</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more of this product soon! ! ! :)</li>
            <li>the color pop on my lips was complimentary (not crazy) and I loved it!  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>Not only did it moisturize amazingly well, it had a beautiful color to it.</li>
            <li>The cherry and peach colors look great all the time, and I would highly recommend them over this one.</li>
            <li>It is a bright, bold colour which is not for everyone, but fortunately works well for me.</li>
            <li>The color is kind of light but easily buildable.</li>
            <li>The color looked pretty on my fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the sheer color of all three of them and the balm itself is so smooth and the perfect consistency for me.</li>
            <li>At first I loved this.</li>
            <li>Atleast that ha a beautiful natural flush to it and is truly moisturizing too.</li>
            <li>So I guess it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>So glad I did because my lips feel so great and soft.</li>
            <li>I gave this a 3 star because the product does dry your lips &amp; it doesn&#x27;t have the best ingredients.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and cute packaging.</li>
            <li>BabyLips give a nice light tint with smooth not gooey lip protection and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The colour is more purpley in certain lighting and not even and easily comes off, but the balm is good and the packaging cute!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite lip balm!!  </li>
            <li>~ :D I&#x27;m actually happy that I got this product, and my lips feel soft and it doesn&#x27;t feel as dry anymore</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for keeping my lips moistened and it gives them a cute pink shine!</li>
            <li>This is great for my young daughter.</li>
            <li>purchased this product yesterday at my local Target for full price at $3.99, and have to say I&#x27;m quite impressed.</li>
            <li>Aside from this, while the casing is adorable, it&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The pink color is perfect for my porcelain skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like it, it has good color payoff and is moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This really does a good job moisturizing.</li>
            <li>the color won&#x27;t distribute very evenly, but otherwise it looks good.</li>
            <li>It has a light pink tint to it and is really cute, it feels really nice and works great.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect pink!</li>
            <li>AND it gives the best splash of color, especially for these hot summer months!</li>
            <li>but it crumbled so easily.</li>
            <li>It dose wear off easy though, which is why I am giving it a 4 star.</li>
            <li>The color is much more intense than I wanted it to be, but this is simply an amazing moisturizing lip balm</li>
            <li>arrived very quick though</li>
            <li>Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>A Strong Flavor, Or</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong scent, which is way to strong and did not care for the flavor</li>
            <li>great price for a lip balm, the shade of pink is very bright, good for a young girl, think bright pink bubble gum.</li>
            <li>Nice lip balm for a nice price, has a very slight flavor also that is pleasant, not candy like.</li>
            <li>Very nice sent, moisture and gives your lips a nice pink tint.</li>
            <li>The colors are true and actually more opaque than I thought they&#x27;d be.  </li>
            <li>It actually gave me beautiful lips</li>
            <li>, i really enjoyed it, i love the flavor and everything about it.mi would ask other people to buy it because it is great</li>
            <li>If your lips aren&#x27;t too chapped, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The color is super cute even on me</li>
            <li>Love the color and smooths my lips, and it&#x27;s super inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I love this, keeps the lips very soft, has a nice bit of color, use it quite often, so I keep it close.</li>
            <li>It made my lips SO soft, and keeps them soft, not to mention it smells amazing!! :)</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, smells absolutely wonderful, like pinky lemonade, makes your lips super soft.</li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t know this lip balm will make my lips very bright pink, so</li>
            <li>The color is very bright pink and lasts for a while.</li>
            <li>I always have to have something on my lips, chapstick, lipgloss, what have you, and my lips chap pretty easy, so it may work better for someone with lips that don&#x27;t chap as easy as mine.</li>
            <li>but in fact it just turned my lips bright bright pink!!!</li>
            <li>It feels so nice on my lips and the color is like a barbie pink but not too bright.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
            <li>Pink Punch is a great color, and I am totally glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Personally I love the pink tint and think it looks great.</li>
            <li>It gives a light pop of color and keeps your lips hydrated throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It rolls on smoothly, but doesn&#x27;t sink into your lips.  </li>
            <li>It does make your lips smooth too.</li>
            <li>I just ordered these to have something to reach free s/h.  </li>
            <li>It seems like a light lipstick almost.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t moisturize and it doesn&#x27;t make your lips smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels like a cheap play makeup lip balm.</li>
            <li>However, it looks like you smeared Pepto Bismol on your lips - and if your lips are at all chapped, the color doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly at all.</li>
            <li>its cheap like 2.99 at wlmart</li>
            <li>The color payoff is also a great touch, sheer like a just drank colored juice look.</li>
            <li>But it can really fit to anyone (Unlike peach kiss, grapevine, and cherry).</li>
            <li>Cheap product.</li>
            <li>It makes your lips feel so smooth</li>
            <li>It goes on your lips really smooth</li>
            <li>This makes my lips feel sooo smooth.</li>
            <li>This is such a great valve and product.</li>
            <li>The formula is cheap and the color is day-glow trashy.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing lip balm is smooth and hydrating.</li>
            <li>Makes my lips smooth.</li>
            <li>No...I can&#x27;t really make this color work on its own.  </li>
            <li>Was looking for lipgloss that had just a hint of color that was comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>I will stick with my Dr. Pepper lip gloss when I want cheap lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have light colored lips the color distribution won&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li>After i use it my lips are not just smooth but the colored ones make your lips tinted (Varies from color).</li>
            <li>It is very pigmented and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>it makes my lips like a baby&#x27;s baby smooth.</li>
            <li>Smells great, adds a tint of color, and actually works!!  </li>
            <li>It feels light</li>
            <li>it goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li>This glides on like a creamy lip balm and really does hydrate your lips while adding amazing color.  </li>
            <li>My 10 year old sister loved this as a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the absolute best balm I&#x27;ve ever tried, but I like it a lot, and especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I ended up loving the bright pink</li>
            <li>Lip balm smells good, leaves a soft moisture feel.</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy it just as much as I do!!!</li>
            <li>Very fun product.</li>
            <li>the colors are very fresh</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really not at all, even for a fair skinned person like myself!</li>
            <li>Perfect light pink and very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Amazon made it super easy.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so pretty, but most importantly it keeps my lips moist and prevents them from getting chapped.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>I love it so so much!</li>
            <li>hey, the fact that this is usually sold out in stores is a testament to how awesome it is.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this.</li>
            <li>The color for this one is more opaque so you can end up with pretty streaky lips because the product doesn&#x27;t spread evenly on your lips.  </li>
            <li>NOT satisfied with it .. thought its much better, after i read the reviews but !!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It is like a beautiful pink gloss.  </li>
            <li>:) It&#x27;s very pigmented and i like this!</li>
            <li>This smells really good and the color is perfect, I like having just a little something to keep my lips smooth yet still dry unlike lip gloss, Ew.</li>
            <li>Shipping was great and fast but this product didn&#x27;t make or keep my lips moist or soft or anything promised.</li>
            <li>It feels mildly moisturizing, like a light chapstick but with noticeable color.</li>
            <li>I own three different flavors of it and love them all.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, the packaging is a cute and fun design.</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It softens my lips pretty well, not as good as eos lip balms but much better than regular lip balms.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect to put in my pocket for quick trips out for errands or into my small purse during a night out.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth &amp; it stays on really well.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again even though it is kind of cakey, but it makes my lips so soft so in my opinion it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>To me its nothing special.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just nothing special, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>; is right!</li>
            <li>Its not very moisturizing but still a great product.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s its a great lip balm just its florescent pink</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big on using lipsticks of bright color</li>
            <li>It has a great tint of pink color.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and the tint is not over the top and is very wearable.  </li>
            <li>It has a lovely colour if you really are generous with your application</li>
            <li>Good back up lip balm!</li>
            <li>Would look good on a younger girl of about 10.</li>
            <li>like this product, it&#x27;s nice and soft</li>
            <li>Not only do I love the taste, this lip balm moisturizes and supplies a perfect shade of pink on the lips.</li>
            <li>I love the color (and taste) of this lip balm, plus it really does hydrate.</li>
            <li>overall I think this is a good prodcut that does what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li>Keeps her lips soft and moist and adds a nice touch of color to her lips.  </li>
            <li>I really do :)</li>
            <li>i love Maybelline Baby lips lip balm because I&#x27;ve proven it helps my very chapped lips</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised it held the color but more natural looking, in the good way through my day.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this lip balm - it moisturizes really well and also adds some color to your lips.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and cute.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much.  </li>
            <li>Not the most versatile color but still very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing, gives good amount of color, literally GLIDES on, package is cute, pretty pink shade, doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips, and SMELLSSS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS NEW LINE FROM MAYBELINE!</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my lips feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and looks good but the pink punch when applied again</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find it super moisterizing.</li>
            <li>The pink punch smells AMAZING, and the Peach kiss a an okay smell.</li>
            <li>baby pink kind of color :)</li>
            <li>so I was pleased when I finally recieved this in the mail :)</li>
            <li>They make my lip feels super moisturized and stay on my lips until I feel the need to wipe them off because I need to eat something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but with this product they stay soft and smooth the more i use it.</li>
            <li>These are definitely the best lip balms that you can get, because they are nothing like chapstick, and they actually stay on your lips for 4 hours without having to reapply every 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Smells like fruit punch and leaves a nice pink tint, not too over the top though</li>
            <li>I love this color in particular and have it on Amazon subscription delivery...</li>
            <li>and I recommended the seller because the product came quickly.</li>
            <li>I find myself putting it on even when I don&#x27;t need to since it smells so good and is an instant way to brighten your smile.  </li>
            <li>but it wears off so quickly.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I love that it is so smooth and silky and leaves my lips feeling soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it does make your lips softer and I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>i apply just a little enough to not make me look like a clown but besides that, i absolutely love it, taste wonderful too!</li>
            <li>Overall this product is great, super hydrating and a nice pink color against my darker skin tone.</li>
            <li>I worried this one was going to be too bright but as long as I don&#x27;t cake it on</li>
            <li>This balm is probably one of my very favorite recent finds.</li>
            <li>&quot; like how Burts Bees feels on your lips, again, not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>The flavor is wonderful but the pink shows up more than I expected.</li>
            <li>Sweet &amp; tangy, just the right amount of color</li>
            <li>shipping was quick and easy&lt;br /&gt;affordable and worth the buy</li>
            <li>I really like it, but it comes off easy.</li>
            <li>the color is really noticeable but it comes off really easy...</li>
            <li>Definitely ordering more in all shades!</li>
            <li>I red one in cherry me a lot better!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Great if your lips are too dry for a matte lipstick, because this is really a two in one: chapstick and lipstick.</li>
            <li>I love the color, and it&#x27;s super soft on your lips.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why Maybelline would produce such a cheap product, not at all impressed, just let down.  </li>
            <li>Sure, maybe after a month of use my lips will be super soft</li>
            <li>This one smells so good and is a very pretty pink.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a light shimmer, but it is a bit too much.</li>
            <li>I picked the pink because I wanted to try something bright</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s BRIGHT opaque pink.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t worried when I saw the bright pink color in the package.</li>
            <li>great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The balm goes on very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>so one swipe of this leaves my lips bright pink.</li>
            <li>It provides a light color that can get darker by how much you use.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this goes smoothly on my lips</li>
            <li>But, the color of this pink punch is wayyyyy too bright for me.  </li>
            <li>I like the bright pink color-</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, but WAY too pink lol</li>
            <li>Though it was sold out in a lot of stores, it is worth the search.</li>
            <li>I like this product- smells good, but is too &#x27;pink&#x27; for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth</li>
            <li>Baby Lips line at the store offers about 10 more varieties, colors, and colorless options.</li>
            <li>A fun moisturizing lip gloss that makes my lips bright pink while keeping them supple without ever making them sticky.</li>
            <li>but it gives of a fair amount of pink.</li>
            <li>It has a very lip balmy feeling, it&#x27;s kind of \\&quot;cakey\\</li>
            <li>I own three different Baby Lips balms, this, the cherry flavor, and the peach.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>It stays for maybe 30min-1hr but for the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good pink tint.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturising product, beautiful bright barbie doll pink colour and shows up on my dark, pigmented lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a natural person, so</li>
            <li>She went so far as to buy more for her sister, mother, my sister, and my mother.  </li>
            <li>that there are different flavors that smell nice.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my lips soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>and I love that my lips are so soft.</li>
            <li>Has a fun fruity scent and the color stays on my lips for an hour.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight fun pop of color, try this out.</li>
            <li>I just like it more when I add clear lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Goes on so smooth, feels great on my lips, adds a very small amount of color to your lips.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for myself a few months ago and loved how it made my lips feel.  </li>
            <li>I think this lip moisturizing balm is fine, but mainly for the color, not for the moisturizing part.</li>
            <li>My daughter looked like she was wearing clown makeup, it was actually quite hilarious but nonetheless a pain to clean up.</li>
            <li>Good for mixing colors with other lipsticks to change the shade a bit.</li>
            <li>While I agree that it&#x27;s not moisturizing in so far as it doesn&#x27;t do any repair or have long-lasting benefits, it does feel very nice when you put it on - so much so that you&#x27;ll forget you&#x27;re even wearing it, which as far as I&#x27;m concerned is exactly what you want from your make-up</li>
            <li>, I like lip balms with just the right amount/hint of color</li>
            <li>Baby Lips are all the rage right now in my daughter&#x27;s preteen age group.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky at all and has just the right amount of shine and color to it and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering flavor either.</li>
            <li>&gt;I&#x27;m using my father&#x27;s account to right this review haha.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I paid up in the hundreds over the years for the right remedy.</li>
            <li>JUST RIGHT</li>
            <li>I thought it was more clear (like lip &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>Maybelline Color Sensational in Make Me Pink</li>
            <li>It did not at first pass the Mommy and Daddy approval rating for appropriate makeup for our 12 year old.  </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so special about it</li>
            <li>Not only do they give a great pop of color (the Pink Punch is really pretty, a little bold and kind of reminds me of Mac&#x27;s Viva Glam Gaga lipstick, depending on how much you put on; Peach Kiss is much more subtle and looks great with a bronzed/smoky eye look), but they glide on your lips!</li>
            <li>I bought a new one along with the pink punch to replace it because I liked it so much, and this one is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my granddaughter and she was very pleased with the flavor and the pink tint.  </li>
            <li>Peach kiss has a more natural color, and its more sheer.</li>
            <li>The Peach Kiss shade looks better with my natural lip color, but both are fantastic items, as they provide soft lips</li>
            <li>Color doesn&#x27;t last as long as a stain, but I don&#x27;t mind reapplying this because it feels so good!</li>
            <li>product caters to my chapped winter lips AND my inner diva at the same time: Pink Punch shade is a light (but highly-saturated) cotton candy pink, great for very fair skin.</li>
            <li>It REALLY moisturizes right from the very first application and</li>
            <li>The Pink Punch is a light baby pink, and it smells so good, like candy!</li>
            <li>Secure Packaging, item was BRAND NEW like promised.</li>
            <li>There is a slight colour- not too bright or noticeable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a light pink and it makes my lips look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a slightly tinted moisturizing stick and thought this would be a good product.</li>
            <li>The color was as expected, though it didn&#x27;t really look good on me</li>
            <li>Everyone needs to own at least on baby lips lip balm I love this stuff</li>
            <li>It definitely feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing your lips when you put it on (and that feels nice), but I just don&#x27;t think it really is.</li>
            <li>I love the popping pink color, and it makes me lips feel all smooth.</li>
            <li>It gives a young, vibrant look, and it smells great, however the scent does not last.</li>
            <li>I took off one star because it tends to feather a little when used on its own--however this can easily be remedied with a good, clear lip liner.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t stay on for a super long time, which is ok to me since it isn&#x27;t supposed to be a lipstick.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it  and they are very much in trend in her shcool  </li>
            <li>It was very cheap $2.99 at Target, so it wasn&#x27;t a big risk to try it out.</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast</li>
            <li>I love a bright pink lipstick, but it always leaves my lips dry.</li>
            <li>I was leery at first to try this product because of the vibrant color, but after I actually tried it, I liked it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too bright , &amp; it&#x27;s something you can use as an everyday wear.</li>
            <li>it twice on your lips for a cute soft pink look, or rub it on more for a pinker</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>But otherwise I love the packaging, although I still wish they&#x27;d bring back Kissing Koolers instead!</li>
            <li>Very 1960s, disco-party-ish!</li>
            <li>This balm works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>but it is pretty though.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented!</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t NEED to be applied more than once, but it&#x27;s so addicting you will feel the need to be constantly applying it.</li>
            <li>but its a pretty color.</li>
            <li>in its regular packaging which i was ok with so overal</li>
            <li>This only happens some of the time, mostly when I reapply it throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I will be back to get a couple more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever used the Quenched (which is my favorite) and the peach kiss which I wasn&#x27;t too fond of.</li>
            <li>I do apply it pretty often.</li>
            <li>Leaves your lips soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>very moisturizing and fun.</li>
            <li>My lips loves it and the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>Has a nice pink tone to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna have to buy more of these if different colors!</li>
            <li>Very sheer color, which is okay with me.</li>
            <li>thinking they would be more on the sheer side.  </li>
            <li>With just a trace of product, it was a gentle pink that looks great on our blossoming young daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok for daily use</li>
            <li>SUCH A CUTE COLOR on my lips.</li>
            <li>This gloss is soft and light and so moisterizing.</li>
            <li>and it made my lips so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>The color was sheer and worked better with the lip balm like formula.  </li>
            <li>This goes on nice and gives a pretty pink color to my lips.  </li>
            <li>my lips are already like a hot pink/red color and this just kinda amplified it, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>Color is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>#34;it is so inviting to just touch your lips and tastes good.&amp;#34; ;)</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!  </li>
            <li>It goes on pretty well</li>
            <li>and I now rock this more than my former lip stick.</li>
            <li>Color is pretty.</li>
            <li>I just bought this stuff about a week ago in the peach flavor first</li>
            <li>give it 4/5 because it fades quickly, but these are so darn inexpensive that it really doesn&#x27;t matter that much to me.</li>
            <li>its easy to apply and really makes your lips baby soft.</li>
            <li>The pink color goes on lighter than expected which is very good as when I first saw it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and initially feels very hydrating.</li>
            <li>its not like lipstick but its pretty good for a regular day out to feel extra girly!</li>
            <li>I just love the way it feels when you first apply it, and that feeling really does last for quite a while.</li>
            <li>It smells good and leaves my lips soft and with a pretty pink tint.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great though, and I&#x27;m actually wearing it right now, but wow is it super pink.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, very pink.</li>
            <li>Maybelline has expanded the line with many more &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34; Some are clear, some with a little color, some with lots of creaminess.</li>
            <li>The product is very moisturizing, soft texture, I&#x27;m satisfied, I would prefer a much more vibrant color though, but this pink color suits me as well.</li>
            <li>can pretty much adjust what color you</li>
            <li>After application, my lips do not stay moist long, but I enjoy the tint and the flavor!  </li>
            <li>I love the light pink tint that is just the slightest bit of flattering color, but I&#x27;ve been mostly surprised that it lasts</li>
            <li>I bought this lip gloss because my lips pretty much fall apart in the winter.</li>
            <li>The color fades quickly but my lips stay smooth for a very long time.</li>
            <li>It was a lot brighter than what I thought it would be, as I thought since these are more chapsticks than lipsticks, I thought the color would be more subtle.</li>
            <li>It is a vibrant barbie pink color and it keeps your lips hydrated and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li>As it turns out, it has a LOVELY sweet pink color on the cheeks, and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Love this the color is just so pink and pretty</li>
            <li>it seems to dry my lips more than anything.</li>
            <li>The quenched one leaves my lips SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>For my skin though I tend to have more dry skin</li>
            <li>Makes my lips feel super soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Makes lips SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this, I was just expecting it to be a light sheer color.</li>
            <li>I added this to my cart because I needed one more small item to get free shipping.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and has just enough color to be pretty but not obnoxious.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased, and deciding which flavor I want to try next.</li>
            <li>The actual color of the tint seemed to have an almost purple tint to it and strongly reminded me of lipstick in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Even if you are like me and have a very pale skin tone it just looks like you have a bright lipstick on, not</li>
            <li>texture is very smooth, and there is a slight pink tint, which I would have liked to know about before I bought it.</li>
            <li>And after the first application, you will notice right away that you&#x27;re lips are softer and smoother, leaving your mouth with a soft glossy look.</li>
            <li>Pink punch is a great lip balm whenever I have dry lips</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is great, but if you want something over-the-top bold, this isn&#x27;t the product to go for.</li>
            <li>If you have very light pink lips, this is not for you (unless you like the pop of color).</li>
            <li>But overall, i enjoy this product, and its a pretty pink :)</li>
            <li>A very light tint of pink color.</li>
            <li>Fixes all your dry lip problems, and gives your lips the color and shine you always have dreamed of! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I would not recommend this particular baby lips, I would recommend all the others!</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s not an intense repairing balm, but certainly isn&#x27;t drying.</li>
            <li>This tinted lip balm is really what it is cracked up to be.  </li>
            <li>The color is overbearing and very 80s.  </li>
            <li>I reapply about every hour or so to keep the color intense, but the moisture probably lasts about two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this pink is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But I think it is not really helpful to me, and it&#x27;s not like a lip stick or a lip balm, I don&#x27;t know how to say it，only one thing I can sure</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This also helps so much during the winter because my lips get so chapped</li>
            <li>it really moist for your lips and</li>
            <li>really did not care for this one that much it was not what I thought it would be</li>
            <li>They feel really &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But on whim I bought one in Pink Punch; and I have to say I love it:</li>
            <li>I like that this is sort of like a lipstick, but really a chapstick.</li>
            <li>it melts really fast.</li>
            <li>came fast</li>
            <li>At such a low price, I will definitely be repurchasing more of these cute lip</li>
            <li>I still really like this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it lasts 8 hours since i reapplied after about 3.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this lip balm!</li>
            <li>/&gt;2 stars for moisture, packaging, price, and color.&lt;br /&gt;-3 stars because the smell makes it unwearable (and umbearable haha) in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the way her lips feel with this product and the smell is very pleasing as well.</li>
            <li>I just bought two more -  Melon Mania and Pink Wink.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>I was concerned as it has a very plastic/pink color.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>The color however, is very pigmented which I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
            <li>it really dosen&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is VERY pigmented.</li>
            <li>I really like this because it has the moisture AND the color.</li>
            <li>I really like the moisture of the lip balm.</li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li>I really like this product-</li>
            <li>BUT I WASNT REALLY LOOKING FOR THE COLOR</li>
            <li>I like the color, but i don&#x27;t find it to be very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Shipment came fast.</li>
            <li>I only bought this product so that I would get free shipping on all my orders XD</li>
            <li>I really hope Maybelline doesn&#x27;t discontinue this item any time soon.</li>
            <li>I like the smell to it and the color, but it didn&#x27;t really moisturize my lips.</li>
            <li>I really like this line of lip moisturizer, but am concerned about unneeded chemicals.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a more translucent pink.</li>
            <li>it give a cute shade of pink on the lips.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love the shade of pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more on the baby pink side.</li>
            <li>Three stars because it&#x27;s like lip stick, except really moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I love all of the pink tints they taste and feel</li>
            <li>it also smells very good.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>really pinky color and moist too.</li>
            <li>My lips are so much smoother than before.</li>
            <li>If you have very chapped lips, or cracked bleeding lips, I would suggest healing them with Carmex before using this.</li>
            <li>The color is suddle, it&#x27;s like a lipstick mixed with a light balm.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really do the trick for me.</li>
            <li>(I noticed it doesn&#x27;t have any flavor really at all, so just a heads up on that.)</li>
            <li>I will buy this product very often</li>
            <li>Not the most moisturizing and the color is way to bubblegum pink</li>
            <li>the color is lovely pink.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more pink than I thought.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable price</li>
            <li>Color is soft and subdued, appropriate for a teen girl.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a sucker for good packaging.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m sure to use it only after exfoliating, or I put clear chap stick on before I apply it.</li>
            <li>I have 3 different flavors so far and plan to get them all:)</li>
            <li>a good long while on dry lips.</li>
            <li>It just kind of shows up as a plain lip balm?</li>
            <li>My lip are so soft right now.  </li>
            <li>An very moisturizing lip balm with high-intensity color, Baby Lips is actually better than I expected (and I expect a lot from Maybelline)!</li>
            <li>I barely wear any lip color, but I like how it appears as a mild lip stick without the stickiness...</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s a good lip balm for the price, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is any different than other lip balms</li>
            <li>When she put it on, her lips were bright pink, and (like Lady Xeona said on Youtube) looked like she ate a box of hot pink crayons.</li>
            <li>I like other lip treatments better.</li>
            <li>Nice pink color not too dark or light.</li>
            <li>So far i love the consistency of it,it applies sooo smooth its unbelievable.</li>
            <li>As far as the balm itself, it isn&#x27;t strong, it gives a light sheen over my lips and moisterizes them for a little while.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a light baby pink tint to help create a nice summery look, but I was severely let down.</li>
            <li>Balm up b/c of the brightly colored tint and no apparent, revolutionary formula differentiating it from every other lip balm.</li>
            <li>however, even though I do see a slight difference in my lips, they are not perfect my any means, perfect meaning that they are smooth like baby lips with out any chapping, I know mabey</li>
            <li>smells nice, doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>feels &amp; smells nice for a little while!</li>
            <li>one was about $3-4 (I know Walmart sells them cheaper), so I didn&#x27;t really have high hopes.</li>
            <li>I will DEFINITELY be purchasing this again and most likely from the same seller (it&#x27;s almost 5 bucks at my nearest drugstore, so you save a buck or two IF you get free shipping).</li>
            <li>Turns out it also tinted my lips slightly which was unexpected but nice.</li>
            <li>would get it again, as long as it stays cheap.</li>
            <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because, honestly, the name is kind of off-putting to me - as a grown woman, the idea of carrying and using a product named &amp;#34;baby lips&amp;#34; is a bit weird.</li>
            <li>Of course, it also depends on the colour of your natural lips because this tinted lip balm is exactly that--a tint.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this lip balm at Target and it is exactly true to color.</li>
            <li>Ok so for someone like me (dark skin)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about a week, and I&#x27;ve already received so many compliments on the color that I&#x27;m tempted to try the other colors as well!</li>
            <li>I love pink lipstick, especially since it&#x27;s so in right now..</li>
            <li>Really like the light pink color.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t overuse it, you have a nice, more subtle pink.</li>
            <li>I love these because they just have a slight tint.</li>
            <li>The product does soften and smooth dry lips, but the color is a bit bubble-gummie for my taste.  </li>
            <li>This lipbalm is decent.</li>
            <li>Luckily this only cost me about a dollar.</li>
            <li>Vibrant color where it happens to stick.</li>
            <li>so she could pretend with her older sisters.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this balm, I was expecting my lips to look a more natural color of pink.</li>
            <li>so I got her it for x-mas, needless to say she&#x27;s in love, but how can you not be with a Maybelline product :)</li>
            <li>As a moisturizing lip balm, this is a decent product.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizing Lip Balm, Pink Punch, 0.15 Ounce]]I love the baby soft lip balms.</li>
            <li>it Moisturizes my lip for a decent period of time.</li>
            <li>This little gem moisturizes like a chapstick and applies a wonderful pink color that lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>When I opened it up it was bigger than expected, I put it on and it smelled pretty good except it did have a tiny bit of a makeupy smell (kind of hard to explain, but it wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything g from expensive to cheap this by far beats all of them!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It really does make your lips baby soft!</li>
            <li>Really i was expecting it to be more long lasting.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Over all I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The color is like bright neon pink but other than</li>
            <li>All the other tinted balms I&#x27;ve ever owned have always been kind of sheer</li>
            <li>I grab this when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing a lip gloss on top of my lipstick but want a little bit of a shine.</li>
            <li>but it was a little more than what you can get it for at the store.</li>
            <li>It might look better on my olive skin in the summer with a little tan.</li>
            <li>I will upload a picture, as it&#x27;s kind of hard to see the color in the amazon listing picture.</li>
            <li>It was an add on item, so it came pretty quickly along with other stuff.</li>
            <li>I get a lush, bright bubble gum pink, and moisturized lips with a single swipe!</li>
            <li>it is light pink shade of a color.</li>
            <li>the color is a bit lighted than what i expected, i like how it feels when you apply it to your lips, its not sticky and its light.</li>
            <li>The item as a whole reminds me of something sold for a nine year old, like its a dress-up toy.  </li>
            <li>However, if you work the product into your lips a lot, it turns into a very flattering shade and makes your lips incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>They really make your lips soft.  </li>
            <li>the pink comes out sheer, not as pink as the colour looks, great for everyday wash of colour,can also be used over or under some of your pinky lipsticks for more moisture.</li>
            <li>- I love how smoothly it goes on and that it&#x27;s not as sticky or annoying as some of the more &amp;#34;juicy&amp;#34; lip gloss styles.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
            <li>My lips get so chapped in the winter normally</li>
            <li>I Bought this item at my normal drug store</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d recomend getting it from your normal drug store just to be cheaper though.</li>
            <li>$4 for a lip balm that only lasts 2 weeks just isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li>If you want a good lip balm that doesn&#x27;t leave color behind, try this color:</li>
            <li>and I love it, but it does NOT last long!</li>
            <li>My new favorite for everyday makeup.  </li>
            <li>This balm glides right on and provides a sheer tint of color.  </li>
            <li>Only thing, the color didn&#x27;t look right on me.</li>
            <li>I love Maybelline&#x27;s Baby Lips line, but didn&#x27;t know you could get it at any local major retail or grocery store for a cheaper price than what you can get online here, especially when you factor in shipping costs.</li>
            <li>And after many uses, I saw the opposite of the intended effect - my lips became dry and irritated!  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, its not sticky or greasy, and it has a subtle sweet smell.</li>
            <li>It stays on very a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>I was definitely excited for the pink tint</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li>and it was a new flavor.  </li>
            <li>Maybelline New York Baby Lips</li>
            <li>you send me a new one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to \\&quot;chapstick.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I live maybelline baby lips.</li>
            <li>I order the baby lips maybelline new york</li>
            <li>B004Y9GYZS Maybelline New York Baby Lips</li>
            <li>So I ordered a bunch of these in different colors, and the baby pink punch color is my favorite.</li>
            <li>overall, i like the Pink punch better, but if you dont care about the scent</li>
            <li>and it also gaves you the the pretty color like a Barbie pink color its really pretty</li>
            <li>The color is subtle, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t fond of the pink color, i was expecting more of a clear tint of pink, but this looks more like a frosted pink on the lips, not  for my coloring.</li>
            <li>The color is noticeable but subtle and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Sheer color that gives a nice pick look without being too harsh.</li>
            <li>Love this little lip balm!</li>
            <li>Going back to school and being a single mother meant I had to budget somewhere; but honestly the quality of drugstore makeup made me want to go without rather than use their gross flavored, grainy textured, feathering lipsticks and lipglosses.</li>
            <li>This one &amp; the clear Quench are my favorites!</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and gives you minty breath too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s why I LOVE this balm, because it is a slick balm and a lipstick in one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I only notice it when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty into the Baby Lips products</li>
            <li>The baby pink is a very pretty, subtle color, and when it goes on your lips feel super smooth.</li>
            <li>Exactly the opposite, in fact.</li>
            <li>Seems to stay on for a long time, and is not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth $3.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly the same as the pictures of the models wearing the product.</li>
            <li>I am expecting to much, but that is just my opion on the product that I have been using for a few months now, however, I do like it, its smooth, and it does add a tint of color, kinda like a colored chapstick, and I will continue to use it, just don&#x27;t expect it to make your chapped lips healed completely.</li>
            <li>This lipgloss is just what I was looking for.... moisturizers with soft color!</li>
            <li>do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this item!</li>
            <li>Just enough blue in the shade to make my teeth appear more white.  </li>
            <li>The color is not too intense with one swipe, but you can make it look really vibrant by applying extra.</li>
            <li>It will not actually change the color or texture of your lips over time, other than keeping them hydrated, and, obviously, tinting them a nice bubblegum color.</li>
            <li>I also love the pink tint and how long it lasts.....</li>
            <li>It does not smooth out easily.</li>
            <li>It has a nice pink color that you can build up to for a more brighter barbie pink look if you want, or just wear a subtle layer for a bit of color.</li>
            <li>I have really chapped lips, in general, and this stuff has really improved the quality of them overall.</li>
            <li>Right price for a lip balm, doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips.</li>
            <li>I ordered the pink punch for UNPLUGGED, and it came in the mail super fast, like two days later.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really make your lips soft and the color doesn&#x27;t last long, but if you&#x27;re looking for a more grownup lip stick for a younger teen I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Since they were a little chapped to begin with, the color doesn&#x27;t go on evenly and makes the product look cheap and trashy.</li>
            <li>The pink is very vibrant, but it is also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>However, I want you to know that it&#x27;s a pretty vibrant pink.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one if you want that just right, almost natural, looking pop of pink on your lips!</li>
            <li>but i mixed with a lip gloss to difusse the colors and make it pop a little bit more</li>
            <li>and i add an extra coat just to make it a little bit more noticeable</li>
            <li>i like to cake on my lip balms and even with a thin layer, this balm left a very bright and noticeable pink on my lips.</li>
            <li>Leave lips a light pink that&#x27;s definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>The lip balm itself works wonders, especially during the fall/winter, has a light tinted pink color, to give you the \\&quot;pout\\&quot; lip look and has a tasty smell as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get the hype with these Baby Lips, they&#x27;re not very moisturizing and tend to just &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on my lips instead of absorbing fully.</li>
            <li>I am buying in a clear color</li>
            <li>Wide variety of colors available for different skin tones&lt;</li>
            <li>It did make my lips feel soft</li>
            <li>It does make your lips soft.</li>
            <li>Makes your lips so soft with a hint of color.  </li>
            <li>Like a tinted lip moisturizer without looking like lipstick on a young girl.</li>
            <li>and youre looking for a natural color</li>
            <li>But this does work well as far as lip color is concerned.</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you still want to look spunky, but professional.</li>
            <li>My lips aren&#x27;t normally super dry, they&#x27;re occasionally dry when I am really dehydrated.</li>
            <li>This color makes your face dim.</li>
            <li>I wear it even when i don&#x27;t go out because it does make lips soft.</li>
            <li>I will let my 10 year old wear it too.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky goopy film on your lips once it gets old (or has been on your lips for awhile)</li>
            <li>I like it so far</li>
            <li>and I ended up letting my 7 year old daughter have it for dress up makeup.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or sticky at all</li>
            <li>I even noticed a natural glow to them.</li>
            <li>The whole thing lasted me 2 months and still lasting til this day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very creamy and the color last for hours.</li>
            <li>Makes lips soft and supple</li>
            <li>Makes my lips kissably soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a natural color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got my order early</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite like lipstick and fades fast, but it&#x27;s definitely there.</li>
            <li>I am 37 years old and have tried lots of lip glosses.</li>
            <li>Nearly neon color</li>
            <li>It keeps them moist and is the only thing that heals my chapped lips FAST.</li>
            <li>and it makes my lips feel so soft.</li>
            <li>This product is not heavy like a lipstick.  </li>
            <li>How soft.</li>
            <li>After the balm was absorbed, my lips were still rough and the tint settled in the creases of my lips.</li>
            <li>I have bought the baby lips in a few different colors and I love them all</li>
            <li>Well this product actually has color to it, which I LOVE because I don&#x27;t like heavy lipsticks</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy more in a few different shades.</li>
            <li>After applying it a few times over, it does leave a nice pink stain on the lips, which is why it got a 2 stars and not 1.</li>
            <li>Easy to store and carry around for times when I want a little color!</li>
            <li>And I also bought the peach color which is even more subtle than the pink, but also very pretty.</li>
            <li>The color is literally like the little kid lip stick you were excited to wear when you were like 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color was way too pink and bright and made me look ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of this particular color though.</li>
            <li>so the streaky pink baby lips on its own is not cute.  </li>
            <li>There was only one problem with this particular shade.</li>
            <li>I have been using it with a clear gloss to calm down the color, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>This product ranks between moderate and high hazard.</li>
            <li>It felt like a high end lip gloss combo lip balm with a sheer tint of color.</li>
            <li>It looks like pale frosy pink lipstick that can look super out of place without other makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peach is my favorite flavor.</li>
            <li>An unexpected outcome to this product is it actually stains my lips a little bit, a light tint</li>
            <li>I have normal colored lips; slightly more pink than usual.</li>
            <li>The pink is pretty</li>
            <li>This is a pretty pink color</li>
            <li>I knew the color would be a hot pink, which doesn&#x27;t work well with my skintone, but I was hoping I could make this color work.  </li>
            <li>The pink is so pink that I have to admit that I don&#x27;t use this gloss every day, but I love it just the same.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t read well and as soon as I applied this on, I had hot pink lips.</li>
            <li>It has just a little bit of color and light enough</li>
            <li>I really like, is really creamy and have a little bit of color</li>
            <li>it does make your lips a little more pink soo...</li>
            <li>It left it soft at first for a bit, but afterwards my lips turned dry</li>
            <li>and like it claims my lips feel baby soft, no loose skin or chapped for them, and even odder they look FULLER&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the only lip product that I have actually used the whole tube/container.</li>
            <li>I really like this product range and have it in several different colors</li>
            <li>It was a painful experience and besides, every woman wants gorgeous and sexy-soft lips.</li>
            <li>Baby Lips are perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want something too thick or too thin!</li>
            <li>It definitely keeps your lips very soft.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted the limited edition colors.</li>
            <li>However, when I applied it for the first time, my lips were literally neon pink!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s got a major scent to it that reminds me of sugary lipgloss.</li>
            <li>Pink Punch will give your lips a sheer pink tint, just enough to be cute.</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for a product that can go from very vibrant pink to (after lots of blotting)</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty, but this lip balm is not very moisturizing in the long run.</li>
            <li>The only think I mainly don&#x27;t like is the lasting of it.</li>
            <li>I love all of the baby lips, but the purple one is just a little dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I really like these, and I have bought a few different &amp;#34;shades&amp;#34; and I use them all the time, and will continue to use them, however, the promise of smooth soft &amp;#34;baby lips&amp;#34; is not true.</li>
            <li>I would rate this as a little better than average</li>
            <li>I thought this might be a little too &amp;#34;barbie-esque&amp;#34; and pink, but if you just put one coat on it, it&#x27;s just a nice pink.</li>
            <li>--just one swipe on your lips and you&#x27;ll barely get any colour payoff.</li>
            <li>No regrets about my purchase.</li>
            <li>at the same time it gives your lips naturally color.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes lips soft.</li>
            <li>Especially being 24 years old.</li>
            <li>Pros: Soft and moisturizing, somewhat sheer color, portable size.</li>
            <li>So inexpensive for such a soft &amp; tasty product.</li>
            <li>It gives a very baby pink on the lips.</li>
            <li>A couple of swipes on the lips is enough for me to look natural.</li>
            <li>Trust me, if it wasn&#x27;t worth it, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time writing about it.</li>
            <li>so a color this light and a not so thick formula</li>
            <li>This is just as nice as chapstick, and it gives your lips a very soft subtle pink-ish tint, not in-your-face pink, just a shiny almost healthy-looking pink tint.</li>
            <li>is kinda fake if you put too much but just put a liitle bit is fine</li>
            <li>With the Maybelline New York Baby Lips, my lips are soft &amp; baby pink!</li>
            <li>It arrived a few days early and is surprisingly a really decent balm!</li>
            <li>I will likely try the clear variety next time!</li>
            <li>A little of this lip balm really goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product as an on-the-go lip balm.</li>
            <li>The balm itself in my opinion is too large, not like your typical chap stick.  </li>
            <li>The only thing with this one does leave you lips very pink if yolu put too much.</li>
            <li>Smooth, very pink, and a little sheer.</li>
            <li>Baby lips is cool because its, small, it&#x27;s a lip balm, and it has fragrance and color!</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast, less then a week</li>
            <li>The Pink Punch color is a nice, subtle, girly pink.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is incredibly, shockingly pink when you first put it on, and not very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>I do think it was worth waiting for, but I could have also bought Nivea moisture rescue which offers the same if not superior moisture.</li>
            <li>Not long after application my lips felt drier than prior to application.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the color (or soft feeling) doesn&#x27;t last too long, so you need to reapply often.</li>
            <li>I have a pale lip color, so it comes out super pink sometimes, sort of making me look like I&#x27;m going to an 80&#x27;s party.</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t too much for a little one to play with.</li>
            <li>My little cousin even uses it and she is one who really like anything that makes her look girly</li>
            <li>and I got that like Niki Minaj pale pink color on my lips while feeling super moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li>Even a little bit leaves behind a bright pink color, so unless you want to look like a stripper, try not to put it on too often.</li>
            <li>Maybe in the summer it won&#x27;t look as bad, but I still don&#x27;t think I can even wear it in the summer its so bright.</li>

            <li> Most moisurizer don&#x27;t have the greatest smell but this moisrizer lip balm dosen&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I am glad my curiosity got the best of me this time.</li>
            <li> It smooths your lips and has a nice color to it! . . . .</li>
            <li> The best thing about it is that it comes in so many colors.</li>

            <li> What a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> The all smell and taste great and the colors all look much better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bright as it looks</li>
            <li> and it does nothing good for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good if you want to wear it under lipstick.</li>
            <li> feels good on your lips and it smells good....</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not as good as Revlon Colorburst lip butter, or L&#x27;oreal Color Riche</li>
            <li> Good buy</li>
            <li> , it glides on and it tastes &amp; smells good.</li>
            <li> and I have a fair complexion.</li>
            <li> Very,very good product though</li>
            <li> but once I got it, I loved it.</li>
            <li> and it smells good</li>
            <li> Leaves lips smooth and has a wonderful flavor.</li>
            <li> The color is nice and moisturizes great.</li>
            <li> This balm is moisturizing, smells good and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Loved it</li>
            <li> this is good for you.</li>
            <li> this was an good purchase.</li>
            <li> I heard good reveiws on it from friends and in some of the beaty blogs and magazines I read.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sticky, it provides immediate moisture and it lasts a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li> It would be best on light and medium-skinned people.</li>
            <li> This balm is really nice and has a great tinted color to it.&lt;br /&gt;I carry around in my pocket and reapply when needed.</li>
            <li> Smooth texture and great flavor/scent!</li>
            <li> Niece loved it. . . . .</li>
            <li> so I bought the cherry Baby lips instead and loved it.</li>
            <li> The product I like, has good quality and the price convinced me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This baby lips doesn&#x27;t look good on anyone in my family.</li>
            <li> the scents they have smell good too.</li>
            <li> I loved this lip balm.</li>
            <li> so this a good replacement</li>
            <li> its a good lip balm.  </li>
            <li> Also a good price.</li>

            <li> i feel like it&#x27;s faded.this one i love because it has tint and smells good like mango!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite one, because the color is great, and it smells SOOO good.</li>
            <li> I have always been super picky about chap sticks, but this is so perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Great shine and application is very smooth.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing balm, I just wanted more color for my lips.</li>
            <li> Amazon needs to rethink the price or they&#x27;re not going to be selling very many of these.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a very cute nude color.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped quickly, I love the color.</li>
            <li> VERY GLAD WITH THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> so, people who have a darker skin tone it might either be way too bright or just a nice pinky color.</li>
            <li> And the pictures on the case look very cute.</li>
            <li> not that great, just okay</li>
            <li> The product itself is very cute also, which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, looks good on my tan latina complexion, however I have to reapply but not too often</li>
            <li> It gives it just the right amount of shine and it makes my lips look plump and beautiful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice, have a fruited smell, the packaging was nice, I may look to invest in more.</li>
            <li> I have always been in love with Baby Lips products and this one is amazing!</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s even better!</li>
            <li> It my favorite!</li>

            <li> I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful color and not too much!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I was expecting something refreshing and it was not at all!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it and recommend it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> the color shows up really nice and it has a nice good slightly strong scent I love it!!</li>
            <li> Amazing</li>
            <li> Leaves your lips feeling so smooth, great smell and has just a hint of color.</li>
            <li> I also really love the bright tropical scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Baby lips is amazing.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> But this thing smells amazing, it is the most pigmented out of the baby lips I own (Yummy Plummy, Coral Crush, Cherry Me), and it&#x27;s good to layer with if you want to amp up your lips and give your lipstick a neon undertone.</li>
            <li> the color is amazing</li>
            <li> Just like any good lip balm you should apply it more than once a day because it would be like saying &amp;</li>
            <li> and I must say it has A nice color to it.</li>
            <li> But now that I got this chap stick that has a nice smell to it...</li>
            <li> This is a nice lip gloss, but you have to keep re-applying over and over.</li>
            <li> And all the different colors are great and look wonderful on!</li>
            <li> The people who always liked the flavored lip balms.</li>
            <li> Is a nice lip tint, but isn&#x27;t a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this is nice mix of both when you are on the go.</li>
            <li> It smells so good :)</li>
            <li> I liked that it looked like lipstick</li>
            <li> But I liked the scent.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but not as hydrating as I would expect.</li>
            <li> unpleasant)it smelled kind of like a fruit punch/strawberry smell, so</li>
            <li> It did have a kind of taste to it</li>
            <li> how &#x27;hazardous&#x27; a product is, meaning how toxic the ingredients are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice light color and smells great.</li>
            <li> Nice lip balm.</li>
            <li> Nice product, came on time.</li>
            <li> This is so nice.</li>
            <li> It is not the best moisturizer, so don&#x27;t count on it so much for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am kind of OCD when it comes to applying chapstick/lip balm throughout the day</li>
            <li> one has a nice, *</li>
            <li> and I liked the taste</li>
            <li> Feels really nice on my lips, keeps them from getting chapped.</li>
            <li> Honestly, these remind me of the &amp;#34;tinker bell&amp;#34; glosses you used to get when you were a preteen years ago..</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve found that after it wears off (which does take a while) it leaves your lips just a tad tinted, so even if you can&#x27;t reapply immediately you still have some color on your lips, which is nice.</li>
            <li> this is a nice thing to always have in your purse.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 because I&#x27;m kind of iffy on whether I like it or not.</li>
            <li> Nice color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, amazing, unbelievable, perfect, cute, nice, stylish, yummy, delicious-smelling,useful, priceless, acceptable, peacemaking, lovable.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, great price, recognizable brand.</li>
            <li> This is a really super Maybelline product that makes your lips feel great, without being gloppy -- the kind of glop that makes strands of your hair stick to it.</li>
            <li> than that It is a great light product I love the color</li>
            <li> Their ColorSensational HighShine lipstick is also a good choice for moisturizing, but Baby Lips is great since it includes spf 15, and the moisture really lasts.</li>
            <li> I like it, it feels good on my lips and really is cute :)</li>
            <li> Maybelline quality, fair price, and more appealing than lip gloss and lipstick for her age.</li>
            <li> I got a couple of the colorless options and I love those even more!</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s pretty good, that&#x27;s why!</li>
            <li> Love this product! :)</li>
            <li> i was suprised how cute this color was on me, i love it!</li>
            <li> Its bright and not too light, no shimmer, and a fruit punch kinda smell.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and smells soooo good.</li>
            <li> It is the best lip moisturizing balm so far that&#x27;s out their.</li>
            <li> my 8 year old daughter likes to wear it too and its the perfect tint to not look like lipstick</li>
            <li> It is amazing :)</li>
            <li> It is a really good lip balm with a fruit scent and light taste.</li>
            <li> Love it&#x27;s nice color as lipstick</li>
            <li> It is way too light and too bright</li>
            <li> I use it on top of my lipstick and it gives it a nice glossy look.</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely delicious and my lips are considerably softer.  </li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and very girly!</li>
            <li> it seems to be a good fit for the summer</li>
            <li> Very moist, not too greasy and leaves the ideal tint</li>
            <li> The lip balms are smooth, go on easy, and give great color.</li>
            <li> Great product and just what I needed at the right price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried another more cherry colored Baby Lips and liked that one a lot better.  </li>
            <li> I love Baby Lips more than most because it is tinted, and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> but this is very light.</li>
            <li> :P Very, very bright bubblegum pink.</li>
            <li> Even if you have darker lips, (I have very light colored lips)</li>
            <li> I love this color because you can wear it lightly every day, or you can cake it on for nice events, and it always looks nice :)</li>
            <li> People who complain about this probably have a very VERY light shade of lips.</li>
            <li> and it goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> I heard many good things about it, but I was less than impressed.</li>
            <li> it was very inexpensive and very cute!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> There are way better lip tints out there</li>
            <li> This is more like lipstick than chap stick since it colors your lips.</li>
            <li> I thought this was more like a fancy brand of Chapstick, but its actually more than that</li>
            <li> since the day she got it and tried it on, she fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li> In love with the color and the silky smooth application!</li>
            <li> Love IT!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love Baby Lips, each time I&#x27;m in the store I have to buy one, even if I already have the shade.</li>
            <li> my two favorite brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do have to apply it more than once a day, but that is because it is a tinted lip balm NOT a colored lipstick.</li>
            <li> (doesn&#x27;t bother me, but some people don&#x27;t like to do anything more than once a day)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Bath &amp; Body Works has better ones.</li>
            <li> Even Carmex or Chapstick work better than this.</li>
            <li> Nivea is better.</li>
            <li> I do wish it would be more of a chap stick than what it is though.</li>
            <li> I love baby lips and the price on amazon it 2 to 3 dollars cheaper than at a CVS or Wallgreens &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It is really nice and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and with a hint of color that is nice for my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> love it including the color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome for people who are very low maintenence, too.</li>
            <li> love the color and smell of it.</li>
            <li> I wonder if they were expecting something more.</li>
            <li> I have seen many people recommend this product on YouTube, so I want to try it.</li>
            <li> I love mine</li>
            <li> Baby lips is awesome and you should definitely get it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend:)</li>
            <li> I love just about anything made by Maybelline, so I was overly ecstatic to find this product cheaper here then in the stores.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more of a shiny-glossy lip than color.</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> just apply more if you want a darker color.</li>
            <li> Im Better off getting a Chapstick.</li>
            <li> but it still goes on smooth!</li>
            <li> I love Baby Lips.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great lip balm!</li>
            <li> Many lip products say they do, but don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love amazon.  </li>
            <li> Love Maybelline.</li>
            <li> I love this product, its my go to lip balm.</li>
            <li> I knew that they would love it</li>
            <li> These are ok, that&#x27;s all just ok.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the egg shaped lip balm.</li>
            <li> I love lip gloss and lipstick</li>
            <li> the feel of the gloss is ok</li>
            <li> when I apply it to my lips for some reason, but rubbing my lips together evens out the color and feels better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> guess I though they were more for teenagers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna be ordering some more Baby Lips.</li>
            <li> love love love.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute product to buy.</li>
            <li> so I love lip glosses.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not offer 8 hours of moisture, more like 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> The more I have to use it, the quicker</li>
            <li> I go through the product, the more product I buy.</li>
            <li> I love baby lips.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it love</li>
            <li> The color is really cute</li>
            <li> much better products out there.</li>
            <li> sure which ones we wanted, so she got,</li>
            <li> This has got to be the most misleading name for a product ever.  </li>
            <li> I was immediately drawn to them because of their bright and fun colors.</li>
            <li> They reminded me of my childhood love for Lisa Frank products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> Thank you, Maybelline, for making such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love this tinted chapstick.</li>
            <li> I tried out the Revlon Lip Butters and I did not like those because it was more like a lipstick to me.</li>
            <li> love it way more than my revlon lip butters.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love lipbalms, lip glosses, lip sticks, lipstains, etc.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Maybelline Baby Lips--they are moisturizing and add a hint of color.  </li>
            <li> I love lip gloss for the color and shine, but I don&#x27;t like the stickiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to get away from using so many toxin in my make-up, so I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> But its better then a lot of lip balms I have now.</li>
            <li> I really love this product it gives me color and moisture to my lips</li>
            <li> Still love you Amazon:)</li>
            <li> Baby Lips is my favorite lip product.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite beauty gurus online recommended baby lips</li>
            <li> I love tinted lip balms.</li>
            <li> my lips have been so so much better.</li>
            <li> and it has a nice light tint.  </li>
            <li> Baby Lips is moisturizing, stylish, and it works.</li>
            <li> But make sure you do NOT lather it on.</li>
            <li> Yet another fantastic product!</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> love my baby lips.</li>
            <li> but if you just want to try a lip color and don&#x27;t want to jump straight into lipstick, then this is a great compromise.</li>
            <li> I also love the color this makes my lips.</li>
            <li> These go on very moist and feel great going on.  </li>
            <li> love it product just as described.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it though; I like it.</li>
            <li> However the cute packaging and reviews sold me on this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and intend on purchasing more Baby Lips shades.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE LIPGLOSS</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy, feels great on your lips</li>
            <li> AND I love the color it gives to your lips.</li>
            <li> I Really love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Baby Lips in Cherry Me</li>
            <li> but this is much more opaque and immediately settles into the vertical creases in the lips, looking like pepto-bismol stripes instead of even color.</li>
            <li> Maybe this shade is ok if you&#x27;re 16</li>
            <li> I love the shade</li>
            <li> but I love the color</li>
            <li> I would say either try one - or stock up, because you are going to love it and want more.</li>
            <li> I sincerely hope you love them too.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I love the Baby Lips collection.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite shade.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I heard many of my friends saying I&#x27;m so in love with this</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> My favorite color from this line.  </li>
            <li> Its nice and smooth on my lips</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok though.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and looks nice.</li>
            <li> I love the cute packaging and</li>
            <li> The packaging is fabulous too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> If I was 15, which I am not, it would be ok.</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> I love the way my lips feel after using this product.  </li>
            <li> i would say its more like colored chapstick.</li>
            <li> I love love love this.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li> and i love how it feels on my lips</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m going to purchase again because of the color, and perhaps try the cherry me as well.</li>
            <li> Of course it would not work on someone who needed a more intensive, perhaps medicated lip balm.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that is smells so yummy, almost like Fruit Loops or something.  </li>
            <li> You need to try this :)</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more of this product soon! ! ! :)</li>
            <li> the color pop on my lips was complimentary (not crazy) and I loved it!  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> Not only did it moisturize amazingly well, it had a beautiful color to it.</li>
            <li> The cherry and peach colors look great all the time, and I would highly recommend them over this one.</li>
            <li> It is a bright, bold colour which is not for everyone, but fortunately works well for me.</li>
            <li> The color is kind of light but easily buildable.</li>
            <li> The color looked pretty on my fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the sheer color of all three of them and the balm itself is so smooth and the perfect consistency for me.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this.</li>
            <li> Atleast that ha a beautiful natural flush to it and is truly moisturizing too.</li>
            <li> So I guess it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> So glad I did because my lips feel so great and soft.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 3 star because the product does dry your lips &amp; it doesn&#x27;t have the best ingredients.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and cute packaging.</li>
            <li> BabyLips give a nice light tint with smooth not gooey lip protection and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The colour is more purpley in certain lighting and not even and easily comes off, but the balm is good and the packaging cute!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite lip balm!!  </li>
            <li> ~ :D I&#x27;m actually happy that I got this product, and my lips feel soft and it doesn&#x27;t feel as dry anymore</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for keeping my lips moistened and it gives them a cute pink shine!</li>
            <li> This is great for my young daughter.</li>
            <li> purchased this product yesterday at my local Target for full price at $3.99, and have to say I&#x27;m quite impressed.</li>
            <li> Aside from this, while the casing is adorable, it&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The pink color is perfect for my porcelain skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like it, it has good color payoff and is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This really does a good job moisturizing.</li>
            <li> the color won&#x27;t distribute very evenly, but otherwise it looks good.</li>
            <li> It has a light pink tint to it and is really cute, it feels really nice and works great.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect pink!</li>
            <li> AND it gives the best splash of color, especially for these hot summer months!</li>
            <li> but it crumbled so easily.</li>
            <li> It dose wear off easy though, which is why I am giving it a 4 star.</li>
            <li> The color is much more intense than I wanted it to be, but this is simply an amazing moisturizing lip balm</li>
            <li> arrived very quick though</li>
            <li> Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> A Strong Flavor, Or</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong scent, which is way to strong and did not care for the flavor</li>
            <li> great price for a lip balm, the shade of pink is very bright, good for a young girl, think bright pink bubble gum.</li>
            <li> Nice lip balm for a nice price, has a very slight flavor also that is pleasant, not candy like.</li>
            <li> Very nice sent, moisture and gives your lips a nice pink tint.</li>
            <li> The colors are true and actually more opaque than I thought they&#x27;d be.  </li>
            <li> It actually gave me beautiful lips</li>
            <li> , i really enjoyed it, i love the flavor and everything about it.mi would ask other people to buy it because it is great</li>
            <li> If your lips aren&#x27;t too chapped, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The color is super cute even on me</li>
            <li> Love the color and smooths my lips, and it&#x27;s super inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I love this, keeps the lips very soft, has a nice bit of color, use it quite often, so I keep it close.</li>
            <li> It made my lips SO soft, and keeps them soft, not to mention it smells amazing!! :)</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, smells absolutely wonderful, like pinky lemonade, makes your lips super soft.</li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t know this lip balm will make my lips very bright pink, so</li>
            <li> The color is very bright pink and lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> I always have to have something on my lips, chapstick, lipgloss, what have you, and my lips chap pretty easy, so it may work better for someone with lips that don&#x27;t chap as easy as mine.</li>
            <li> but in fact it just turned my lips bright bright pink!!!</li>
            <li> It feels so nice on my lips and the color is like a barbie pink but not too bright.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
            <li> Pink Punch is a great color, and I am totally glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Personally I love the pink tint and think it looks great.</li>
            <li> It gives a light pop of color and keeps your lips hydrated throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It rolls on smoothly, but doesn&#x27;t sink into your lips.  </li>
            <li> It does make your lips smooth too.</li>
            <li> I just ordered these to have something to reach free s/h.  </li>
            <li> It seems like a light lipstick almost.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize and it doesn&#x27;t make your lips smooth.</li>
            <li> It feels like a cheap play makeup lip balm.</li>
            <li> However, it looks like you smeared Pepto Bismol on your lips - and if your lips are at all chapped, the color doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly at all.</li>
            <li> its cheap like 2.99 at wlmart</li>
            <li> The color payoff is also a great touch, sheer like a just drank colored juice look.</li>
            <li> But it can really fit to anyone (Unlike peach kiss, grapevine, and cherry).</li>
            <li> Cheap product.</li>
            <li> It makes your lips feel so smooth</li>
            <li> It goes on your lips really smooth</li>
            <li> This makes my lips feel sooo smooth.</li>
            <li> This is such a great valve and product.</li>
            <li> The formula is cheap and the color is day-glow trashy.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing lip balm is smooth and hydrating.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips smooth.</li>
            <li> No...I can&#x27;t really make this color work on its own.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for lipgloss that had just a hint of color that was comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I will stick with my Dr. Pepper lip gloss when I want cheap lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have light colored lips the color distribution won&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> After i use it my lips are not just smooth but the colored ones make your lips tinted (Varies from color).</li>
            <li> It is very pigmented and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> it makes my lips like a baby&#x27;s baby smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells great, adds a tint of color, and actually works!!  </li>
            <li> It feels light</li>
            <li> it goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> This glides on like a creamy lip balm and really does hydrate your lips while adding amazing color.  </li>
            <li> My 10 year old sister loved this as a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the absolute best balm I&#x27;ve ever tried, but I like it a lot, and especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I ended up loving the bright pink</li>
            <li> Lip balm smells good, leaves a soft moisture feel.</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy it just as much as I do!!!</li>
            <li> Very fun product.</li>
            <li> the colors are very fresh</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not at all, even for a fair skinned person like myself!</li>
            <li> Perfect light pink and very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Amazon made it super easy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so pretty, but most importantly it keeps my lips moist and prevents them from getting chapped.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> I love it so so much!</li>
            <li> hey, the fact that this is usually sold out in stores is a testament to how awesome it is.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this.</li>
            <li> The color for this one is more opaque so you can end up with pretty streaky lips because the product doesn&#x27;t spread evenly on your lips.  </li>
            <li> NOT satisfied with it .. thought its much better, after i read the reviews but !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is like a beautiful pink gloss.  </li>
            <li> :) It&#x27;s very pigmented and i like this!</li>
            <li> This smells really good and the color is perfect, I like having just a little something to keep my lips smooth yet still dry unlike lip gloss, Ew.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great and fast but this product didn&#x27;t make or keep my lips moist or soft or anything promised.</li>
            <li> It feels mildly moisturizing, like a light chapstick but with noticeable color.</li>
            <li> I own three different flavors of it and love them all.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, the packaging is a cute and fun design.</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It softens my lips pretty well, not as good as eos lip balms but much better than regular lip balms.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect to put in my pocket for quick trips out for errands or into my small purse during a night out.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth &amp; it stays on really well.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again even though it is kind of cakey, but it makes my lips so soft so in my opinion it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> To me its nothing special.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just nothing special, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> ; is right!</li>
            <li> Its not very moisturizing but still a great product.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s its a great lip balm just its florescent pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on using lipsticks of bright color</li>
            <li> It has a great tint of pink color.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and the tint is not over the top and is very wearable.  </li>
            <li> It has a lovely colour if you really are generous with your application</li>
            <li> Good back up lip balm!</li>
            <li> Would look good on a younger girl of about 10.</li>
            <li> like this product, it&#x27;s nice and soft</li>
            <li> Not only do I love the taste, this lip balm moisturizes and supplies a perfect shade of pink on the lips.</li>
            <li> I love the color (and taste) of this lip balm, plus it really does hydrate.</li>
            <li> overall I think this is a good prodcut that does what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Keeps her lips soft and moist and adds a nice touch of color to her lips.  </li>
            <li> I really do :)</li>
            <li> i love Maybelline Baby lips lip balm because I&#x27;ve proven it helps my very chapped lips</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised it held the color but more natural looking, in the good way through my day.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this lip balm - it moisturizes really well and also adds some color to your lips.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and cute.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much.  </li>
            <li> Not the most versatile color but still very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, gives good amount of color, literally GLIDES on, package is cute, pretty pink shade, doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips, and SMELLSSS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS NEW LINE FROM MAYBELINE!</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my lips feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and looks good but the pink punch when applied again</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find it super moisterizing.</li>
            <li> The pink punch smells AMAZING, and the Peach kiss a an okay smell.</li>
            <li> baby pink kind of color :)</li>
            <li> so I was pleased when I finally recieved this in the mail :)</li>
            <li> They make my lip feels super moisturized and stay on my lips until I feel the need to wipe them off because I need to eat something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but with this product they stay soft and smooth the more i use it.</li>
            <li> These are definitely the best lip balms that you can get, because they are nothing like chapstick, and they actually stay on your lips for 4 hours without having to reapply every 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Smells like fruit punch and leaves a nice pink tint, not too over the top though</li>
            <li> I love this color in particular and have it on Amazon subscription delivery...</li>
            <li> and I recommended the seller because the product came quickly.</li>
            <li> I find myself putting it on even when I don&#x27;t need to since it smells so good and is an instant way to brighten your smile.  </li>
            <li> but it wears off so quickly.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I love that it is so smooth and silky and leaves my lips feeling soft and moist.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it does make your lips softer and I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> i apply just a little enough to not make me look like a clown but besides that, i absolutely love it, taste wonderful too!</li>
            <li> Overall this product is great, super hydrating and a nice pink color against my darker skin tone.</li>
            <li> I worried this one was going to be too bright but as long as I don&#x27;t cake it on</li>
            <li> This balm is probably one of my very favorite recent finds.</li>
            <li> &quot; like how Burts Bees feels on your lips, again, not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The flavor is wonderful but the pink shows up more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Sweet &amp; tangy, just the right amount of color</li>
            <li> shipping was quick and easy&lt;br /&gt;affordable and worth the buy</li>
            <li> I really like it, but it comes off easy.</li>
            <li> the color is really noticeable but it comes off really easy...</li>
            <li> Definitely ordering more in all shades!</li>
            <li> I red one in cherry me a lot better!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Great if your lips are too dry for a matte lipstick, because this is really a two in one: chapstick and lipstick.</li>
            <li> I love the color, and it&#x27;s super soft on your lips.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why Maybelline would produce such a cheap product, not at all impressed, just let down.  </li>
            <li> Sure, maybe after a month of use my lips will be super soft</li>
            <li> This one smells so good and is a very pretty pink.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light shimmer, but it is a bit too much.</li>
            <li> I picked the pink because I wanted to try something bright</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s BRIGHT opaque pink.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t worried when I saw the bright pink color in the package.</li>
            <li> great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The balm goes on very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> so one swipe of this leaves my lips bright pink.</li>
            <li> It provides a light color that can get darker by how much you use.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this goes smoothly on my lips</li>
            <li> But, the color of this pink punch is wayyyyy too bright for me.  </li>
            <li> I like the bright pink color-</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, but WAY too pink lol</li>
            <li> Though it was sold out in a lot of stores, it is worth the search.</li>
            <li> I like this product- smells good, but is too &#x27;pink&#x27; for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really worth</li>
            <li> Baby Lips line at the store offers about 10 more varieties, colors, and colorless options.</li>
            <li> A fun moisturizing lip gloss that makes my lips bright pink while keeping them supple without ever making them sticky.</li>
            <li> but it gives of a fair amount of pink.</li>
            <li> It has a very lip balmy feeling, it&#x27;s kind of \\&quot;cakey\\</li>
            <li> I own three different Baby Lips balms, this, the cherry flavor, and the peach.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> It stays for maybe 30min-1hr but for the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good pink tint.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturising product, beautiful bright barbie doll pink colour and shows up on my dark, pigmented lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a natural person, so</li>
            <li> She went so far as to buy more for her sister, mother, my sister, and my mother.  </li>
            <li> that there are different flavors that smell nice.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my lips soft and moist.  </li>
            <li> and I love that my lips are so soft.</li>
            <li> Has a fun fruity scent and the color stays on my lips for an hour.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight fun pop of color, try this out.</li>
            <li> I just like it more when I add clear lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Goes on so smooth, feels great on my lips, adds a very small amount of color to your lips.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for myself a few months ago and loved how it made my lips feel.  </li>
            <li> I think this lip moisturizing balm is fine, but mainly for the color, not for the moisturizing part.</li>
            <li> My daughter looked like she was wearing clown makeup, it was actually quite hilarious but nonetheless a pain to clean up.</li>
            <li> Good for mixing colors with other lipsticks to change the shade a bit.</li>
            <li> While I agree that it&#x27;s not moisturizing in so far as it doesn&#x27;t do any repair or have long-lasting benefits, it does feel very nice when you put it on - so much so that you&#x27;ll forget you&#x27;re even wearing it, which as far as I&#x27;m concerned is exactly what you want from your make-up</li>
            <li> , I like lip balms with just the right amount/hint of color</li>
            <li> Baby Lips are all the rage right now in my daughter&#x27;s preteen age group.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky at all and has just the right amount of shine and color to it and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering flavor either.</li>
            <li> &gt;I&#x27;m using my father&#x27;s account to right this review haha.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I paid up in the hundreds over the years for the right remedy.</li>
            <li> JUST RIGHT</li>
            <li> I thought it was more clear (like lip &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> Maybelline Color Sensational in Make Me Pink</li>
            <li> It did not at first pass the Mommy and Daddy approval rating for appropriate makeup for our 12 year old.  </li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so special about it</li>
            <li> Not only do they give a great pop of color (the Pink Punch is really pretty, a little bold and kind of reminds me of Mac&#x27;s Viva Glam Gaga lipstick, depending on how much you put on; Peach Kiss is much more subtle and looks great with a bronzed/smoky eye look), but they glide on your lips!</li>
            <li> I bought a new one along with the pink punch to replace it because I liked it so much, and this one is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter and she was very pleased with the flavor and the pink tint.  </li>
            <li> Peach kiss has a more natural color, and its more sheer.</li>
            <li> The Peach Kiss shade looks better with my natural lip color, but both are fantastic items, as they provide soft lips</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t last as long as a stain, but I don&#x27;t mind reapplying this because it feels so good!</li>
            <li> product caters to my chapped winter lips AND my inner diva at the same time: Pink Punch shade is a light (but highly-saturated) cotton candy pink, great for very fair skin.</li>
            <li> It REALLY moisturizes right from the very first application and</li>
            <li> The Pink Punch is a light baby pink, and it smells so good, like candy!</li>
            <li> Secure Packaging, item was BRAND NEW like promised.</li>
            <li> There is a slight colour- not too bright or noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a light pink and it makes my lips look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a slightly tinted moisturizing stick and thought this would be a good product.</li>
            <li> The color was as expected, though it didn&#x27;t really look good on me</li>
            <li> Everyone needs to own at least on baby lips lip balm I love this stuff</li>
            <li> It definitely feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing your lips when you put it on (and that feels nice), but I just don&#x27;t think it really is.</li>
            <li> I love the popping pink color, and it makes me lips feel all smooth.</li>
            <li> It gives a young, vibrant look, and it smells great, however the scent does not last.</li>
            <li> I took off one star because it tends to feather a little when used on its own--however this can easily be remedied with a good, clear lip liner.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t stay on for a super long time, which is ok to me since it isn&#x27;t supposed to be a lipstick.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it  and they are very much in trend in her shcool  </li>
            <li> It was very cheap $2.99 at Target, so it wasn&#x27;t a big risk to try it out.</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast</li>
            <li> I love a bright pink lipstick, but it always leaves my lips dry.</li>
            <li> I was leery at first to try this product because of the vibrant color, but after I actually tried it, I liked it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bright , &amp; it&#x27;s something you can use as an everyday wear.</li>
            <li> it twice on your lips for a cute soft pink look, or rub it on more for a pinker</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> But otherwise I love the packaging, although I still wish they&#x27;d bring back Kissing Koolers instead!</li>
            <li> Very 1960s, disco-party-ish!</li>
            <li> This balm works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> but it is pretty though.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented!</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t NEED to be applied more than once, but it&#x27;s so addicting you will feel the need to be constantly applying it.</li>
            <li> but its a pretty color.</li>
            <li> in its regular packaging which i was ok with so overal</li>
            <li> This only happens some of the time, mostly when I reapply it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I will be back to get a couple more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used the Quenched (which is my favorite) and the peach kiss which I wasn&#x27;t too fond of.</li>
            <li> I do apply it pretty often.</li>
            <li> Leaves your lips soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing and fun.</li>
            <li> My lips loves it and the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> Has a nice pink tone to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna have to buy more of these if different colors!</li>
            <li> Very sheer color, which is okay with me.</li>
            <li> thinking they would be more on the sheer side.  </li>
            <li> With just a trace of product, it was a gentle pink that looks great on our blossoming young daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ok for daily use</li>
            <li> SUCH A CUTE COLOR on my lips.</li>
            <li> This gloss is soft and light and so moisterizing.</li>
            <li> and it made my lips so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> The color was sheer and worked better with the lip balm like formula.  </li>
            <li> This goes on nice and gives a pretty pink color to my lips.  </li>
            <li> my lips are already like a hot pink/red color and this just kinda amplified it, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> Color is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> #34;it is so inviting to just touch your lips and tastes good.&amp;#34; ;)</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing!  </li>
            <li> It goes on pretty well</li>
            <li> and I now rock this more than my former lip stick.</li>
            <li> Color is pretty.</li>
            <li> I just bought this stuff about a week ago in the peach flavor first</li>
            <li> give it 4/5 because it fades quickly, but these are so darn inexpensive that it really doesn&#x27;t matter that much to me.</li>
            <li> its easy to apply and really makes your lips baby soft.</li>
            <li> The pink color goes on lighter than expected which is very good as when I first saw it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and initially feels very hydrating.</li>
            <li> its not like lipstick but its pretty good for a regular day out to feel extra girly!</li>
            <li> I just love the way it feels when you first apply it, and that feeling really does last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> It smells good and leaves my lips soft and with a pretty pink tint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great though, and I&#x27;m actually wearing it right now, but wow is it super pink.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, very pink.</li>
            <li> Maybelline has expanded the line with many more &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34; Some are clear, some with a little color, some with lots of creaminess.</li>
            <li> The product is very moisturizing, soft texture, I&#x27;m satisfied, I would prefer a much more vibrant color though, but this pink color suits me as well.</li>
            <li> can pretty much adjust what color you</li>
            <li> After application, my lips do not stay moist long, but I enjoy the tint and the flavor!  </li>
            <li> I love the light pink tint that is just the slightest bit of flattering color, but I&#x27;ve been mostly surprised that it lasts</li>
            <li> I bought this lip gloss because my lips pretty much fall apart in the winter.</li>
            <li> The color fades quickly but my lips stay smooth for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It was a lot brighter than what I thought it would be, as I thought since these are more chapsticks than lipsticks, I thought the color would be more subtle.</li>
            <li> It is a vibrant barbie pink color and it keeps your lips hydrated and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, it has a LOVELY sweet pink color on the cheeks, and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Love this the color is just so pink and pretty</li>
            <li> it seems to dry my lips more than anything.</li>
            <li> The quenched one leaves my lips SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> For my skin though I tend to have more dry skin</li>
            <li> Makes my lips feel super soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Makes lips SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this, I was just expecting it to be a light sheer color.</li>
            <li> I added this to my cart because I needed one more small item to get free shipping.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and has just enough color to be pretty but not obnoxious.</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased, and deciding which flavor I want to try next.</li>
            <li> The actual color of the tint seemed to have an almost purple tint to it and strongly reminded me of lipstick in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Even if you are like me and have a very pale skin tone it just looks like you have a bright lipstick on, not</li>
            <li> texture is very smooth, and there is a slight pink tint, which I would have liked to know about before I bought it.</li>
            <li> And after the first application, you will notice right away that you&#x27;re lips are softer and smoother, leaving your mouth with a soft glossy look.</li>
            <li> Pink punch is a great lip balm whenever I have dry lips</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is great, but if you want something over-the-top bold, this isn&#x27;t the product to go for.</li>
            <li> If you have very light pink lips, this is not for you (unless you like the pop of color).</li>
            <li> But overall, i enjoy this product, and its a pretty pink :)</li>
            <li> A very light tint of pink color.</li>
            <li> Fixes all your dry lip problems, and gives your lips the color and shine you always have dreamed of! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I would not recommend this particular baby lips, I would recommend all the others!</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s not an intense repairing balm, but certainly isn&#x27;t drying.</li>
            <li> This tinted lip balm is really what it is cracked up to be.  </li>
            <li> The color is overbearing and very 80s.  </li>
            <li> I reapply about every hour or so to keep the color intense, but the moisture probably lasts about two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this pink is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> But I think it is not really helpful to me, and it&#x27;s not like a lip stick or a lip balm, I don&#x27;t know how to say it，only one thing I can sure</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This also helps so much during the winter because my lips get so chapped</li>
            <li> it really moist for your lips and</li>
            <li> really did not care for this one that much it was not what I thought it would be</li>
            <li> They feel really &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But on whim I bought one in Pink Punch; and I have to say I love it:</li>
            <li> I like that this is sort of like a lipstick, but really a chapstick.</li>
            <li> it melts really fast.</li>
            <li> came fast</li>
            <li> At such a low price, I will definitely be repurchasing more of these cute lip</li>
            <li> I still really like this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it lasts 8 hours since i reapplied after about 3.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this lip balm!</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 stars for moisture, packaging, price, and color.&lt;br /&gt;-3 stars because the smell makes it unwearable (and umbearable haha) in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the way her lips feel with this product and the smell is very pleasing as well.</li>
            <li> I just bought two more -  Melon Mania and Pink Wink.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> I was concerned as it has a very plastic/pink color.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> The color however, is very pigmented which I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
            <li> it really dosen&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is VERY pigmented.</li>
            <li> I really like this because it has the moisture AND the color.</li>
            <li> I really like the moisture of the lip balm.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li> I really like this product-</li>
            <li> BUT I WASNT REALLY LOOKING FOR THE COLOR</li>
            <li> I like the color, but i don&#x27;t find it to be very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Shipment came fast.</li>
            <li> I only bought this product so that I would get free shipping on all my orders XD</li>
            <li> I really hope Maybelline doesn&#x27;t discontinue this item any time soon.</li>
            <li> I like the smell to it and the color, but it didn&#x27;t really moisturize my lips.</li>
            <li> I really like this line of lip moisturizer, but am concerned about unneeded chemicals.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a more translucent pink.</li>
            <li> it give a cute shade of pink on the lips.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love the shade of pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more on the baby pink side.</li>
            <li> Three stars because it&#x27;s like lip stick, except really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love all of the pink tints they taste and feel</li>
            <li> it also smells very good.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> really pinky color and moist too.</li>
            <li> My lips are so much smoother than before.</li>
            <li> If you have very chapped lips, or cracked bleeding lips, I would suggest healing them with Carmex before using this.</li>
            <li> The color is suddle, it&#x27;s like a lipstick mixed with a light balm.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> (I noticed it doesn&#x27;t have any flavor really at all, so just a heads up on that.)</li>
            <li> I will buy this product very often</li>
            <li> Not the most moisturizing and the color is way to bubblegum pink</li>
            <li> the color is lovely pink.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more pink than I thought.  </li>
            <li> Reasonable price</li>
            <li> Color is soft and subdued, appropriate for a teen girl.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a sucker for good packaging.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m sure to use it only after exfoliating, or I put clear chap stick on before I apply it.</li>
            <li> I have 3 different flavors so far and plan to get them all:)</li>
            <li> a good long while on dry lips.</li>
            <li> It just kind of shows up as a plain lip balm?</li>
            <li> My lip are so soft right now.  </li>
            <li> An very moisturizing lip balm with high-intensity color, Baby Lips is actually better than I expected (and I expect a lot from Maybelline)!</li>
            <li> I barely wear any lip color, but I like how it appears as a mild lip stick without the stickiness...</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s a good lip balm for the price, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is any different than other lip balms</li>
            <li> When she put it on, her lips were bright pink, and (like Lady Xeona said on Youtube) looked like she ate a box of hot pink crayons.</li>
            <li> I like other lip treatments better.</li>
            <li> Nice pink color not too dark or light.</li>
            <li> So far i love the consistency of it,it applies sooo smooth its unbelievable.</li>
            <li> As far as the balm itself, it isn&#x27;t strong, it gives a light sheen over my lips and moisterizes them for a little while.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a light baby pink tint to help create a nice summery look, but I was severely let down.</li>
            <li> Balm up b/c of the brightly colored tint and no apparent, revolutionary formula differentiating it from every other lip balm.</li>
            <li> however, even though I do see a slight difference in my lips, they are not perfect my any means, perfect meaning that they are smooth like baby lips with out any chapping, I know mabey</li>
            <li> smells nice, doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> feels &amp; smells nice for a little while!</li>
            <li> one was about $3-4 (I know Walmart sells them cheaper), so I didn&#x27;t really have high hopes.</li>
            <li> I will DEFINITELY be purchasing this again and most likely from the same seller (it&#x27;s almost 5 bucks at my nearest drugstore, so you save a buck or two IF you get free shipping).</li>
            <li> Turns out it also tinted my lips slightly which was unexpected but nice.</li>
            <li> would get it again, as long as it stays cheap.</li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because, honestly, the name is kind of off-putting to me - as a grown woman, the idea of carrying and using a product named &amp;#34;baby lips&amp;#34; is a bit weird.</li>
            <li> Of course, it also depends on the colour of your natural lips because this tinted lip balm is exactly that--a tint.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this lip balm at Target and it is exactly true to color.</li>
            <li> Ok so for someone like me (dark skin)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a week, and I&#x27;ve already received so many compliments on the color that I&#x27;m tempted to try the other colors as well!</li>
            <li> I love pink lipstick, especially since it&#x27;s so in right now..</li>
            <li> Really like the light pink color.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t overuse it, you have a nice, more subtle pink.</li>
            <li> I love these because they just have a slight tint.</li>
            <li> The product does soften and smooth dry lips, but the color is a bit bubble-gummie for my taste.  </li>
            <li> This lipbalm is decent.</li>
            <li> Luckily this only cost me about a dollar.</li>
            <li> Vibrant color where it happens to stick.</li>
            <li> so she could pretend with her older sisters.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this balm, I was expecting my lips to look a more natural color of pink.</li>
            <li> so I got her it for x-mas, needless to say she&#x27;s in love, but how can you not be with a Maybelline product :)</li>
            <li> As a moisturizing lip balm, this is a decent product.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizing Lip Balm, Pink Punch, 0.15 Ounce]]I love the baby soft lip balms.</li>
            <li> it Moisturizes my lip for a decent period of time.</li>
            <li> This little gem moisturizes like a chapstick and applies a wonderful pink color that lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> When I opened it up it was bigger than expected, I put it on and it smelled pretty good except it did have a tiny bit of a makeupy smell (kind of hard to explain, but it wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything g from expensive to cheap this by far beats all of them!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It really does make your lips baby soft!</li>
            <li> Really i was expecting it to be more long lasting.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Over all I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The color is like bright neon pink but other than</li>
            <li> All the other tinted balms I&#x27;ve ever owned have always been kind of sheer</li>
            <li> I grab this when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing a lip gloss on top of my lipstick but want a little bit of a shine.</li>
            <li> but it was a little more than what you can get it for at the store.</li>
            <li> It might look better on my olive skin in the summer with a little tan.</li>
            <li> I will upload a picture, as it&#x27;s kind of hard to see the color in the amazon listing picture.</li>
            <li> It was an add on item, so it came pretty quickly along with other stuff.</li>
            <li> I get a lush, bright bubble gum pink, and moisturized lips with a single swipe!</li>
            <li> it is light pink shade of a color.</li>
            <li> the color is a bit lighted than what i expected, i like how it feels when you apply it to your lips, its not sticky and its light.</li>
            <li> The item as a whole reminds me of something sold for a nine year old, like its a dress-up toy.  </li>
            <li> However, if you work the product into your lips a lot, it turns into a very flattering shade and makes your lips incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> They really make your lips soft.  </li>
            <li> the pink comes out sheer, not as pink as the colour looks, great for everyday wash of colour,can also be used over or under some of your pinky lipsticks for more moisture.</li>
            <li> - I love how smoothly it goes on and that it&#x27;s not as sticky or annoying as some of the more &amp;#34;juicy&amp;#34; lip gloss styles.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> My lips get so chapped in the winter normally</li>
            <li> I Bought this item at my normal drug store</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d recomend getting it from your normal drug store just to be cheaper though.</li>
            <li> $4 for a lip balm that only lasts 2 weeks just isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> If you want a good lip balm that doesn&#x27;t leave color behind, try this color:</li>
            <li> and I love it, but it does NOT last long!</li>
            <li> My new favorite for everyday makeup.  </li>
            <li> This balm glides right on and provides a sheer tint of color.  </li>
            <li> Only thing, the color didn&#x27;t look right on me.</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline&#x27;s Baby Lips line, but didn&#x27;t know you could get it at any local major retail or grocery store for a cheaper price than what you can get online here, especially when you factor in shipping costs.</li>
            <li> And after many uses, I saw the opposite of the intended effect - my lips became dry and irritated!  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, its not sticky or greasy, and it has a subtle sweet smell.</li>
            <li> It stays on very a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> I was definitely excited for the pink tint</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> and it was a new flavor.  </li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Baby Lips</li>
            <li> you send me a new one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to \\&quot;chapstick.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I live maybelline baby lips.</li>
            <li> I order the baby lips maybelline new york</li>
            <li> B004Y9GYZS Maybelline New York Baby Lips</li>
            <li> So I ordered a bunch of these in different colors, and the baby pink punch color is my favorite.</li>
            <li> overall, i like the Pink punch better, but if you dont care about the scent</li>
            <li> and it also gaves you the the pretty color like a Barbie pink color its really pretty</li>
            <li> The color is subtle, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t fond of the pink color, i was expecting more of a clear tint of pink, but this looks more like a frosted pink on the lips, not  for my coloring.</li>
            <li> The color is noticeable but subtle and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Sheer color that gives a nice pick look without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> Love this little lip balm!</li>
            <li> Going back to school and being a single mother meant I had to budget somewhere; but honestly the quality of drugstore makeup made me want to go without rather than use their gross flavored, grainy textured, feathering lipsticks and lipglosses.</li>
            <li> This one &amp; the clear Quench are my favorites!</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and gives you minty breath too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s why I LOVE this balm, because it is a slick balm and a lipstick in one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I only notice it when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty into the Baby Lips products</li>
            <li> The baby pink is a very pretty, subtle color, and when it goes on your lips feel super smooth.</li>
            <li> Exactly the opposite, in fact.</li>
            <li> Seems to stay on for a long time, and is not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth $3.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly the same as the pictures of the models wearing the product.</li>
            <li> I am expecting to much, but that is just my opion on the product that I have been using for a few months now, however, I do like it, its smooth, and it does add a tint of color, kinda like a colored chapstick, and I will continue to use it, just don&#x27;t expect it to make your chapped lips healed completely.</li>
            <li> This lipgloss is just what I was looking for.... moisturizers with soft color!</li>
            <li> do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Just enough blue in the shade to make my teeth appear more white.  </li>
            <li> The color is not too intense with one swipe, but you can make it look really vibrant by applying extra.</li>
            <li> It will not actually change the color or texture of your lips over time, other than keeping them hydrated, and, obviously, tinting them a nice bubblegum color.</li>
            <li> I also love the pink tint and how long it lasts.....</li>
            <li> It does not smooth out easily.</li>
            <li> It has a nice pink color that you can build up to for a more brighter barbie pink look if you want, or just wear a subtle layer for a bit of color.</li>
            <li> I have really chapped lips, in general, and this stuff has really improved the quality of them overall.</li>
            <li> Right price for a lip balm, doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips.</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink punch for UNPLUGGED, and it came in the mail super fast, like two days later.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really make your lips soft and the color doesn&#x27;t last long, but if you&#x27;re looking for a more grownup lip stick for a younger teen I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Since they were a little chapped to begin with, the color doesn&#x27;t go on evenly and makes the product look cheap and trashy.</li>
            <li> The pink is very vibrant, but it is also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> However, I want you to know that it&#x27;s a pretty vibrant pink.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one if you want that just right, almost natural, looking pop of pink on your lips!</li>
            <li> but i mixed with a lip gloss to difusse the colors and make it pop a little bit more</li>
            <li> and i add an extra coat just to make it a little bit more noticeable</li>
            <li> i like to cake on my lip balms and even with a thin layer, this balm left a very bright and noticeable pink on my lips.</li>
            <li> Leave lips a light pink that&#x27;s definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> The lip balm itself works wonders, especially during the fall/winter, has a light tinted pink color, to give you the \\&quot;pout\\&quot; lip look and has a tasty smell as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get the hype with these Baby Lips, they&#x27;re not very moisturizing and tend to just &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on my lips instead of absorbing fully.</li>
            <li> I am buying in a clear color</li>
            <li> Wide variety of colors available for different skin tones&lt;</li>
            <li> It did make my lips feel soft</li>
            <li> It does make your lips soft.</li>
            <li> Makes your lips so soft with a hint of color.  </li>
            <li> Like a tinted lip moisturizer without looking like lipstick on a young girl.</li>
            <li> and youre looking for a natural color</li>
            <li> But this does work well as far as lip color is concerned.</li>
            <li> I recommend it if you still want to look spunky, but professional.</li>
            <li> My lips aren&#x27;t normally super dry, they&#x27;re occasionally dry when I am really dehydrated.</li>
            <li> This color makes your face dim.</li>
            <li> I wear it even when i don&#x27;t go out because it does make lips soft.</li>
            <li> I will let my 10 year old wear it too.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky goopy film on your lips once it gets old (or has been on your lips for awhile)</li>
            <li> I like it so far</li>
            <li> and I ended up letting my 7 year old daughter have it for dress up makeup.</li>
            <li> Not heavy or sticky at all</li>
            <li> I even noticed a natural glow to them.</li>
            <li> The whole thing lasted me 2 months and still lasting til this day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very creamy and the color last for hours.</li>
            <li> Makes lips soft and supple</li>
            <li> Makes my lips kissably soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a natural color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got my order early</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite like lipstick and fades fast, but it&#x27;s definitely there.</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and have tried lots of lip glosses.</li>
            <li> Nearly neon color</li>
            <li> It keeps them moist and is the only thing that heals my chapped lips FAST.</li>
            <li> and it makes my lips feel so soft.</li>
            <li> This product is not heavy like a lipstick.  </li>
            <li> How soft.</li>
            <li> After the balm was absorbed, my lips were still rough and the tint settled in the creases of my lips.</li>
            <li> I have bought the baby lips in a few different colors and I love them all</li>
            <li> Well this product actually has color to it, which I LOVE because I don&#x27;t like heavy lipsticks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to buy more in a few different shades.</li>
            <li> After applying it a few times over, it does leave a nice pink stain on the lips, which is why it got a 2 stars and not 1.</li>
            <li> Easy to store and carry around for times when I want a little color!</li>
            <li> And I also bought the peach color which is even more subtle than the pink, but also very pretty.</li>
            <li> The color is literally like the little kid lip stick you were excited to wear when you were like 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color was way too pink and bright and made me look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of this particular color though.</li>
            <li> so the streaky pink baby lips on its own is not cute.  </li>
            <li> There was only one problem with this particular shade.</li>
            <li> I have been using it with a clear gloss to calm down the color, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product ranks between moderate and high hazard.</li>
            <li> It felt like a high end lip gloss combo lip balm with a sheer tint of color.</li>
            <li> It looks like pale frosy pink lipstick that can look super out of place without other makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peach is my favorite flavor.</li>
            <li> An unexpected outcome to this product is it actually stains my lips a little bit, a light tint</li>
            <li> I have normal colored lips; slightly more pink than usual.</li>
            <li> The pink is pretty</li>
            <li> This is a pretty pink color</li>
            <li> I knew the color would be a hot pink, which doesn&#x27;t work well with my skintone, but I was hoping I could make this color work.  </li>
            <li> The pink is so pink that I have to admit that I don&#x27;t use this gloss every day, but I love it just the same.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t read well and as soon as I applied this on, I had hot pink lips.</li>
            <li> It has just a little bit of color and light enough</li>
            <li> I really like, is really creamy and have a little bit of color</li>
            <li> it does make your lips a little more pink soo...</li>
            <li> It left it soft at first for a bit, but afterwards my lips turned dry</li>
            <li> and like it claims my lips feel baby soft, no loose skin or chapped for them, and even odder they look FULLER&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the only lip product that I have actually used the whole tube/container.</li>
            <li> I really like this product range and have it in several different colors</li>
            <li> It was a painful experience and besides, every woman wants gorgeous and sexy-soft lips.</li>
            <li> Baby Lips are perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want something too thick or too thin!</li>
            <li> It definitely keeps your lips very soft.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted the limited edition colors.</li>
            <li> However, when I applied it for the first time, my lips were literally neon pink!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s got a major scent to it that reminds me of sugary lipgloss.</li>
            <li> Pink Punch will give your lips a sheer pink tint, just enough to be cute.</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for a product that can go from very vibrant pink to (after lots of blotting)</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty, but this lip balm is not very moisturizing in the long run.</li>
            <li> The only think I mainly don&#x27;t like is the lasting of it.</li>
            <li> I love all of the baby lips, but the purple one is just a little dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I really like these, and I have bought a few different &amp;#34;shades&amp;#34; and I use them all the time, and will continue to use them, however, the promise of smooth soft &amp;#34;baby lips&amp;#34; is not true.</li>
            <li> I would rate this as a little better than average</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a little too &amp;#34;barbie-esque&amp;#34; and pink, but if you just put one coat on it, it&#x27;s just a nice pink.</li>
            <li> --just one swipe on your lips and you&#x27;ll barely get any colour payoff.</li>
            <li> No regrets about my purchase.</li>
            <li> at the same time it gives your lips naturally color.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes lips soft.</li>
            <li> Especially being 24 years old.</li>
            <li> Pros: Soft and moisturizing, somewhat sheer color, portable size.</li>
            <li> So inexpensive for such a soft &amp; tasty product.</li>
            <li> It gives a very baby pink on the lips.</li>
            <li> A couple of swipes on the lips is enough for me to look natural.</li>
            <li> Trust me, if it wasn&#x27;t worth it, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time writing about it.</li>
            <li> so a color this light and a not so thick formula</li>
            <li> This is just as nice as chapstick, and it gives your lips a very soft subtle pink-ish tint, not in-your-face pink, just a shiny almost healthy-looking pink tint.</li>
            <li> is kinda fake if you put too much but just put a liitle bit is fine</li>
            <li> With the Maybelline New York Baby Lips, my lips are soft &amp; baby pink!</li>
            <li> It arrived a few days early and is surprisingly a really decent balm!</li>
            <li> I will likely try the clear variety next time!</li>
            <li> A little of this lip balm really goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product as an on-the-go lip balm.</li>
            <li> The balm itself in my opinion is too large, not like your typical chap stick.  </li>
            <li> The only thing with this one does leave you lips very pink if yolu put too much.</li>
            <li> Smooth, very pink, and a little sheer.</li>
            <li> Baby lips is cool because its, small, it&#x27;s a lip balm, and it has fragrance and color!</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast, less then a week</li>
            <li> The Pink Punch color is a nice, subtle, girly pink.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is incredibly, shockingly pink when you first put it on, and not very hydrating.  </li>
            <li> I do think it was worth waiting for, but I could have also bought Nivea moisture rescue which offers the same if not superior moisture.</li>
            <li> Not long after application my lips felt drier than prior to application.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the color (or soft feeling) doesn&#x27;t last too long, so you need to reapply often.</li>
            <li> I have a pale lip color, so it comes out super pink sometimes, sort of making me look like I&#x27;m going to an 80&#x27;s party.</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t too much for a little one to play with.</li>
            <li> My little cousin even uses it and she is one who really like anything that makes her look girly</li>
            <li> and I got that like Niki Minaj pale pink color on my lips while feeling super moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li> Even a little bit leaves behind a bright pink color, so unless you want to look like a stripper, try not to put it on too often.</li>
            <li> Maybe in the summer it won&#x27;t look as bad, but I still don&#x27;t think I can even wear it in the summer its so bright.</li>
            <li> it doesnt last long though, and i haven&#x27;t really noticed my lips any softer or less sun burned.</li>
            <li> The pink punch actually smells really fruity like a punch drink and goes on very pink on the lips.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the other colors, pink punch is really opaque.</li>
            <li> I have just begun using them, so I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s helping my lips to be softer, less dry.  </li>
            <li> SOFT AND PINK!</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and creamy, but this one in particular has a pink tent, I wanted one that did not have any tint, but if you are like me the go for the other baby lips that is NOT TINTED.</li>
            <li> I have a medium/tan skin tone and this has a slight pink hue (not too much)</li>
            <li> The only thing is I think I might have a pigment allergy to them which causes my upper lip to become dry and scaly.  </li>
            <li> but I like a nice little pop of color that is subtle for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> It does last a long time too!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long</li>
            <li> It does enhance dry and chapped lips and doesn&#x27;t seem to provide enough moisture</li>
            <li> As far as color, the pink was too pink for my face.</li>
            <li> It really is a balm, but the color can clump in areas that are more dry or creased.&lt;br /&gt;However, if one puts on a balm or base prior to use, the color evens out.</li>
            <li> I bought the pink color which is really subtle, but very pretty.</li>
            <li> I knew that if the baby pink color was too much I could blend it down with some of my other makeup that was left.</li>
            <li> I really like that this lip balm leaves a pale pink color on the lips,</li>
            <li> It also hase a very vibrant pink color, but at the same time I am VERY pale (sometimes people ask me if I&#x27;m feeling alright</li>
            <li> It is just enough for attention but not enough that makes you look like a clown like other colors.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about the pink punch is that the color is a little overwhelming on my pale skin.</li>
            <li> but my lips are dark enough that it is not obvious that the lip balm is tinted.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time so you don&#x27;t have to reapply every 30 minutes like some chapsticks do</li>
            <li> I finally got my hands on the Pink Punch.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a tinted lip balm for a long time and stumbled upon this.</li>
            <li> It has a obvious pink color when its supposed to be a lip balm.</li>
            <li> It actually smells like pink punch.  </li>
            <li> It makes your lips look like baby lip color and it stays on for a long long time.</li>
            <li> After seeing a Maybelline commercial advertising the balm and hearing tons of raving reviews, I gave in and ordered the Pink Punch.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks my lips are so amazingly soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I like the pink punch and red cherry because it makes my lips pinkish or reddish.  </li>
            <li> Especially for girls who want a bit of a girly pink tinge to their lips.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it lasts that long, though I do talk a lot for my job and maybe that&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> since it&#x27;s a balm it would be like a sheer pink that is not the case</li>
            <li> I remember saying, \\&quot;Aw not another false advertisement for a product that might not be worth it for the price.\\</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long, and you have to reapply often but I wouldn&#x27;t say anymore than other $3.99 lip balms.</li>
            <li> but I have several other colours and the formula</li>
            <li> This order arrived with two of my other orders and was shipped out and delivered on time if not earlier!</li>
            <li> I will definitely try other balms in this line of product.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, the key is to reapply.  </li>
            <li> I also bought other colors of this model in physical store.</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips moisturised for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I like the color, but it won&#x27;t keep very long time.</li>
            <li> ^-^ My lips are usually dry and what I do is</li>
            <li> But it dose cake up on the dry, chapped parts of your lips</li>
            <li> In fact it made my lips dry after applying.</li>
            <li> and i like how it makes my dry lips feel</li>
            <li> With my dry lips I like to reapply the product, but can&#x27;t without putting a ton of this color on my lips</li>
            <li> If your lips are really dry</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t recommend it for excessively dry lips.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t going to work an overnight miracle for dry lips, but it doesn&#x27;t promise to.</li>
            <li> or so when my lips feel dry.</li>
            <li> And that makes me a pretty tough critic to please.</li>
            <li> Kinda dried out my lips and left me with this gross pink residue on my lips</li>
            <li> This is NOT a high end lip healing medicine like balm.</li>
            <li> The colors last for hours and my lips feel moisturized for half the day.</li>
            <li> In previous ads I&#x27;ve seen for the product, it says it moisturizes the lips and gives off a lasting effect, which it does not.</li>
            <li> Do your lips ever get dry or rough spots?</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stay long on though, u have to keep applying it other than that I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> ( I only use a little bit of when I put on</li>
            <li> so you get a little pop from it which is prefect for the days you don&#x27;t want to wear a lot of make up or keeping simple.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for dry chapped lips</li>
            <li> The heavier you apply it, the brighter pink your lips get.  </li>
            <li> but I have to add another pink to spice it up.</li>
            <li> Too bubble gum matte pink.</li>
            <li> Its really pink but doesn&#x27;t come off like that.</li>
            <li> I bought the Maybelline Baby Lips (pink punch) at a drugstore and like the texture of it on my lips.</li>
            <li> (This review is for Pink Punch</li>
            <li> I recommend this product, at only a few bucks it can&#x27;t hurt to try it.  </li>
            <li> this PINK PUNCH color WILL give you color.</li>
            <li> I got the pink punch and peach kiss.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all, it did the opposite for me and actually dried out my lips.</li>
            <li> The pink was way too pink on me and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I wear this lip balm with my HG pink lipstick-</li>
            <li> not too pink.</li>
            <li> Pink Punch, Cherry Me, And Peppermint.</li>
            <li> so they won&#x27;t give you the pink greasy look.</li>
            <li> Pink Punch and Peach Kiss.</li>
            <li> I would have to say it isnt that moisterizing however, if your looking for a pink nicki minaj lipstick</li>
            <li> it might not be so pink.</li>
            <li> I bought two shades; Pink Punch and Peach Kiss.</li>
            <li> and I only need to reapply every few hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was way too pink for my lips</li>
            <li> - I have the pink punch and cherry colors.</li>
            <li> Must have if you want some pink to your lips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a Barbie pink.</li>
            <li> It has a pink color that sits inbetween your chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I got the pink punch.</li>
            <li> BUT ITS PINK LIKE BARBIE</li>
            <li> , I figured I&#x27;d try the pink punch.</li>
            <li> so now some are harder to find.</li>
            <li> Color pigments built up on the rough areas/around them.</li>
            <li> I can see why some buyers might complain a bit about the pink color it leaves but remember that it IS meant to do that.</li>
            <li> it was soooo pink.</li>
            <li> If you like wearing a really pink shade on your lips, then this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> Color is not really my type.</li>
            <li> I have it in Pink Punch.</li>
            <li> I have tried and tested a wide variety of them.</li>
            <li> I want my items within the next few days.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could pull off the pink lip.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get over the hideous Barbie doll pink hue it leaves on my lips.</li>
            <li> took a pink crayon and colored over my lips.</li>
            <li> so I got this Pink Punch and thinking</li>
            <li> it goes on like pepto bismal pink if that&#x27;s what you want</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t what i want or expected i could see that in a lipstick maybe.</li>
            <li> and I am already debating when I will order my next few from the baby</li>
            <li> I also like the hint of pink.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes it also wears off the middle of the lip, leaving a hideous pink ring around your mouth.</li>
            <li> Not heavy, greasy, clumpy, or thick.</li>
            <li> I use it for casual or fun looks and days.</li>
            <li> It does not moisturize dry lips and the color is too dark.</li>
            <li> The Pink Punch is very pink, like a Barbie pink.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a subtle or soft shade of pink, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY pink ..like barbie pink .....</li>
            <li> It adds a subtle tint to your lips but makes them so soft.  </li>
            <li> As a lip balm/tint I was expecting the color to be very subtle, but I found the appearance to be very cakey.</li>
            <li> It really makes my lips feel soft and moisturized--especially in the harsh winter cold.  </li>
            <li> It is baby pink though!</li>
            <li> I usually wear &amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees&amp;#34; chapstick stuff (no color), but thought I&#x27;d try something different.</li>
            <li> I plan to try the other shades.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t need to apply it anymore than any other lipstick or gloss, those saying it dries out</li>
            <li> Other than that, it shipped well</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other colors but after this now i&#x27;m forsure going to.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted a pop of pink on my lips &amp; this does it!</li>
            <li> Will not use any other</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this would be so pink!</li>
            <li> so I bought this and a couple other colors</li>
            <li> I will be trying the other colors.</li>
            <li> contrasting colors make this balm feel a cut above the rest even though it&#x27;s probably technically no better than a tinted chapstick-</li>
            <li> If you want your lips to be the color of pink bubble gum, buy this!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a difference in the softness and it turns your lips totally pink!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll look at some other places though, definately.</li>
            <li> I thought the color(pink Punch was just the name , but I have dropped stars due to</li>
            <li> just like any other product, not that &amp;#34;baby lips&amp;#34; but  OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned that it made their lips peel, but I haven&#x27;t found this to be the case for myself.</li>
            <li> I am getting really impatient because it has been way too long.</li>
            <li> The color is very pink.  </li>
            <li> This tinted \\&quot;Pink Punch\\&quot; shade was worse than the clear \\&quot;Quenched\\&quot; shade.</li>
            <li> but it comes off with an odd pink tint that I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li> It has a slight pink undertone color to it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the Barbie pink color, but it is surprisingly very wearable.</li>
            <li> but it is just a little too pink for me other than that it stays on well and isnt gummy feeling like other glosses.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes without stickiness and provides just a hint of pink without the stick mess that, to me, is lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had bought this to replace my usual super expensive makeup that I get from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Its a little on the pink side</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried putting it on over some chap stick which helps a little but not much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super moisturizing, but I prefer other products for that anyway.</li>
            <li> This is not worth $7.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth the price tag either.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this to people (like my mom) with dark lips</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m a dark skin girl</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong got it fast as well.</li>
            <li> But that would be my only negative reason to give it four stars/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I have dark lips</li>
            <li> Average moisturizing power</li>
            <li> Average looking tube&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> Love Baby Lips lip balm - hate this color...</li>
            <li> I have tried it without lipstick and it sometimes gives me a glossy cotton candy look or sometimes it looks like a pale pink.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with dry, cracked, bleeding, unattractive, and unhealthy lips, I have tried everything from Vaseline to different lip glosses, balms, sticks, and everything in that order.</li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone to buy this and some of the other baby lips products!</li>
            <li> I recommend this and the other Baby Lips!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have one single complaint about Baby Lips other than the fact that I don&#x27;t yet have it in every color and flavor.</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer, I bought this balm as a 2-pack at Target</li>
            <li> I paid half this price at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> IT HAS IT FOR WAYYYY LESS.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base for my lip gloss and it gives off this light pink tint</li>
            <li> When I first heard about Maybelline&#x27;s Baby Lips, I was curious, to say the least, and a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> The color is a little too &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; for me, for some reason I didn&#x27;t think it would be as dark.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to chap stick/ lip balm in general and have tried almost every brand, and practically every flavor.</li>
            <li> At Christmas, I bought it for my little girl for her stocking.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to little girl or teenager to use.</li>
            <li> My little sister and I have been nagging my mom to by us Baby lips.</li>
            <li> I also like it for me when I don&#x27;t want to wear lipstick but just need a little color.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a little bit of a pop of color, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> i like something a little heavier as a lip balm.</li>
            <li> so that was a little bonus.</li>
            <li> Well, did you ever get little mini lip color sets for kids when you were a little girl?</li>
            <li> I am not a &amp;#34;bright colors&amp;#34; type of person, so when I got this lip moisturizer and realized that tinted MEANS tinted I was a little put off...</li>
            <li> It also changes the color a little.</li>
            <li> little pinkish thats it</li>
            <li> I found that if my lips were very dry and cracked when I used it, it would settle under the dry skin and look cheap and horrible.</li>
            <li> (I usually have color issues because my lips are already very pink).</li>
            <li> There is a slight fruit punch odor, but it&#x27;s not strong.  </li>
            <li> stains your lips like you just ate a popsicle, not very appealing</li>
            <li> this is part of my everyday little makeup and my lips feel moisturizing and the color stay for hours</li>
            <li> its not moisturizing at all and the color is a faded pastel/neon pink , ewwww!!!</li>
            <li> I know some people really like artificially fruity scents, but they make me gag for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing, no stay power, not good for dark lips&lt;</li>
            <li> Found that I do have to reapply every few hours.  </li>
            <li> i will re purchased in a few months</li>
            <li> I use it everyday in the mornings, but you have to re-apply it often.</li>
            <li> waste your time on this product.</li>
            <li> My sister says it makes her lips feel dryer after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I wish I did not give it a chance as I need treatment lip balm for my lips now after just a few months usage.</li>
            <li> A few hours after applying this, I started to notice myself getting chapped lips.</li>
            <li> No one has ever disliked them, instead thanked me, for passing on the word about Baby Lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> No tugging my dried out lips.</li>
            <li> honestly not a fan of this pale pink color on my skin (nc40 but pigmented lips).</li>
            <li> It softens your lips and it has color too, so you won&#x27;t have pale lips.</li>
            <li> but lipstick just seems so stiff and dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seriously smells like Hi-C pink punch, and I couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> &quot; I thought coming from a major line, it was going to be expensive.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m disappointed that it barely worth the couple of dollars I paid for it.</li>
            <li> So disappointed and aggravated right now.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this pink punch thinking that it&#x27;s a faint nudish pink</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about purchasing it since I have a dark complexion and did not know how pink lips would look on me.</li>
            <li> I usually wear lip gloss</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is expensive, which is definitely part of the appeal</li>
            <li> Shimmery, but not overwhelming ya know?</li>
            <li> This lip balm is not as creamy as most lip balms and the color is awful.</li>
            <li> I usually get the cherry colored one</li>
            <li> I usually end up mixing this with a lipstick so the color is even.  </li>
            <li> but now, I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I like it without lipstick underneath.</li>
            <li> And, because it does&#x27;nt absorb, if your lips are the least bit rough, the color makes it look worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel as though it was very &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; either :(</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, as she has dry lips and is obsessed with chapstick.</li>
            <li> A serious upgrade from my usual cherry Chapstick.</li>
            <li> This lip balm seems to be hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Why is Baby Lips so hard to find in the stores?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially because it&#x27;s not as restrained: the bulky width of the lip balm makes me look like a clown, or at least a child after eating a cherry</li>
            <li> I use it all the time, it is starting to get cold</li>
            <li> It has a really gross and awkward consistency.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it looks really bad on chapped lips, because the product latches onto dead skin.</li>
            <li> I have not seen her use it lately.</li>
            <li> A little expensive for lip balm, but my wife wanted to try it, and I needed a small stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> And seriously, the price?</li>
            <li> I needed a lipgloss that was subtle for work but perky.</li>
            <li> , the one thing ill say is a little off is how the color stays on...</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this so bad and we look allover and couldn&#x27;t find it until we came a cross it on Amazon..</li>
            <li> I got the punch pink and it looked like it would be a crazy color</li>
            <li> not good</li>
            <li> or if I need to sit down like they think I&#x27;m going to faint!)</li>
            <li> The color is \\&quot;pink punch,\\&quot; but I didn&#x27;t know that meant that it would smell like fruit punch gone bad.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to chapstick/lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Did I mention I&#x27;m hopelessly addicted to lip balm?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews on products, but I am behind this one 100 percent.</li>
            <li> It would leave my lips in a condition that&#x27;s even worse than before.</li>
            <li> I want red, but hate the taste of cherry.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to tinted lip balms.</li>
            <li> The pink punch one is this horrible, unflattering bubblegum pink color.</li>
            <li> Though, the hint of color is VERY subtle.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is terrible in every conceivable way.  </li>
            <li> The truth - I was a little bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t believe that a product that was so inexpensive could work so well.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> How could you go wrong?</li>
            <li> However this product kinda is weird.</li>
            <li> It fades after an hour or two, unfortunately, but I slip it into my pocket or keep it at my desk at work and reapply often.</li>
            <li> Nope, wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> nothing wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my daughter took one of mine ...</li>
            <li> Since people said the color was faint</li>
            <li> but this was the wrong colour for my chocolate complexion.</li>
            <li> However, the product pretends to be a fancy lip balm and fails.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> This stuff behaved like el cheapo little girl fake lip stick!!!</li>
            <li> a little boring on gloss</li>
            <li> but i wasnt crazy about the color</li>
            <li> I kept getting mutiple cold sores every winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become very addicted to these Baby Lips lip balms!</li>
            <li> The moisturizing in this product isn&#x27;t BAD</li>
            <li> &amp; I was shocked to see that this lip balm gives an appearance of a lipstick.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive tinted balm and bought this hoping for something ah-mazing, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say this is the worst lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Whenever it came in, I immediately tried it and found ALL of the reasons I hate drugstore makeup to not apply to this product.</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed since it was supposed to be moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It looked terrible.</li>
            <li> cannot believe how disgusting this product smells!</li>
            <li> I have never used a lip product as awful as the Maybelline Baby Lips.</li>
            <li> However the color is so awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only lip product that I have actually used the whole tube/container. I love it. I got the punch pink and it looked like it would be a crazy color but it&#x27;s not. It looks great! It&#x27;s just a light pink and it makes my lips look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li> The pink punch one is this horrible, unflattering bubblegum pink color. I wouldn&#x27;t bother repurchasing this in another color. There are way better lip tints out there</li>
            <li> This is more like lipstick than chap stick since it colors your lips.</li>
            <li> I thought this was more like a fancy brand of Chapstick, but its actually more than that &amp; I looooove the color that shows on my lips. It&#x27;s not too bright , &amp; it&#x27;s something you can use as an everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Love this little lip balm! Pleasant smell and application. Leave lips a light pink that&#x27;s definitely noticeable. Easy to store and carry around for times when I want a little color! It is baby pink though! So beware if you don&#x27;t want that color on your lips!</li>
            <li> I bought this in a two pack deal at target. This one does the same thing as the quenched one, it does&#x27;nt absorb. And I have to reapply it alot. And, because it does&#x27;nt absorb, if your lips are the least bit rough, the color makes it look worse. My lips are drier than before, and they are cracked open, and I have been using this and the quenched one for two weeks non stop.</li>
            <li> smells nice, doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, but WAY too pink lol</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty, but this lip balm is not very moisturizing in the long run.</li>
            <li> i got this product for my girlfriend. since the day she got it and tried it on, she fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li> This tinted lip balm is really what it is cracked up to be.  It gives a light pop of color and keeps your lips hydrated throughout the day.  The pink punch actually smells really fruity like a punch drink and goes on very pink on the lips.  The heavier you apply it, the brighter pink your lips get.  I love the way it makes my lips feel so soft and smooth.  The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long so I find myself applying it every 20 minutes at work.</li>
            <li> I have always been in love with Baby Lips products and this one is amazing! In love with the color and the silky smooth application! Great with any look!</li>
            <li> Love IT!&lt;br /&gt;The color is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;You can pretty much adjust what color you want!&lt;br /&gt;Rub it twice on your lips for a cute soft pink look, or rub it on more for a pinker look!&lt;br /&gt;It does do wonders to your lips, like a baby&#x27;s bottom!&lt;br /&gt;Plus it comes with 2! I didn&#x27;t know that, so that&#x27;s even better! &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> The coverage isn&#x27;t as opaque as I&#x27;d thought and I know this is a gloss so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot of color but this is very light. Still, I like the hint of color it gives and the way it feels on. You also can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it  and they are very much in trend in her shcool  ;-) Best regards from  us in Iceland</li>
            <li> I really like this product range and have it in several different colors - I love how smoothly it goes on and that it&#x27;s not as sticky or annoying as some of the more &amp;#34;juicy&amp;#34; lip gloss styles. While I agree that it&#x27;s not moisturizing in so far as it doesn&#x27;t do any repair or have long-lasting benefits, it does feel very nice when you put it on - so much so that you&#x27;ll forget you&#x27;re even wearing it, which as far as I&#x27;m concerned is exactly what you want from your make-up anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because, honestly, the name is kind of off-putting to me - as a grown woman, the idea of carrying and using a product named &amp;#34;baby lips&amp;#34; is a bit weird. But otherwise I love the packaging, although I still wish they&#x27;d bring back Kissing Koolers instead!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing balm, I just wanted more color for my lips. The pink is pretty but I have to add another pink to spice it up.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is terrible in every conceivable way.  It rolls on smoothly, but doesn&#x27;t sink into your lips.  The color is overbearing and very 80s.  And after many uses, I saw the opposite of the intended effect - my lips became dry and irritated!  I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product. I heard many good things about it, but I was less than impressed. It did make my lips feel soft and I didn&#x27;t feel any adverse effects regarding the smoothness of my lips. But I thought the color was hideous.  I was hoping for a light baby pink tint to help create a nice summery look, but I was severely let down. The actual color of the tint seemed to have an almost purple tint to it and strongly reminded me of lipstick in the 80&#x27;s.  As a lip balm/tint I was expecting the color to be very subtle, but I found the appearance to be very cakey. If you are looking for a lip balm that will tint your lips to a different color, I recommend trying either a different color or a different product.</li>
            <li> I love Baby Lips, each time I&#x27;m in the store I have to buy one, even if I already have the shade. I am addicted to chap stick/ lip balm in general and have tried almost every brand, and practically every flavor. I love Baby Lips more than most because it is tinted, and feels amazing. I&#x27;d level it with Softlips and So Moist, my two favorite brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to apply it more than once a day, but that is because it is a tinted lip balm NOT a colored lipstick. Just like any good lip balm you should apply it more than once a day because it would be like saying &amp;#34;Okay, I want to be hydrated so if I drink 3 oz of water just once a day in Mid August I&#x27;ll be hydrated all day and maybe so tomorrow.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives&lt;br /&gt;-Feels Amazing&lt;br /&gt;-Works Wonders For My Lips&lt;br /&gt;-Tinted, So Cute&lt;br /&gt;-Fun Colors to Pick From&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives&lt;br /&gt;-Not A Strong Flavor, Or No Flavors&lt;br /&gt;-Price Tag, Ouch&lt;br /&gt;-Reapplication (doesn&#x27;t bother me, but some people don&#x27;t like to do anything more than once a day)</li>
            <li> Too bubble gum matte pink. I thought it was more clear (like lip &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34;) Our preteen doesn&#x27;t like it (maybe Nicki Minaj would?)</li>
            <li> So I ordered a bunch of these in different colors, and the baby pink punch color is my favorite. It goes on nicely, looks good on my tan latina complexion, however I have to reapply but not too often, I would definately buy this color again. I love it.</li>
            <li> I just received it today and I must say it has A nice color to it. ~ :D I&#x27;m actually happy that I got this product, and my lips feel soft and it doesn&#x27;t feel as dry anymore ^-^ My lips are usually dry and what I do is I usually wear lip gloss but every time the wind blows my hair, it would just stick my hair onto my lips D: But now that I got this chap stick that has a nice smell to it... I&#x27;m actually happy. ^______^</li>
            <li> Its really pink but doesn&#x27;t come off like that. Smells delicious! It does make your lips soft. I&#x27;m going to buy all of them.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect pink! I love it so so much! Its bright and not too light, no shimmer, and a fruit punch kinda smell. It my favorite!</li>
            <li> An very moisturizing lip balm with high-intensity color, Baby Lips is actually better than I expected (and I expect a lot from Maybelline)! Though it was sold out in a lot of stores, it is worth the search. Their ColorSensational HighShine lipstick is also a good choice for moisturizing, but Baby Lips is great since it includes spf 15, and the moisture really lasts. I reapply about every hour or so to keep the color intense, but the moisture probably lasts about two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product caters to my chapped winter lips AND my inner diva at the same time: Pink Punch shade is a light (but highly-saturated) cotton candy pink, great for very fair skin. Very 1960s, disco-party-ish! I&#x27;m looking forward to trying all of the colors.</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer, I bought this balm as a 2-pack at Target and it does nothing good for me. This tinted \\&quot;Pink Punch\\&quot; shade was worse than the clear \\&quot;Quenched\\&quot; shade. After the balm was absorbed, my lips were still rough and the tint settled in the creases of my lips. It looked terrible. I don&#x27;t recommend this lip balm. Bath &amp; Body Works has better ones. Even Carmex or Chapstick work better than this.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lip gloss, but you have to keep re-applying over and over. Nivea is better. It is described on Amazon as having SPF, however when I got it in the mail, it does that not say that on the package.  If you go to Maybelline Beauty Advisor, Ask a Question, and enter \\&quot;babylips SPF\\&quot;, it says that this color does NOT have any sun protection factor.</li>
            <li> I bought the Maybelline Baby Lips (pink punch) at a drugstore and like the texture of it on my lips. It is moisturizing and the tint is not over the top and is very wearable.  My only gripe is with Amazon&#x27;s price here.  This is not worth $7.  I paid half this price at the drugstore.  Amazon needs to rethink the price or they&#x27;re not going to be selling very many of these.</li>
            <li> I watch beauty videos on YouTube and Baby Lips was all the rage, so I wanted to try it for myself. I was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t believe that a product that was so inexpensive could work so well. I was wrong. After using this product, I would definitely recommend it to everyone. It made my lips SO soft, and keeps them soft, not to mention it smells amazing!! :)</li>
            <li> I was leery at first to try this product because of the vibrant color, but after I actually tried it, I liked it. The color on your lips is not the color it looks like in the tube, which I was thankful for. I do wish it would be more of a chap stick than what it is though. It doesn&#x27;t really make your lips soft and the color doesn&#x27;t last long, but if you&#x27;re looking for a more grownup lip stick for a younger teen I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I love baby lips and the price on amazon it 2 to 3 dollars cheaper than at a CVS or Wallgreens &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I usually wear &amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees&amp;#34; chapstick stuff (no color), but thought I&#x27;d try something different. This is just as nice as chapstick, and it gives your lips a very soft subtle pink-ish tint, not in-your-face pink, just a shiny almost healthy-looking pink tint. I like it!</li>
            <li> I have bought the baby lips in a few different colors and I love them all but this pink is my favorite. THE LIPS YOU WERE BORN WITH</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! it was very inexpensive and very cute! the color I got was Peach kiss and it&#x27;s a very cute nude color. At Walmart I got it for 2.99! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and like it claims my lips feel baby soft, no loose skin or chapped for them, and even odder they look FULLER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a great buy!</li>
            <li> (This review is for Pink Punch but I have several other colours and the formula is the same.) This lipbalm is decent. It has a lovely colour if you really are generous with your application --just one swipe on your lips and you&#x27;ll barely get any colour payoff. The colour is more purpley in certain lighting and not even and easily comes off, but the balm is good and the packaging cute!&lt;br /&gt;The photo is taken of the same application in different lighting. Of course, it also depends on the colour of your natural lips because this tinted lip balm is exactly that--a tint. It isn&#x27;t opaque.</li>
            <li> I love the color, and it&#x27;s super soft on your lips. I just got it today and hope to continue using it</li>
            <li> I love this!  This is my new favorite lip balm!!  Makes your lips so soft with a hint of color.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> After application, my lips do not stay moist long, but I enjoy the tint and the flavor!  Good back up lip balm!</li>
            <li> The best chap stick ever! And all the different colors are great and look wonderful on! Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> Love this Chapstick! Leaves your lips feeling so smooth, great smell and has just a hint of color. Lasts a long time so you don&#x27;t have to reapply every 30 minutes like some chapsticks do</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. It does not moisturize dry lips and the color is too dark. Also, it dries up within 15 minutes so you have to keep applying. It&#x27;s good if you want to wear it under lipstick.</li>
            <li> BabyLips give a nice light tint with smooth not gooey lip protection and moisturizer.  The price is reasonable.  I plan to try the other shades.</li>
            <li> feels good on your lips and it smells good....it does rub  off quickly,also it can be used by kids also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting and waiting for this to be restocked, everywhere I went whether it was Target, CVS, Rite Aid, all flavors/tints were sold out. I finally got my hands on the Pink Punch. It is really nice and goes on smooth. Very moisturizing and with a hint of color that is nice for my fair skin tone. Though, the hint of color is VERY subtle. I do think it was worth waiting for, but I could have also bought Nivea moisture rescue which offers the same if not superior moisture. Personally, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase just because it was such a hassle to get a hold of.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and looks good but the pink punch when applied again (I wear it at my serving job) stains your lips like you just ate a popsicle, not very appealing</li>
            <li> this is part of my everyday little makeup and my lips feel moisturizing and the color stay for hours</li>
            <li> love it including the color but it is not moisturizing enough for me so put a moisturizer like blistex underneath</li>
            <li> I love this, keeps the lips very soft, has a nice bit of color, use it quite often, so I keep it close.</li>
            <li> I got this for my cousin, I have heard lots of great things about babylips, I got it on time and am happy</li>
            <li> Love this the color is just so pink and pretty</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not as good as Revlon Colorburst lip butter, or L&#x27;oreal Color Riche lip balm,&lt;br /&gt;Especially because it&#x27;s not as restrained: the bulky width of the lip balm makes me look like a clown, or at least a child after eating a cherry popsicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s awesome for tweens, I think. It&#x27;s awesome for people who are very low maintenence, too. The people who always liked the flavored lip balms. In the current market, though, it just doesn&#x27;t keep up.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped quickly, I love the color. You know how some lip balms come indifferent colors but when you put it on it doesnt show up as the color? It just kind of shows up as a plain lip balm? Well this product actually has color to it, which I LOVE because I don&#x27;t like heavy lipsticks, I like lip balms with just the right amount/hint of color and these are definitely my fave!</li>
            <li> This balm works pretty well.  Really like the light pink color.  Found that I do have to reapply every few hours.  Do feel it makes my lips softer.</li>
            <li> Nice lip balm for a nice price, has a very slight flavor also that is pleasant, not candy like. Good buy</li>
            <li> I like this product- smells good, but is too &#x27;pink&#x27; for me. I was looking for a light shimmer, but it is a bit too much. Would look good on a younger girl of about 10.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice, have a fruited smell, the packaging was nice, I may look to invest in more. Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The product is very moisturizing, soft texture, I&#x27;m satisfied, I would prefer a much more vibrant color though, but this pink color suits me as well. A nice choice, girls!</li>
            <li> This balm glides right on and provides a sheer tint of color.  Works perfectly.  Happy I purchased this product.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> love the color and smell of it. its easy to apply and really makes your lips baby soft. it doesn&#x27;t stay long on though, u have to keep applying it other than that I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Edit: It&#x27;s 2015 and I still use this product, in fact, I&#x27;m still using the same one! ( I only use a little bit of when I put on my makeup)&lt;br /&gt;I updated the stars to 5. It&#x27;s really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, it&#x27;s nice and soft, it glides on and it tastes &amp; smells good. It was very cheap $2.99 at Target, so it wasn&#x27;t a big risk to try it out. I like how moisturizing it is, I don&#x27;t need to apply it anymore than any other lipstick or gloss, those saying it dries out I wonder if they were expecting something more. An unexpected outcome to this product is it actually stains my lips a little bit, a light tint and I like that a lot. I picked the pink because I wanted to try something bright and I have a fair complexion. I recommend this product, at only a few bucks it can&#x27;t hurt to try it.  I will upload a picture, as it&#x27;s kind of hard to see the color in the amazon listing picture.</li>
            <li> I really like it, it has good color payoff and is moisturizing. But it dose cake up on the dry, chapped parts of your lips</li>
            <li> Is a nice lip tint, but isn&#x27;t a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This smells very good, and has a tint of color so it looks very nice when you wear it. It does make your lips smooth too. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have seen many people recommend this product on YouTube, so I want to try it. But I think it is not really helpful to me, and it&#x27;s not like a lip stick or a lip balm, I don&#x27;t know how to say it，only one thing I can sure is I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this balm! I was looking for a tinted lip balm for a long time and stumbled upon this. So glad I did because my lips feel so great and soft. I bought the pink color which is really subtle, but very pretty. And I also bought the peach color which is even more subtle than the pink, but also very pretty. And seriously, the price? How could you go wrong?</li>
            <li> Uh... Luckily this only cost me about a dollar. It feels as if I rubbed baby oil on my lips, not as creamy as I had hoped, and definitely not moisturising. After applying it a few times over, it does leave a nice pink stain on the lips, which is why it got a 2 stars and not 1. I wont be buying anymore, though.</li>
            <li> I love pink lipstick, especially since it&#x27;s so in right now..but lipstick just seems so stiff and dry.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I LOVE this balm, because it is a slick balm and a lipstick in one.&lt;br /&gt;Yes this PINK PUNCH color WILL give you color. It&#x27;s not for those who just want a product like chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, the fact that this is usually sold out in stores is a testament to how awesome it is.</li>
            <li> I love BABY LIPS! It is moisturizing and creamy, but this one in particular has a pink tent, I wanted one that did not have any tint, but if you are like me the go for the other baby lips that is NOT TINTED. Very,very good product though, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Baby lips are amazing!! I love mine and I use it all the time!! It softens your lips and it has color too, so you won&#x27;t have pale lips. People say that baby lips doesn&#x27;t work as a lip balm, but I disagree. Baby lips is awesome and you should definitely get it!</li>
            <li> The product sometimes get stuck ti the sides and the moisturizer gets stuck to the sides of the holder</li>
            <li> I like it, it feels good on my lips and really is cute :) However this product kinda is weird. It has a obvious pink color when its supposed to be a lip balm. Its like a lip gloss which has a visible color on it. Otherwise this product is perfect for moisterising and protecting your lips!!!</li>
            <li> I like it but it comes off with an odd pink tint that I wasn&#x27;t expecting. Other than that, it shipped well and I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend:)</li>
            <li> I love just about anything made by Maybelline, so I was overly ecstatic to find this product cheaper here then in the stores. the shipping was fast, less then a week and the company was great with providing tracking information. The lip balm itself works wonders, especially during the fall/winter, has a light tinted pink color, to give you the \\&quot;pout\\&quot; lip look and has a tasty smell as well. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter and she was very pleased with the flavor and the pink tint.  She is a fan of this lip balm.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love the taste, this lip balm moisturizes and supplies a perfect shade of pink on the lips. Extra lip color is not necessary!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more of a shiny-glossy lip than color. it is light pink shade of a color. a little boring on gloss but it is pretty though.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, love it!</li>
            <li> This smells absolutely wonderful. It actually smells like pink punch.  You will be licking your lips all the time so you may have to re-apply often. There is a slight colour- not too bright or noticeable. It definitely keeps your lips very soft. It is just as advertise- a balm, not glossy at all. I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> i haver darker skin so I was hesitant on the &amp;#34;pink punch&amp;#34; but it works perfectly. It&#x27;s a great color just apply more if you want a darker color. Perfect mixture of chapstick, gloss, and lipstick. Its a little on the pink side but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> I like this color. If you don&#x27;t overuse it, you have a nice, more subtle pink. I don&#x27;t use it to moisturize. Just for color.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, great price, recognizable brand. No regrets about my purchase.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great and fast but this product didn&#x27;t make or keep my lips moist or soft or anything promised. In fact it made my lips dry after applying. However, It did give my lip a tint. But it must constantly be reapplied. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again. Im Better off getting a Chapstick.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty pink color but I don&#x27;t find it super moisterizing. I like other lip treatments better. If your lips aren&#x27;t too chapped, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I love a bright pink lipstick, but it always leaves my lips dry. Lip balm never has a great color, but the Baby Lips Lip Balm is the best of both worlds! I get a lush, bright bubble gum pink, and moisturized lips with a single swipe! The colors last for hours and my lips feel moisturized for half the day. The size is perfect to put in my pocket for quick trips out for errands or into my small purse during a night out. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more in a few different shades.</li>
            <li> I adore this lip balm. I was so excited to receive this. it smells awesome and when I put it on my lips WOAH! it&#x27;s so super soft and smooth! BEST lip cosmetic ever and it has a color to it. but it still goes on smooth!</li>
            <li> Baby Lips are all the rage right now in my daughter&#x27;s preteen age group. Like a tinted lip moisturizer without looking like lipstick on a young girl.</li>
            <li> I love Baby Lips.  It gives my lips some color and keeps them hydrated at the same time.  I love that it&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this and was kinda unsure of it but once I got it, I loved it. It feels so nice on my lips and the color is like a barbie pink but not too bright.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice color. Very moisturizing. It makes your lips look like baby lip color and it stays on for a long long time.</li>
            <li> it was a gift to grandaughter</li>
            <li> Vibrant color where it happens to stick. It really is a balm, but the color can clump in areas that are more dry or creased.&lt;br /&gt;However, if one puts on a balm or base prior to use, the color evens out. The pigmentation is great, but if you want something over-the-top bold, this isn&#x27;t the product to go for.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm! It smells good and leaves my lips soft and with a pretty pink tint. From now on I will always get this!!</li>
            <li> I oove baby lips. It goes on so smooth and smells soooo good. I haven&#x27;t tried the other colors but after this now i&#x27;m forsure going to.</li>
            <li> This is such a great lip balm! It goes on very smooth &amp; it stays on really well. I got this because I wanted a pop of pink on my lips &amp; this does it! It is just enough for attention but not enough that makes you look like a clown like other colors. This one &amp; the clear Quench are my favorites! This also helps so much during the winter because my lips get so chapped so it&#x27;s great to have moisturized lips &amp; with some color too. I highly recommend this one if you want that just right, almost natural, looking pop of pink on your lips!</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast and it was great quality! Will definitely be ordering more of this product soon! ! ! :)</li>
            <li> I love the color (and taste) of this lip balm, plus it really does hydrate. Many lip products say they do, but don&#x27;t. This is like Christmas for my lips! Color doesn&#x27;t last as long as a stain, but I don&#x27;t mind reapplying this because it feels so good!</li>
            <li> Love the color! Love the feel! It really does make your lips baby soft! Definitely ordering more in all shades!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Very good color and quality.  Very good purchase.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Love amazon.  Love Maybelline.</li>
            <li> i really love baby lips! it really moist for your lips and at the same time it gives your lips naturally color. and it smells good</li>
            <li> My lip are so soft right now.  and it only took just a couple of days. simply fantastic ! !</li>
            <li> The Pink Punch color is a nice, subtle, girly pink. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week, and I&#x27;ve already received so many compliments on the color that I&#x27;m tempted to try the other colors as well! The color is kind of light but easily buildable. It feels mildly moisturizing, like a light chapstick but with noticeable color. It fades after an hour or two, unfortunately, but I slip it into my pocket or keep it at my desk at work and reapply often. I also really love the bright tropical scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 4/5 because it fades quickly, but these are so darn inexpensive that it really doesn&#x27;t matter that much to me. I&#x27;ll be stocking up for sure!</li>
            <li> With the Maybelline New York Baby Lips, my lips are soft &amp; baby pink! I love this product, its my go to lip balm.</li>
            <li> Leaves lips smooth and has a wonderful flavor.</li>
            <li> really did not care for this one that much it was not what I thought it would be so I gave it to my nieces I knew that they would love it</li>
            <li> These are ok, that&#x27;s all just ok. My favorite is the egg shaped lip balm. I just ordered these to have something to reach free s/h.  I will not ever purchase this item again. feels &amp; smells nice for a little while! To me its nothing special. Just the name!</li>
            <li> I love lip gloss and lipstick this is nice mix of both when you are on the go. The color is nice and moisturizes great.</li>
            <li> Baby lips for sure!!! I&#x27;ve tried everything g from expensive to cheap this by far beats all of them!!!!!!!! Will not use any other</li>
            <li> I have a friend who loves this product.  I purchased this for her and it was a new flavor.  She says she loves it.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this so bad and we look allover and couldn&#x27;t find it until we came a cross it on Amazon.. It is the best lip moisturizing balm so far that&#x27;s out their. It smells so good :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks..</li>
            <li> the feel of the gloss is ok but i wasnt crazy about the color, this is my fault b/c i picked the color but it is just a little too pink for me other than that it stays on well and isnt gummy feeling like other glosses.</li>
            <li> the color is a bit lighted than what i expected, i like how it feels when you apply it to your lips, its not sticky and its light. I still use it but i mixed with a lip gloss to difusse the colors and make it pop a little bit more</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline&#x27;s Baby Lips line, but didn&#x27;t know you could get it at any local major retail or grocery store for a cheaper price than what you can get online here, especially when you factor in shipping costs. Baby Lips line at the store offers about 10 more varieties, colors, and colorless options. I highly recommend this product, it does make your lips softer and I love the way it feels. It does last a long time too! I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of this particular color though. It was a lot brighter than what I thought it would be, as I thought since these are more chapsticks than lipsticks, I thought the color would be more subtle. It&#x27;s not quite. I got a couple of the colorless options and I love those even more!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone .</li>
            <li> I got the pink punch and peach kiss. It was an add on item, so it came pretty quickly along with other stuff. The pink punch smells AMAZING, and the Peach kiss a an okay smell. Unlike the other colors, pink punch is really opaque. It seems like a light lipstick almost. Peach kiss has a more natural color, and its more sheer. They feel really &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; when I apply it to my lips for some reason, but rubbing my lips together evens out the color and feels better. overall, i like the Pink punch better, but if you dont care about the scent and youre looking for a natural color, I&#x27;d say the peach kiss is great.</li>
            <li> Love it. Nice and pink but not too flashy.</li>
            <li> I have never tried these Baby Lips before....guess I though they were more for teenagers. But on whim I bought one in Pink Punch; and I have to say I love it: the smell, the color is very nice; and best of all it works!!  Bye bye chap stick!  I&#x27;m gonna be ordering some more Baby Lips.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old sister loved this as a stocking stuffer. I liked that it looked like lipstick so she could pretend with her older sisters.</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance and i like how it makes my dry lips feel lol. but i didnt realize it had color. i like to cake on my lip balms and even with a thin layer, this balm left a very bright and noticeable pink on my lips. its not like lipstick but its pretty good for a regular day out to feel extra girly!</li>
            <li> love love love. all maybeline products but this was phenomenal! my lips are thanksfull. i will re purchased in a few months</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY pink ..like barbie pink .....Can&#x27;t use it all the time</li>
            <li> Kinda dried out my lips and left me with this gross pink residue on my lips</li>
            <li> I was looking for a slightly tinted moisturizing stick and thought this would be a good product. It wasn&#x27;t moisturizing at all, it did the opposite for me and actually dried out my lips. The pink was way too pink on me and didn&#x27;t work. I did like the smell and taste, but I would not buy it again or recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm. Its tinted so you get a little pop from it which is prefect for the days you don&#x27;t want to wear a lot of make up or keeping simple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute product to buy. I&#x27;m a girl so I love lip glosses. The color was as expected, though it didn&#x27;t really look good on me so I ended up giving it away. But I liked the scent.</li>
            <li> I really like that this lip balm leaves a pale pink color on the lips, baby pink kind of color :) Perfect for office hours.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented! I don&#x27;t know about the claims that they moisturize your lips, though. But this does work well as far as lip color is concerned.</li>
            <li> These are never in the stores when I go so I was pleased when I finally recieved this in the mail :) I use it everyday in the mornings, but you have to re-apply it often.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for myself a few months ago and loved how it made my lips feel.  At Christmas, I bought it for my little girl for her stocking.  She absolutely loves it!  She gets to be a big girl and put lipstick on, but it&#x27;s just a hint of color so it isn&#x27;t too much for a little one to play with. She now puts it on every day before she leaves the house.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not offer 8 hours of moisture, more like 8 minutes. I was constantly reapplying. Great strategy over at maybelline. The more I have to use it, the quicker I go through the product, the more product I buy. Wrong! I didn&#x27;t even get a third of the way through before I switched back to Nivea, A Kiss Of Shimmer. Which actually does what Baby Lips advertises AND has spf in it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time on this product. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize and it doesn&#x27;t make your lips smooth. For what it does (nothing) it&#x27;s not worth the price tag either. It feels like a cheap play makeup lip balm.</li>
            <li> I needed a lipgloss that was subtle for work but perky. This is definitely perfect. I recommend it if you still want to look spunky, but professional.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive tinted balm and bought this hoping for something ah-mazing, but was disappointed. My lips aren&#x27;t normally super dry, they&#x27;re occasionally dry when I am really dehydrated. Not long after application my lips felt drier than prior to application. There is a noticeable tint from the lip balm which is why I didn&#x27;t give this 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, which is definitely part of the appeal and I know many did like this product and that awesome, but this just wasn&#x27;t for me... I&#x27;ll stick to my chubby stick.</li>
            <li> The lip balm is nourishing and its odor is great and sweet !!! I recommend it to little girl or teenager to use. The color is cute!</li>
            <li> This balm is moisturizing, smells good and is inexpensive. The problem? It&#x27;s BRIGHT opaque pink. All the other tinted balms I&#x27;ve ever owned have always been kind of sheer so I wasn&#x27;t worried when I saw the bright pink color in the package. However, it looks like you smeared Pepto Bismol on your lips - and if your lips are at all chapped, the color doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly at all. I have been using it with a clear gloss to calm down the color, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I will likely try the clear variety next time!</li>
            <li> I like that this is sort of like a lipstick, but really a chapstick. I have a medium/tan skin tone and this has a slight pink hue (not too much) so it gives me enough color to notice against my darker skin, but not clown-like. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Baby lips is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t NEED to be applied more than once, but it&#x27;s so addicting you will feel the need to be constantly applying it.</li>
            <li> I love baby lips. This one smells so good and is a very pretty pink.</li>
            <li> This color makes your face dim. And the lip balm doesn&#x27;t spread well on your lips. It is clustered. Wouldn&#x27;t choose it again.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a little too &amp;#34;barbie-esque&amp;#34; and pink, but if you just put one coat on it, it&#x27;s just a nice pink.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 3 star because the product does dry your lips &amp; it doesn&#x27;t have the best ingredients.</li>
            <li> Nope, wrong. It&#x27;s great though, and I&#x27;m actually wearing it right now, but wow is it super pink. :P Very, very bright bubblegum pink.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, as she has dry lips and is obsessed with chapstick. Great product but I didn&#x27;t realize that it was tinted. My daughter looked like she was wearing clown makeup, it was actually quite hilarious but nonetheless a pain to clean up.</li>
            <li> Love it. Definitely makes lips soft. I wear it all the time. Nice pink color not too dark or light. I wear it even when i don&#x27;t go out because it does make lips soft. I wear it alone.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. Goes on so smooth, feels great on my lips, adds a very small amount of color to your lips. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love Baby Lips lip balm - hate this color...</li>
            <li> I wear this lip balm with my HG pink lipstick- Maybelline Color Sensational in Make Me Pink and together they are perfection. I am obssessed with this product. The color is very pretty and it goes on smoothly. I grab this when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing a lip gloss on top of my lipstick but want a little bit of a shine. This is definitely going to my &amp;#34;Repeat Purchase&amp;#34; stash. Love it love it love it!</li>
            <li> VERY GLAD WITH THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> Loved it but it crumbled so easily.</li>
            <li> The color is really cute and I love it, but it does NOT last long! It&#x27;s not &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; either... it seems to dry my lips more than anything. I&#x27;ve tried putting it on over some chap stick which helps a little but not much. I would not purchase this again... much better products out there.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this lip balm. It has just a little bit of color and light enough I will let my 10 year old wear it too.</li>
            <li> great for everyday use. not too pink. my 8 year old daughter likes to wear it too and its the perfect tint to not look like lipstick</li>
            <li> I put this on all times of day to moisturize. It has a slight pink undertone color to it. Great for moisturizing</li>
            <li> Pink punch is a great lip balm whenever I have dry lips and it also gaves you the the pretty color like a Barbie pink color its really pretty and it makes me feel girly and its cheap like 2.99 at wlmart</li>
            <li> A fun moisturizing lip gloss that makes my lips bright pink while keeping them supple without ever making them sticky. A serious upgrade from my usual cherry Chapstick. I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
            <li> yea ahaha... it melts really fast. stains your lips. but its a pretty color. came fast</li>
            <li> Smells nice but not as hydrating as I would expect. Turns out it also tinted my lips slightly which was unexpected but nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, you have to use a lot or the color tends to fade sometimes</li>
            <li> My little sister and I have been nagging my mom to by us Baby lips. She wasen&#x27;t sure which ones we wanted, so she got, Pink Punch, Cherry Me, And Peppermint. When I got mine, (Cherry Me) I immediatly put it on, but my sister waited until we were done shopping at Walmart. When she put it on, her lips were bright pink, and (like Lady Xeona said on Youtube) looked like she ate a box of hot pink crayons. I snickerd which brought attetion to my mom who confiscated it and gave her Peppermint instead. I would recomend this to people (like my mom) with dark lips so they won&#x27;t give you the pink greasy look.</li>
            <li> This is not moisturizing. This has got to be the most misleading name for a product ever.  Garbage.  Buy the EOS balm instead</li>
            <li> When I first heard about Maybelline&#x27;s Baby Lips, I was curious, to say the least, and a little skeptical. I was at Target one day and decided to purchase two of them -- Pink Punch and Peach Kiss. I was immediately drawn to them because of their bright and fun colors. They reminded me of my childhood love for Lisa Frank products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each one was about $3-4 (I know Walmart sells them cheaper), so I didn&#x27;t really have high hopes. However, the Baby Lips exceeded my expectations. Not only do they give a great pop of color (the Pink Punch is really pretty, a little bold and kind of reminds me of Mac&#x27;s Viva Glam Gaga lipstick, depending on how much you put on; Peach Kiss is much more subtle and looks great with a bronzed/smoky eye look), but they glide on your lips! They make my lip feels super moisturized and stay on my lips until I feel the need to wipe them off because I need to eat something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried more expensive products, most recently the EOS lip balm, and was not nearly as impressed with those products as I am with Baby Lips. At such a low price, I will definitely be repurchasing more of these cute lip balms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who says price is everything? This shows that you don&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg for a great, attractive and moisturizing lip product! Thank you, Maybelline, for making such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love these because they just have a slight tint. This is great for my young daughter. I also like it for me when I don&#x27;t want to wear lipstick but just need a little color. My sister says it makes her lips feel dryer after a few minutes. It&#x27;s not super moisturizing, but I prefer other products for that anyway.</li>
            <li> I love this tinted chapstick. The pink is very vibrant, but it is also very moisturizing. I&#x27;ve become very addicted to these Baby Lips lip balms! I tried out the Revlon Lip Butters and I did not like those because it was more like a lipstick to me. I guess my lips don&#x27;t deal well with lipsticks, but these Baby Lips are perfect!</li>
            <li> So i recieved this product in the mail 2 or 3 days ago and ive used it for some time now. I would have to say it isnt that moisterizing however, if your looking for a pink nicki minaj lipstick this is good for you. I didnt know it gave of color but it gives of a fair amount of pink. The packaging was a brown bag kinda..in its regular packaging which i was ok with so overal this was an good purchase.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, gives good amount of color, literally GLIDES on, package is cute, pretty pink shade, doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips, and SMELLSSS AMAZING! love it way more than my revlon lip butters. :)</li>
            <li> I love lipbalms, lip glosses, lip sticks, lipstains, etc. So when I heard about this product I figured I might as well try it out. I heard good reveiws on it from friends and in some of the beaty blogs and magazines I read. When I opened it up it was bigger than expected, I put it on and it smelled pretty good except it did have a tiny bit of a makeupy smell (kind of hard to explain, but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant)it smelled kind of like a fruit punch/strawberry smell, so if you don;t like that it might not be the product for you! It did have a kind of taste to it but I only notice it when I first put it on. It has a very lip balmy feeling, it&#x27;s kind of \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; like how Burts Bees feels on your lips, again, not unpleasant. It stays on very a pretty long time. It also hase a very vibrant pink color, but at the same time I am VERY pale (sometimes people ask me if I&#x27;m feeling alright or if I need to sit down like they think I&#x27;m going to faint!) so, people who have a darker skin tone it might either be way too bright or just a nice pinky color. Even if you have darker lips, (I have very light colored lips) it might not be so pink. Even if you are like me and have a very pale skin tone it just looks like you have a bright lipstick on, not like you&#x27;re from the Capitol (Hunger Games anyone?)So overall I think this is a good prodcut that does what it&#x27;s advertised to do. I would buy it again even though it is kind of cakey, but it makes my lips so soft so in my opinion it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I will admit I was hesitant to get Baby Lips Balm up b/c of the brightly colored tint and no apparent, revolutionary formula differentiating it from every other lip balm. After seeing a Maybelline commercial advertising the balm and hearing tons of raving reviews, I gave in and ordered the Pink Punch. It arrived a few days early and is surprisingly a really decent balm! It isn&#x27;t sticky, it provides immediate moisture and it lasts a fair amount of time. Given I have a very fair skin tone, the tint is noticeable but just one swipe is all I need so I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking too Gaga.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Maybelline Baby Lips--they are moisturizing and add a hint of color.  The Pink Punch is a light baby pink, and it smells so good, like candy!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to chapstick/lip gloss. I love lip gloss for the color and shine, but I don&#x27;t like the stickiness. So I prefer tinted chapstick or lip balm, like this one. I bought two shades; Pink Punch and Peach Kiss. Both work great, though I prefer the shade of Peach Kiss to this one. I have a pale lip color, so it comes out super pink sometimes, sort of making me look like I&#x27;m going to an 80&#x27;s party. This only happens some of the time, mostly when I reapply it throughout the day. I still really like this product. The Peach Kiss shade looks better with my natural lip color, but both are fantastic items, as they provide soft lips and I only need to reapply every few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I posted this review yesterday, then today found a website where I can look up how &#x27;hazardous&#x27; a product is, meaning how toxic the ingredients are. This product ranks between moderate and high hazard. I&#x27;m trying to get away from using so many toxin in my make-up, so I won&#x27;t be buying this again. Though for those that don&#x27;t care about toxins or unnatural products, it&#x27;s still a good item!</li>
            <li> I just got this lip balm in my mailbox today and used it today. So far i love the consistency of it,it applies sooo smooth its unbelievable. I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky goopy film on your lips once it gets old (or has been on your lips for awhile) I don&#x27;t really think it lasts 8 hours since i reapplied after about 3. But its better then a lot of lip balms I have now. The color payoff is also a great touch, sheer like a just drank colored juice look. I like it so far</li>
            <li> I really love this product it gives me color and moisture to my lips I use it all the time, it is starting to get cold so my lips start chapping but with this product they stay soft and smooth the more i use it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this would be so pink! It&#x27;s was way too pink for my lips and I ended up letting my 7 year old daughter have it for dress up makeup. I do like the feel of it though. Just not this color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say this is the worst lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used.  The balm itself in my opinion is too large, not like your typical chap stick.  The item as a whole reminds me of something sold for a nine year old, like its a dress-up toy.  I have no idea why Maybelline would produce such a cheap product, not at all impressed, just let down.  Boo Hoo Maybelline!  Still love you Amazon:)</li>
            <li> This lip balm is amazing. I love all of the baby lips, but the purple one is just a little dark for my skin tone. These are definitely the best lip balms that you can get, because they are nothing like chapstick, and they actually stay on your lips for 4 hours without having to reapply every 10 minutes. I love this color because you can wear it lightly every day, or you can cake it on for nice events, and it always looks nice :) This is my favorite one, because the color is great, and it smells SOOO good. It would be best on light and medium-skinned people. But it can really fit to anyone (Unlike peach kiss, grapevine, and cherry). So try it. It is amazing :)</li>
            <li> highly recommend this lip balm! Goes on and stays in place for hours, no bleeding, no smearing. Stays where you put it. Love this color!!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty into the Baby Lips products Maybelline makes - I have the pink punch and cherry colors. The baby pink is a very pretty, subtle color, and when it goes on your lips feel super smooth. The only downside is that the color (or soft feeling) doesn&#x27;t last too long, so you need to reapply often. For the price point, it&#x27;s a great product though!</li>
            <li> It was just what was looking for. Perfect light pink and very moisturizing! It&#x27;s not as bright as it looks</li>
            <li> Baby Lips is my favorite lip product. I own three different flavors of it and love them all. Great deal on these too!</li>
            <li> A hint of pink and so lush on the lips. I will be back to get a couple more. Great lip balm!</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used! I&#x27;ve only ever used the Quenched (which is my favorite) and the peach kiss which I wasn&#x27;t too fond of. The quenched one leaves my lips SUPER soft. It gives it just the right amount of shine and it makes my lips look plump and beautiful! I love it! I recommend the quenched flavor for all!</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips moisturised for a very long time.  Keeps lipstick on all day when used before applying lipstick. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Cheap product. Not was I was expecting</li>
            <li> Must have if you want some pink to your lips.  These are amazing, like chap stick but not - I need them all!</li>
            <li> Baby lips are great for softening your lips while giving you a pop of color. One of my favorite beauty gurus online recommended baby lips so I bought this and a couple other colors and I like them all. I worried this one was going to be too bright but as long as I don&#x27;t cake it on it&#x27;s really not at all, even for a fair skinned person like myself!</li>
            <li> I love tinted lip balms. I like the moisture of this product--it&#x27;s not an intense repairing balm, but certainly isn&#x27;t drying. The color looked pretty on my fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe how disgusting this product smells! The color is \\&quot;pink punch,\\&quot; but I didn&#x27;t know that meant that it would smell like fruit punch gone bad. It seriously smells like Hi-C pink punch, and I couldn&#x27;t stand it. I know some people really like artificially fruity scents, but they make me gag for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for moisture, packaging, price, and color.&lt;br /&gt;-3 stars because the smell makes it unwearable (and umbearable haha) in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the way her lips feel with this product and the smell is very pleasing as well. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I have severely chapped lips in the winter and I&#x27;ve tried everything. My lips were so chapped I kept getting mutiple cold sores every winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was skeptical of this product but decided to give it a try. Between this and an occasional swipe of vasolene with coco butter my lips have been so so much better. This really does a good job moisturizing. I do apply it pretty often. My only complaint about the pink punch is that the color is a little overwhelming on my pale skin. It looks like pale frosy pink lipstick that can look super out of place without other makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peach is my favorite flavor. It&#x27;s got a nice light color and smells great. I also like the cherry. It gives your lips a glossy pink/red look. Over all I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks my lips are so amazingly soft and moisturized. I just bought two more -  Melon Mania and Pink Wink. I love the sheer color of all three of them and the balm itself is so smooth and the perfect consistency for me. It&#x27;s not sticky at all and has just the right amount of shine and color to it and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering flavor either. I don&#x27;t have one single complaint about Baby Lips other than the fact that I don&#x27;t yet have it in every color and flavor. My lips get so chapped in the winter normally and since I&#x27;ve been using this, I haven&#x27;t had chapped lips at all! Exactly the opposite, in fact. And at this price, I&#x27;ll probably end up with one of each and then two or three of each of my favorites. Did I mention I&#x27;m hopelessly addicted to lip balm? And that makes me a pretty tough critic to please. Haha.</li>
            <li> This order arrived with two of my other orders and was shipped out and delivered on time if not earlier! Baby lips is cool because its, small, it&#x27;s a lip balm, and it has fragrance and color! I would recommend anyone to buy this and some of the other baby lips products!</li>
            <li> This lip balm seems to be hard to find.  Amazon made it super easy.  Nice lip balm. Not heavy or sticky at all and it has a nice light tint.  Leaves your lips soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Baby Lips is moisturizing, stylish, and it works. But make sure you do NOT lather it on. Even a little bit leaves behind a bright pink color, so unless you want to look like a stripper, try not to put it on too often. If you want a good lip balm that doesn&#x27;t leave color behind, try this color: [[ASIN:B004Y9M0YM Maybelline New York Baby Lips Moisturizing Lip Balm, Peppermint, 0.15 Ounce]]  It goes on clear and gives you minty breath too!</li>
            <li> The balm goes on very silky and smooth. The pink color goes on lighter than expected which is very good as when I first saw it I was concerned as it has a very plastic/pink color. The color fades quickly but my lips stay smooth for a very long time. I am happy with this purchase. Also, it is great if I want a tint of color with my lip balm. I did not give it 5 stars as the color does fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> The color is very pink.  With my dry lips I like to reapply the product, but can&#x27;t without putting a ton of this color on my lips</li>
            <li> When I purchased this balm, I was expecting my lips to look a more natural color of pink. However, when I applied it for the first time, my lips were literally neon pink! I can never wear this lip balm in public! Maybe in the summer it won&#x27;t look as bad, but I still don&#x27;t think I can even wear it in the summer its so bright. The color is literally like the little kid lip stick you were excited to wear when you were like 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I would not recommend this particular baby lips, I would recommend all the others! The all smell and taste great and the colors all look much better!</li>
            <li> This balm is really nice and has a great tinted color to it.&lt;br /&gt;I carry around in my pocket and reapply when needed. Seems to stay on for a long time, and is not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth $3.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs to own at least on baby lips lip balm I love this stuff and it works really well. My little cousin even uses it and she is one who really like anything that makes her look girly but she said it give her the perfect amount of color and makes her lips feel good!</li>
            <li> It has a really gross and awkward consistency. It&#x27;s almost chalky. I was very disappointed since it was supposed to be moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m a dark skin girl and i didn&#x27;t know this lip balm will make my lips very bright pink, so i apply just a little enough to not make me look like a clown but besides that, i absolutely love it, taste wonderful too!</li>
            <li> I love baby lips! It makes your lips feel so smooth and it adds on a shine to your lips.</li>
            <li> I will not recommend this lip balm for cracked/dry lips. It does not smooth out easily. If you want an inexpensive lipstick with a bit color every now and then, it might be for you. For this money, don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> Baby lips has done it again! Yet another fantastic product! Smells like fruit punch and leaves a nice pink tint, not too over the top though</li>
            <li> &gt;I&#x27;m using my father&#x27;s account to right this review haha.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product yesterday at my local Target for full price at $3.99, and have to say I&#x27;m quite impressed. I was expecting something of lower quality, but this met all of my requirements. This lip/chap stick (I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a mixture of both) moisturized my lips from the moment I put it on. However, the moment I needed to reapply that moisturizing sensation totally left my lips. In previous ads I&#x27;ve seen for the product, it says it moisturizes the lips and gives off a lasting effect, which it does not. Plus, you do have to reapply often. Aside from this, while the casing is adorable, it&#x27;s cheaply made. I am just waiting for the plastic covering to crack in my purse. That being said, I&#x27;ve tried to keep it in my pocket but I&#x27;m at a loss on what to do if it does crack. The color however, is very pigmented which I didn&#x27;t expect. It&#x27;s basically a Barbie pink. I don&#x27;t mind this, but it&#x27;s definitely not like the pictures. A little of this lip balm really goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product as an on-the-go lip balm. It doesn&#x27;t last long, and you have to reapply often but I wouldn&#x27;t say anymore than other $3.99 lip balms. At the low price, it wouldn&#x27;t break your wallet to try it out.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is incredibly, shockingly pink when you first put it on, and not very hydrating.  However, if you work the product into your lips a lot, it turns into a very flattering shade and makes your lips incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> This Moisurizer is the best moisurizer I&#x27;ve ever own!!! It goes on your lips really smooth it does make your lips a little more pink soo... Most moisurizer don&#x27;t have the greatest smell but this moisrizer lip balm dosen&#x27;t it really dosen&#x27;t have a smell.I Bought this item at my normal drug store it was the same price except no shipping and handlying so I&#x27;d recomend getting it from your normal drug store just to be cheaper though. :) Hope you enjoy it just as much as I do!!! &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> very moisturizing and fun. I also love the pink tint and how long it lasts.....shipping was quick and easy&lt;br /&gt;affordable and worth the buy</li>
            <li> Color looks MUCH different than picture.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how my lips feel after using this, but I have to reapply so often! I used mine up in two weeks. $4 for a lip balm that only lasts 2 weeks just isn&#x27;t worth it to me. I probably won&#x27;t be getting this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews on products, but I am behind this one 100 percent. I had a problem with dry, cracked, bleeding, unattractive, and unhealthy lips, I have tried everything from Vaseline to different lip glosses, balms, sticks, and everything in that order. It would leave my lips in a condition that&#x27;s even worse than before. My lips would peel and feel like it&#x27;s been in a shredder machine. It was a painful experience and besides, every woman wants gorgeous and sexy-soft lips. Especially being 24 years old. So, I kept seeing the Maybelline commercials on the \\&quot;Baby Lip Balm\\&quot;. I remember saying, \\&quot;Aw not another false advertisement for a product that might not be worth it for the price.\\&quot; I thought coming from a major line, it was going to be expensive. One day walking in a Kroger Supermarket, I came across it and saw that it was like 3.49. I realized, 3.49?, I paid up in the hundreds over the years for the right remedy. So what did I have to lose? I gave it a try and I&#x27;ve been using it every since. For 2 months it has worked wonders. My lips are as healthy as it has EVER been! I even noticed a natural glow to them. I am glad my curiosity got the best of me this time. I am a faithful user and I can say that for me it is heaven sent. I wear it by itself, but sometimes I put it under or over my lipstick. It stays on all day. I might reapply once if I eat and sometimes it even stays on then. My lips loves it and the colors are pretty. I have this one and the Cherry. I will be trying the other colors. The whole thing lasted me 2 months and still lasting til this day. I recommend anyone to try it. Trust me, if it wasn&#x27;t worth it, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time writing about it. I keep it 100. This product is a must! Though everybody is different, so what worked for me, may not work for someone else. Also you have to give it a few weeks to really see the results you&#x27;re looking for. It took a month for me.</li>
            <li> Its too pinky for me... doesn&#x27;t look great on me... so I use it during bedtime only.... great moisturizer though</li>
            <li> Love it, carry it with me everywhere! Shimmery, but not overwhelming ya know? just perf! Be sure to get this product!</li>
            <li> love my baby lips. great price for the value of the item. works as advertised. would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I think this lip moisturizing balm is fine, but mainly for the color, not for the moisturizing part. The moisturizing in this product isn&#x27;t BAD it&#x27;s just nothing special, that&#x27;s all. It has a nice pink color that you can build up to for a more brighter barbie pink look if you want, or just wear a subtle layer for a bit of color. If you are looking for a moisturizing balm alone I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this but if you just want to try a lip color and don&#x27;t want to jump straight into lipstick, then this is a great compromise.</li>
            <li> My teen daugher loves the baby lips.  Keeps her lips soft and moist and adds a nice touch of color to her lips.  Color is soft and subdued, appropriate for a teen girl.  Amazon was the best price.  In stores, sell for $5.99.</li>
            <li> This makes my lips feel sooo smooth. It does have a color to it but my lips are dark enough that it is not obvious that the lip balm is tinted. It smells so yummy</li>
            <li> This lip balm is VERY pigmented. I&#x27;m very pale so one swipe of this leaves my lips bright pink. It looks exactly the same as the pictures of the models wearing the product. It&#x27;s also very creamy and the color last for hours. &lt;3 &lt;3</li>
            <li> Nice product, came on time. Has a nice pink tone to it.</li>
            <li> Great product! My teenage daughter likes it a lot!</li>
            <li> Smooth texture and great flavor/scent!</li>
            <li> its not moisturizing at all and the color is a faded pastel/neon pink , ewwww!!! it makes my lips look like they faded into my skin !!!  not good</li>
            <li> This is such a great valve and product. It is a really good lip balm with a fruit scent and light taste. I also love the color this makes my lips. I&#x27;m gonna have to buy more of these if different colors!</li>
            <li> Makes lips soft and supple</li>
            <li> Very sheer color, which is okay with me. Makes my lips kissably soft.</li>
            <li> The colors are true and actually more opaque than I thought they&#x27;d be.  Actually I bought several of the lighter shades thinking they would be more on the sheer side.  The only thing is I think I might have a pigment allergy to them which causes my upper lip to become dry and scaly.  But I just back off on use a bit.  These go on very moist and feel great going on.  Good for mixing colors with other lipsticks to change the shade a bit.</li>
            <li> love it product just as described. Nothing wrong got it fast as well. will order again. I would suggest this to my friends and family</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the Barbie pink color, but it is surprisingly very wearable. It&#x27;s incredibly pigmented for a lip balm, so I almost treat it like a lipstick. Because it&#x27;s so pigmented, I wear about one coat on my lips, and I ALSO use it as blush! As it turns out, it has a LOVELY sweet pink color on the cheeks, and it looks very natural. I just swipe it one or two times on the apples of my cheeks and blend in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Maybelline never discontinues this product. The only drawback is that it looks really bad on chapped lips, because the product latches onto dead skin. Ever since I got mine in the mail, I&#x27;ve been exfoliating my lips daily in order to wear this color!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS NEW LINE FROM MAYBELINE! THESE LIP BALMS ARE TINTED JUST RIGHT TO GIVE YOU THE MOISTURE YOU NEED IN YOUR LIPS AND NOT LOOK LIKE YOU HAVENT DONE ANYTHING WITH YOURSELF! TINT OF THIS AND PEACH KISS ARE MY FAV</li>
            <li> People who complain about this probably have a very VERY light shade of lips. If you have very light pink lips, this is not for you (unless you like the pop of color). I really like this because it has the moisture AND the color. It&#x27;s perfect on my lips. I use it for casual or fun looks and days. I have normal colored lips; slightly more pink than usual. Anyways, I love it. Great if your lips are too dry for a matte lipstick, because this is really a two in one: chapstick and lipstick. I don&#x27;t love it though; I like it.</li>
            <li> Right price for a lip balm, doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips. But you have to reapply all the time. And after awhile, the taste of it started to wear on you. But would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is not as creamy as most lip balms and the color is awful. I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I like the product but it was a little more than what you can get it for at the store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for keeping my lips moistened and it gives them a cute pink shine! I love it! I really do :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It smooths your lips and has a nice color to it! . . . .</li>
            <li> I have never used a lip product as awful as the Maybelline Baby Lips. Ever. The formula is cheap and the color is day-glow trashy. My lips became drier with each use. I wish I did not give it a chance as I need treatment lip balm for my lips now after just a few months usage. Maybelline needs to pull this product asap or reformulate.</li>
            <li> great price for a lip balm, the shade of pink is very bright, good for a young girl, think bright pink bubble gum.</li>
            <li> It has a pink color that sits inbetween your chapped lips. It doesn&#x27;t have a natural color.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this nor the grape one. And I bet the lighter colors are worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this color only:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Maybelline-York-Moisturizing-Cherry-Ounce/dp/B004Y9H1QO/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_1</li>
            <li> This is so nice. I got my order early and I got it in perfect condition nothing wrong. the color shows up really nice and it has a nice good slightly strong scent I love it!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Why is Baby Lips so hard to find in the stores?  Because it&#x27;s pretty good, that&#x27;s why! Next time I order I&#x27;ll get five.</li>
            <li> I bought this product (Pink Punch) as a surprise for our 12 year old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) It is not the best moisturizer, so don&#x27;t count on it so much for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2)  It did not at first pass the Mommy and Daddy approval rating for appropriate makeup for our 12 year old.  Granted, this is subjective.  However, I want you to know that it&#x27;s a pretty vibrant pink.  My wife had our daughter blot this stuff until there was only the slightest smear left.  With just a trace of product, it was a gentle pink that looks great on our blossoming young daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the fifth star got knocked off because of the moisturizing issue.  However, if you are looking for a product that can go from very vibrant pink to (after lots of blotting) a blush of color, then this might be for you.</li>
            <li> I really like the moisture of the lip balm. If you&#x27;re looking for a little bit of a pop of color, this will do the trick. I got the pink punch. The only think I mainly don&#x27;t like is the lasting of it.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm. I am kind of OCD when it comes to applying chapstick/lip balm throughout the day and I always apply a lot. I realized with this balm that the pigmentation increases every time I retouch my lips. I used it like maybe 3 times in 3 hours and I got that like Niki Minaj pale pink color on my lips while feeling super moisturized at the same time. I have tan skin BTW...</li>
            <li> I had bought this to replace my usual super expensive makeup that I get from Sephora. Going back to school and being a single mother meant I had to budget somewhere; but honestly the quality of drugstore makeup made me want to go without rather than use their gross flavored, grainy textured, feathering lipsticks and lipglosses. However the cute packaging and reviews sold me on this product. I knew that if the baby pink color was too much I could blend it down with some of my other makeup that was left. Whenever it came in, I immediately tried it and found ALL of the reasons I hate drugstore makeup to not apply to this product. The color is super cute even on me (I usually have color issues because my lips are already very pink). I took off one star because it tends to feather a little when used on its own--however this can easily be remedied with a good, clear lip liner. I absolutely love it and intend on purchasing more Baby Lips shades.</li>
            <li> I really like this product- I own three different Baby Lips balms, this, the cherry flavor, and the peach.&lt;br /&gt;This one has a nice, *pop*-y color and it goes on very smooth. It moisturizes without stickiness and provides just a hint of pink without the stick mess that, to me, is lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But- It will not actually change the color or texture of your lips over time, other than keeping them hydrated, and, obviously, tinting them a nice bubblegum color. Still, I&#x27;d have bought it just for the attractive packaging- Baby Lips see-through tops and contrasting colors make this balm feel a cut above the rest even though it&#x27;s probably technically no better than a tinted chapstick- but I&#x27;m a sucker for good packaging.</li>
            <li> Need I say more!! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> cheep and moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;color is kinda fake if you put too much but just put a liitle bit is fine&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s ok for daily use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the absolute best balm I&#x27;ve ever tried, but I like it a lot, and especially for the price.  The color is subtle, which is nice.  I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> Niece loved it. . . . . .. . . . . . .. . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .ll . l.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing lip balm is smooth and hydrating. Wasn&#x27;t fond of the pink color, i was expecting more of a clear tint of pink, but this looks more like a frosted pink on the lips, not  for my coloring.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE LIPGLOSS BUT AT CVS AND WALMART IT HAS IT FOR WAYYYY LESS. BUT ITS PINK LIKE BARBIE BUT I WASNT REALLY LOOKING FOR THE COLOR</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have used. It moisturizes so well and looks great as well! It has a light pink tint to it and is really cute, it feels really nice and works great. It has cured my chapped lips just like the TV ad described. I am sold!</li>
            <li> I tried to buy this at the store but they were out of this color so I bought the cherry Baby lips instead and loved it.It provides a light color that can get darker by how much you use.Its not very moisturizing but still a great product.</li>
            <li> I like the color, but i don&#x27;t find it to be very moisturizing. i like something a little heavier as a lip balm.</li>
            <li> Shipment came fast. Love this lip balm. It is very creamy, feels great on your lips AND I love the color it gives to your lips. Great product. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I Really love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off to know where i am coming from, I do not wear make up often but I like a nice little pop of color that is subtle for everyday wear. When I go to school Its great to give me that color i need and the moisture as well.. For my skin though I tend to have more dry skin so the moisture went away faster than the amount of time described. But that would be my only negative reason to give it four stars/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that It is a great light product I love the color and it smells wonderful as well! I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> The product I like, has good quality and the price convinced me.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again if I need. THANK YOU</li>
            <li> My kid used this and it didn&#x27;t keep my lips moist. it ended up making her lips sticky. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again</li>
            <li> Wish it would stay on longer</li>
            <li> I had no problem with the lip balm.  I just wanted another color and flavor.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I really like these, and I have bought a few different &amp;#34;shades&amp;#34; and I use them all the time, and will continue to use them, however, the promise of smooth soft &amp;#34;baby lips&amp;#34; is not true. I always have to have something on my lips, chapstick, lipgloss, what have you, and my lips chap pretty easy, so it may work better for someone with lips that don&#x27;t chap as easy as mine. however, even though I do see a slight difference in my lips, they are not perfect my any means, perfect meaning that they are smooth like baby lips with out any chapping, I know mabey I am expecting to much, but that is just my opion on the product that I have been using for a few months now, however, I do like it, its smooth, and it does add a tint of color, kinda like a colored chapstick, and I will continue to use it, just don&#x27;t expect it to make your chapped lips healed completely.</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes my lips smooth. SUCH A CUTE COLOR on my lips. I barely wear any lip color, but I like how it appears as a mild lip stick without the stickiness... and I don&#x27;t always like wearing gloss. Love the color and smooths my lips, and it&#x27;s super inexpensive. Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2M4KKLFUUP9Q4]]As soon as I opened a package, I see this.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know where to send private msg, so I&#x27;m writing this on review page.&lt;br /&gt;could you send me a new one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
            <li> This smells really good and the color is perfect, I like having just a little something to keep my lips smooth yet still dry unlike lip gloss, Ew. It stays for maybe 30min-1hr but for the price it is worth it. I only bought this product so that I would get free shipping on all my orders XD but I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Baby Lips in Cherry Me but this is much more opaque and immediately settles into the vertical creases in the lips, looking like pepto-bismol stripes instead of even color. After a few minutes it also wears off the middle of the lip, leaving a hideous pink ring around your mouth. Maybe this shade is ok if you&#x27;re 16 but if you&#x27;re over 25 forget this color and try a different one.</li>
            <li> I love the shade it&#x27;s so pretty, but most importantly it keeps my lips moist and prevents them from getting chapped. It dose wear off easy though, which is why I am giving it a 4 star.</li>
            <li> My new favorite for everyday makeup.  Makes my lips feel super soft and moisturized.  The color is noticeable but subtle and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> The color is much more intense than I wanted it to be, but this is simply an amazing moisturizing lip balm</li>
            <li> This is a really super Maybelline product that makes your lips feel great, without being gloppy -- the kind of glop that makes strands of your hair stick to it. The color is not too intense with one swipe, but you can make it look really vibrant by applying extra. I just love the way it feels when you first apply it, and that feeling really does last for quite a while. For what it&#x27;s worth, the packaging is a cute and fun design. Pink Punch is a great color, and I am totally glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Love it&#x27;s nice color as lipstick I did not see any different in my lips in a matter of moisturizing but I love the color</li>
            <li> This is the third Baby Lips lip balm I&#x27;ve gotten from Amazon.  They really make your lips soft.  Unfortunately, my daughter took one of mine ... so now I need to get another one.</li>
            <li> Sheer color that gives a nice pick look without being too harsh. Makes lips SUPER soft. Smells amazing. Love this product! :)</li>
            <li> I knew the color would be a hot pink, which doesn&#x27;t work well with my skintone, but I was hoping I could make this color work.  No...I can&#x27;t really make this color work on its own.  But this thing smells amazing, it is the most pigmented out of the baby lips I own (Yummy Plummy, Coral Crush, Cherry Me), and it&#x27;s good to layer with if you want to amp up your lips and give your lipstick a neon undertone.</li>
            <li> Was looking for lipgloss that had just a hint of color that was comfortable to wear. This lipgloss is just what I was looking for.... moisturizers with soft color!</li>
            <li> I never have a problem with chapped lips. A few hours after applying this, I started to notice myself getting chapped lips. I stopped using it and it stopped. I started again and it started again. It definitely feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing your lips when you put it on (and that feels nice), but I just don&#x27;t think it really is. As far as color, the pink was too pink for my face. I wish there was a better way to see color when you buy online, but I know that&#x27;s difficult. I want red, but hate the taste of cherry. Since people said the color was faint and I liked the taste, I figured I&#x27;d try the pink punch. The flavor is wonderful but the pink shows up more than I expected. It&#x27;s not quite like lipstick and fades fast, but it&#x27;s definitely there.</li>
            <li> Feels really nice on my lips, keeps them from getting chapped. Only thing, the color didn&#x27;t look right on me. I usually get the cherry colored one and I wanted to try another. But I&#x27;ll leave this color to the cooler toned ppl.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm after it was recommended to be by a sorority sister. I love the color it gives my lips! It softens my lips pretty well, not as good as eos lip balms but much better than regular lip balms. Because it tints my lips will color while softening my lips I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> I really like it, but it comes off easy. Also didn&#x27;t know it was actually going I give you color so that was a little bonus.</li>
            <li> This gloss is soft and light and so moisterizing. I love the light pink tint that is just the slightest bit of flattering color, but I&#x27;ve been mostly surprised that it lasts a good long while on dry lips. This is my new go-to \\&quot;chapstick.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This stuff moisturizes great. I love this color in particular and have it on Amazon subscription delivery...I really hope Maybelline doesn&#x27;t discontinue this item any time soon.</li>
            <li> i love Maybelline Baby lips lip balm because I&#x27;ve proven it helps my very chapped lips and it made my lips so soft and smooth but i neded to reapply everytime i feel like it&#x27;s faded.this one i love because it has tint and smells good like mango!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! the pink comes out sheer, not as pink as the colour looks, great for everyday wash of colour,can also be used over or under some of your pinky lipsticks for more moisture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good pink tint.  I have just begun using them, so I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s helping my lips to be softer, less dry.  But I can say that the color doesn&#x27;t last for &amp;#34;8 hours&amp;#34;... it&#x27;s not a stain.  There is a slight fruit punch odor, but it&#x27;s not strong.  I prefer the darker colors because I feel the lighter ones sort of wash out my lips.  Honestly, these remind me of the &amp;#34;tinker bell&amp;#34; glosses you used to get when you were a preteen years ago.. and that&#x27;s gotta date me!  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> At one point I owned all of them. They took off after I began recommending them (LOL) so now some are harder to find. Maybelline has expanded the line with many more &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34; Some are clear, some with a little color, some with lots of creaminess. What can I say...I recommend every flavor. &amp;#34;Peach Kiss&amp;#34; is the creamiest and lasts the longest for me. I am one of those have-to-have-my-lip balm people. I would say either try one - or stock up, because you are going to love it and want more. No one has ever disliked them, instead thanked me, for passing on the word about Baby Lips. I sincerely hope you love them too.</li>
            <li> This baby lips doesn&#x27;t look good on anyone in my family. It is way too light and too bright</li>
            <li> I like the smell to it and the color, but it didn&#x27;t really moisturize my lips. It left it soft at first for a bit, but afterwards my lips turned dry and I had to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> I like the color, but it won&#x27;t keep very long time. But it&#x27;s OK. And the pictures on the case look very cute.</li>
            <li> The color is a little too &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; for me, for some reason I didn&#x27;t think it would be as dark. I didn&#x27;t feel as though it was very &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; either :(</li>
            <li> I love the Baby Lips collection.  The lip balms are smooth, go on easy, and give great color. This is my favorite shade.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;I Like the baby lips&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this product because is amaizin and I recommended the seller because the product came quickly.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this. It&#x27;s very smooth and initially feels very hydrating. It felt like a high end lip gloss combo lip balm with a sheer tint of color. So what&#x27;s the problem? Well, did you ever get little mini lip color sets for kids when you were a little girl? Do your lips ever get dry or rough spots? This stuff behaved like el cheapo little girl fake lip stick!!! Color pigments built up on the rough areas/around them. Talk about trashy looking! I am 37 years old and have tried lots of lip glosses. I will stick with my Dr. Pepper lip gloss when I want cheap lip gloss. Atleast that ha a beautiful natural flush to it and is truly moisturizing too.</li>
            <li> I am not a &amp;#34;bright colors&amp;#34; type of person, so when I got this lip moisturizer and realized that tinted MEANS tinted I was a little put off... then I actually wore it with some of my outfits that have the same color pink in them and wow- the color pop on my lips was complimentary (not crazy) and I loved it!  Also, I&#x27;ve found that after it wears off (which does take a while) it leaves your lips just a tad tinted, so even if you can&#x27;t reapply immediately you still have some color on your lips, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Pros: Soft and moisturizing, somewhat sheer color, portable size. Solid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: &amp;#34;PInk punch&amp;#34; is right! Nearly neon color and it&#x27;s got a major scent to it that reminds me of sugary lipgloss.</li>
            <li> this is a nice thing to always have in your purse. its like chapstick with alittle color. the scents they have smell good too. not too over powering.</li>
            <li> If you want a bit of color but lots of moisturizing power, this is the way to go! Makes lips look naturally plump and pink. PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing, no stay power, not good for dark lips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried another more cherry colored Baby Lips and liked that one a lot better.  The color was sheer and worked better with the lip balm like formula.  The color for this one is more opaque so you can end up with pretty streaky lips because the product doesn&#x27;t spread evenly on your lips.  I usually end up mixing this with a lipstick so the color is even.  I have dark lips so the streaky pink baby lips on its own is not cute.  Maybe if you have light colored lips the color distribution won&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> The color is like bright neon pink but other than that&#x27;s its a great lip balm just its florescent pink</li>
            <li> Very moisturising product, beautiful bright barbie doll pink colour and shows up on my dark, pigmented lips. LOVE this item!</li>
            <li> Smooth, very pink, and a little sheer. It also smells fruity and delicious. The pink is so pink that I have to admit that I don&#x27;t use this gloss every day, but I love it just the same.</li>
            <li> I live maybelline baby lips. It&#x27;s my favourite lip balm but this was the wrong colour for my chocolate complexion.</li>
            <li> This goes on nice and gives a pretty pink color to my lips.  I really like this line of lip moisturizer, but am concerned about unneeded chemicals.</li>
            <li> The product does soften and smooth dry lips, but the color is a bit bubble-gummie for my taste.  I would have preferred a more translucent pink.</li>
            <li> I loved this lip balm. Very nice color.I like that it give a cute shade of pink on the lips. I liked this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this one, so I ordered it for her as a stocking stuffer. She loves it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> My daughter seemed to like it but do not have verification of this. I have not seen her use it lately.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, very pink. If your lips are really dry it seeps into the cracks so I don&#x27;t recommend it for excessively dry lips.</li>
            <li> A little expensive for lip balm, but my wife wanted to try it, and I needed a small stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> If you want your lips to be the color of pink bubble gum, buy this! If you are looking for a subtle or soft shade of pink, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Baby lips works great for me. After i use it my lips are not just smooth but the colored ones make your lips tinted (Varies from color). It is very pigmented and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at my local wallmart and I heard many of my friends saying I&#x27;m so in love with this and I don&#x27;t agree! It doesn&#x27;t make a difference in the softness and it turns your lips totally pink! I thought since it said lip balm it wouldn&#x27;t color my lips but in fact it just turned my lips bright bright pink!!! I am not getting this again and if you don&#x27;t listen and get it get a color that would look good on lips!</li>
            <li> You must have this lip stick! The flavor is amazing! Everybody can use it, and it looks awesome with any skin color!</li>
            <li> I just got this in today and already I LOVE IT! It REALLY moisturizes right from the very first application and the smell is very pleasant. I can see why some buyers might complain a bit about the pink color it leaves but remember that it IS meant to do that. Personally I love the pink tint and think it looks great. I will DEFINITELY be purchasing this again and most likely from the same seller (it&#x27;s almost 5 bucks at my nearest drugstore, so you save a buck or two IF you get free shipping). Definitely a good buy in my book! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> omg! i love it! I LOVE IT!  it makes my lips like a baby&#x27;s baby smooth. it&#x27;s a girl&#x27;s must have item</li>
            <li> My favorite color from this line.  Great for over liner to add a punch of color and moisture.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this, I was just expecting it to be a light sheer color. and oh my gosh when I put it on...it was soooo pink. I had no clue when I was going to wear it. but now, I use it everyday! my lips are already like a hot pink/red color and this just kinda amplified it, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it. but I went back and also bought the \\&quot;peppermint\\&quot; and \\&quot;cherry me\\&quot; I REALLY wanted the limited edition colors. but I couldn&#x27;t find them. I&#x27;ll look at some other places though, definately.</li>
            <li> If you have chapped lips the color won&#x27;t distribute very evenly, but otherwise it looks good. The color is very bright pink and lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> Its nice and smooth on my lips but I don&#x27;t love the shade of pink. It might look better on my olive skin in the summer with a little tan. If you like wearing a really pink shade on your lips, then this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> I added this to my cart because I needed one more small item to get free shipping. What a pleasant surprise. I love this! It goes on smooth and has just enough color to be pretty but not obnoxious. Very fun product.</li>
            <li> moisturizing but greasy for me. I don&#x27;t like wearing makeup so this a good replacement</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get the hype with these Baby Lips, they&#x27;re not very moisturizing and tend to just &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on my lips instead of absorbing fully. The color was way too pink and bright and made me look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! I have always been super picky about chap sticks, but this is so perfect for me! The best thing about it is that it comes in so many colors. Baby Lips are perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want something too thick or too thin! Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Color is not really my type. It&#x27;s more on the baby pink side. Didnt know it was gonna be like lipstick. It&#x27;s ok though. It&#x27;s pretty so I gave it to my daughter and she loves it!!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised it held the color but more natural looking, in the good way through my day. I thought the color(pink Punch was just the name , but I have dropped stars due to it&#x27;s strong scent, which is way to strong and did not care for the flavor</li>
            <li> Three stars because it&#x27;s like lip stick, except really moisturizing. Didn&#x27;t read well and as soon as I applied this on, I had hot pink lips. I&#x27;m more of a natural person, so yea....</li>
            <li> Very beautiful color and not too much! Color is exactly as described. Awesome wear and goes great with about anything! Highly recommended! Great shine and application is very smooth.</li>
            <li> I love all of the pink tints they taste and feel great!!I keep these in my beach bag at all times!</li>
            <li> it is the best lips moisturizing lip balm i&#x27;ve ever used&lt;br /&gt;i think i;ve already ordered 10 pieces!&lt;br /&gt;everyone around me keeps asking me about it</li>
            <li> Overall this product is great, super hydrating and a nice pink color against my darker skin tone. There was only one problem with this particular shade. I found that if my lips were very dry and cracked when I used it, it would settle under the dry skin and look cheap and horrible. Now I&#x27;m sure to use it only after exfoliating, or I put clear chap stick on before I apply it. This was the only shade I had this problem with. The cherry and peach colors look great all the time, and I would highly recommend them over this one.</li>
            <li> the color is really noticeable but it comes off really easy...it also smells very good.&lt;br /&gt;it arrived very quick though</li>
            <li> My sister wanted to try this out so I got her it for x-mas, needless to say she&#x27;s in love, but how can you not be with a Maybelline product :)</li>
            <li> its a good lip balm.  It goes on smooth and looks nice. I would recommend this product. Also a good price.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 because I&#x27;m kind of iffy on whether I like it or not. I use it on top of my lipstick and it gives it a nice glossy look. It also changes the color a little. I have tried it without lipstick and it sometimes gives me a glossy cotton candy look or sometimes it looks like a pale pink. I&#x27;m not sure if I like it without lipstick underneath.</li>
            <li> Smells great, adds a tint of color, and actually works!!  I like the pink punch and red cherry because it makes my lips pinkish or reddish.  It smells absolutely delicious and my lips are considerably softer.  I find myself putting it on even when I don&#x27;t need to since it smells so good and is an instant way to brighten your smile.  My boyfriend also loves it.  He loves kissing me after I put it on since &amp;#34;it is so inviting to just touch your lips and tastes good.&amp;#34; ;)</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing lip balm, she loves every color!</li>
            <li> really pinky color and moist too. just like any other product, not that &amp;#34;baby lips&amp;#34; but  OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no need lipstick if put this on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I will never buy another brand of chapstick. My lips are so much smoother than before. And the way my lips feel when I wear it is awsome. Not heavy, greasy, clumpy, or thick. I have 3 different flavors so far and plan to get them all:)</li>
            <li> I actually bought this lip balm at Target and it is exactly true to color. It is a vibrant barbie pink color and it keeps your lips hydrated and it feels amazing. I love the cute packaging and how it clicks off like a lipstick tube. I recommend this and the other Baby Lips!</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this, so we got it.  She loves it.  She went so far as to buy more for her sister, mother, my sister, and my mother.  So I guess it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have it in Pink Punch. This is NOT a high end lip healing medicine like balm. If you have very chapped lips, or cracked bleeding lips, I would suggest healing them with Carmex before using this. Now, the ad says this renews the lips, or anti-ages them, which is why I bought it. The packaging is fabulous too! I&#x27;ve just started using it, we&#x27;ll see if it does renew my lips. As far as the balm itself, it isn&#x27;t strong, it gives a light sheen over my lips and moisterizes them for a little while. Not 8 hours. Reapply, reapply, reapply. The color is suddle, it&#x27;s like a lipstick mixed with a light balm. The Pink Punch is very pink, like a Barbie pink. I give it 4 stars for the packaging and price. It&#x27;s not gonna break your wallet, so who can&#x27;t afford to give this a try?</li>
            <li> I really like the way this goes smoothly on my lips, i like the moisture in it, the one thing ill say is a little off is how the color stays on...its kinda all over the placee and you need to apply like 2 to 4 times to actually see the color. But overall, i enjoy this product, and its a pretty pink :)</li>
            <li> the colors are very fresh</li>
            <li> not that great, just okay</li>
            <li> Its great I use it as a base for my lip gloss and it gives off this light pink tint</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing!  It really makes my lips feel soft and moisturized--especially in the harsh winter cold.  The best I have every come across.  I am buying in a clear color so I can wear under any lipstick.</li>
            <li> NOT satisfied with it .. thought its much better, after i read the reviews but !!!!!!! little pinkish thats it</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product. The truth - I was a little bit disappointed. It goes on pretty well but it wears off so quickly. My $0.99 chapstick from the drugstore lasts longer and makes my lips softer than this lip balm. I do like that there are different flavors that smell nice. However, the product pretends to be a fancy lip balm and fails. I&#x27;ll stick to the $0.99 chapstick over this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect lip balm for my preteen.  Just a hint of color.  Maybelline quality, fair price, and more appealing than lip gloss and lipstick for her age.</li>
            <li> honestly not a fan of this pale pink color on my skin (nc40 but pigmented lips). I have very dry lips so a color this light and a not so thick formula doesn&#x27;t really do the trick for me. I red one in cherry me a lot better!</li>
            <li> Nothing its great, i really enjoyed it, i love the flavor and everything about it.mi would ask other people to buy it because it is great</li>
            <li> I bought this lip gloss because my lips pretty much fall apart in the winter. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It goes on smoothly, its not sticky or greasy, and it has a subtle sweet smell. Pink Punch will give your lips a sheer pink tint, just enough to be cute. It isn&#x27;t going to work an overnight miracle for dry lips, but it doesn&#x27;t promise to. Other reviewers mentioned that it made their lips peel, but I haven&#x27;t found this to be the case for myself. Overall, very pleased, and deciding which flavor I want to try next.</li>
            <li> Hi Im lisbeth I order the baby lips maybelline new york but Never came to me please sent the product</li>
            <li> I have tryed all baby lips products and this is my personal fave.  Very nice sent, moisture and gives your lips a nice pink tint. Perfect befor lipstick, stainor gloss and beautifulon its own</li>
            <li> this is not moisturizing at all! do not waste your money! I was expecting something refreshing and it was not at all!</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I use in my lips! It keeps them moist and is the only thing that heals my chapped lips FAST. I buy this in bulk. It&#x27;s always hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> BEEAAUUTIFFULL!! Fixes all your dry lip problems, and gives your lips the color and shine you always have dreamed of! :) lov it</li>
            <li> As a moisturizing lip balm, this is a decent product.  However the color is so awful - I can&#x27;t use the product and then leave the house.  It&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve smeared pepto bismol on my lips.  Not flattering for me...</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t stay on for a super long time, which is ok to me since it isn&#x27;t supposed to be a lipstick. Nice color. I love the popping pink color, and it makes me lips feel all smooth.</li>
            <li> So inexpensive for such a soft &amp; tasty product. I LOVE IT! Sweet &amp; tangy, just the right amount of color and it makes my lips feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to tinted lip balms. I have tried and tested a wide variety of them. I would rate this as a little better than average&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;1. Wide variety of colors available for different skin tones&lt;br /&gt;2. Gives a sheer tint when applies&lt;br /&gt;3. Average moisturizing power&lt;br /&gt;4. Average looking tube&lt;br /&gt;5. Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t last long&lt;br /&gt;2. Not strong enough for dry chapped lips</li>
            <li> I love everything about this lip balm - it moisturizes really well and also adds some color to your lips. I&#x27;d recommend for sure. Especially for girls who want a bit of a girly pink tinge to their lips. The product itself is very cute also, which is an added bonus. Love it and recommend it!</li>
            <li> This lip balm feels great!  Love the way it makes my lips soft and moist.  But, the color of this pink punch is wayyyyy too bright for me.  If I was 15, which I am not, it would be ok.</li>
            <li> I am getting really impatient because it has been way too long. I want my items within the next few days. So disappointed and aggravated right now.</li>
            <li> Loved It!!Would buy again and recommend to friends and family. Great product and just what I needed at the right price.</li>
            <li> This balm is probably one of my very favorite recent finds. Very moisturizing, smells absolutely wonderful, like pinky lemonade, makes your lips super soft. A very light tint of pink color. (I noticed it doesn&#x27;t have any flavor really at all, so just a heads up on that.) I will definitely try other balms in this line of product.</li>
            <li> I love the color and I love that my lips are so soft. I will buy this product very often</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of buzz about this balm, so when it was on sale I simply had to try it out. While it&#x27;s a good lip balm for the price, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is any different than other lip balms I have.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is very smooth, and there is a slight pink tint, which I would have liked to know about before I bought it. I wouldn&#x27;t say it lasts that long, though I do talk a lot for my job and maybe that&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;I would get it again, as long as it stays cheap.</li>
            <li> Not the most moisturizing and the color is way to bubblegum pink but it is a very handy product to have nonetheless. Easy to apply and cute packaging. Probably won&#x27;t be purchasing from this line again but don&#x27;t regret it. Has a fun fruity scent and the color stays on my lips for an hour. It does enhance dry and chapped lips and doesn&#x27;t seem to provide enough moisture but if you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight fun pop of color, try this out.</li>
            <li> This lips moisturizing is great I love all of them i have a perfect collection of them. The only thing with this one does leave you lips very pink if yolu put too much.</li>
            <li> Secure Packaging, item was BRAND NEW like promised. The color is beautiful and very girly! Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I bought the coral from Walgreens last week.  I love the way my lips feel after using this product.  As other reviewers have stated, the key is to reapply.  It adds a subtle tint to your lips but makes them so soft.  This product is not heavy like a lipstick.  It feels light but I feel it protects from the elements like a chapstick does.  I would definitely recommend this product.  The product name \\&quot;Baby Lips\\&quot; is a good choice for this product.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is extraordinary. In my experience tinted lip balms that claim to &amp;#34;moisturize&amp;#34; never work. This changed everything. Not only did it moisturize amazingly well, it had a beautiful color to it. I&#x27;m not big on using lipsticks of bright color &amp; I was shocked to see that this lip balm gives an appearance of a lipstick. I ended up loving the bright pink and I will definitely buy it again. It not only gave the color but the moisture that&#x27;s signature of Baby Lips as well.</li>
            <li> This lip balm or lipstick.. whatever its the best!! i would say its more like colored chapstick. it goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could pull off the pink lip.  I was wrong.  This glides on like a creamy lip balm and really does hydrate your lips while adding amazing color.  It is like a beautiful pink gloss.  I love love love this.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004Y9GYZS Maybelline New York Baby Lips Moisturizing Lip Balm, Pink Punch, 0.15 Ounce]]I love the baby soft lip balms. It comes in a variety of colors and flavors. You&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li> I hate this product. I cant use it without using another balm or moisturizer with it. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like the bright pink color- it seems to be a good fit for the summer and it&#x27;s convenient to have a lipstick and chapstick in one. The downside is that I have to reapply every hour or so when my lips feel dry.</li>
            <li> the color is lovely pink. and it works. I also bought other colors of this model in physical store. it&#x27;s cheep but good.</li>
            <li> the color is amazing and i love how it feels on my lips and i add an extra coat just to make it a little bit more noticeable</li>
            <li> I have really chapped lips, in general, and this stuff has really improved the quality of them overall. My lips have been alot softer and smoother. I would and have recommended this to friends.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm. I was a little skeptical about purchasing it since I have a dark complexion and did not know how pink lips would look on me. It actually gave me beautiful lips and I now rock this more than my former lip stick.</li>
            <li> Very moist, not too greasy and leaves the ideal tint</li>
            <li> This has just tge perfect amount of color &amp; moisturizes my lips.</li>
            <li> It gives a very baby pink on the lips. A couple of swipes on the lips is enough for me to look natural. :) It&#x27;s very pigmented and i like this!</li>
            <li> I really like, is really creamy and have a little bit of color (thing that i dont like). Really i was expecting it to be more long lasting. Wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is wonderful. I ordered the pink punch for UNPLUGGED, and it came in the mail super fast, like two days later. The balm smells AWSOME. And after the first application, you will notice right away that you&#x27;re lips are softer and smoother, leaving your mouth with a soft glossy look.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and cute.</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this item! SOFT AND PINK! :) Beautiful, amazing, unbelievable, perfect, cute, nice, stylish, yummy, delicious-smelling,useful, priceless, acceptable, peacemaking, lovable. BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this couple of times but I think it&#x27;s next stop is the trash can. Sure, maybe after a month of use my lips will be super soft but I can&#x27;t get over the hideous Barbie doll pink hue it leaves on my lips. I was definitely excited for the pink tint but this looks like a 5-year-old took a pink crayon and colored over my lips. Since they were a little chapped to begin with, the color doesn&#x27;t go on evenly and makes the product look cheap and trashy. I was looking forward to purchasing this product for quite some time and I&#x27;m disappointed that it barely worth the couple of dollars I paid for it. Maybe try the tint-less version?</li>
            <li> Ok so for someone like me (dark skin) i was suprised how cute this color was on me, i love it! it doesnt last long though, and i haven&#x27;t really noticed my lips any softer or less sun burned. I have gone about 2 weeks of use so i&#x27;ll give it until i&#x27;m done with the tube. I&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m going to purchase again because of the color, and perhaps try the cherry me as well.</li>
            <li> so I got this Pink Punch and thinking since it&#x27;s a balm it would be like a sheer pink that is not the case it goes on like pepto bismal pink if that&#x27;s what you want then get this but it wasn&#x27;t what i want or expected i could see that in a lipstick maybe. is moisturizing though i would just pick a different color.</li>
            <li> This product works well for being so inexpensive.  Of course it would not work on someone who needed a more intensive, perhaps medicated lip balm.  This little gem moisturizes like a chapstick and applies a wonderful pink color that lasts for a long time.  The pink color is perfect for my porcelain skin.  I think this product is a steal at such a low price and I am already debating when I will order my next few from the baby lips line.</li>
            <li> How soft. No tugging my dried out lips. Color is pretty. Just enough blue in the shade to make my teeth appear more white.  Good staying power as well</li>
            <li> Baby Lips is an awesome product.  I have purchased the peppermint one and I love it so much.  I decided to try this pink punch thinking that it&#x27;s a faint nudish pink but it&#x27;s more pink than I thought.  Not the most versatile color but still very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is a bright, bold colour which is not for everyone, but fortunately works well for me. It gives a young, vibrant look, and it smells great, however the scent does not last.</li>
            <li> Lip balm smells good, leaves a soft moisture feel. It&#x27;s not shiny and dosent have that vaseline taste. would recommend</li>
            <li> Heard a great deal of reviews about this and bought it,basically it DOESNT hydrate your lips at all,the only thing it does is work as a base coat for your lips when you put on lip gloss,but you could give it a try as its cheap,and the color is pinky for my taste</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but I really don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so special about it but  I would buy again. I just like it more when I add clear lip gloss.</li>
            <li> it Moisturizes my lip for a decent period of time. It has a great tint of pink color. Reasonable price and I love it!</li>
            <li> Its a great lip moisturizer.  I use it before and after the gym.  I also like the hint of pink.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff! I just bought this stuff about a week ago in the peach flavor first and it went through the wash and was ruined.  I bought a new one along with the pink punch to replace it because I liked it so much, and this one is my absolute favorite! I love that it is so smooth and silky and leaves my lips feeling soft and moist.  It is not the same as Burts Bees which I am a big fan of for chapped lips, so if you are trying to use something for healing this isn&#x27;t the product for you.  My favorite part is that is smells so yummy, almost like Fruit Loops or something.  AND it gives the best splash of color, especially for these hot summer months! You need to try this :)</li>
