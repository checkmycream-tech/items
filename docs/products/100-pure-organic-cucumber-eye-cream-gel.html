    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It works great!</li>
            <li>This is a great organic product.</li>
            <li>My skin never feels greasy, and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>this is a very nice natural/organic eye cream that is soothing and absorbable and not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>I think it is a good eye cream.</li>
            <li>but I didnt think it did as good a job as this.</li>
            <li>I had always heard cucumber was good for bags under your eyes</li>
            <li>So, I just untwist the top and dab my finger on the top to get the perfect amount that I need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a great product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>It is VERY gentle and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice eye cream.</li>
            <li>I started out using the coffee bean eye cream, which I liked too</li>
            <li>It feel nice and keeps the under-eye area nice and moist.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, feels great, and I just love 100% pure products.</li>
            <li>I plan to keep it stocked in my cabinet as a safe go-to product.</li>
            <li>The thing I like about this cream is how refreshing it is.</li>
            <li>I believe in changing off to keep the product working and this product works okay for a switch off.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing this product again from this seller, very happy with the transaction.</li>
            <li>I love the 100 percent products and love  the eye cream</li>
            <li>It has a nice cool feeling and leaves your around the eye area feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin was becoming irritated.</li>
            <li>Is soothing and seems to be smoothing out fine lines.</li>
            <li>If that doesn&#x27;t sound fun to you or if you are weirded out by your finger \\&quot;contaminating\\</li>
            <li>Cream ok, but the bottle is just very mal-designed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great service and really fast, love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing when applied and the slight fragrance of cucumber is very nice.</li>
            <li>&quot; the cream every time you open the top, then this product is not for you.....</li>
            <li>I liked this product because it is what I needed to soothe my tired eyes because I have a great deal of reading to do on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>Nice change to supplement my other eye cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing, but now I&#x27;m forced to take the top off and use a q-tip to get the product out of the jar.</li>
            <li>I buy only cruelty free beauty and home products.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li>eh...I don&#x27;t think it really does anything.</li>
            <li>The cucumber really does take the puffiness away and leave me feeling refreshed in the morning.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>BUT it is pleasantly refreshing and extremely hydrating.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that you only need a teeny tiny amount each time, but the pump top gives you probably 5 times the amount you need.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked very at the beginning, however, it went dry when I finished half of it and couldn&#x27;t come out any more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 66 years old and have always used a moisturizer on my face, but nothing on my eyes.</li>
            <li>Thought this would at least reduce some puffiness under my eyes in the morning, but it&#x27;s nothing more than a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It seems like it&#x27;s too dry or thick to be able to be pumped.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m 66 years old and have always used a moisturizer on my face, but nothing on my eyes. I buy only cruelty free beauty and home products. I researched a bit and chose this sys cream gel. It works great! Is soothing and seems to be smoothing out fine lines. My only criticisms are: (1) it smells more like eggplant than cucumber and (2) the dispenser pump is stiff and usually delivers too much product. I think I&#x27;ll buy the coffee scented one next time, and I&#x27;m hoping the company will change the pump..</li>
            <li> Thought this would at least reduce some puffiness under my eyes in the morning, but it&#x27;s nothing more than a moisturizer. Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing when applied and the slight fragrance of cucumber is very nice. It just does not completely remove puffiness.</li>
            <li> I am big on eye creams. This is not fancy---it won&#x27;t diminish wrinkles or drastically reduce bags BUT it is pleasantly refreshing and extremely hydrating. I plan to keep it stocked in my cabinet as a safe go-to product. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> The thing I like about this cream is how refreshing it is. I use it at night or when my eyes feel very tired.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good eye cream. The only thing is that you only need a teeny tiny amount each time, but the pump top gives you probably 5 times the amount you need. So, I just untwist the top and dab my finger on the top to get the perfect amount that I need. If that doesn&#x27;t sound fun to you or if you are weirded out by your finger \\&quot;contaminating\\&quot; the cream every time you open the top, then this product is not for you.....OR if you don&#x27;t mind being wasteful, you could just dispense obscene amounts of cream each time.</li>
            <li> Nice change to supplement my other eye cream.  I believe in changing off to keep the product working and this product works okay for a switch off.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.  It is VERY gentle and smells wonderful.  As far as bringing down puffiness....eh...I don&#x27;t think it really does anything.</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it is what I needed to soothe my tired eyes because I have a great deal of reading to do on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This is a nice eye cream. It has a nice cool feeling and leaves your around the eye area feeling moisturized. Unfortunately, I started having a negative reaction (allergy?), so I had to discontinue using it. I gave it to my mother who loves it and has no problem with it.</li>
            <li> Cream ok, but the bottle is just very mal-designed. Every time I loose some of the cream bcs the pump would not pump just the amount required.</li>
            <li> I started out using the coffee bean eye cream, which I liked too but I didnt think it did as good a job as this. The cucumber really does take the puffiness away and leave me feeling refreshed in the morning. I have noticed that my eyes are moisturized and less prone to wrinkling and it has smoothed out some existing wrinkles. This is a great organic product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great, and I just love 100% pure products. I also have the organic coffee bean eye cream, and use them in conjunction. My skin never feels greasy, and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. I will definitely be purchasing this product again from this seller, very happy with the transaction.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading the reviews, but after several uses (about 3 weeks) I noticed that my skin was becoming irritated. I&#x27;m sure this is a great product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked very at the beginning, however, it went dry when I finished half of it and couldn&#x27;t come out any more.</li>
            <li> this is a very nice natural/organic eye cream that is soothing and absorbable and not at all greasy.  It feel nice and keeps the under-eye area nice and moist.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> I love the 100 percent products and love  the eye cream</li>
            <li> I had always heard cucumber was good for bags under your eyes so I thought I would try this organic cream. I do think it is helping</li>
            <li> I like the eye cream. It&#x27;s refreshing, but now I&#x27;m forced to take the top off and use a q-tip to get the product out of the jar. It&#x27;s a bit of a pain. The pump no longer works. It seems like it&#x27;s too dry or thick to be able to be pumped.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> This is the product you get for sore tired eyes, especially dealing with this years allergy season.&lt;br /&gt;I just can not be without this cream, its my must have item of the season.&lt;br /&gt;Great service and really fast, love it. Thanks</li>
