            <li> I ordered the white one and it looks just like the picture but one thing that I noticed is its glow in the dark. It took a little over two weeks for it to get here but its ok. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the white scratch on the back which is not that much noticeable.</li>
            <li> This case is fashionable. However, it falls apart and stains easily.</li>
            <li> I love it. Order it on May17th and received it 2 weeks later. No scratches, perfect!</li>

            <li> I love this case! Aside from the fact that it took weeks to get it it still came in about two weeks early. This case was totally worth the wait. Good quality for its price. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month &amp; it is still in perfect conditions &amp; good at protecting my phone.</li>
            <li> Super nice durable case</li>

            <li> The case is very cute and looks just like what expected.</li>
            <li> Loved it I want to order more only wish that the shipping time was faster.</li>

            <li> Thanks a lot receive faster then expected it&#x27;s light but match the phone perfectly</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t add bulk to your phone. I like it.</li>
            <li> AWESOME AF IT GLOWS !</li>
            <li> This is a very nice case! It&#x27;s everything it says it is, and it&#x27;s very inexpensive. The only thing that I have to say is that it took a long time to ship, but it was worth the wait! I love the transparency, and how it looks with the gold backing! I love my new case!!</li>
            <li> Arrived before estimated arrival and fits great.  Added bonus that I thought was cool:  The white case glows in the dark so it&#x27;s easy to find your phone in the middle of the night.  Something they didn&#x27;t advertise.  Very slim design and shows off the back of the iPhone and doesn&#x27;t add much weight at all but thick enough to protect the protruding camera lens.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect, looks awesome. But idk how well it&#x27;ll pretext my phone to be honest. The case is flexible enough to put on the phone but otherwise when on the phone it&#x27;s very hard. I wonder how well this hard plastic will save my phone from breaking.</li>
