            <li>Light, airy, easy to disperse.</li>
            <li>I am a girl with fine hair - a lot of it, but fine.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for people with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and that it sprays a fine mist for even coverage.  </li>
            <li>It is super light but holds EVERYthing in place!</li>
            <li>The shampoo, conditioner and this hairspray are fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>Great hair spray and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great light hair spray, as I do not like hair spray that makes my hair feel crunchy or heavy.  </li>
            <li>I love many of It&#x27;s a 10 products, and this is definitely one of them.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>This is super.</li>
            <li>It knocks down all the frizz, holds great and still has movement.</li>
            <li>This an awesome hairspray and apparently alot of other people think so too.  </li>
            <li>I like this hair spray; however I use it as a working spray - not a finishing one as I like more hold than this one offers.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Honestly, because I have not used many other hairspray products so I don&#x27;t really have experience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great hairspray without being stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li>This is a great finishing spray, not sticky or stiff on my hair.</li>
            <li>It truly changed my lifelss, dry, and damaged hair into shiney, smooth, and healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Really works on my fine straight hair; does not make it sticky but holds the style well.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy a third and more times after this one!!</li>
            <li>After many years of the same hair spray, I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, especially the smell.</li>
            <li>I was really struggling with the growing out process and this hairspray has made it virtually painless!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay for this, because I&#x27;d definitely regret it.</li>
            <li>Having such great results with other</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really use that much hairspray, just wanted to try this one out since I liked other</li>
            <li>I love spraying it all over &amp; shaking my hair to allow it to dry.</li>
            <li>I never use hair spray because it weights down my hair, but, It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Finishing Spray is light and keeps my hair looking polished and frizz free all day.</li>
            <li>Tried to order more but am now limited to 1 can</li>
            <li>Shines, holds and even smells decent!</li>
            <li>Gentle hold - maybe too gentle - especially for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Great hold without a heavy lacquered feeling makes this finishing spray a terrific product.</li>
            <li>a spray or two to keep my stray hairs from sticking straight out</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Controls my frizz and just gives an overall light shine &amp; scent.  </li>
            <li>Especially when clean my hair refuses to cooperate.</li>
            <li>With really short hair I always was able to wear very strong hold hairspray, which look ridiculous now that it&#x27;s longer.</li>
            <li>Good product for this mixed girl with black dye in hair.</li>
            <li>Miracle Finishing Spray indeed works miracles when it comes to holding my hair in Florida&#x27;s high humidity.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see where the high reviews came from.</li>
            <li>You may pay a little bit more for it</li>
            <li>I have fine hair &amp; this spray holds very well but does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>This product is light weight, provides minimal shine, and is not sticky.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special, not worth cost and is very itchy to scalp.</li>
            <li>This smells much better than the past ones I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my scalp like the others do.</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time on how pretty my hair is, and its only because of its a 10.</li>
            <li>I just spritz it lightly and the hair stays in place but still is loose enough to have a natural bounce and movement.</li>
            <li>I think my old hairspray was turning my blond hair gold.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need a lot for a soft hold and therefore it lasts longer balancing it out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t remember how much curl I actually have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting difficult to find at a good price.  </li>
            <li>Its not cheap, but its worth it!</li>
            <li>Feels soft and natural at the same time it holds your style.</li>
            <li>This hairspray smells fantastic too and holds your hair without making it hard and sticky.</li>
            <li>I give 4 for the quality of this product but 1 for the shipping of this item, so in general, I&#x27;m giving it a 3.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Will be going to back to my old spray.</li>
            <li>Made my hair hard and gummy, did not seem like it was an original product.  </li>
            <li>Again, it does NOT dry hair at all!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They make my dry highlighted hair shiny and soft.</li>

            <li> This smells much better than the past ones I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my scalp like the others do.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time on how pretty my hair is, and its only because of its a 10.</li>
            <li> I just spritz it lightly and the hair stays in place but still is loose enough to have a natural bounce and movement.</li>
            <li> I think my old hairspray was turning my blond hair gold.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need a lot for a soft hold and therefore it lasts longer balancing it out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t remember how much curl I actually have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting difficult to find at a good price.  </li>
            <li> Its not cheap, but its worth it!</li>
            <li> Feels soft and natural at the same time it holds your style.</li>
            <li> This hairspray smells fantastic too and holds your hair without making it hard and sticky.</li>
            <li> I give 4 for the quality of this product but 1 for the shipping of this item, so in general, I&#x27;m giving it a 3.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Will be going to back to my old spray.</li>
            <li> Made my hair hard and gummy, did not seem like it was an original product.  </li>
            <li> Again, it does NOT dry hair at all!&lt;br</li>
            <li> They make my dry highlighted hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I have long arns but not long enough to hold the can at a distance to prevent blowing hair out of style.</li>
            <li> get me wrong, it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle products, I was not surprised when I tried the finishing spray.  </li>
            <li> It holds all day long without looking like I have sprayed it to death.</li>
            <li> Not heavy, not light, prefect!</li>
            <li> this product is alright for everyday use but it barely does anything.</li>
            <li> since I don&#x27;t need that much hairspray, and especially because of the poor delivery state, I probably won&#x27;t purchase this item anymore, just stick with other products like the leave-in or shine spray one!</li>
            <li> I only use hairspray every few days or so and it is</li>
            <li> I flat iron a little, then fluff with my fingers</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference using this product vs other finishing sprays.</li>
            <li> I would say this one doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, and it&#x27;s not very sticky.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> After using my hair still feels soft instead of hard and stiff like other hair sprays do.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty difficult hair to manage, and just a little spray with this leaves my hair set in place for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I have always weighed my hair down with products to keep the curl and frizzies down until my hair dresser told me about this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it sticky and matted.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand than its a 10!</li>
            <li> Useless in high humidity</li>
            <li> I use a control hair spray, let it dry and then use the miracle spray so that my style will stay firmly in place.vThe style will usually hold for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair firm but adds shine.</li>
            <li> Stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> but I got one with a broken lid and super dirty and distorted bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First off let me say I HATE using product as it usually irritates my scalp, smells odd, damages hair etc.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist gave me a small version of this when I moved.  </li>
            <li> Not a good hold at all..love the other 10 Miracle products I use!</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> So the hair spray not adds some body to my hair, it will hold the style well into the night - without it looking like I sprayed my hair like crazy!</li>
            <li> Made my scalp horribly itchy</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Would not use anything else.</li>
            <li> This finishing Spray is a must have.  It works better than hairspray (eventhough sometimes you just need hairspray).  It is a nice size bottle and a good price.  I highly recommend all Its A 10 products they are wonderful.  Also it is a better deal to buy its on here then at a salon or store.  Better value.</li>
            <li> First off let me say I HATE using product as it usually irritates my scalp, smells odd, damages hair etc. However, I found this to be innocuous and reasonably effective.</li>
            <li> Finally a hairspray that will hold without looking like you have any on! Great for summer just to make your you have no frizzes lasts all day! Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Made my hair hard and gummy, did not seem like it was an original product.  I would not refer this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product it doesn&#x27;t make your hair stuff at all but holds it nicely</li>
            <li> this product is alright for everyday use but it barely does anything. Its Ok. I don&#x27;t think I would get it again. YOU CAN FIND A BETTER PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This is a very light hairspray.  It won&#x27;t hold my bangs back so I have to use something heavier on them, but it&#x27;s great on the rest of my hair.  It holds it in place, but lets it move so I don&#x27;t look like a helmet head anymore.</li>
            <li> I never use hair spray because it weights down my hair, but, It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Finishing Spray is light and keeps my hair looking polished and frizz free all day.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray... I have always weighed my hair down with products to keep the curl and frizzies down until my hair dresser told me about this product. I use the shampoo, leave in conditioner and this hairspray -- and my hair looks great... even on the highest humidity days. I no longer have to put tons of sticky products on my hair for it to look fabulous!!!! Wish I heard about this product decades ago!</li>
            <li> Made my scalp horribly itchy</li>
            <li> This is a repeat purchase. Love it!</li>
            <li> Stiff and sticky. Not as described.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff -- and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray. I have very fine hair. I love spraying it all over &amp; shaking my hair to allow it to dry. The smell is also nice.</li>
            <li> Hair spray effective and could be good quality but pressure of the spray is so powerful it blows hair around.  I have long arns but not long enough to hold the can at a distance to prevent blowing hair out of style.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!!!  It holds, it shines, it&#x27;s not sticky and you can brush through it if needed. Great for adding volume or defining curls.</li>
            <li> This smells much better than the past ones I&#x27;ve tried and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my scalp like the others do. The&lt;br /&gt;nozzle does not seem to get as stopped up as the others too...I only use hairspray every few days or so and it is&lt;br /&gt;only a spray or two to keep my stray hairs from sticking straight out so I don&#x27;t know how it would work if I actually&lt;br /&gt;styled my hair. But it works for me.</li>
            <li> After many years of the same hair spray, I decided to give this a try. I think my old hairspray was turning my blond hair gold. This smells nice, works well, and seems to have resolved the problem.</li>
            <li> This an awesome hairspray and apparently alot of other people think so too.  Tried to order more but am now limited to 1 can instead of 3 or 4. Disappointing.  It&#x27;s getting difficult to find at a good price.  I guess this is a case of &#x27;supply &amp; demand&#x27;?</li>
            <li> Not a good hold at all..love the other 10 Miracle products I use!</li>
            <li> Total opposite of texture fiber. Light, airy, easy to disperse. It holds and does not become sticky or look like there&#x27;s any product on your hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It makes your hair firm but adds shine. Never had a spray that did that.</li>
            <li> I give 4 for the quality of this product but 1 for the shipping of this item, so in general, I&#x27;m giving it a 3.&lt;br /&gt;I order this item in a \\&quot;new\\&quot; condition but I got one with a broken lid and super dirty and distorted bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use that much hairspray, just wanted to try this one out since I liked other It&#x27;s a 10 product. Honestly, because I have not used many other hairspray products so I don&#x27;t really have experience. I would say this one doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, and it&#x27;s not very sticky.&lt;br /&gt;But since I don&#x27;t need that much hairspray, and especially because of the poor delivery state, I probably won&#x27;t purchase this item anymore, just stick with other products like the leave-in or shine spray one!</li>
            <li> i love all their products</li>
            <li> This is a great hair spray.  It smooths, but does not leave your hair sticky or rigid.  Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I am a girl with fine hair - a lot of it, but fine. Especially when clean my hair refuses to cooperate. So the hair spray not adds some body to my hair, it will hold the style well into the night - without it looking like I sprayed my hair like crazy!</li>
            <li> This product is light weight, provides minimal shine, and is not sticky.  I would recommend this for people with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year.  It&#x27;s a great hairspray without being stiff or sticky.  You may pay a little bit more for it but you don&#x27;t need a lot for a soft hold and therefore it lasts longer balancing it out.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist gave me a small version of this when I moved.  I loved it and ordered this size when I arrived in California.  It tames the frizzies and keeps your style in place without creating helmet-hair.</li>
            <li> I had heard about the It&#x27;s a 10 products. Maybe the hairspray is not one of the better items, but I found it sticky and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a salon spray (private co.) for years; I ran out and tried this.  Will be going to back to my old spray.</li>
            <li> It is kind of sticky after you spray but it works good</li>
            <li> This hair spray is non-sticky and holds well.  It works well to resist humidity.  I would purchase it again. Try it!</li>
            <li> You will find this to be a great hair spray  - light but holds</li>
            <li> I love many of It&#x27;s a 10 products, and this is definitely one of them.  It&#x27;s a nice spray that holds strong but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair tacky and &amp;#34;crunchy.&amp;#34;  I like the smell and that it sprays a fine mist for even coverage.  I have super-fine hair and this helps me build volume without leaving me with tacky hair that doesn&#x27;t move in a breeze.  I alternated between this finishing spray and Aveda, but I must admit that I use this one more often.</li>
            <li> I have pretty difficult hair to manage, and just a little spray with this leaves my hair set in place for the rest of the day. Its not cheap, but its worth it!</li>
            <li> Having such great results with other It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle products, I was not surprised when I tried the finishing spray.  Fabulous!  Miracle Finishing Spray indeed works miracles when it comes to holding my hair in Florida&#x27;s high humidity. Great hold without a heavy lacquered feeling makes this finishing spray a terrific product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.  Controls my frizz and just gives an overall light shine &amp; scent.  Terrific product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t see a difference using this product vs other finishing sprays.</li>
            <li> Good price. Shipped quickly. Lids were cracked though</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand than its a 10! It truly changed my lifelss, dry, and damaged hair into shiney, smooth, and healthy hair. I get compliments all the time on how pretty my hair is, and its only because of its a 10. Try the shampoo and conditioner! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Really works on my fine straight hair; does not make it sticky but holds the style well. A great product</li>
            <li> This is super. It never becomes sticky or plastered to my head. I just spritz it lightly and the hair stays in place but still is loose enough to have a natural bounce and movement.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see where the high reviews came from. Useless in high humidity</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!! I use the It&#x27;s a 10 miracle spray and love their products anyways but this hairspray is amazing! It is super light but holds EVERYthing in place! I will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I love all the It&#x27;s a 10 products. The shampoo, conditioner and this hairspray are fantastic. They make my dry highlighted hair shiny and soft. This hairspray smells fantastic too and holds your hair without making it hard and sticky.</li>
            <li> This is a great finishing spray, not sticky or stiff on my hair. No cons for me...I love this stuff. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a good finishing spray.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair &amp; this spray holds very well but does not weigh my hair down. If you have checked salon prices this is a great price.</li>
            <li> I like this hair spray; however I use it as a working spray - not a finishing one as I like more hold than this one offers.</li>
            <li> I tried this product based on the advice from my hairdresser and I love it - it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like it needs washed even after using it for several days.  Works great ~ does all 10 things it says!</li>
            <li> Product is very light on the hair and allows the wind to funnel through without messing up style. I use this product in conjunction with the same brand shampoo and leave in conditioner.  My hair simply loves this brand.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, especially the smell. Its a great spray to even freshen up your hair between washes. LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> Best hair spray on the market and the best price was through this seller. I will definitely buy a third and more times after this one!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking for this again once I finish this up.  You don&#x27;t ever feel any symptoms of helmet head.</li>
            <li> After using my hair still feels soft instead of hard and stiff like other hair sprays do.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, not worth cost and is very itchy to scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a great light hair spray, as I do not like hair spray that makes my hair feel crunchy or heavy.  This is perfect!  I found it on a YouTube video whereby this was one of the hairdresser&#x27;s favorite picks.</li>
            <li> Great smell! Not heavy, not light, prefect! My daughter, 16, tried, now, I&#x27;m hiding it from her :-)&lt;br /&gt;Big size, good look.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Shines, holds and even smells decent!</li>
            <li> It holds well and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair a nice shine and does not make hair sticky or &amp;#34;helmut head.&amp;#34;  If I&#x27;m going to windy place I use a control hair spray, let it dry and then use the miracle spray so that my style will stay firmly in place.vThe style will usually hold for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Works great! Feels soft and natural at the same time it holds your style.</li>
            <li> Another perfect product from the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; Hair products.&lt;br /&gt;Not at all drying, flexible, touchable hair, that holds a style.&lt;br /&gt;Good smell, not overpowering.  Again, it does NOT dry hair at all!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS SPRAY!  Will not use anything else !!</li>
            <li> Good product for this mixed girl with black dye in hair. Absolutely great. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Gentle hold - maybe too gentle - especially for fine hair.  Love It&#x27;s a 10 products but probably won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Great hair spray and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> I am growing out my hair after 15 years of having a short pixie cut. I didn&#x27;t remember how much curl I actually have. Since I am wearing it in a layered bob now, after all the round brush blowdrying in the morning to get it straight, I have alot of frizz. I flat iron a little, then fluff with my fingers and it looks ok. THEN...I spray the It&#x27;s a 10 hairspray and it looks fabulous. I get so many complements. It holds all day long without looking like I have sprayed it to death. It knocks down all the frizz, holds great and still has movement. With really short hair I always was able to wear very strong hold hairspray, which look ridiculous now that it&#x27;s longer. I am so glad my hairdresser recommended this. I was really struggling with the growing out process and this hairspray has made it virtually painless! I love it</li>
            <li> Great spray.  Holds hair in place.</li>
            <li> My mother gave me this, and I foolishly accepted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a fine product. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it sticky and matted. It puts my hair right where I want it, and does a good job of keeping it there. But the smell is overpowering -- I have to hold my breath and immediately vacate the room after application. Nobody I know can stand being in the vicinity of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also relatively unimpressive for the price. Yes, it holds my hair in place while still allowing for flexibility. But so do cheaper hairsprays, and they don&#x27;t have that god-awful odor. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay for this, because I&#x27;d definitely regret it.</li>
