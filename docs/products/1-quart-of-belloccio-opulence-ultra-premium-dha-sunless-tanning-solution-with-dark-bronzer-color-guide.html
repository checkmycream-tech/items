    <ol>
            <li>Smells great too!  </li>
            <li>Has a wonderful bronze glow.</li>
            <li>not the best</li>
            <li>It looks great,</li>
            <li>Nice color too!</li>
            <li>the smell is pleasant too does not smell metallic at all.</li>
            <li>I loved this solution.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous air brush tans every time.</li>
            <li>and I know this solution is best when kept cool.</li>
            <li>SUPER AWESOME WITH NO UNWANTED COLORS.  </li>
            <li>I still love the solution but am considering stockpiling during cooler times of the year!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They should have mentioned this up front and/or offer a lower DHA formula for more fair skin types like most others do.  </li>
            <li>There is no weird orangy color, just a very nice healthy bronze that is build-able for a deeper result.  </li>
            <li>love this bronze color</li>
            <li>i tryed many diff spray and this is simply the best.</li>
            <li>I normally am in love with this solution and use it exclusively on all of my clients as well as myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I think it would work excellent on someone with darker skin looking for a very deep tan.  </li>
            <li>but it worked ok</li>
            <li>We have tried many different products and have found this one to be the best.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, goes on with a light color so you can see what you are spraying.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the odor most sunless tanning lotions have.  </li>
            <li>As for Belloccio&#x27;s Opulence, I never knew this product existed until I received a sample with the airbrush system I had purchased, which I also love, but that&#x27;s another story.  </li>
            <li>It looks great at first but fades to quickly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty confident you will be as pleased with it as I am.</li>
            <li>It leaves a lightly tacky coating on the surface of the skin that remains there until the client&#x27;s first shower, but I assume that helps keep the product attached to the skin longer, resulting in better and more even coverage, and doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my clients at all.  </li>
            <li>wow ..i must say this is by far the best tanning spray ive ever used</li>
            <li>This product originally came as a sample with the spray tan kit we bought.</li>
            <li>not much to say it has a great color and lasts about 5 to 7 days before needing freshening also</li>
            <li>I own a professional makeup studio and we offer airbrush tanning.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly without leaving &#x27;tacky&#x27; feeling  to my skin.</li>
            <li>Starts out great but doesn&#x27;t stay dark after a shower.</li>
            <li>Right away this product matched the salon quality.</li>
            <li>I like this tan liquid very much.</li>
            <li>This time I noticed the box was extremely hot upon delivery</li>
            <li>Everyone thinks this tan is real!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really love this tanning product.</li>
            <li>Anyway, Opulence is essentially, all of my favorite sunless tanners contained in one bottle</li>
            <li>Looks as good as any of the more expensive norvel products we have used.</li>
            <li>It has provided several applications and a great medium to dark tan result.</li>
            <li>really isn&#x27;t much of a noticeable scent at all.  </li>
            <li>It truly lasts and lasts - a good week, at least for me.  </li>
            <li>The color is pretty good, it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in your pores, but it fades off in the biggest awful patches I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>It lasted about as long as Ocean (some wear-off after 3-days and significant wear-off by day 5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no orangey look and it appears very natural looking</li>
            <li>Fortunately, over the years, sunless tanners have come a long way, but I can assure you that you definitely get what you pay for, so don&#x27;t skimp.  </li>
            <li>wow..</li>
            <li>This is by far THE stickiest tanning solution I&#x27;ve ever used in my 10+ years spraying and being sprayed.</li>
            <li>After a few sprays I think I do a better job than the salon girls, especially in the chest, thighs and butt where I take my time.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few different brand and this one has become my favorite.</li>
            <li>I like the color and love that it only takes a few hours to dry.</li>
            <li>Finally a tan that impresses like no other!</li>
            <li>A little Opulence goes a long way and gives a deep, rich color.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, on me it looked quite intense and slightly orange</li>
            <li>and when it&#x27;s coming off, it fades very naturally instead of looking all splotchy like some other solutions I have used.</li>

            <li> It does darken up a little during the following couple of hours, so just take that into consideration during the application.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened with my batch, I sprayed 2 different clients with very different skin - one looked yellow and the other looked orange - not good!  </li>
            <li> , I was expecting a lot from this solution from the other reviews.</li>

            <li> Wears off evenly, doesn&#x27;t get real dark, although I have not tried layering.</li>
            <li> I do think it effected the quality of the product and sadly I was not able to use it, very frustrating to have to throw about 50 worth of inventory out.</li>
            <li> fault the shipping process was flawed, but not exactly mine either!</li>
            <li> The worst color I&#x27;ve used, turned one client orange and the other looked yellow.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and embarrassed that I did this to two of my clients.</li>

            <li> love this bronze color</li>
            <li> I loved this solution.  It looks great, no orangey look and it appears very natural looking and when it&#x27;s coming off, it fades very naturally instead of looking all splotchy like some other solutions I have used.</li>
            <li> wow ..i must say this is by far the best tanning spray ive ever used wow..i tryed many diff spray and this is simply the best.</li>
            <li> I normally am in love with this solution and use it exclusively on all of my clients as well as myself. This time I noticed the box was extremely hot upon delivery and I know this solution is best when kept cool. I do think it effected the quality of the product and sadly I was not able to use it, very frustrating to have to throw about 50 worth of inventory out. I still love the solution but am considering stockpiling during cooler times of the year! I realize it&#x27;s not the products fault the shipping process was flawed, but not exactly mine either! They made their money, I lost some 😢</li>
            <li> Everyone thinks this tan is real!  SUPER AWESOME WITH NO UNWANTED COLORS.  Smells great too!  Finally a tan that impresses like no other!</li>
            <li> Has a wonderful bronze glow. Looks as good as any of the more expensive norvel products we have used. Haven&#x27;t used anything else since we got this</li>
            <li> The worst color I&#x27;ve used, turned one client orange and the other looked yellow. Maybe I got a bad batch, I was expecting a lot from this solution from the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the results I got, BUT I think this product is not ideal for my skin type (moderately fair skin color).  Therefore, on me it looked quite intense and slightly orange and you could see blotches as it started to wear off after a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I think it would work excellent on someone with darker skin looking for a very deep tan.  I have used Ocean brand 12%DHA  (their darkest) and this was darker.  It lasted about as long as Ocean (some wear-off after 3-days and significant wear-off by day 5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should have mentioned this up front and/or offer a lower DHA formula for more fair skin types like most others do.  The description did not state DHA concentration so I took a chance.</li>
            <li> I like this tan liquid very much. It has provided several applications and a great medium to dark tan result. It dries quickly without leaving &#x27;tacky&#x27; feeling  to my skin. And there is no scent!</li>
            <li> Starts out great but doesn&#x27;t stay dark after a shower. I&#x27;ve used all the recommended post tan products and waited 8 hours to shower and in order to stay dark, I have to apply every other day. It looks great at first but fades to quickly.</li>

            <li> not the best but it worked ok</li>
            <li> I own a professional makeup studio and we offer airbrush tanning. We have tried many different products and have found this one to be the best.  It smells nice, goes on with a light color so you can see what you are spraying.  It does darken up a little during the following couple of hours, so just take that into consideration during the application.  There is no weird orangy color, just a very nice healthy bronze that is build-able for a deeper result.  It leaves a lightly tacky coating on the surface of the skin that remains there until the client&#x27;s first shower, but I assume that helps keep the product attached to the skin longer, resulting in better and more even coverage, and doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my clients at all.  Overall, I really love this tanning product.</li>
            <li> I use this this product to spray my wife. This product originally came as a sample with the spray tan kit we bought. Right away this product matched the salon quality. After a few sprays I think I do a better job than the salon girls, especially in the chest, thighs and butt where I take my time.  We have reordered this product several times.</li>
            <li> No streaking, doesn&#x27;t leave you looking orange. Wears off evenly, doesn&#x27;t get real dark, although I have not tried layering.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the odor most sunless tanning lotions have.  Nice color too!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous air brush tans every time. (Provided you know how to use an airbrush well) I&#x27;ll definitely re-order when I start to run low.</li>
            <li> I love this! It doesn&#x27;t have an orange tint to it like the others</li>
            <li> not much to say it has a great color and lasts about 5 to 7 days before needing freshening also the smell is pleasant too does not smell metallic at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brand and this one has become my favorite. I like the color and love that it only takes a few hours to dry. I have had no complaints about it from anyone that I have sprayd.</li>
            <li> I have been using sunless tanners for over 20 years - back when the end result was orange - as in the fruit.  Fortunately, over the years, sunless tanners have come a long way, but I can assure you that you definitely get what you pay for, so don&#x27;t skimp.  As for Belloccio&#x27;s Opulence, I never knew this product existed until I received a sample with the airbrush system I had purchased, which I also love, but that&#x27;s another story.  A little Opulence goes a long way and gives a deep, rich color.  It truly lasts and lasts - a good week, at least for me.  My biggest concern though, was the smell. I was expecting  something really weird smelling, which is typical of sunless tanners, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover there really isn&#x27;t much of a noticeable scent at all.  Anyway, Opulence is essentially, all of my favorite sunless tanners contained in one bottle and I&#x27;m pretty confident you will be as pleased with it as I am.</li>
