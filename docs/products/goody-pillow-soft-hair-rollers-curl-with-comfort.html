            <li>They really work best over night, we tried wetting her hair and blowdrying one day</li>
            <li>These, paired with lots of moose work perfectly for those who have stubbornly straight hair.</li>

            <li>Very comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>Loved them -  great for short hair to make curly.  </li>
            <li>I have used these for years and LOVE them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also place my pony tail on top of my head before I use them</li>
            <li>Could be sewn better.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for bangs or short hair..</li>
            <li>I curl my hair twice a week and love these rollers.</li>
            <li>I like these curlers, wish they were available in satin wrap, that would be a better product.</li>
            <li>Easy to sleep in.</li>
            <li>These are wonderful, my stepdaughter has very very fine thin hair, so one bag of these does the trick.</li>
            <li>I love these, however the first time I used them...</li>
            <li>The are small in width and thickness but perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li>They are so, so soft to sleep in them and wake up with wavy cute bouncy curls!</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine hair that is fairly straight and chin length</li>

            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>The one issue you must consider is how many curlers to order because of the size, I try not to put alot of hair on a curler because it will not dry over night.  </li>
            <li>I only wish they had more in a bag.</li>
            <li>Soft, comfortable, stays in hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes they are cheaply made as mine usually last a year before replacing with individual ones breaking but for the money and healthy hair</li>
            <li>Plus you will have tons of volume making your hair look much</li>
            <li>and it did not work very well,</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thank God for these curlers less head aches more sleep time.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Slid out of my daughter&#x27;s hair easily (even when rolling wet).</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t tangle either and come out quickly if wrapped properly.  </li>
            <li>Much  better than I thought they would be at such a low price.</li>
            <li>I have long, full hair but straight as string.  </li>
            <li>The curls last longer than any hot rollers and won&#x27;t burn your hair, skin or hands.  </li>
            <li>but when she keeps them in overnight she has pretty bouncy curls that last all day.</li>
            <li>These are very cheaply made, nothing but a little one inch square sponge in the middle of a wire.</li>
            <li>I just sewed them up, 9 of the 30 I have, and that fixed it.  </li>
            <li>The last ones I bought from conair were bamboo , green colored and lasted for more than a year before they started to come apart.</li>
            <li>have long straight hair that I used to Perm until my hair got so damaged</li>

            <li> have long straight hair that I used to Perm until my hair got so damaged</li>
            <li> Much softer to sleep in than the pink sponge rollers we used when I was little.</li>
            <li> But I do think this can be an issue because they did not last very long before I had to repair them.  </li>
            <li> I actually went out and bought other ones for my longer hair.</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry, they won&#x27;t hold or curl your hair.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the curls come out a bit tight and take several hours to loosen.</li>
            <li> so I can sleep at night without them waking me up like the harder clip rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had split ends in years and it only takes me a few minutes to put 20-30 rollers in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Also if you use thin strands you will get small tight curls or less curlers for loose full waves.  </li>
            <li> These are not like the old ones that I had bought in the past, these are nothing but a small square of sponge with a wire through it covered with cloth.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and have been using this product for some years now.</li>
            <li> they are also very small , not for long hair.</li>
            <li> These are basically a gauzy piece of fabric covering a very small, square piece of sponge with a long piece of wire through the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to find another way to add volume without destroying it.  </li>
            <li> All in all, simply dreadful and not at all like the previous Conair bamboo soft curlers, which were sadly discontinued.</li>
            <li> -- my curls ended up looking weird and dented, probably because of the square shape of the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fabric they are covered in gave me the frizzies.  </li>

            <li> I have lots of fine hair that is fairly straight and chin length and I couldn&#x27;t make these things work, no matter what i tried!</li>
            <li> Loved them -  great for short hair to make curly.  can sleep in them</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and LOVE them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long straight hair that I used to Perm until my hair got so damaged I had to find another way to add volume without destroying it.  I simply use them after blow drying when my hair is damp or spray the hair with water and curl away.  If your hair is dry, they won&#x27;t hold or curl your hair.  Also if you use thin strands you will get small tight curls or less curlers for loose full waves.  I also place my pony tail on top of my head before I use them so I can sleep at night without them waking me up like the harder clip rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had split ends in years and it only takes me a few minutes to put 20-30 rollers in my hair.  They don&#x27;t tangle either and come out quickly if wrapped properly.  I simply take them out in the morning , toss my hair a bit and use either a hair spray or liquid shine depending on the look I want.  The curls last longer than any hot rollers and won&#x27;t burn your hair, skin or hands.  Plus you will have tons of volume making your hair look much fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes they are cheaply made as mine usually last a year before replacing with individual ones breaking but for the money and healthy hair it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful, my stepdaughter has very very fine thin hair, so one bag of these does the trick. They really work best over night, we tried wetting her hair and blowdrying one day and it did not work very well, but when she keeps them in overnight she has pretty bouncy curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair</li>
            <li> I love these, however the first time I used them...some of the seams came undone and made them not usable.  Could be sewn better.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for bangs or short hair.. I actually went out and bought other ones for my longer hair. But theses are perfect for shorter hair</li>
            <li> Easiest way to make curls!!!!</li>
            <li> These, paired with lots of moose work perfectly for those who have stubbornly straight hair. I only wish they had more in a bag. 10 rolls aren&#x27;t even close to enough!</li>
            <li> They are so, so soft to sleep in them and wake up with wavy cute bouncy curls! Love them! Work great!</li>
            <li> Thank God for these curlers less head aches more sleep time.&lt;br /&gt;Nice price for the amount in the pack. Thank-you.</li>
            <li> You may as well just wrap your hair a piece of coat hanger not for me. I would not reorder</li>
            <li> Soft, comfortable, stays in hair.  Good price.  Much  better than I thought they would be at such a low price.</li>
            <li> Slid out of my daughter&#x27;s hair easily (even when rolling wet). Much softer to sleep in than the pink sponge rollers we used when I was little.</li>
            <li> These are very comfortable. They came on time for a Christmas gift to be given. The price is right. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like these.  I have long thick hair and have been using this product for some years now. They give my hair body that lasts until the next shampoo about three days later.  Very comfortable to sleep in.  Sometimes the curls come out a bit tight and take several hours to loosen.</li>
            <li> These are not like the old ones that I had bought in the past, these are nothing but a small square of sponge with a wire through it covered with cloth. The square is in the middle and the rest is wire. they are also very small , not for long hair. I have used them about 3 times and they already have wire sticking out of them. they are falling apart. The last ones I bought from conair were bamboo , green colored and lasted for more than a year before they started to come apart. These are very cheaply made, nothing but a little one inch square sponge in the middle of a wire. I would not reccommend these to anyone. They will not last.</li>
            <li> I like these curlers, wish they were available in satin wrap, that would be a better product. Easy to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I have long, full hair but straight as string.  I curl my hair twice a week and love these rollers. The are small in width and thickness but perfect for my hair. The one issue you must consider is how many curlers to order because of the size, I try not to put alot of hair on a curler because it will not dry over night.  After 1 month I did find the curler inner wire coming through the end of the white cotton cover.  I just sewed them up, 9 of the 30 I have, and that fixed it.  But I do think this can be an issue because they did not last very long before I had to repair them.  I like the curl they provide and the comfort to sleep on, so I will repair them as needed.</li>
            <li> These are basically a gauzy piece of fabric covering a very small, square piece of sponge with a long piece of wire through the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the sponge being too short -- making my hair fall out of the curler -- my curls ended up looking weird and dented, probably because of the square shape of the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fabric they are covered in gave me the frizzies.  All in all, simply dreadful and not at all like the previous Conair bamboo soft curlers, which were sadly discontinued.</li>
