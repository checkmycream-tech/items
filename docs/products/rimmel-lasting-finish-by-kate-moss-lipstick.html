            <li>Let me tell u how I love this lip stick smells good</li>
            <li>but I have warm skin tone</li>
            <li>but I prefer it on its own.</li>
            <li>Dries up fairly matte which I love</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even look nice for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It immediately makes you look like a hooked whose days have not been kind</li>
            <li>really nice</li>

            <li>NEW FAVORITE COLOR AND LIPSTICK!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>(kate 001), it is the perfect shade of red for my skin color (tan to olive skin tone) and it smells really good too.</li>
            <li>it is wonderful it last a good amount of time</li>
            <li>It complements my very fair skin very well</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful red color.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Supposedly it lasts longer if you apply translucent powder on top to set it.</li>
            <li>the finish this gives on my lips is the one that makes lips more alluring.</li>

            <li>best red lipstick i have.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>best red lipstick i have everrrrrrrrr</li>
            <li>One of my favorite lipsticks.</li>
            <li>But I have braces for one more month.</li>
            <li>I have fallen madly in love with this lipstick</li>
            <li>and i love the way it turned out although i am medium</li>
            <li>Marvelous, especially considering the price, I like it better than my fancy MAC and Borjois lipsticks</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best pigmented and smooth lipsticks I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>The color is fabulous!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cheap glamor doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>hands down the best I have ever own</li>
            <li>I have spent anywhere from $5.00 -$50.00 on lipsticks and this one was is awesome.</li>
            <li>Brilliant red.</li>
            <li>One of the best reds so far I renamed it from 001 to pure heaven because it look</li>
            <li>That said, it is a fun color, smooth and easy to apply and nice quality.</li>
            <li>Easy to wear gloss over if that is your thing,</li>
            <li>This lipstick is creamy and glides on easily.</li>
            <li>But it is easy to smudge .</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t wear it often as it&#x27;s just tooooo strong.  </li>
            <li>This red is beautiful on my skin tone.</li>
            <li>but as i put on this red lipstick it looks so beautiful on me.</li>
            <li>Super pigmented!</li>
            <li>I love it for the bright red hue and for the vegan ingredients</li>
            <li>but that is another story and not the fault of this gorgeously smooth lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great lipstick, only put on once or twice a day, depends if you wipe your lips with tissue it will not get weak&amp;#62; lighter.</li>
            <li>an goes on smooth</li>
            <li>Rimmel did not disappoint its affordable, a lot of great colors, and this lipsticks lasts with the need of the occasional touch up.</li>
            <li>Even my father who HATES red lipstick told me that it looked great.</li>
            <li>Stays on and looks so smooth, not sticky or oily.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Smooth finish.</li>
            <li>but if you set it with a clear gloss over it is good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for pale skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can watch the video there for a more in depth look at the product  or just take my word hands down the best red lipstick I have ever own</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;m older, my friends say the darker red looks best on me  Norma Heagy</li>
            <li>The color really lasts &amp; is nice &amp; bold.</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty and is probably flattering for most skin types.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
            <li>beautiful color though a bit lighter than expected.</li>
            <li>Product itself us nice, very smooth, packagings great, it smears a little bit easier than most but overall</li>
            <li>It was a bit more bright than i expected.</li>
            <li>This has been, by far, the BEST red lipstick I have ever worn.</li>
            <li>The color is amazing and the lipstick actually smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Color is great, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long at all!</li>
            <li>Bright red color!</li>
            <li>I have the 001 and is a beautiful and intense red .</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a good price to try different shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t stain, which is good for a red lipstick.</li>
            <li>true to color.</li>
            <li>Its a gorgeous red.</li>
            <li>This is a gorgeous red lipstick.</li>
            <li>I also like the super bright red color!!!</li>
            <li>Also, this lipstick has a pretty strong scent.</li>
            <li>Great shade, but needed constant reapplication to stay vibrant!</li>
            <li>This is a super bold lipstick choice, matte.  </li>
            <li>It soft and smooth finish is outstanding.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super flattering color</li>
            <li>I know, smell isn&#x27;t a factor for most people, but it definitely is for me :)</li>
            <li>The color is absolutely extraordinary .</li>
            <li>just that good lol (silly me)</li>
            <li>Nice and beautiful, the color is a little darker than I expected, but still love it.</li>
            <li>Didint like the color after all its too dark but it was a good product rich color and smooth will purchase another</li>
            <li>Love the high gloss and feel on my lips.</li>
            <li>Very sexy red color.</li>
            <li>but on my skin tone instead of a nice deep red like it appears here, it&#x27;s bright fuschia.</li>
            <li>I think the photo graphs from these lipsticks should be taken under true light so customers can see the real color.</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick such a bold color and makes me look like I&#x27;m from the 40s!</li>
            <li>Stays on for a decent amount of time, and comes off easy.</li>
            <li>The color was a bit lighter than I expected, but still a good lipstick.</li>
            <li>If you want a red lipstick and you&#x27;re unsure about which shade of red, this is a safe one that would look good on any skin tone.</li>
            <li>Finally a nice red for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance, creamy texture, fabulous red color.  </li>
            <li>While I use and love many other rimmel products I detest this lipstick.</li>
            <li>I actually try to use it very sparingly when I put it on and then blot as much as I can, and still come up with a good coverage at a color that isn&#x27;t screaming at me/</li>
            <li>Great color and lasts longer than expected for such a cheap lipstick.</li>
            <li>I love it, so far it is my favorite red.</li>
            <li>it arrived right away and this is my favorite red to throw on during the fall and winter season.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t care for it very much.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and I would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite red lipstic.</li>
            <li>I wear it almost daily and get many compliments.</li>
            <li>the big bang lacquer is better</li>
            <li>This is my first ever lipstick purchase and I must say...</li>
            <li>It does not last many hours.</li>
            <li>My favorite drugstore choice for a red lip.</li>
            <li>It is a really sexy red.</li>
            <li>Never had a chance to go back to CSV to buy more until yesterday.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look that great on me, And they certainly don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>The color looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sidenote: This is more of a deeper red.</li>
            <li>This is the one red lipstick I use on many of my clients.  </li>
            <li>I am very upset with this!</li>
            <li>I love that with this lipstick, I only need to re-apply twice or thrice a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true red, really flaterring, long lasting &amp; it wears off perfectly.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time exactly, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and stays slick without needing any gloss which is nice, but it does not stay put at all.</li>
            <li>It is just ok overall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a rusty red.  </li>
            <li>Not too dark, not to bright, simply classic.</li>
            <li>First time trying red, and it was a good color overall.</li>
            <li>This is a true true red.  </li>
            <li>I like the color, it is very vibrant.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is on the dry side though.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, just expected it to be a darker red.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for any woman of any skin color, it is a very classy and sexy red.</li>
            <li>Hard enough and for the price is a very good lipstick.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick, it&#x27;s a gorgeous classic shade of dark blue red.  </li>
            <li>Too much mouth movement:</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It stay on really well.</li>
            <li>I really like.</li>
            <li>It really brings out your face.</li>
            <li>Lasts  very well</li>
            <li>The color is such a beautiful deep red and it glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>I bought this blindly not knowing if it would be bad, good, or ok</li>
            <li>Due to my skin tone, most lipsticks look fuchsia.</li>
            <li>Color rich and deep like picture, will order this lipstick again</li>
            <li>I had never tried much of this brand, and realized I didn&#x27;t have a true red toned lipstick.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend it to anyone, as this color is true to the picture.</li>
            <li>She saw a new aspect to her fashion style!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a purple/blue red than a orange red.</li>
            <li>But for the price, it&#x27;s a decent, doable color.</li>
            <li>What it looks like on is several shades lighter (even taking into account my lighter skin tone) and in pictures showed up more pink than red even without strong lighting or flash involved</li>
            <li>Very pretty red.</li>
            <li>This is a little more blood orange-y than I&#x27;d have preferred.</li>
            <li>Did have to reapply after a few hours but better than having stained lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not great quality, but it feels good on.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Color looks dark but goes on a little bit brighter than I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Still a very nice color</li>
            <li>I have one of those tricky skin tones that usually do not work well with reds, but when a friend of mine told me I should try this particular shade I did.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice, lasts well, only a little drying--</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, and tends to fade quickly in the middle, so reapplying it open it pretty necessary.</li>
            <li>Not really a good kind if lipstick.</li>
            <li>This is the first red lipstick I&#x27;ve ever worn</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m a red lipstick freak...have tons of them.</li>
            <li>My favorite red and the only red that I will wear!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a very strong red just enough to be glamorous, very satisfied</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li>i was pleasantly surprised by this add-on item.</li>
            <li>but oh well and it came on Sunday and a day early üëèüëè</li>
            <li>I needed red lipstick, mission accomplished.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t stay as its said it was wasted moneyeven though it was cheap to me</li>
            <li>and as i can tell it lasts very well only</li>
            <li>The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t last too long and transfers easily.</li>
            <li>I bought this lipstick expecting a vibrant red color and it was a little bit darker than expected but other than that it was great to have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic, deep, movie star, serious and sultry kind of red.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty much as expected - what surprised me was the amount of time the lipstick remained after application, I eventually had to wash the stain off my lips which is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars - for me.</li>
            <li>The fact that it wasn&#x27;t true to color when worn, and the need to either frequently apply or rely heavily on lip liner or powder to help set it costs the lipstick two stars.</li>
            <li>This particular color is a true red with very little orange which I like.</li>
            <li>It also has pretty long lasting color!</li>
            <li>this bloody red lipstick is perfect for that kissable lips!</li>
            <li>Lipstick was smearing right and left with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>After a couple of days of using it I noticed my lips were a bit more dry than usual</li>
            <li>I normally wear more expensive brands</li>
            <li>Well the color is more of a &amp;#34;true red&amp;#34;, exactly what I was afraid might happen.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is nowhere near the color red like pictured.  </li>
            <li>I work 8hr shifts where I talk ALOT, it doesn&#x27;t smear , but about right away the 6hr mark it does begin to look a little duller, so I touch up.</li>
            <li>Highly suggest this long wearing lipstick!!</li>
            <li>It does need to be carefully applied, as it is hard to wipe off and will smear, which has been my experience with most lipsticks this color.</li>

            <li> Let me tell u how I love this lip stick smells good</li>
            <li> but I have warm skin tone</li>
            <li> but I prefer it on its own.</li>
            <li> Dries up fairly matte which I love</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even look nice for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It immediately makes you look like a hooked whose days have not been kind</li>
            <li> really nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a nice lipstick.  </li>

            <li> NEW FAVORITE COLOR AND LIPSTICK!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> (kate 001), it is the perfect shade of red for my skin color (tan to olive skin tone) and it smells really good too.</li>
            <li> it is wonderful it last a good amount of time</li>
            <li> It complements my very fair skin very well</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful red color.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Supposedly it lasts longer if you apply translucent powder on top to set it.</li>
            <li> the finish this gives on my lips is the one that makes lips more alluring.</li>
            <li> The perfect red for my skin color.</li>

            <li> I am seriously in love with this lipstick.</li>
            <li> best red lipstick i have.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> best red lipstick i have everrrrrrrrr</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lipsticks.</li>
            <li> But I have braces for one more month.</li>
            <li> I have fallen madly in love with this lipstick</li>
            <li> and i love the way it turned out although i am medium</li>
            <li> Marvelous, especially considering the price, I like it better than my fancy MAC and Borjois lipsticks</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best pigmented and smooth lipsticks I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> The color is fabulous!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cheap glamor doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li> Love this color.</li>
            <li> hands down the best I have ever own</li>
            <li> I have spent anywhere from $5.00 -$50.00 on lipsticks and this one was is awesome.</li>
            <li> Brilliant red.</li>
            <li> One of the best reds so far I renamed it from 001 to pure heaven because it look</li>
            <li> That said, it is a fun color, smooth and easy to apply and nice quality.</li>
            <li> Easy to wear gloss over if that is your thing,</li>
            <li> This lipstick is creamy and glides on easily.</li>
            <li> But it is easy to smudge .</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t wear it often as it&#x27;s just tooooo strong.  </li>
            <li> This red is beautiful on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> but as i put on this red lipstick it looks so beautiful on me.</li>
            <li> Super pigmented!</li>
            <li> I love it for the bright red hue and for the vegan ingredients</li>
            <li> but that is another story and not the fault of this gorgeously smooth lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great lipstick, only put on once or twice a day, depends if you wipe your lips with tissue it will not get weak&amp;#62; lighter.</li>
            <li> an goes on smooth</li>
            <li> Rimmel did not disappoint its affordable, a lot of great colors, and this lipsticks lasts with the need of the occasional touch up.</li>
            <li> Even my father who HATES red lipstick told me that it looked great.</li>
            <li> Stays on and looks so smooth, not sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Smooth finish.</li>
            <li> but if you set it with a clear gloss over it is good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for pale skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can watch the video there for a more in depth look at the product  or just take my word hands down the best red lipstick I have ever own</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m older, my friends say the darker red looks best on me  Norma Heagy</li>
            <li> The color really lasts &amp; is nice &amp; bold.</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty and is probably flattering for most skin types.</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
            <li> beautiful color though a bit lighter than expected.</li>
            <li> Product itself us nice, very smooth, packagings great, it smears a little bit easier than most but overall</li>
            <li> It was a bit more bright than i expected.</li>
            <li> This has been, by far, the BEST red lipstick I have ever worn.</li>
            <li> The color is amazing and the lipstick actually smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Color is great, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long at all!</li>
            <li> Bright red color!</li>
            <li> I have the 001 and is a beautiful and intense red .</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a good price to try different shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t stain, which is good for a red lipstick.</li>
            <li> true to color.</li>
            <li> Its a gorgeous red.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous red lipstick.</li>
            <li> I also like the super bright red color!!!</li>
            <li> Also, this lipstick has a pretty strong scent.</li>
            <li> Great shade, but needed constant reapplication to stay vibrant!</li>
            <li> This is a super bold lipstick choice, matte.  </li>
            <li> It soft and smooth finish is outstanding.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super flattering color</li>
            <li> I know, smell isn&#x27;t a factor for most people, but it definitely is for me :)</li>
            <li> The color is absolutely extraordinary .</li>
            <li> just that good lol (silly me)</li>
            <li> Nice and beautiful, the color is a little darker than I expected, but still love it.</li>
            <li> Didint like the color after all its too dark but it was a good product rich color and smooth will purchase another</li>
            <li> Love the high gloss and feel on my lips.</li>
            <li> Very sexy red color.</li>
            <li> but on my skin tone instead of a nice deep red like it appears here, it&#x27;s bright fuschia.</li>
            <li> I think the photo graphs from these lipsticks should be taken under true light so customers can see the real color.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick such a bold color and makes me look like I&#x27;m from the 40s!</li>
            <li> Stays on for a decent amount of time, and comes off easy.</li>
            <li> The color was a bit lighter than I expected, but still a good lipstick.</li>
            <li> If you want a red lipstick and you&#x27;re unsure about which shade of red, this is a safe one that would look good on any skin tone.</li>
            <li> Finally a nice red for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance, creamy texture, fabulous red color.  </li>
            <li> While I use and love many other rimmel products I detest this lipstick.</li>
            <li> I actually try to use it very sparingly when I put it on and then blot as much as I can, and still come up with a good coverage at a color that isn&#x27;t screaming at me/</li>
            <li> Great color and lasts longer than expected for such a cheap lipstick.</li>
            <li> I love it, so far it is my favorite red.</li>
            <li> it arrived right away and this is my favorite red to throw on during the fall and winter season.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t care for it very much.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and I would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite red lipstic.</li>
            <li> I wear it almost daily and get many compliments.</li>
            <li> the big bang lacquer is better</li>
            <li> This is my first ever lipstick purchase and I must say...</li>
            <li> It does not last many hours.</li>
            <li> My favorite drugstore choice for a red lip.</li>
            <li> It is a really sexy red.</li>
            <li> Never had a chance to go back to CSV to buy more until yesterday.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look that great on me, And they certainly don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The color looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sidenote: This is more of a deeper red.</li>
            <li> This is the one red lipstick I use on many of my clients.  </li>
            <li> I am very upset with this!</li>
            <li> I love that with this lipstick, I only need to re-apply twice or thrice a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a true red, really flaterring, long lasting &amp; it wears off perfectly.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time exactly, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and stays slick without needing any gloss which is nice, but it does not stay put at all.</li>
            <li> It is just ok overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a rusty red.  </li>
            <li> Not too dark, not to bright, simply classic.</li>
            <li> First time trying red, and it was a good color overall.</li>
            <li> This is a true true red.  </li>
            <li> I like the color, it is very vibrant.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is on the dry side though.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, just expected it to be a darker red.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for any woman of any skin color, it is a very classy and sexy red.</li>
            <li> Hard enough and for the price is a very good lipstick.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick, it&#x27;s a gorgeous classic shade of dark blue red.  </li>
            <li> Too much mouth movement:</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It stay on really well.</li>
            <li> I really like.</li>
            <li> It really brings out your face.</li>
            <li> Lasts  very well</li>
            <li> The color is such a beautiful deep red and it glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I bought this blindly not knowing if it would be bad, good, or ok</li>
            <li> Due to my skin tone, most lipsticks look fuchsia.</li>
            <li> Color rich and deep like picture, will order this lipstick again</li>
            <li> I had never tried much of this brand, and realized I didn&#x27;t have a true red toned lipstick.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend it to anyone, as this color is true to the picture.</li>
            <li> She saw a new aspect to her fashion style!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a purple/blue red than a orange red.</li>
            <li> But for the price, it&#x27;s a decent, doable color.</li>
            <li> What it looks like on is several shades lighter (even taking into account my lighter skin tone) and in pictures showed up more pink than red even without strong lighting or flash involved</li>
            <li> Very pretty red.</li>
            <li> This is a little more blood orange-y than I&#x27;d have preferred.</li>
            <li> Did have to reapply after a few hours but better than having stained lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great quality, but it feels good on.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Color looks dark but goes on a little bit brighter than I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Still a very nice color</li>
            <li> I have one of those tricky skin tones that usually do not work well with reds, but when a friend of mine told me I should try this particular shade I did.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice, lasts well, only a little drying--</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, and tends to fade quickly in the middle, so reapplying it open it pretty necessary.</li>
            <li> Not really a good kind if lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is the first red lipstick I&#x27;ve ever worn</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a red lipstick freak...have tons of them.</li>
            <li> My favorite red and the only red that I will wear!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very strong red just enough to be glamorous, very satisfied</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> i was pleasantly surprised by this add-on item.</li>
            <li> but oh well and it came on Sunday and a day early üëèüëè</li>
            <li> I needed red lipstick, mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stay as its said it was wasted moneyeven though it was cheap to me</li>
            <li> and as i can tell it lasts very well only</li>
            <li> The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t last too long and transfers easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this lipstick expecting a vibrant red color and it was a little bit darker than expected but other than that it was great to have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic, deep, movie star, serious and sultry kind of red.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty much as expected - what surprised me was the amount of time the lipstick remained after application, I eventually had to wash the stain off my lips which is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars - for me.</li>
            <li> The fact that it wasn&#x27;t true to color when worn, and the need to either frequently apply or rely heavily on lip liner or powder to help set it costs the lipstick two stars.</li>
            <li> This particular color is a true red with very little orange which I like.</li>
            <li> It also has pretty long lasting color!</li>
            <li> this bloody red lipstick is perfect for that kissable lips!</li>
            <li> Lipstick was smearing right and left with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> After a couple of days of using it I noticed my lips were a bit more dry than usual</li>
            <li> I normally wear more expensive brands</li>
            <li> Well the color is more of a &amp;#34;true red&amp;#34;, exactly what I was afraid might happen.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is nowhere near the color red like pictured.  </li>
            <li> I work 8hr shifts where I talk ALOT, it doesn&#x27;t smear , but about right away the 6hr mark it does begin to look a little duller, so I touch up.</li>
            <li> Highly suggest this long wearing lipstick!!</li>
            <li> It does need to be carefully applied, as it is hard to wipe off and will smear, which has been my experience with most lipsticks this color.</li>
            <li> but since I am a casual makeup wearer, perhaps I am better suited to lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I wish it was actually long lasting lipstick.</li>
            <li> but I find a lot of their colors do not last as long as they claim.</li>
            <li> For Christmas I decided to splurge on quite a few new lipsticks.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that I had intense feathering all over from this product..</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t stay on for long.  </li>
            <li> No lipstick seems to stay long with me.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> not really red as expected</li>
            <li> and it was received at a much earlier date than I expected.</li>
            <li> love this shade and the feeling of this lipstick and on the less expensive side.</li>
            <li> its so dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too dry even when used with lip balm.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin so the shade of red was not a match.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it gets everywhere and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lighter color than expected</li>
            <li> It does smell a little strange, but I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I know other women might need and appreciate the &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I usually prefer neutral colors but this is one red</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to buy the other shades as well.</li>
            <li> but it can feel a little dry.</li>
            <li> After putting it on, I felt like a very pretty, very expensive whore.</li>
            <li> so i wish it was a little darker.</li>
            <li> The color is not as the pic, it is a little bit differentt; however, I like the way it looks</li>
            <li> First off, I received a lipstick with the barcode crudely sharpied off which was odd, but that isn&#x27;t why I&#x27;m marking this down.</li>
            <li> I reapply every few hours to keep my lips moist.</li>
            <li> it smell like fruit punch, and completely harsh for my complexion .</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this everyday for about a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of scents and this seems to have one.</li>
            <li> if you aren&#x27;t expert at applying lipstick it will not easily come off if you miss your lips</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awful blue red, but the lipstick itself is a brownish red</li>
            <li> I am clumsy with lipstick, therefore I am always getting it on everything - mugs, cups, my teeth ...</li>
            <li> Not a good color.</li>
            <li> The shape is awkward, making it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> but little bit lip gloss and taadaaa!!!!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I bought expensive lipsticks before, like Lacome, Elizabeth Arden.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this color</li>
            <li> did sorry  </li>
            <li> which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> because of my bad lip condition and because my lips peel drink this time of year with the cold</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not what I expected but my niece loves it.</li>
            <li> I love it for the bright red hue and for the vegan ingredients so I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t stay on for long.  No lipstick seems to stay long with me.  Too much mouth movement: lol.</li>
            <li> I love this shade and lipstick and it has remained my favorite. I am clumsy with lipstick, therefore I am always getting it on everything - mugs, cups, my teeth ... but that is another story and not the fault of this gorgeously smooth lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it to anyone, as this color is true to the picture.</li>
            <li> Great lipstick, only put on once or twice a day, depends if you wipe your lips with tissue it will not get weak&amp;#62; lighter. Just one thing i thought it was going to be darker. I think the photo graphs from these lipsticks should be taken under true light so customers can see the real color.</li>
            <li> I like the color, it is very vibrant. The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t last too long and transfers easily.</li>
            <li> This is a true true red.  Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s a wonderful red color.</li>
            <li> Nice color. Flakes a bit, but I like it overall.</li>
            <li> While I use and love many other rimmel products I detest this lipstick. The color bleeds even with liner. Its not quite  the shade of red I thought it would be and it has a bit of a perfume taste and smell.  I just don&#x27;t care for it very much. Swatch it and smell it in store.</li>
            <li> This color is bright and beautiful!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. It&#x27;s so pigmented, so beautiful, has a great exterior AND has a light fragrance. It goes on very smoothly and I would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color. Great for events.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, just expected it to be a darker red. It&#x27;s definitely blue toned I just wanted a darker blue tone</li>
            <li> Looks red but has an orange tint.</li>
            <li> Giving this four stars because my girlfriend was surprised to find this darker than expected. But it&#x27;s okay, it was actually a welcoming surprise for her. She saw a new aspect to her fashion style!</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous. I wish it was actually long lasting lipstick. It&#x27;s not great quality, but it feels good on. Though if you plan on eating or drinking, you will need to reapply. It will not stay. If you want color that won&#x27;t come off, this is not it. But it&#x27;s a good price to try different shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly it lasts longer if you apply translucent powder on top to set it. I haven&#x27;t tried this yet, but hopefully that will solve some of my issues with this.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Love the high gloss and feel on my lips.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite red lipstic. this is the glossy version of ruby woo just amazing.</li>
            <li> Let me tell u how I love this lip stick smells good an goes on smooth</li>
            <li> Color is great, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long at all!</li>
            <li> the finish this gives on my lips is the one that makes lips more alluring. so great a lipstick that i don&#x27;t even need to buy another lipstick brand.</li>
            <li> Very sexy red color. The perfect red for my skin color. I wear it almost daily and get many compliments. I hope Rimmel never stops making this color.</li>
            <li> its not eay to apply over lips..its so dry</li>
            <li> Not the color I ordered!!!üòí. It does smell great though.</li>
            <li> I have one of those tricky skin tones that usually do not work well with reds, but when a friend of mine told me I should try this particular shade I did. It was perfect with my skin tone and its just a lovely shade of red. Rimmel did not disappoint its affordable, a lot of great colors, and this lipsticks lasts with the need of the occasional touch up. I normally wear more expensive brands but I find a lot of their colors do not last as long as they claim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too dry even when used with lip balm.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing but I have warm skin tone so i wish it was a little darker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very strong red just enough to be glamorous, very satisfied</li>
            <li> Nice and beautiful, the color is a little darker than I expected, but still love it.</li>
            <li> Didint like the color after all its too dark but it was a good product rich color and smooth will purchase another but in a diffrent color.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty much as expected - what surprised me was the amount of time the lipstick remained after application, I eventually had to wash the stain off my lips which is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars - for me. I know other women might need and appreciate the &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; effect, and don&#x27;t mind a bit of staining. Some color instead of none - but since I am a casual makeup wearer, perhaps I am better suited to lip gloss.</li>
            <li> love this color so much favorite lip stick ever</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it.!!</li>
            <li> sexy but the big bang lacquer is better</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick. The colors are great. Delivery was earlier than I expected. Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Bright red color! You can&#x27;t go wrong. I found it does stain your lips a bit, but doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Love this color! (kate 001), it is the perfect shade of red for my skin color (tan to olive skin tone) and it smells really good too. It goes on smooth, lasts for a few hours. i was pleasantly surprised by this add-on item. Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I have the 001 and is a beautiful and intense red . Hard enough and for the price is a very good lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever lipstick purchase and I must say... I LOVE love love this shade and the feeling of this lipstick and on the less expensive side. Did have to reapply after a few hours but better than having stained lips.</li>
            <li> This is a super bold lipstick choice, matte.  I like it but I can&#x27;t wear it often as it&#x27;s just tooooo strong.  I actually try to use it very sparingly when I put it on and then blot as much as I can, and still come up with a good coverage at a color that isn&#x27;t screaming at me/you/any observer.</li>
            <li> It smells really good.</li>
            <li> this lipstick makes me more alluring to men - and even - women</li>
            <li> I prefer the Revlon.  However this was also a good choice.  Even though I&#x27;m older, my friends say the darker red looks best on me  Norma Heagy</li>
            <li> Super pigmented! Stays on for a decent amount of time, and comes off easy. It also doesn&#x27;t stain, which is good for a red lipstick. Smells nice; good quality makeup; awesome price!</li>
            <li> This red is beautiful on my skin tone. Even my father who HATES red lipstick told me that it looked great.</li>
            <li> love love love it. i&#x27;m not the person who put lipstick, i was a lip gloss girl. but as i put on this red lipstick it looks so beautiful on me. true to color. i would buy it again. matte finish and not that glossy one. but little bit lip gloss and taadaaa!!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a deep blue/red with a matte finish, something like the picture. Well the color is more of a &amp;#34;true red&amp;#34;, exactly what I was afraid might happen. Anyway, I&#x27;ll wear it, but buyer beware. It wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping for. Lesson learned!!</li>
            <li> It was a bit more bright than i expected. It does not last many hours.</li>
            <li> Amazing color, beautifulüòç</li>
            <li> Very nice color, nice matte look to it.</li>
            <li> Its a gorgeous red. love it . would recommend it . It looks good on brown skin.</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty and is probably flattering for most skin types. It does need to be carefully applied, as it is hard to wipe off and will smear, which has been my experience with most lipsticks this color. It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, and tends to fade quickly in the middle, so reapplying it open it pretty necessary. That said, it is a fun color, smooth and easy to apply and nice quality.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the fact that it is Matte</li>
            <li> Very pretty red. I use a lip liner with it and the color stays well most of the day. I reapply every few hours to keep my lips moist.</li>
            <li> After putting it on, I felt like a very pretty, very expensive whore. And then when I had to apply it again, 3 minutes later, I got the same results!! So ladies (and gents, if that&#x27;s your thing. I&#x27;m very open-minded and good for you!) if you have time for 20 mini-breaks within every hour to re-apply your lipstick, then this is perfect for you! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The color was a bit lighter than I expected, but still a good lipstick. First time trying red, and it was a good color overall.</li>
            <li> it smell like fruit punch, and completely harsh for my complexion .</li>
            <li> this bloody red lipstick is perfect for that kissable lips!</li>
            <li> not really red as expected</li>
            <li> Love it wish a tad bit darker  but oh well and it came on Sunday and a day early üëèüëè</li>
            <li> My favorite drugstore choice for a red lip. Not too dark, not to bright, simply classic. Great smooth formula, hydrating, does not bleed or feather, although I prefer to wear with a lip pencil when I won&#x27;t have time for touch ups, otherwise I wear it alone. Easy to wear gloss over if that is your thing, but I prefer it on its own. I find myself reaching for this lipstick over my Mac Ruby Woo as it&#x27;s easier to work with.</li>
            <li> I needed red lipstick, mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> THIS IS PERFECT! I&#x27;m a redhead. I have a fair complexion, but not too light. This has been, by far, the BEST red lipstick I have ever worn.</li>
            <li> loved loved loved! came quick!! was cheaper than the store very happy! love the color! beautiful color one of my favorite lip sticks</li>
            <li> It stay on really well. I love the color.  It is a really sexy red.</li>
            <li> Due to my skin tone, most lipsticks look fuchsia. But #1 and #10 don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a checkout girl in a supermarket wearing it. She told me CSV carried that brand. I bought my first two, and was very happy with them. Never had a chance to go back to CSV to buy more until yesterday. But CSV o longer carries them. Called Ultra. Again. No longer available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought expensive lipsticks before, like Lacome, Elizabeth Arden. $30 a lipstick. They don&#x27;t look that great on me, And they certainly don&#x27;t last long. I love Kate. But I guess this inexpensive brand does not bring in enough profit so the stores stop carrying it. As a result, you have to buy them online. The cost is $2.38 per item, but you have to pay about $5 for shipping. And if you buy multiple items from the same store, you pay multiple shipping. What a highway robbery!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this shade was a deep burgundy red but when I applied the lipstick it actually had an orange undertone. I have dark skin so the shade of red was not a match. The lipstick itself is great.</li>
            <li> Stays on and looks so smooth, not sticky or oily. I would recommend this if you dare to wear red lipstick at times. I usually prefer neutral colors but this is one red I really like.</li>
            <li> I like the very nice !!!&lt;br /&gt;I want buying again</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lipstick. It goes on smoothly. Stays on.</li>
            <li> It is so moist, deep color pigmentation. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of scents and this seems to have one.</li>
            <li> The color really lasts &amp; is nice &amp; bold.</li>
            <li> I wanted a red lipstick and found this one so I thought I would give it a try. I love the color but it can feel a little dry.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shade of red lipstick. The color looks exactly like the picture. Very pleased</li>
            <li> Not really a good kind if lipstick. The shade is deceiving. It didnt meet my expectation</li>
            <li> The color is not as the pic, it is a little bit differentt; however, I like the way it looks</li>
            <li> For Christmas I decided to splurge on quite a few new lipsticks. I had never tried much of this brand, and realized I didn&#x27;t have a true red toned lipstick. This lipstick is creamy and glides on easily. The pigmentation is flawless. My one complaint is that I had intense feathering all over from this product..keep in mind I didn&#x27;t wear a lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: This is more of a deeper red. It shows a bit darker rather than brighter on my face. Also, this lipstick has a pretty strong scent. I actually like it, but if scented lipstick bothers you it definitely is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Added a swatch. I have very fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Edit: The lipstick shade is 001.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright lipstick overall. It smells good</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous red lipstick. If you want a red lipstick and you&#x27;re unsure about which shade of red, this is a safe one that would look good on any skin tone. It&#x27;s not a flirty, shimmery, girly type of red. It&#x27;s a classic, deep, movie star, serious and sultry kind of red. It&#x27;s more of a purple/blue red than a orange red. The color is very deep and saturated. I would recommend this for any woman of any skin color, it is a very classy and sexy red. Makes you feel like a porn star. Or royalty.</li>
            <li> Love the color&lt;br /&gt; Better then MAC</li>
            <li> it arrived right away and this is my favorite red to throw on during the fall and winter season. i don&#x27;t wear it with a lip liner and it dosent run or smudge its a creamy matte finish and it lasts all day. because of my bad lip condition and because my lips peel drink this time of year with the cold it helps to condition lips before using it because matte lipstick does show EVERYTHING!! but i would not trade this color for the world</li>
            <li> Color rich and deep like picture, will order this lipstick again</li>
            <li> This is the one red lipstick I use on many of my clients.  Its such a universal red.  It soft and smooth finish is outstanding.</li>
            <li> This is the first red lipstick I&#x27;ve ever worn that didn&#x27;t make me look and feel like a literal clown. It&#x27;s a super flattering color and I love the texture! I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Great shade, but needed constant reapplication to stay vibrant!</li>
            <li> Let me just say this is an amazing product... hands down the best I have ever own&lt;br /&gt;My Blog posted about this product: http://insanepredict.blogspot.com/2014/11/need-red-chose-rimmel-london.html&lt;br /&gt;You can watch the video there for a more in depth look at the product  or just take my word hands down the best red lipstick I have ever own</li>
            <li> The color is amazing and feels great :)</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT shade of red.  Sexy! Don&#x27;t ever run out because this has now become my &#x27;go to&#x27; color. Love it!</li>
            <li> The color is amazing and the lipstick actually smells fantastic! I know, smell isn&#x27;t a factor for most people, but it definitely is for me :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this color</li>
            <li> Good lip stick was hoping it was darker though.</li>
            <li> The color is absolutely extraordinary . I love it so much! My only complaint is that it gets everywhere and doesn&#x27;t last very long. The shape is awkward, making it hard to apply. I love the fact that it is on the dry side though. I definitely recommend red!</li>
            <li> I thought the finish would have been a bit matte but the colour is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is nowhere near the color red like pictured.  I am very upset with this!</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick such a bold color and makes me look like I&#x27;m from the 40s! Took about 3 weeks to get here but it&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I love that with this lipstick, I only need to re-apply twice or thrice a day. I also like the super bright red color!!! It complements my very fair skin very well I almost look like a vampire when I wear it and yugh, I want to be a vampire!!!</li>
            <li> This is a little more blood orange-y than I&#x27;d have preferred. Not as &#x27;red&#x27; deep red as the photo. But for the price, it&#x27;s a decent, doable color. And yes, tastes okay too.</li>
            <li> This is the red lipstick I have been waiting for all of my life! It&#x27;s a true red, really flaterring, long lasting &amp; it wears off perfectly. Dries up fairly matte which I love and I got a lot of compliments and you can&#x27;t beat the price! After a couple of days of using it I noticed my lips were a bit more dry than usual but it wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a red lipstick freak...have tons of them. And this one rocks! I have spent anywhere from $5.00 -$50.00 on lipsticks and this one was is awesome. It stays. I work 8hr shifts where I talk ALOT, it doesn&#x27;t smear , but about right away the 6hr mark it does begin to look a little duller, so I touch up. So, i&#x27;d say the wear is about 6hrs. It&#x27;s great though. But be care with applying, if you aren&#x27;t expert at applying lipstick it will not easily come off if you miss your lips, it stays where you put it. Highly suggest this long wearing lipstick!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and application. I am seriously in love with this lipstick. I wear it any time I get the chance to</li>
            <li> best red lipstick i have. love it</li>
            <li> best red lipstick i have everrrrrrrrr</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous! I love it! It&#x27;s perfect for pale skin. It really brings out your face. It arrived on time exactly, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted it to be. No packaging defects. It does smell a little strange, but I like the smell. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lipsticks. The color is such a beautiful deep red and it glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t dry out. It also has pretty long lasting color!</li>
            <li> Orange red.  Not a good color.</li>
            <li> One of the best reds so far I renamed it from 001 to pure heaven because it look just that good lol (silly me) but it&#x27;s a really amazing color for all skin tone must have for every woman</li>
            <li> Yuck.  Flaky clumps of red lipstick.  Didn&#x27;t even look nice for 5 minutes.  It immediately makes you look like a hooked whose days have not been kind</li>
            <li> Great price. Well pigmented. But I have braces for one more month. I&#x27;m sure this will look beautiful with straight whites</li>
            <li> I have fallen madly in love with this lipstick it is wonderful it last a good amount of time and it looks good I have been wearing this everyday for about a month and I have no complaints about this product</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness i loved this lipstick it looks very nice and elegant and i love the way it turned out although i am medium but it was gorgeus</li>
            <li> NEW FAVORITE COLOR AND LIPSTICK!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lighter color than expected</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stay as its said it was wasted moneyeven though it was cheap to me did sorry  sale person</li>
            <li> Great color and lasts longer than expected for such a cheap lipstick. Good moisture with matte finish</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick, it&#x27;s a gorgeous classic shade of dark blue red.  It tastes like cherry candy (my favorite flavor on candy) and stays on and bright for hours.  Marvelous, especially considering the price, I like it better than my fancy MAC and Borjois lipsticks</li>
            <li> Bravo Rimmel! This is by far one of the best pigmented and smooth lipsticks I&#x27;ve ever tried. I bought this blindly not knowing if it would be bad, good, or ok and I&#x27;m happy to say that I made the right choice. I can&#x27;t wait to buy the other shades as well. This particular color is a true red with very little orange which I like. Very nice! Kudos Kate Moss!</li>
            <li> Finally a nice red for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The color is fabulous! Smooth finish. Took off one star cause I have to reapply 3 to 4 times in a 10 hour day.</li>
            <li> Product itself us nice, very smooth, packagings great, it smears a little bit easier than most but overall really nice and i would repurchase</li>
            <li> First off, I received a lipstick with the barcode crudely sharpied off which was odd, but that isn&#x27;t why I&#x27;m marking this down. The #001 color looks like a deep cherry red color in the image, and what arrived seemed like it might be a deep red until it was actually put on. What it looks like on is several shades lighter (even taking into account my lighter skin tone) and in pictures showed up more pink than red even without strong lighting or flash involved which was disappointing. It goes on smooth and stays slick without needing any gloss which is nice, but it does not stay put at all. Lipstick was smearing right and left with minimal effort. The fact that it wasn&#x27;t true to color when worn, and the need to either frequently apply or rely heavily on lip liner or powder to help set it costs the lipstick two stars. It is just ok overall.</li>
            <li> Good but the color is very different from the picture</li>
            <li> Brilliant red. Smells good . But it is easy to smudge . Gets on glasses , etc. but if you set it with a clear gloss over it is good. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> My favorite red and the only red that I will wear!  I have bought it for many people and have yet to find someone who didn&#x27;t look amazing in it!  It has a very nice texture and is easy to apply.  Lasts  very well but you may need to reapply later in the day for extended wear.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance, creamy texture, fabulous red color.  A find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I panicked when I looked at the color circle on the bottom of the tube.  It&#x27;s an awful blue red, but the lipstick itself is a brownish red that&#x27;s perfect for every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap glamor doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li> Love this color. Looks great on olive complexion!</li>
            <li> I got 01. Didn&#x27;t come with a seal or anything..&lt;br /&gt;Color looks dark but goes on a little bit brighter than I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Still a very nice color though</li>
            <li> Cheap but very great! This lipstick doesn&#x27;t chap my lips and the color lasts all day, it stays on even after eating or drinking.</li>
            <li> A great product and like the color</li>
            <li> I though the color was going to be to bright but when I used it on my lips it looks like a darker red. I love it, so far it is my favorite red. It is creamy and easy to apply, feels awesome on the lips. For the price it is a very good product, yes it will transfer to cups, food, etc and you may needa lip liner if you want to reduce smudging on the borders of the lips. I use it with no lip liner and had no problems but some people may be picky about that.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t red.  It&#x27;s more like a rusty red.  It&#x27;s still a nice lipstick.  I&#x27;m keeping it.  This would go good if your wearing brown or huntergreen.</li>
            <li> I bought this lipstick expecting a vibrant red color and it was a little bit darker than expected but other than that it was great to have. and it was received at a much earlier date than I expected. good product for the price and smells appealing as well.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is amazing. The pigment lasts for hours and it smells so good! You only need to reapply after drinking or eating, otherwise, it will stay put.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice, lasts well, only a little drying-- but on my skin tone instead of a nice deep red like it appears here, it&#x27;s bright fuschia. Not what I wanted but I guess the product itself is okay!</li>
            <li> beautiful color though a bit lighter than expected. smells wonderfully of cherry and as i can tell it lasts very well only need to reapply sparingly</li>
