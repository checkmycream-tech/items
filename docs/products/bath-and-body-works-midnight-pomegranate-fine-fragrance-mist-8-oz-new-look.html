            <li>My friend had a little bottle solid red, that smelled wonderful, lasted a long time, she would spray her hair, I think I bought the mist , instead of the real perfume, this is weaker &amp; don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly, does not cause my skin (which is extremely sensitive) to break out, and it sprays evenly and to a proper amount.</li>

            <li> I am so glad I found this product because Midnight Pomegranate is no longer sold in Bath and Body Works stores. This bottle is just like what I used to buy from the stores, only cheaper. I would buy it again. I would recommend this to any of my friends. It smells heavenly, does not cause my skin (which is extremely sensitive) to break out, and it sprays evenly and to a proper amount. I use it every day.</li>

            <li> I love this fragrance.... smells nice and long lasting. I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! This is great for a gift....</li>
            <li> i purchased this Christmas last year and i still have a  tiny bit left. worth every&lt;br /&gt;penny.</li>
