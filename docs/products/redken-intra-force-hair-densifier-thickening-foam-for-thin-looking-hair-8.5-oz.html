            <li>Very satisfied!</li>
            <li>This is a great product from what others have told me, but it just didn&#x27;t work with my hair.</li>
            <li>I have good luck with this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine; like a child&#x27;s and has no body on its own.  </li>
            <li>The IntraForce give a really good volume to the hair and make it quite full and nice.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>and this gave a better feel to my hair and made it feel stronger during heat styling---at 1/3 of the cost of this product..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products to help give lift to my thinning hair -- none have worked.  </li>
            <li>Makes me feel as though I have more hair.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair appear thicker with more volume, has a minty smell but thats ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find it &amp; ordered the last 2 this website had!</li>
            <li>Gets your hair clean but do not see the thickening agent working.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and I have tried many, many other thickening products and mousse.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item based on one very positive review.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this product several times and each time I use it I try using more</li>
            <li>Most of the ones I purchased did not have the same effect.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I have been using too much?</li>
            <li>It makes styling my hair a pleasure and, for me, it is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years &amp; only recently was told it was no longer available.</li>
            <li>It definitely made my hair seem denser after the first application.  </li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t feel this product was that special compared to other things I have tried.</li>
            <li>This product is not awful, but not great either.</li>

            <li> Have used this product for years &amp; only recently was told it was no longer available. I was so happy to find it &amp; ordered the last 2 this website had! Hope they continue to carry it!</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair looking volumized. Doesn&#x27;t have an odor or residue. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now. Bottle lasts a while</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Sad to hear it is being discontinued!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mousse!!! I tried several Redken products after my hair stylist mentioned their quality because I have noticed my hair thinning.  You will see and feel the difference of Intra Force Densifier Thickening Foam compared to other mousse products even before you apply it to your hair.  It makes styling my hair a pleasure and, for me, it is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Gets your hair clean but do not see the thickening agent working.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on one very positive review. This product is not awful, but not great either. I don&#x27;t feel that it thickened my hair very much and in some ways it made it feel finer. Maybe I have been using too much? I just didn&#x27;t feel this product was that special compared to other things I have tried. I did try Treseme 24 Hour Blow Dry Lotion and this gave a better feel to my hair and made it feel stronger during heat styling---at 1/3 of the cost of this product.. I will probably use this Intraforce  Densifier until it is gone but I do not plan on purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Wow...an amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. Can&#x27;t believe they are no longer making it!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  My hair is fine, and I have tried many, many other thickening products and mousse.  The IntraForce give a really good volume to the hair and make it quite full and nice.</li>
            <li> This product gives body to my hair but made it too stiff and not as managable as I like.  I prefer Redken 06 Thickening Lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Redkin Intra Force system for thinning hair for about 2 years now and this densifier is awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before and was running out before I would get back to my source -- prime makes my life less stressful.</li>
            <li> This does nothing. not sure what it was suppose to accomplish I used it and it did nothing.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It definitely made my hair seem denser after the first application.  I style my hair after I apply this product and it gives my hair lift.  I&#x27;ve tried many products to help give lift to my thinning hair -- none have worked.  This product, however, does the trick.  Makes me feel as though I have more hair.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product several times and each time I use it I try using more and I try using less and no matter what I do this tends to make my hair look dirty.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I buy this Intra Force as a set....conditioner, shampoo and thickening mousse......I do like it, it does not leave my hair gummy .....I guess it works as well as other products that are used for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give you a raving review on this product, but I found it to make my hair look dirty and heavy.  This is a great product from what others have told me, but it just didn&#x27;t work with my hair.</li>
            <li> I have good luck with this product.  Most of the ones I purchased did not have the same effect.  Company purchased from sent it out right away.  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Definitely helps thicken hair. The key is not to go over board. Too much makes it difficult for hair to take a curl.</li>
            <li> Made my hair appear thicker with more volume, has a minty smell but thats ok. I used it every day.</li>
            <li> I will never go to another product now that I&#x27;ve discovered Intra Force Hair Densifier.  It thickens my hair and makes the style look like it did in the salon.  My hair is very fine; like a child&#x27;s and has no body on its own.  I love this product.</li>
