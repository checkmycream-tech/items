            <li>I have heard good things about Smashbox products from magazines I read (Cosmo, Marie Claire) and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>

            <li>The eyeliner goes on flawlessly, the primer works really well</li>
            <li>Nice product though</li>
            <li>Everything was in a travel size and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>I bought the try me box when i was out of town and wanted some nice make up for going out.</li>
            <li>precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lip gloss:  Really nice, neutral shade.  </li>
            <li>Fun, good stuff!  </li>
            <li>Mascara was fine, primer was good....</li>
            <li>I originally bought this kit specifically to try the primer, which I loved.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many a mascara and this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>be sure to order the trial kit with the foundation and Halo powder.</li>
            <li>so I feel better</li>
            <li>I love the products.  </li>
            <li>But I love the mascara and lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I am light so this worked nicely.</li>
            <li>Smashbox is my favorite makeup brand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love just another reason why I love this brand.</li>
            <li>I know I will :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Works better than others that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Goes on nice smooth and feels</li>
            <li>This is also fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Smashbox, once before, but wasn&#x27;t wanting to purchase the full size items yet without being sure I liked the product.</li>
            <li>I think this product is amazing , its totally true to its word..</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the feel of the primer as it goes on, the lip gloss has a nice tint and even a bit of flavoring to it; the eye primer is really good - comparable to my favorite Urban Decay primer!</li>
            <li>I like the eyeliner the best, followed by the lip gloss (although it is EXTREMELY STICKY).  </li>
            <li>it will complete your look for sure! :)</li>
            <li>The eye liner goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smudge unless you want it to.  </li>
            <li>No clumps and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Creates a smooth surface for applying makeup after.</li>
            <li>VERY worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that i went out and bought the full size product :)</li>
            <li>But when I inquired about the item they were very quick to respond and refunded my money quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the eyeliner or mascara since for higher prices we should get more quality.</li>
            <li>First, the face primer:  It is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Love the mascara it really make my lashes fuller</li>
            <li>I really like Avon&#x27;s primer much better.</li>
            <li>i love just about every product in that case, in exception of the lip gloss, not a fan of it much.</li>
            <li>The product itself was not bad for a sample.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t end up purchasing full size of anything from this kit, although it was fun to try.</li>
            <li>Its very drying brings out fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Eye concealer is good, like any other though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they are super cute and tiny and worth the price</li>
            <li>My favorite is the hyperlash mascara, the brush is like no other.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great way to try a little bit of everything without spending to much.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon for the quick service.</li>
            <li>Due to price though I&#x27;m going to look for a more wallet friendly comparable primer (right now I&#x27;m trying Revlon&#x27;s Photofinish), if I can&#x27;t find one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color though.</li>
            <li>Thank god I bought this first.</li>
            <li>Clear pore concealer goes on smooth and glides on the skin.</li>
            <li>and i work as a waitress in a hot restaurant.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking to try Smashbox products, but doesn&#x27;t know what to try first.</li>
            <li>I paid 29.99 and received exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Next in line... full size versions of everything in this box!</li>
            <li>The primer is nice but not long lasting or hydrating.</li>
            <li>The primer is amazing just a little bit covers my whole face.</li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;ve already ordered another tube</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light on my face and the primers and eyeliner last all day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use lip gloss or primer</li>
            <li>The eyeliner stays on better than any other i&#x27;ve tried before</li>
            <li>Although this was a good way of sampling various Smashbox products, it was a little bit over priced.</li>
            <li>Flakes are around my eye and mainly under/around my bottom</li>
            <li>as usual, the order was filled quickly and correctly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for any woman.</li>
            <li>I love the product,  I would recommend this if you want a little bit of everything</li>
            <li>I prefer my gel eyeliner with a brush if I&#x27;m doing &#x27;cat eyes&#x27; just because it&#x27;s a little quicker for me, so I use it mostly for my waterline.</li>
            <li>On the applicator it looks shiny and smooth, unlike other mascaras that have a matte look and are clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;1.The mascara has dried out my eyelashes so much I lost a chunk right in the middle of my left top eye.</li>
            <li>And since it&#x27;s clear...</li>
            <li>The concealer was my least favorite even with primer under it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit because I&#x27;m about to go on vacation, and needed some of the products that this kit offers.</li>
            <li>I guess, I  will send it back, but really wanted to try the products.  </li>
            <li>The mascara takes soooo freakin long to dry that when I open my eye and my lashes hit the top of my eyelid</li>
            <li>Like the other primer, it goes on smooth and really works as a great base for your eye</li>
            <li>You get to try all of these products for a low price, and they last for a very decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Plus I got addicted to a couple more of the products that I had not yet tried.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner is a hot mess.</li>
            <li>Was worried when I first put it on because it&#x27;s thicker, and I thought it would make my face feel plasticy and heavy</li>
            <li>The contents feel dry and old.</li>

            <li> The contents feel dry and old.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily and sensitive skin and with this brand I have no issues.</li>
            <li> , I would have gone there instead of paying nearly $40 which was not worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> lid primer goes on smoother and more opaque than my other lid primer (L&#x27;Oreal DeCrease), and I was sad when it ran</li>
            <li> Strange product as I&#x27;ve never used anything like it.</li>
            <li> Takes way to long to dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using primers for a very long time.</li>
            <li> We are black women with different tones and everything in the box goes with both of us.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of lipgloss, so I&#x27;ve only used the one included a few times.</li>
            <li> Items  as expected.</li>
            <li> not much for the money</li>
            <li> Makes lips look shiny, but not overly so, like you had just wet</li>
            <li> I did not get this material delivered to me due to a postal service issue.</li>
            <li> They even went to the extreme to offer to send me something in return for not getting what I ordered</li>
            <li> I bought one set for my gym bag and the other one for my travel toiletries</li>
            <li> One for me and the other for my sister.</li>
            <li> Other mascaras have made my lids feel heavy.</li>

            <li> The gloss and mascara are very dry like the make up is past</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was in a package that had a very clearly marked price of 19.99 on it.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>

            <li> Each item is small</li>
            <li> The items were small, but it&#x27;s a &#x27;trial&#x27; kit.  </li>
            <li> so it is hard to tell where I have just applied it on my face.</li>
            <li> Very small packaging.  </li>

            <li> Got this kit and it is really good. Love the mascara it really make my lashes fuller and it&#x27;s a great way to try a little bit of everything without spending to much. I will defiantly be buying the bigger versions of these products.</li>
            <li> Everyone I know is using Smashbox.. So I decided to try this Trial size Kit..  I love the product,  I would recommend this if you want a little bit of everything</li>
            <li> I have heard good things about Smashbox products from magazines I read (Cosmo, Marie Claire) and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  This &#x27;sample-size&#x27; try it kit was a perfect way to introduce me to some of their great products.  I absolutely love the feel of the primer as it goes on, the lip gloss has a nice tint and even a bit of flavoring to it; the eye primer is really good - comparable to my favorite Urban Decay primer! The eye liner goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smudge unless you want it to.  I haven&#x27;t tried the mascara as of yet.  Since purchasing this kit I have bought full-sized versions of Smashbox products as this try it kit has made me a FAN!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this kit. I originally bought this kit specifically to try the primer, which I loved. Due to price though I&#x27;m going to look for a more wallet friendly comparable primer (right now I&#x27;m trying Revlon&#x27;s Photofinish), if I can&#x27;t find one I&#x27;ll suck it up and buy this one. Was worried when I first put it on because it&#x27;s thicker, and I thought it would make my face feel plasticy and heavy but it didn&#x27;t. I wore it alone and with foundation and concealer. (my previous primer looked and felt like a moisturizer, but I didn&#x27;t like it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid primer goes on smoother and more opaque than my other lid primer (L&#x27;Oreal DeCrease), and I was sad when it ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many a mascara and this one is definitely my favorite. No clumps and goes on smooth. Other mascaras have made my lids feel heavy. On the applicator it looks shiny and smooth, unlike other mascaras that have a matte look and are clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of lipgloss, so I&#x27;ve only used the one included a few times. It&#x27;s a pretty color though. :B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner is great, also goes on smooth and creamy. I prefer my gel eyeliner with a brush if I&#x27;m doing &#x27;cat eyes&#x27; just because it&#x27;s a little quicker for me, so I use it mostly for my waterline.</li>
            <li> well, i rated this based on the service from amazon. as usual, the order was filled quickly and correctly. i purchased this for christmas for my wife, so, obviously she hasn&#x27;t used it yet. sephora was recommended by all her friends, and, i am a guy, sooooo i don&#x27;t have a clue if it&#x27;s good, but her friends all say it is. hope this helps anyone looking to buy.  thanks amazon for the quick service.</li>
            <li> Very small packaging.  Items  as expected.</li>
            <li> Daughter in-law asked for it and she loves it.</li>
            <li> The product itself was not bad for a sample. However, the concealer dried up fast. I give it a medium rating because I paid double had I known they have this pack at Macy&#x27;s for $20, I would have gone there instead of paying nearly $40 which was not worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> Although this was a good way of sampling various Smashbox products, it was a little bit over priced. I am in love with the foundation primer, excellent product!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when I saw how little it was. I liked the Mascara and lip gloss. I am not sure I would purchase</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet but they are super cute and tiny and worth the price</li>
            <li> if you have a special even coming up like your wedding/ prom or what not and have to take alot of pictures, THIS is the best stuff!!! be sure to order the trial kit with the foundation and Halo powder. it will complete your look for sure! :)</li>
            <li> I did not get this material delivered to me due to a postal service issue. But when I inquired about the item they were very quick to respond and refunded my money quickly. They even went to the extreme to offer to send me something in return for not getting what I ordered and I did not except, but that is truly remarkable customer service.</li>
            <li> tried it, sort of liked it but it was an impluse buy now I am on Prozac so I feel better</li>
            <li> I bought one set for my gym bag and the other one for my travel toiletries and it&#x27;s awesome. Plus I got addicted to a couple more of the products that I had not yet tried.</li>
            <li> I love the products.  The eyeliner goes on flawlessly, the primer works really well, the skin primer has a weightless feeling on my face.  I loved the mascara so much I&#x27;ve already ordered another tube, it&#x27;s brush has a comb row-what a great idea.</li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing , its totally true to its word..foundation is very light weight and gives you a flawless look ..</li>
            <li> Thank god I bought this first. I will not be buying these products since they are not what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.The mascara has dried out my eyelashes so much I lost a chunk right in the middle of my left top eye.The wand on the mascara is really good, I will try to keep it but the product itself is not good. The mascara takes soooo freakin long to dry that when I open my eye and my lashes hit the top of my eyelid it gets all over my eye lid. I curl my lashes so they go up. Takes way to long to dry. Also it flakes off through the day and looks bad, really bad. Flakes are around my eye and mainly under/around my bottom lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The eyeliner is a hot mess. It smears and  does not stay on. I work 12 hours, nurse, it is gone or messed up at the end of my shift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Eye concealer is good, like any other though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Lip gloss I did like, but others are the same for cheaper. Nice product though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Clear pore concealer goes on smooth and glides on the skin. Strange product as I&#x27;ve never used anything like it. Creates a smooth surface for applying makeup after. I apply it to my fingers then my face, it has almost no feeling when I touch it so it is hard to tell where I have just applied it on my face. And since it&#x27;s clear... yeah lol  takes some getting use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the eyeliner or mascara since for higher prices we should get more quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit wanting to try the primer and concealer.  After receiving it. (very small) The concealer was my least favorite even with primer under it. Its very drying brings out fine lines.  But I love the mascara and lip gloss. The colors they send are neutral I am light so this worked nicely. I like the brown eyeliner but I prefer a non sharpening one, such as maybelines (chestnut) from walmart for 6.00.  The primer is nice but not long lasting or hydrating. I&#x27;ve been using primers for a very long time. I really like Avon&#x27;s primer much better.</li>
            <li> not much for the money</li>
            <li> Smashbox is my favorite makeup brand so this was an inexpensive bonus for me! I&#x27;d like to buy another one!</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail. I&#x27;m so in love just another reason why I love this brand. Everything was in a travel size and packaged nicely. The primer is amazing just a little bit covers my whole face. I have extremely oily and sensitive skin and with this brand I have no issues. It&#x27;s light on my face and the primers and eyeliner last all day. The make up doesn&#x27;t streak over the primer. For anyone wanting to try smashbox I say buy this. I know I will :)</li>
            <li> I bought the try me box when i was out of town and wanted some nice make up for going out. I absolutely love it. I have been using the eyeliner and mascara everyday since then (almost 3 months) and, since i can&#x27;t really afford to buy this stuff otherwise, will be buying another try it kit soon. The eyeliner stays on better than any other i&#x27;ve tried before and i work as a waitress in a hot restaurant. The mascara doesn&#x27;t look clumpy or flaky. I don&#x27;t really use lip gloss or primer but i did try them and the gloss is a  good color and the primers are great when you&#x27;re going for an airbrushed look. I have and will continue to recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Just received my \\&quot;Try It\\&quot; kit, and it&#x27;s exactly as pictured. I purchased this kit because I&#x27;m about to go on vacation, and needed some of the products that this kit offers. I&#x27;ve tried Smashbox, once before, but wasn&#x27;t wanting to purchase the full size items yet without being sure I liked the product. Also, the size of items included in this kit is perfect for traveling. I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s wanting to try out Smashbox, or for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the seller - I&#x27;m happy with the amount of time it took for me to receive my items. There were only two shipping options (Standard or Expedited) and with the expedited shipping I ordered this on Sunday and received it on Wednesday. All items were securly packaged, nothing was damaged.</li>
            <li> The contents feel dry and old. The gloss and mascara are very dry like the make up is past it&#x27;s use by date. Disappointed...</li>
            <li> First, the face primer:  It is fantastic!  Works better than others that I have tried.  Goes on nice smooth and feels great on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyelash primer:  This is also fantastic!  Like the other primer, it goes on smooth and really works as a great base for your eye make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyeliner:  One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Very smooth and precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lip gloss:  Really nice, neutral shade.  Makes lips look shiny, but not overly so, like you had just wet them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mascara:  This one, I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with.  The brush was the problem.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me to give me the type of look I wanted.  Seemed prone to making my eyelashes clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a great buy!  You get to try all of these products for a low price, and they last for a very decent amount of time.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to try Smashbox products, but doesn&#x27;t know what to try first.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because it was recommended by a friend.  Since I am now a prime member I thought I would just order through amazon.  I paid 29.99 and received exactly what I was looking for.  Unfortunately it was in a package that had a very clearly marked price of 19.99 on it.&lt;br /&gt;Now who feels like a fool?  I guess, I  will send it back, but really wanted to try the products.  Again,  I just became a prime member and wanted to use this exclusively, but now I don&#x27;t  trust what is printed.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will leave it up to Amazon!</li>
            <li> Each item is small so you obviously get just enough to try it 3 to 4 times, depending on the item. I am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried smashbox makeup and this was a great starter set to see what the quality was like.  The items were small, but it&#x27;s a &#x27;trial&#x27; kit.  :)  VERY worth the money.</li>
            <li> This kit is aaaaamaziiiiiiing!!!! i love just about every product in that case, in exception of the lip gloss, not a fan of it much. My favorite is the hyperlash mascara, the brush is like no other. I love it so much that i went out and bought the full size product :) The face primer keeps my foundation on all day. The eyeliner pencil color works great for my skin complexion. The lid primer make my eye shadows look great all day.</li>
            <li> I bought two boxes of this. One for me and the other for my sister. We are black women with different tones and everything in the box goes with both of us. I highly recommend this for any woman. Next in line... full size versions of everything in this box!</li>
            <li> Fun, good stuff!  I like the eyeliner the best, followed by the lip gloss (although it is EXTREMELY STICKY).  Mascara was fine, primer was good....I didn&#x27;t end up purchasing full size of anything from this kit, although it was fun to try.</li>
