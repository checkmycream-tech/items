            <li>&amp; IT WAS A GREAT COLOR.</li>
            <li>Excellent product! :-)</li>
            <li>Good for highlights,  not brassy.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>where I spray it looks blended right into my color and covers my roots perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love the color though!</li>
            <li>Great for a laugh or for Halloween though!</li>
            <li>It looks more reddish.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>good for halloween party ;)</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t rub off on my car upholstery, and washed out easily in the shower.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily but need to put it on after you style your hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for quite a few years and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>The Jerome Russell sprays are great to cover greys and also to spray on hair or extensions for extra color and shine!</li>
            <li>I think everyone should have one of these bottles in the right shade for them!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t die my hair and want to write a review for fun.</li>
            <li>THE PRICE WAS RIGHT</li>
            <li>Spray is good for dark root touch ups</li>
            <li>Make hair kind of dry and straw like.  </li>
            <li>More yellowy orange than blonde.  </li>
            <li>Worked fine to color my son&#x27;s brown hair blonde for a costume.</li>
            <li>I did use the entire can on his short hair and it was barely enough as you have to spray a lot for good coverage, and this makes the hair hard and crunchy, but that was great for his spiky-haired costume look.</li>
            <li>Very convinient.  </li>
            <li>(beware, its sprayer is powerful, so wear a towel over your clothes and be prepared to clean up any doors, walls, sinks, mirrors in the hairspray&#x27;s path.</li>
            <li>It is very glossy and does not look natural.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and is not sticky.</li>
            <li>Think old lady perfume!  </li>
            <li>it can last a couple of days and still wash out without &amp;#34;staining&amp;#34; your real hair color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like the stuff I used to use at Halloween when I was a kid.....and just like that stuff there is no way this color can be considered natural.  </li>
            <li>At first this product didn&#x27;t look too bad, especially if you just wanted a few streaks for a night out (in dim lights:) but using over your whole hair, it looked cheap and Halloweenish.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not like those stiff Halloween colors, it really adds soft highlights to your hair.</li>
            <li>However, the past year and a half, I have had so many defective spray botlles</li>
            <li>This product barely added any blonde to the hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> did not last long used maybe 8 times.</li>
            <li> Definitely isn&#x27;t what we expected when trying to get blonde hair for Halloween</li>
            <li> I have lots of white in my hair and didn&#x27;t want yellow or pink or some strange color stain.  </li>
            <li> Works fine otherwise, just the wrong color.</li>
            <li> Just something I&#x27;ve learned from long time use</li>
            <li> I definitely should have listened to the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Not golden blonde, but like gold spray paint.</li>

            <li> Like it a lot, have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells like something your grandmom would wear only worse.  </li>
            <li> the spray will dry in it and make it very hard to use.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and was hoping this would at least fake some blonde for Halloween.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t care about my roots anyway</li>
            <li> Used this in past- like having it on hand for roots between hair appts.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> and I use it for subtle highlighting.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on and it looked ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Not good</li>
            <li> The worse part of it is the odor which does not dissipate even after hours.</li>
            <li> This is not a bleach blonde spray - it is  a metallic shiny gold - and was horrible.</li>
            <li> It does the job of covering up the roots, however it has a bit of an orangy tint and it smells awful.  </li>
            <li> This is horrible for use on your hair.</li>
            <li> Orange color, looks horrible!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not a fan.  I have dark hair and was hoping this would at least fake some blonde for Halloween.  No such luck.  It&#x27;s basically gold spray paint.  I guess if you are already fair-haired and want a tinsey touch up it might work, but for darker hair - no way.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to cover up my roots while my hair stylist is on maternity leave.  It does the job of covering up the roots, however it has a bit of an orangy tint and it smells awful.  Think old lady perfume!  I guess it will have to do until she comes back!</li>
            <li> Good for highlights,  not brassy.  I used it to highlight with a deeper color in a stage production hair style.  Great news it can last a couple of days and still wash out without &amp;#34;staining&amp;#34; your real hair color.  I have lots of white in my hair and didn&#x27;t want yellow or pink or some strange color stain.  I was happy.  If you spray and over spray it will build up and get gummy.</li>
            <li> Always an excellent product and service-Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I use it for subtle highlighting. When put it on then brush it in it works. The spray cap needs to be washed out after you use it- the spray will dry in it and make it very hard to use. Just something I&#x27;ve learned from long time use</li>
            <li> This is horrible for use on your hair. It is very glossy and does not look natural. Maybe it could be used for making crafts.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years and was very happy with it. However, the past year and a half, I have had so many defective spray botlles, it&#x27;s ridiculous. It sprays air, but no color. I have contacted the company  and gotten no response. I will not orger this product again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not like those stiff Halloween colors, it really adds soft highlights to your hair. I use it when my hair is growing out for highlighting streaks. think I ordered 3 cans, since can&#x27;t find it in this town.</li>
            <li> Spray is good for dark root touch ups</li>
            <li> I definitely should have listened to the other reviewers. It&#x27;s GOLD. Not golden blonde, but like gold spray paint. Works fine otherwise, just the wrong color.</li>
            <li> This product barely added any blonde to the hair.  It looks more reddish.  Definitely isn&#x27;t what we expected when trying to get blonde hair for Halloween</li>
            <li> did not last long used maybe 8 times. Love the color though!</li>
            <li> More yellowy orange than blonde.  Not good</li>
            <li> This stuff is ridiculous. It&#x27;s a shiny gold color with what looks like glitter.</li>
            <li> I did a test run with this product before I decided to go out in public and I&#x27;m glad I did.  At first this product didn&#x27;t look too bad, especially if you just wanted a few streaks for a night out (in dim lights:) but using over your whole hair, it looked cheap and Halloweenish.  The worse part of it is the odor which does not dissipate even after hours. It&#x27;s smells like something your grandmom would wear only worse.  Yuk!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t care about my roots anyway but thought I&#x27;d give this a try just to see if it made a difference.  It&#x27;s just like the stuff I used to use at Halloween when I was a kid.....and just like that stuff there is no way this color can be considered natural.  I sprayed it on and it looked ridiculous.  Great for a laugh or for Halloween though!</li>
            <li> If you want to look like Miley Cyrus for halloween, this does the trick.  Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend for every day use, but for costumes, go for it.  (beware, its sprayer is powerful, so wear a towel over your clothes and be prepared to clean up any doors, walls, sinks, mirrors in the hairspray&#x27;s path.</li>
            <li> Used this in past- like having it on hand for roots between hair appts. Excellent delivery service</li>
            <li> Great for Halloween for a temp color.</li>
            <li> good for halloween party ;)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product. The color matches my expectations and it matches my hair perfectly.  It looks very natural and is not sticky. I spray it on after I have styled my hair and being careful how I spray and where I spray it looks blended right into my color and covers my roots perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is not a bleach blonde spray - it is  a metallic shiny gold - and was horrible.</li>
            <li> I have no idea. I don&#x27;t die my hair and want to write a review for fun.</li>
            <li> I think everyone should have one of these bottles in the right shade for them!  The Jerome Russell sprays are great to cover greys and also to spray on hair or extensions for extra color and shine!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  Very convinient.  I can be blonde today and brunette again tomorrow.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Worked fine to color my son&#x27;s brown hair blonde for a costume. Didn&#x27;t rub off on my car upholstery, and washed out easily in the shower. I did use the entire can on his short hair and it was barely enough as you have to spray a lot for good coverage, and this makes the hair hard and crunchy, but that was great for his spiky-haired costume look.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! :-)</li>
            <li> Make hair kind of dry and straw like.  Washes out easily but need to put it on after you style your hair.</li>
            <li> Orange color, looks horrible!</li>
            <li> THE PRICE WAS RIGHT &amp; IT WAS A GREAT COLOR.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot, have dark brown hair and I like to use this for highlights.  Hard to find in stores.</li>
