            <li>This product works great!  </li>
            <li>It has reduced the depth of the wrinkles on my forehead, vanished the ones around my mouth and the best part is that it firms the jawline up for those of you over 50, like me!  </li>

            <li>I read all the reviews and thought this would be great.  </li>
            <li>It does make your skin feel good but hasn&#x27;t helped at all.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>My girl loved it and swears by it now</li>
            <li>One thing good about it is it didn&#x27;t break my face out.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the resulted, I applied it for two weeks on one side of my face and saw noticeable  improvement  </li>
            <li>There is so many products I have tried and Redeaux has worked the best most products I used was more exspensive than Redeaux.</li>
            <li>I bought this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>i used it when my wife had it out, its amazing.</li>
            <li>This product works amazing</li>
            <li>nice feel on your skin.</li>
            <li>Really great really works</li>
            <li>Not to sure yet.</li>
            <li>and it is paraben free!</li>
            <li>but i love it.</li>
            <li>ok d</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into magic potions, but gave this a shot</li>
            <li>I have neglected my skin for many years.</li>
            <li>and I love the price.</li>
            <li>and it does what it says it will do and on my old face that is great.  </li>
            <li>Just a good moisturizer with high price !</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a noticable reduction in my fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Not one FINE line is gone and my skin is NOT brighter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a super cream!</li>
            <li>I am trying this because it was supposed to have a great following.  </li>
            <li>It has especially given me great results on my neck/decollete area.</li>
            <li>Friendly,consistent, fast delivery!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results so far!</li>
            <li>I did not see any significant change in my skin.</li>
            <li>The packaging is good (a product should never be in an open jar where bacteria from your fingers and light can get to it) and the fragrance-free aspect is a plus (fragrance is an irritant to the skin),</li>
            <li>she asks me to order her another one (it makes her feel special that I order it for her)....</li>
            <li>I find my skin looks better, my &#x27;smokers&#x27; lines above my top lip are not so noticeable.</li>
            <li>This product consistently came up on several reputable websites as the top performer.</li>
            <li>Wrinkle Redeaux did an amazing job of firming my skin, slightly lifting the jaw line, and giving my face a healthy look.</li>
            <li>Buy this for your wife or girlfriend, you might win some brownie points with very little effort...</li>
            <li>(my parents have those, too) and spent several weeks conducting both primary and secondary online research to find the absolute best anti-wrinkle product available.</li>
            <li>but beyond that there&#x27;s nothing much positive to say.</li>
            <li>not so much, didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>2 weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference so</li>
            <li>really like this product.</li>
            <li>Finished the whole tube with no results really.  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>worked really well around the corners of the eyes.</li>
            <li>It is also priced reasonably.  </li>
            <li>a tube is supposed to be filled - not just half full.  </li>
            <li>DID NOT WORK NOT EVEN REPLACING PREPARATION (H)  IN OTHER AREAS.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li>My expectations were realistic -</li>
            <li>I live in the desert</li>
            <li>There was no reduction in wrinkles in my face, in fact, my skin continued to add new wrinkles.</li>
            <li>When I first applied it, my face started burning, broke out in hives, red bumps all over my face.  </li>
            <li>Refrain helps all these to make my skin look tighter, smooth and less age lines.  </li>
            <li>Seems like it is an old product-</li>
            <li>old, I cannot expect miracles but this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Not sure about reducing the appearance of fine lines but</li>
            <li>tube was sealed but only half filled.  </li>
            <li>so it is key to take care of this area as early as possible!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weird because the ingredients are the right ones and they are in the right concentration, but it just didn&#x27;t do anything; in fact, it left my skin drier than ever before.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This definitely helped smooth out the dramatic lines and soften my overall look.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on sensitive skin and does not have an irritating fragrance.</li>
            <li> Ignored my skin as a kid, but now in my mature age, I noticed my skin is dryer, not as tight and age lines.  </li>
            <li> so maybe it&#x27;s not strong enough for a dry climate</li>
            <li> A total waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use there is absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> I paid for a lot of empty space.  </li>
            <li> I follwed the instructions and waited patiently for the results that were expected due to the advertisement and the favorable reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 and have some small lines under my eyes, one on my forehead, and two deep wrinkles on my neck</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all due to this cream...</li>
            <li> I did not see any visible difference in this product from any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> Be very careful when using it.</li>
            <li> Do not use everyday or it will over dry your skin!</li>
            <li> not fresh.</li>
            <li> I have tried others but they don&#x27;t make my skin feel same way, plus is not as expensive as other anti-wrinkle products.</li>
            <li> I had issues with the viscosity of the cream as it was very thin and traveled into my eyes and mouth before having time to completely absorb.</li>
            <li> Actually, I look the same except for the disappointed expression I have due to the money I wasted!</li>
            <li> However, everyone&#x27;s skin is different and unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> I realize this is not a laser or filler - but I did expect to see at least some improvement.</li>
            <li> Sadly, my container is almost empty and nothing has changed.</li>
            <li> I was seriously disapointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this product is not good.</li>
            <li> This product is fake they don&#x27;t work, probably all this review is fake, I tried to get my money back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing, nada, zilch, zero, negative!!!  </li>
            <li> I have no doubt this product may work for others as the reviews state, just not me :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> very unhappy with product.</li>
            <li> I hate to admit it, but I have wrinkles.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best product on the market. Works for me when i dont get enough sleep</li>
            <li> I hate to admit it, but I have wrinkles.  When I son said I looked great except for the wrinkles, I had to accept it.  I am trying this because it was supposed to have a great following.  It&#x27;s been almost a month and I can see some improvement.  I&#x27;ll keep fighting.</li>
            <li> very unhappy with product. Seems like it is an old product- not fresh. Would definitely not purchase again. Have seen no results of anything after 3 months.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin drier the next day.  Makes it flake.  But, when used it seems to reduce wrinkles.  Do not use everyday or it will over dry your skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy but this cream definitely  protects my face from the elements and it has already made me look younger and people say that the wrinkles have disappeared greatly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost two months and have seen no visible changes.  It does make your skin feel good but hasn&#x27;t helped at all. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Really great really works I bought for my wife</li>
            <li> Not to sure yet. you never no with all the stuff they try to sale u .But i will give it till the end of 8-31-11 and see..I&#x27;M hoping it takes out some wrinkles..</li>
            <li> Friendly,consistent, fast delivery!!!  This product continues to keep my skin hydrated throughout the day and night. It has especially given me great results on my neck/decollete area. The neck ages 7 years earlier than the face so it is key to take care of this area as early as possible! The addition bonus to this product is that it yields amazng results and it is paraben free!</li>
            <li> Good. I&#x27;ve been using for one month now.  I find my skin looks better, my &#x27;smokers&#x27; lines above my top lip are not so noticeable.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I hoped it would be.  I don&#x27;t see a noticable reduction in my fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Ignored my skin as a kid, but now in my mature age, I noticed my skin is dryer, not as tight and age lines.  Refrain helps all these to make my skin look tighter, smooth and less age lines.  Recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is fake they don&#x27;t work, probably all this review is fake, I tried to get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;No body answer the phone or email. Please don&#x27;t buy this product is not good.</li>
            <li> not so much, didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
            <li> I could not use it as I broke out in a rash.</li>
            <li> great product and it does what it says it will do and on my old face that is great.  thanks</li>
            <li> I was seriously disapointed in this product.  I follwed the instructions and waited patiently for the results that were expected due to the advertisement and the favorable reviews. Nothing, nada, zilch, zero, negative!!!  Not one FINE line is gone and my skin is NOT brighter. Actually, I look the same except for the disappointed expression I have due to the money I wasted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for approx. 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference so far.&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this product is that it makes your face shinny even if you take a paper towl and pat your face with it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t want to walk around looking like I&#x27;m using something.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in skin after 2 months of using.  I live in the desert so maybe it&#x27;s not strong enough for a dry climate</li>
            <li> this product really works but it takes a few weeks to see the difference and you have to keep using it but i love it. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I just order my second one. Since I started using it my skin feels firmer. Not sure about reducing the appearance of fine lines but couple of days ago I had a video call with a relative that I haven&#x27;t seen for couple of months and he ask me if I had something done because I look fresher....&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product. I have tried others but they don&#x27;t make my skin feel same way, plus is not as expensive as other anti-wrinkle products.</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK NOT EVEN REPLACING PREPARATION (H)  IN OTHER AREAS.  :)&lt;br /&gt;/////////&lt;br /&gt; O O&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#60;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY FACE STILL LOOKS LIKE THE MAP OF CALIFORNIA</li>
            <li> I bought this amazing product.  It&#x27;s incredible.  You have to get it!</li>
            <li> just a lotion.  Finished the whole tube with no results really.  A total waste of money in my opinion. Try something else.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  Such an inexpensive product for all the benefits..  I would thoroughly recommend Redeaux. It really works.  I will be telling all my contacts about it...</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had been complaining about her creams not working well. I asked a coworker what she used and referred this to me. My girl loved it and swears by it now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 and have some small lines under my eyes, one on my forehead, and two deep wrinkles on my neck (my parents have those, too) and spent several weeks conducting both primary and secondary online research to find the absolute best anti-wrinkle product available. My expectations were realistic - I realize this is not a laser or filler - but I did expect to see at least some improvement. Sadly, my container is almost empty and nothing has changed.

The packaging is good (a product should never be in an open jar where bacteria from your fingers and light can get to it) and the fragrance-free aspect is a plus (fragrance is an irritant to the skin), but beyond that there&#x27;s nothing much positive to say. I wanted to give it 5 stars, but the lack of results force me to give it 2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results so far! I work in the sun and wrinkles do occur from constant squinting! My lines appear to be fading with continual usage!</li>
            <li> As a guy I don&#x27;t care but this stuff works I look like am 5 years younger an it smells  ok d as well I&#x27;d recommend it to all my buddy&#x27;s. ..</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, great results!</li>
            <li> worked really well around the corners of the eyes. I work outside so constant squinting is the problem. This definitely helped smooth out the dramatic lines and soften my overall look. I&#x27;m not into magic potions, but gave this a shot and it helped a great deal.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for a while... whenever ever she runs out she asks me to order her another one (it makes her feel special that I order it for her)....she always reminds me that she loves her face and it&#x27;s all due to this cream... I keep telling her that her face is beautiful with the cream or without, but she swears it&#x27;s the cream... so be it... if it  makes her happy, then this product deserves 5 stars.  Buy this for your wife or girlfriend, you might win some brownie points with very little effort... Good Luck!</li>
            <li> This product works great!  After using Strivectin for 3 years and no longer seeing results, I went looking for an update.  This cream provides lots of moisture and is clinically tested and proven to show results.  You can feel the difference immediately and will see it in about 2 weeks.  It has reduced the depth of the wrinkles on my forehead, vanished the ones around my mouth and the best part is that it firms the jawline up for those of you over 50, like me!  I use a different eye cream for lines around the eye though.  It is also priced reasonably.  It&#x27;s really a super cream!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to find the BEST wrinkle reducing products. This product consistently came up on several reputable websites as the top performer. However, everyone&#x27;s skin is different and unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t work well for me. I had issues with the viscosity of the cream as it was very thin and traveled into my eyes and mouth before having time to completely absorb. I have no doubt this product may work for others as the reviews state, just not me :(</li>
            <li> i used it when my wife had it out, its amazing. my skin actually got smoother... , my wrinkles seemed to fade after 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and thought this would be great.  I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin at all.  One thing good about it is it didn&#x27;t break my face out.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use there is absolutely no difference. I would not recommend for a woman over 60 if you&#x27;re trying to ease the look of lines and wrinkles. It has no effect.</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully according to directions. There was no reduction in wrinkles in my face, in fact, my skin continued to add new wrinkles.</li>
            <li> tube was sealed but only half filled.  I paid for a lot of empty space.  This does not make sense. a tube is supposed to be filled - not just half full.  cecilia</li>
            <li> Just a good moisturizer with high price ! I did not see any significant change in my skin. If I apply it before going to bed, in the morning that I wake up , I can see somehow an even skin, but later after one two hours it is as always.</li>
            <li> I have neglected my skin for many years. Wrinkle Redeaux did an amazing job of firming my skin, slightly lifting the jaw line, and giving my face a healthy look. At 58 yrs. old, I cannot expect miracles but this product exceeded my expectations. I noticed a difference after 4 days. It is gentle on sensitive skin and does not have an irritating fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am seeing some results</li>
            <li> This product works amazing and I love the price. There is so many products I have tried and Redeaux has worked the best most products I used was more exspensive than Redeaux.</li>
            <li> nice feel on your skin.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the resulted, I applied it for two weeks on one side of my face and saw noticeable  improvement  on that side  so I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> When I first applied it, my face started burning, broke out in hives, red bumps all over my face.  I had to go home on my lunch hour to wash my face, which by then had already sunk into my skin.  I ended up having to take a antihistiman to releave some of the burning and itching.  I would never recommend this product to anyone.  Be very careful when using it.</li>
            <li> I did not see any visible difference in this product from any other product I have tried. Since I have not seen a difference I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
