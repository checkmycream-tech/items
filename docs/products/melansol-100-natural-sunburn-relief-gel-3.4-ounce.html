    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I was not overly impressed.</li>
            <li>Very good product</li>
            <li>Works great at relieving sunburn.  </li>
            <li>some good and getting some relief from the itchiness that sometimes accompanies healing.</li>
            <li>This is a nice gel that feels good on the skin without being too sticky.  </li>
            <li>The reason, in large part, was that we used their excellent sunscreen, which I have already reviewed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell or look good, but it works, and thaat is what is important to me!</li>
            <li>I find that it soothes irritated skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, works well.</li>
            <li>This MelanSol 100% Natural Sunburn Relief Gel contains very excellent ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It works SO much better than store bought burn gels and lotions.  </li>
            <li>it sure seems to help.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is NOT a moisturizer at all, but more like aloe with added&lt;br /&gt;anti-oxidants.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not planning of purposefully getting a sunburn to test this product, but if this happens I will be sure to update this review.</li>
            <li>Its more of a slimy gel verses  </li>
            <li>Has also been very effective for sunburn after our latest ski trip in New Mexico.  </li>
            <li>A great gel for sunburns that is animal cruelty free and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It was easy to feel I was doing my skin</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel cool and refreshing on my skin, which is what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I blistered up and got sun poisoning, but after two years out of the sun in Great Britain, I am whiter than white, and burn easily.</li>
            <li>The fluid isn&#x27;t particularly attractive</li>
            <li>Instead of being absorbed it seems to sit on top of the afflicted area.</li>
            <li>A pale skinned girl&#x27;s very good friend!!!!  </li>
            <li>That happened recently and I was happy to be able to have a natural alternative on hand.</li>
            <li>like that it is 100% natural and provides nice sunburn relief.</li>
            <li>The MelanSol gel feels cool and soothing on the skin when it is burned.  </li>
            <li>i was pleasantly surprised by the nice feel and absorption of this gel.</li>
            <li>With ingredients such as calendula, aloe and vitamin E, this gel can be nothing but good for the skin.</li>
            <li>natural\\&quot; Melansol is chock full of ingredients.</li>
            <li>The gel goes on smoothly, and is fairly quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised (relieved my pinkish mild shoulder burn)</li>
            <li>It felt good against my skin, and did relieve the dry skin somewhat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying if you get a burn.</li>
            <li>My son commented that he didn&#x27;t like the sticky feel that was left on his skin, but more importantly he also didn&#x27;t mention his sunburn after the MelanSol was applied.</li>
            <li>You may say that we are not eating it, but whatever we put onto our skin is absorbed into our system, so we may as well be eating it.</li>
            <li>However, just for use as a eczema treatment, there are far better options, like the line of products by Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I waited 20 minutes after applying and the gel seemed to be completely absorbed but still stains.</li>
            <li>Choose the right product for you.</li>
            <li>There is a slight but mostly pleasant scent, that is not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li>Those typically have many, many chemicals and added fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t been sunburned in the last month, I did apply this product and it feels just like aloe (nice smell), but for the price, I am going to stick with pure aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a minor burn and this gel worked great to soothe the burn, and with use over the next couple of days, this gel helped the burn mark dissipate quickly.</li>
            <li>So far I have only tried it on a mild burn, and it worked nicely. .</li>
            <li>For example, one of the first ingredients in this &amp;#34;100% natural&amp;#34; product is xanthan gum.</li>
            <li>Overall I think there are better choices.</li>
            <li>Later, it is added to a liquid medium to form the gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as I said, I&#x27;m sticking to my $3.50 tube of pure aloe vera gel, which has been soothing my sunburns for many years, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li>Feels a bit sticky at first but absorbs fast</li>
            <li>I am not clear why there are so many and how they determined that this combination would work.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re REALLY concerned about being as natural as possible, and you don&#x27;t want plain &#x27;ol aloe, this may be your best bet.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that this is a cruelty-free product.</li>
            <li>it really seems to help areas of my face</li>
            <li>It went on fairly smoothly and it soothed my boy&#x27;s skin enough that he didn&#x27;t mention his sunburn again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;</li>
            <li>We returned from 3 weeks in the Yucatan and really had no reason to use this product.</li>
            <li>Got this for eczema and it worked really well to relax condition.</li>
            <li>I got too much sun while out on the water, put it on and</li>
            <li>, I guess it is aloe gel that does not get absorbed into skin completely?</li>
            <li>Perhaps I applied too much?</li>
            <li>It seems that they packed it with as many natural ingredients as possible.</li>
            <li>However, at almost thirty dollars a tube I did not find it to be superior to many other sunburn relief products that cost a third or half as much.</li>
            <li>Works great, feels great, but a tiny tube will not be enough for  a bad sunburn.  </li>
            <li>has alcohol as a second ingredient after aloe gel), so it will not dry out the damaged skin even more.</li>
            <li>It does cool and remove pain from the sunburn, I think the biggest distraction is the initial smell that you have when you put it on, after about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>MelanSol 100% Natural Sunburn Relief Gel is exactly that.  </li>
            <li>This sunburn relief gel is also effective on ordinary burns.</li>
            <li>Not sure, but when in pain, I like to put a nice layer of burn relief on.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, but covering the majority of a body uses a decent amount.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this for any skin irritation or redness.</li>
            <li>The price point is high for a product of this type.</li>
            <li>I do question the high price, but considering all the exotic ingredients, and its effectiveness, this tube will last a long time, and merits a high rating.</li>
            <li>I live at high</li>
            <li>As for me, I prefer all-natural, but I&#x27;m not willing to pay through the nose for it when almost-all-natural alternatives are available.</li>
            <li>Vitamin E helps the skin heal by stimulating new cell growth and is supposed to speed up cell regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very natural product. .</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, on the positive side, but is a slightly brownish color on the negative side.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise the redness was soothed instantly with the active natural extracts in this potent herbal based gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for all natural products and am willing to pay extra to purchase them over synthetics, but I&#x27;m torn with this burn relief gel.</li>
            <li>No bad smell and is not sticky like some other relief</li>
            <li>The product is slightly brown in color, which surprised me because I am used to aloe products coming in a bright green.</li>
            <li>After a fermentation period, the polysaccharide is precipitated from a growth medium with isopropyl alcohol, dried, and ground into a fine powder.</li>
            <li>Melansol provides results similar to pure aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>Yesterday was no different, so after scrubbing with soap and water and hand sanitizer, I was still very itchy.</li>
            <li>It smells like camomile tea and old citronella candles (</li>
            <li>MelanSol 100% Natural Sunburn Relief Gel was a welcomed item in my summer medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s always that time when we are unexpectedly caught in the sun for a longer period than anticipated.</li>
            <li>The gel itself is not very attractive in color - brownish, but it has flowery smell, and goes on easy and is clear on the skin.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;Worked on a light sunburn on a very pale tween.</li>
            <li>(As an example, the 5-star-reviewed Maui Vera organic product is more than twice the size at slightly over half the price.)</li>
            <li>So obviously the mix of natural ingredients do the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I do have eczema and dry skin, and have super sensitive skin that reacts to a lot of common products and can cause huge, raw, welts.</li>
            <li>I have a tendancy to get a minor (sometimes major) sunburn when we take our yearly beach</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t ignore the price -- even compared to other natural sunburn relief products, it&#x27;s up there.</li>
            <li> Instead of this I packed my usual Banana Boat Aloe Vera gel I can trust to soothe and prevent sunburned skin from peeling much.</li>
            <li> The gel dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness behind.</li>
            <li> This gel is rather expensive, but when it comes to burns, I do like to know that I have something quickly available that works.</li>
            <li> I have rash-related itchy skin in the winter and get frequent wind and sunburns from track meets in the spring, so I wanted a product I could use year round.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll buy it for as long as</li>
            <li> gel.&lt;br /&gt;The relief lasted as long</li>
            <li> It is possible the itching was from the healing process and the burning sensation seemed to go away quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> I didnt&#x27; even need a bandage to hide the scrape -- the vegetable glycerin left a slight protective film over the inflammation, and kept it hydrated at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The skin on my hands is frequently dry.</li>
            <li> I like that it does not contain alcohol (every single sunburn gel at my grocery store</li>
            <li> And the color is a light dirty brown.</li>
            <li> Prior to my time in England in the late &#x27;70s, I only had one sunburn in my life.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any blistering and no real discomfort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But even long exposure to the sun while wearing sunscreen can leave me feeling a little too toasty.</li>
            <li> I like that this isn&#x27;t as stickly as some of the other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Being a gel rather than a cream, it seems less likely to get wiped off on stuff, although other reviewers have complained of it staining clothes.</li>
            <li> The bottle is only 3.4 ounces, so it wouldn&#x27;t last extremely long if you get bad sunburns over your entire body.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Found this while in Florida.  Works great at relieving sunburn.  No bad smell and is not sticky like some other relief gels.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you will like it!</li>
            <li> I have a tendancy to get a minor (sometimes major) sunburn when we take our yearly beach trip.&lt;br /&gt;So I will be packing this in our suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is 100% natural and provides nice sunburn relief.</li>
            <li> A pale skinned girl&#x27;s very good friend!!!!  I always keep a small tube of calendula gel in my medicine cabinet for burns from the curling iron, oven, etc.  Works great, feels great, but a tiny tube will not be enough for  a bad sunburn.  This MelanSol 100% Natural Sunburn Relief Gel contains very excellent ingredients.  It works SO much better than store bought burn gels and lotions.  Those typically have many, many chemicals and added fragrances.  The MelanSol gel feels cool and soothing on the skin when it is burned.  The bottle is only 3.4 ounces, so it wouldn&#x27;t last extremely long if you get bad sunburns over your entire body.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, but covering the majority of a body uses a decent amount.  My bad burn was on my shoulders and face.  The MelanSol kept my face from drying out and peeling.  I only took away a star because of the price for the amount.</li>
            <li> I try very hard not to get sunburned. But even long exposure to the sun while wearing sunscreen can leave me feeling a little too toasty. So I tried out some of this sunburn relief gel. I wasn&#x27;t wild about the smell, but it wasn&#x27;t bad -- just not a fragrance I would pick. I didn&#x27;t feel cool and refreshing on my skin, which is what I was hoping for. It&#x27;s worth trying if you get a burn.</li>
            <li> I burn all the time. So I feel like I am always looking for a sunburn relief product that isn&#x27;t sticky, and doesn&#x27;t smell overpowering.  I like that this isn&#x27;t as stickly as some of the other products I have tried. It is soothing on burns. So far I have only tried it on a mild burn, and it worked nicely. .</li>
            <li> after scraping myself with a razor, i decided to try this gel on the red, inflamed skin. I figured, if it works on sunburn, why not a cut? To my surprise the redness was soothed instantly with the active natural extracts in this potent herbal based gel. I didnt&#x27; even need a bandage to hide the scrape -- the vegetable glycerin left a slight protective film over the inflammation, and kept it hydrated at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not just for post-sun skin! i highly recommend this for any skin irritation or redness.</li>
            <li> Melansol provides results similar to pure aloe vera.  I&#x27;m not sure what to make about the claims about its additional ingredients, but there is no doubt that aloe based products soothe pain and promote healing.  It has a pleasant smell, on the positive side, but is a slightly brownish color on the negative side.  (When in pain you will not care about the color, I suspect!)  I really appreciate that this is a cruelty-free product.</li>
            <li> i was pleasantly surprised by the nice feel and absorption of this gel. I have rash-related itchy skin in the winter and get frequent wind and sunburns from track meets in the spring, so I wanted a product I could use year round. The gel dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness behind. It was easy to feel I was doing my skin some good and getting some relief from the itchiness that sometimes accompanies healing. I did not have to use a lot to get results.</li>
            <li> It does cool and remove pain from the sunburn, I think the biggest distraction is the initial smell that you have when you put it on, after about 5 minutes you don&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is what they meant people to use&lt;br /&gt;this product for, but it sure seems to help.  I use it&lt;br /&gt;at night and in the morning use moisturized with SPF30&lt;br /&gt;as I live at high elevation.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way this product makes my face feel and look.&lt;br /&gt;If I use it continually it really seems to help areas of my face&lt;br /&gt;that have taken a beating from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a moisturizer at all, but more like aloe with added&lt;br /&gt;anti-oxidants.  Very good product and I&#x27;ll buy it for as long as it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;available.</li>
            <li> My tween got an unintended sunburn on his neck and shoulders.  It wasn&#x27;t very bad but it was apparently uncomfortable enough that he mentioned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I had MelanSol on hand.  It comes out of the tube as a dirty-brick colored fluid. It went on fairly smoothly and it soothed my boy&#x27;s skin enough that he didn&#x27;t mention his sunburn again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;Worked on a light sunburn on a very pale tween. The fluid isn&#x27;t particularly attractive but once you rub it on you don&#x27;t see any color.  My son commented that he didn&#x27;t like the sticky feel that was left on his skin, but more importantly he also didn&#x27;t mention his sunburn after the MelanSol was applied.</li>
            <li> A great gel for sunburns that is animal cruelty free and has natural ingredients. It is not too sticky and feels soothing when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to pack this product for our Mexican beach vacation. It arrived with a broken cap so I would have had to tape it shut? The color is an ugly brown and it has an off smell upon applying it to the skin.  Instead of this I packed my usual Banana Boat Aloe Vera gel I can trust to soothe and prevent sunburned skin from peeling much.</li>
            <li> Prior to my time in England in the late &#x27;70s, I only had one sunburn in my life. That one came as a result of putting on Coppertone QT tanning lotion all over and sleeping on a raft in lake Mead when I was a kid. I blistered up and got sun poisoning, but after two years out of the sun in Great Britain, I am whiter than white, and burn easily. I got this cream for the inevitable burn my pool time will give me as soon as the cast comes off my foot this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, yesterday I was cleaning the pool filter cartridges, which requires pulling the lid off of the filter enclosure, and for some reason the dome always seems to have tiny nettle like itchy allergens that always transfer to my forearms and make for a miserable couple of days after each cleaning. Yesterday was no different, so after scrubbing with soap and water and hand sanitizer, I was still very itchy. I rubbed in this cream and the redness, burning and itch immediately went away. So obviously the mix of natural ingredients do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell or look good, but it works, and thaat is what is important to me!</li>
            <li> MelanSol 100% Natural Sunburn Relief Gel is exactly that.  It&#x27;s a really thick, brown goo that does soothe skin irritations and seems to promote healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it&#x27;s very expensive for the amount of product.  I like it, but doubt I&#x27;ll purchase a tube.</li>
            <li> We returned from 3 weeks in the Yucatan and really had no reason to use this product. The reason, in large part, was that we used their excellent sunscreen, which I have already reviewed. This sunburn relief gel is also effective on ordinary burns. Having burnt my thumb, I tried some and felt immediate relief. I do question the high price, but considering all the exotic ingredients, and its effectiveness, this tube will last a long time, and merits a high rating.</li>
            <li> Got this for eczema and it worked really well to relax condition. Feels a bit sticky at first but absorbs fast</li>
            <li> This is as soothing and cooling as any aloe gel.&lt;br /&gt;The relief lasted as long but so did the fragrance.  It smells like camomile tea and old citronella candles (though I&#x27;m not sure this has citronella in it, it smells like it though).&lt;br /&gt;This also has a slight tint to it from the ingredients and on my super-fair skin it winds up looking like my skin is dirty once it dries.</li>
            <li> This is a very natural product. . .it&#x27;s a dark brown color, and the flowery fragrance has no hint of chemicals. I find that it soothes irritated skin nicely. Being a gel rather than a cream, it seems less likely to get wiped off on stuff, although other reviewers have complained of it staining clothes. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve actually gotten it on any clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only three stars? I can&#x27;t ignore the price -- even compared to other natural sunburn relief products, it&#x27;s up there. (As an example, the 5-star-reviewed Maui Vera organic product is more than twice the size at slightly over half the price.) Granted, MelanSol has the fewest hard-to-pronounce ingredients of any of the products that I looked at, so if you&#x27;re REALLY concerned about being as natural as possible, and you don&#x27;t want plain &#x27;ol aloe, this may be your best bet. As for me, I prefer all-natural, but I&#x27;m not willing to pay through the nose for it when almost-all-natural alternatives are available. Choose the right product for you.</li>
            <li> MelanSol 100% Natural Sunburn Relief Gel was a welcomed item in my summer medicine cabinet. With ingredients such as calendula, aloe and vitamin E, this gel can be nothing but good for the skin. Calendula is a staple ingredient in every herbalists&#x27; medicine chest and used for its healing properties that helps wounds heal faster and improves skin hydration. Aloe is known as the burn plant and has been helping heal those kitchen mishaps for years. Vitamin E helps the skin heal by stimulating new cell growth and is supposed to speed up cell regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s always that time when we are unexpectedly caught in the sun for a longer period than anticipated. That happened recently and I was happy to be able to have a natural alternative on hand. It did ease the burning for a bit but there was still itching involved that this didn&#x27;t seem to relieve. It is possible the itching was from the healing process and the burning sensation seemed to go away quicker than expected. I didn&#x27;t have any blistering and no real discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the gel is nothing offensive and it does have a bit of a color to it, but nothing I would complain about. I had no problems with it on my clothing or bedding.</li>
            <li> This product came to the rescue when someone in our home received a burn while cooking.  It was a minor burn and this gel worked great to soothe the burn, and with use over the next couple of days, this gel helped the burn mark dissipate quickly. Has also been very effective for sunburn after our latest ski trip in New Mexico.  Soothed the burn on the face and never did peel.  This gel is rather expensive, but when it comes to burns, I do like to know that I have something quickly available that works.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, works well. Aloe Vera is were its at for sun burns and rashes. I keep it by my bedside.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t been sunburned in the last month, I did apply this product and it feels just like aloe (nice smell), but for the price, I am going to stick with pure aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m learning that &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; can mean the opposite of what we think it means. For example, one of the first ingredients in this &amp;#34;100% natural&amp;#34; product is xanthan gum. You may say that we are not eating it, but whatever we put onto our skin is absorbed into our system, so we may as well be eating it. Here you go-this is what xanthan gum is: Xanthan gum (/ˈzænθən/) is a polysaccharide secreted by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris,[2] used as a food additive and rheology modifier,[3] commonly used as a food thickening agent (in salad dressings, for example) and a stabilizer (in cosmetic products, for example, to prevent ingredients from separating). It is composed of pentasaccharide repeat units, comprising glucose, mannose, and glucuronic acid in the molar ratio 2.0:2.0:1.0.[4] It is produced by the fermentation of glucose, sucrose, or lactose. After a fermentation period, the polysaccharide is precipitated from a growth medium with isopropyl alcohol, dried, and ground into a fine powder. Later, it is added to a liquid medium to form the gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as I said, I&#x27;m sticking to my $3.50 tube of pure aloe vera gel, which has been soothing my sunburns for many years, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> From the aroma to the constancy- MelanSol is relief at it&#x27;s best. I got too much sun while out on the water, put it on and within several hours felt like I had prevented additional redness.</li>
            <li> Despite it being \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; Melansol is chock full of ingredients. It seems that they packed it with as many natural ingredients as possible. I am not clear why there are so many and how they determined that this combination would work. Regardless, I was not overly impressed. The product states it works on rashes so I applied it to a rash. Instead of being absorbed it seems to sit on top of the afflicted area. Then there is the matter of smell and color. The smell is not a pleasant one. And the color is a light dirty brown. It squirts out of the tube looking like a dirty gel. The price point is high for a product of this type. Overall I think there are better choices.</li>
            <li> This is a nice gel that feels good on the skin without being too sticky.  However, at almost thirty dollars a tube I did not find it to be superior to many other sunburn relief products that cost a third or half as much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not planning of purposefully getting a sunburn to test this product, but if this happens I will be sure to update this review. However, I do have eczema and dry skin, and have super sensitive skin that reacts to a lot of common products and can cause huge, raw, welts. The skin on my hands is frequently dry. I teach, and to avoid getting constantly sick from everything the kids bring to school, I am frequently washing my hands, which can lead to cracked and broken skin on my hands, especially around the knuckles. I tried this product last night to see how it works. The product is slightly brown in color, which surprised me because I am used to aloe products coming in a bright green. However, the color does not show up after application. There is a slight but mostly pleasant scent, that is not at all overpowering. The gel goes on smoothly, and is fairly quickly absorbed. It felt good against my skin, and did relieve the dry skin somewhat. However, just for use as a eczema treatment, there are far better options, like the line of products by Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If at some point one of my children or I have a sunburn, I will edit my review to reflect its use for sunburn relief.</li>
            <li> The gel itself is not very attractive in color - brownish, but it has flowery smell, and goes on easy and is clear on the skin. It seems to disappear into skin in just a couple of minutes, but when you take a shower, it gels again, I guess it is aloe gel that does not get absorbed into skin completely? Anyway, it washes off with just water and without scrubbing. It seems to stop burning and itching. I like that it does not contain alcohol (every single sunburn gel at my grocery store has alcohol as a second ingredient after aloe gel), so it will not dry out the damaged skin even more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for all natural products and am willing to pay extra to purchase them over synthetics, but I&#x27;m torn with this burn relief gel. It works as advertised (relieved my pinkish mild shoulder burn) but I didn&#x27;t care for the brownish gel. It left stains on my white clothing and bedding. I waited 20 minutes after applying and the gel seemed to be completely absorbed but still stains. Perhaps I applied too much? Not sure, but when in pain, I like to put a nice layer of burn relief on.  The texture of the gel is weird too. Its more of a slimy gel verses  gels that I&#x27;m used to (if that makes any sense).  I&#x27;ll still keep looking.</li>
    </ol>
