            <li> ..little on the expensive side but last I checked they are gluten free so it helps with peace of mind when I go down the grocery isle to just grab one.  </li>
            <li> bringing a full size toothpaste on a trip was silly.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT CLEAN TEETH GOOD AND TASTE HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> but I need toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have hardly any of that stuff in it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fructose/gluten/lactose intolerant (yes my life sucks..)</li>
            <li> Too expensive for one little bottle.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s is for people who want to keep the unhealthy ingredients out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I tried a few toothpaste&#x27;s without doing research on the ingredients and ended up being sick all day at work because of them...</li>

            <li> Travel size, I didn&#x27;t read the description close enough.</li>
            <li> Luv the item. I use the full size normally and I didn&#x27;t want to switch brands when going on vacation but bringing a full size toothpaste on a trip was silly. Couldnt find this travel size locally. Glad the seller carries the smaller size.</li>
            <li> I love Tom&#x27;s! I was happy to find a travel size for taking in my carry-on bag!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fructose/gluten/lactose intolerant (yes my life sucks..) and I tried a few toothpaste&#x27;s without doing research on the ingredients and ended up being sick all day at work because of them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s of main products are good - simple..little on the expensive side but last I checked they are gluten free so it helps with peace of mind when I go down the grocery isle to just grab one.  They don&#x27;t seem to be loaded up on sugar&#x27;s either..like sorbitol or xylitol.. i&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re in there but I need toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have hardly any of that stuff in it... just give me the toothpaste!  Anyway good products!</li>
            <li> Love this tooth paste and this is a good price.</li>
            <li> product is good - seller was not as good as the product</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s is for people who want to keep the unhealthy ingredients out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a basic toothpaste, no fluoride, no other toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant-flavored and it cleans the teeth.  Trust Tom&#x27;s to provide well-designed products that come in well-labeled packages so you know what you are getting.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth and clean. Very refreshing!</li>
            <li> Low star for company. Showed picture of two boxes and only comes with one. Too expensive for one little bottle.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste gives you a good clean feel after using and my teeth do appear white from use.</li>
            <li> Great  all natural product that soothes sensitive teeth while it cleans.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and needed to find a travel size toothpaste that I could use. I only use Tom&#x27;s and love the product. I wish I could find the travel size at my local store but ordering on Amazon is easy!</li>
            <li> NOT AS GOOD AS COLGATE AND CREST. DOES NOT CLEAN TEETH GOOD AND TASTE HORRIBLE, IT IS LIKE USING PASTE TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH WITH</li>
            <li> i have been looking for travel size Toms for awhile....glad i finally found it</li>
            <li> Like this.  My choice is fluoride free and this one is one of the best</li>
