            <li>I have to say - the stuff is impressive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed with the product, I started using it on my face.</li>
            <li>Now, I can&#x27;t stop getting compliments on how great my skin looks!</li>
            <li>People have always told me I had great skin</li>
            <li>That convinced me that it really is great stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with Creme de la Mer.  </li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>This creme is amazing!</li>
            <li>So, nutshell, with La Mer, you don&#x27;t even need to use all the &#x27;extras&#x27; (eye serum, etc) cause the creme is amazing!    </li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Anyway, my real love for La Mer came after my esthetician convinced me to try Skinceutical Epidermal Repair.</li>
            <li>Very attractive :)</li>
            <li>After 29 years of Erno Laszlo products for my oily skin, my complexion is quite good.</li>
            <li>I think the most remarkable thing is how when I wake up in the morning, I still feel it.   </li>
            <li>I love it with all my heart !</li>
            <li>and it worked like magic !</li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin looks so much better!      </li>
            <li>I am the first to admit I&#x27;m easily charmed by positive reviews and remarkable claims, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens if not hundreds of products trying to find the best of the best.</li>
            <li>and this stuff really is amazing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even tried a moisturizer of any kind for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>I have found superior moisturizers and sincerely believe La Mer is over-hyped.</li>
            <li>I purchesed the whole La Mer line and my skin was very happy.  </li>
            <li>it is the best moisturizer i have found in my oily, acne-prone 10 plus years of adult acne.  </li>
            <li>Ok, the hype, expense, etc...  </li>
            <li>I just love the stuff.</li>
            <li>Of all things to splurge on, I&#x27;ve realized skincare is particularly worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I am in the skin care business and hear from many people that La Mer is just hype.</li>
            <li>I looked like the elephant man and thought I would surely have a permanent scar.</li>
            <li>my skin made it through and looked even better than it had before.     </li>
            <li>Within a week my skin looked more even, felt like satin, and was noticeably firmer.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Ok, while overpriced for face cream</li>
            <li>the next day my face was perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will buy a refill once this pot is gone.  </li>
            <li>and she even said \\&quot;wow, your skin is looking great.</li>
            <li>Make sure you rub it a bit between your hands, to warm it up, than pat it gently onto sensitve skin.</li>
            <li>However, I won&#x27;t make another purchase, and strongly prefer Dr. Sebagh or even Jurlique.</li>
            <li>I  doubt if its grandiose claims are true, but that said, I really do love this face cream.  </li>
            <li>Warm on your fingertips first.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re over 30, this little jar is one of the best investments you can make.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Either way, the texture of my skin has improved greatly, and my pores appear smaller.  </li>
            <li>Too rich for some people.  </li>
            <li>Since this was the first thing I was able to apply to his rash, for immediate comfort, I used it two days in a row.</li>
            <li>ULTRA RICH FACE CREAM</li>
            <li>, the La Mer representatives advised me to use the Moisturizing Lotion, as opposed to the original Creme.  </li>
            <li>I was sceptical, because I&#x27;ve heard it can cause breakouts because it&#x27;s so rich, but by then, I&#x27;d have preferred acne to whatever my face was doing.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the spatula, and warm it between your fingers prior to application.</li>
            <li>I have people constantly say how gorgeous my skin is-</li>
            <li>Ok Ok enough of the rambling...</li>
            <li>No other product has ever given me this kind of result.  </li>
            <li>I loved La Mer because again, dry skin</li>
            <li>Granted I have a Rx, but rather than dry skin and adding wrinkles like many acne meds do, my skin is more dewy and hydrated than ever before.</li>
            <li>Why is this product advertised here for $100 more than the cost of purchasing it directly from the La Mer website?</li>
            <li>I think my face is worth it.</li>
            <li>The fact that it does contain this oil, prevents any of the sea kelp to actually be absorbed.</li>
            <li>WELL worth the money-</li>
            <li>They both (as well as the young womans&#x27; husband) professed to love it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my first jar with the idea that most products don&#x27;t live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>I just stopped trying out other products now since its only La Mer that brings the best results.</li>
            <li>I received my first jar of La Mer when I was 26ish from my stepmother for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>1.7 OUNCE- HAS THE SAME MOISTURIZING RESULTS- FOR A FRACTION OF THE COST!!!- :)</li>
            <li>Ive tried all the supposed best of the moment,breakthrough skin care,anti-aging,anti-wrinkle products in the past 5 yrs,and I just keep going back to La Mer.</li>
            <li>I have spent oodles on every kind of presription and OTC skin product I can think of.</li>
            <li>Make sure you consult with a La Mer sales person to know how to properly apply the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I used it overnight, tiny amount, and I woke up about 50% better.</li>
            <li>I use other products for at least six months to reap their full benefits,and honestly,my skin looks its most radiant and best when Im back with La Mer.</li>
            <li>It can only be best described as hard, butter..</li>
            <li>jar of Creme de la Mer, raving about how his female and even some male colleagues really loved it.  </li>
            <li>Buy direct from la mer and get the free samples :) Do not apply when your skin is wet, it won&#x27;t spread.</li>
            <li>Invest in La Mer, give it a few months, and you&#x27;ll have amazing skin.</li>
            <li>And Creme de La Mer really works.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really looking for a miracle.    </li>
            <li>Last night, while going through my evening bedtime routine I tilted my face up into the light and</li>
            <li>I have found that La Mer does not do this, and it is very soothing to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it and my skin looks so natural and fresh even with the make up</li>
            <li>so really you&#x27;re not paying anymore than you would for Clinique etc</li>
            <li>The young woman inside SAKS brought me to La Mer and a direct French woman with amazing skin.  </li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t cause too many breakouts, it never really seemed to absorb well into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 26, have combination oily/dry skin, and have had no breakouts from this product in over 3 months straight of using it every night.  </li>
            <li>Besides, most products for the skin, sting people who have such sensitive skin, not creme de la mer.  </li>
            <li>No one complains when people spend that much on their hair, and dinner with wine at a good restaurant is more expensive!</li>
            <li>You have to be sure you dry your hands and face completely before applying this product or it just won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>surely it could be done as I&#x27;m sure there is nothing particularly exclusive or expensive in La  Mer.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to those with younger skin, or to people who don&#x27;t have chronically dry or itchy skin (more normal/combination).  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and hydrated for hours, unlike any other moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>_wow!</li>
            <li>My hormones went wild after my daughter was born and this stuff was a miracle!  </li>
            <li>That being said, this is probably the first AND the last time I&#x27;ll purchase anything from La Mer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odd that no one has tried to create a cheap clone....</li>
            <li>I use it very sparingly, only at night, and not even every night.  </li>
            <li>then I have to confess that it&#x27;s completely the La Mer</li>
            <li>My skin looks like it did when I was about 12 years old.  </li>
            <li>I had been disappointed I couldn&#x27;t find the Givency Skin Products that I have loved and used w/much success at the SAKS in Denver (I live in Northern Colorado)</li>
            <li>I find it so funny that so many reviews obsess about how expensive this is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy or oily for my skin, it heals OVERNIGHT those pesky little \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; that still pop up from time to time, and I love how it makes my face look!</li>
            <li>Creme de La Mer aggravates my skin  and caused an atopic dermatitis flare-up that took weeks to calm down.</li>
            <li>Yes, it cost more than a lot of creams, but $100 every few months for glowing skin is NOT much in my book.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and a lot of face creams and lotions I&#x27;ve tried sting and can cause red blotchiness.  </li>
            <li>I would wholey recommend this product to people with normal, dry and mature skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am very careful and particular when it comes to cosmetics and skin care.</li>
            <li>My six year old son was diagnosed with this form of eczema last summer.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended to me while in NYC - I went in begging for someone to show me a highly moisturizing line as my skin is ridiculously dry ..</li>
            <li>For starters..I have normal/combination skin, so a large portion of the negativity of this review is probably due to the performance of the product on my skin type.</li>
            <li>It has also cleared up acne scars and left my pores far smaller.</li>
            <li>and my skin is not particularly dry</li>
            <li>I steered clear of this product for a long, time but due to a convincing yet incredibly, annoying sales girl, I bought this at Saks last week and I&#x27;m not at all sure what I was expecting, but it far surpassed the product!</li>
            <li>The first two weeks, my skin is firm and glowing.  </li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The texture is very thick, and while we&#x27;re advised to warm the cream in our hands, it still ends up greasy and heavy.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or oily for my skin, it heals OVERNIGHT those pesky little \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; that still pop up from time to time, and I love how it makes my face look!</li>
            <li> Creme de La Mer aggravates my skin  and caused an atopic dermatitis flare-up that took weeks to calm down.</li>
            <li> Yes, it cost more than a lot of creams, but $100 every few months for glowing skin is NOT much in my book.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and a lot of face creams and lotions I&#x27;ve tried sting and can cause red blotchiness.  </li>
            <li> I would wholey recommend this product to people with normal, dry and mature skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am very careful and particular when it comes to cosmetics and skin care.</li>
            <li> My six year old son was diagnosed with this form of eczema last summer.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended to me while in NYC - I went in begging for someone to show me a highly moisturizing line as my skin is ridiculously dry ..</li>
            <li> For starters..I have normal/combination skin, so a large portion of the negativity of this review is probably due to the performance of the product on my skin type.</li>
            <li> It has also cleared up acne scars and left my pores far smaller.</li>
            <li> and my skin is not particularly dry</li>
            <li> I steered clear of this product for a long, time but due to a convincing yet incredibly, annoying sales girl, I bought this at Saks last week and I&#x27;m not at all sure what I was expecting, but it far surpassed the product!</li>
            <li> The first two weeks, my skin is firm and glowing.  </li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The texture is very thick, and while we&#x27;re advised to warm the cream in our hands, it still ends up greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I used this for only TWO nights in a row, and my normally, clear skin began forming whiteheads and my t-zone became extremely oily, and visibly so....</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it can be used very sparingly.</li>
            <li> Now, when it pops up, I skip all the other products, and go directly for the creme de la mer.  </li>
            <li> Within two weeks, my scar was flat, and the rendess disappeared.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter also has Ketosis Polaris, but it much less severe, and I don&#x27;t use creme de la mer on her.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and the first time I put it on, I thought it looked, felt and smelled exactly like Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream.</li>
            <li> I mean really, don&#x27;t you think?\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Then it begins to become peppered with several small pimples, and a few large ones.  </li>
            <li> I admit that I wanted to believe that the whole \\&quot;sea broth\\&quot; thing was for real, but sea broth or no sea broth, this won&#x27;t help your skin unless you plan to swim the English channel and want to spread it all over as a very expensive barrier cream, and even then, Vaseline would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to begin?</li>
            <li> In terms of wrinkle improvement,there will only be a cosmetic change due to the fact that your skin will look moist,which lessens the appearance of lines.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long (2 weeks), but I did notice a difference immediately.  </li>
            <li> It has the initial effect of shrinking your pores, and so your skin feels a little tight yet incredibly soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li> Since I moved from a humid climate to a dry climate, this moisturizer has been a must.</li>
            <li> Because of its greasy texture, I can only use it at night or for the relief of especially dry skin.    </li>
            <li> I have dry skin that craves moisture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it sparingly overnight to soothe my skin when my acne meds dry it out</li>
            <li> I started using Retin-A for my acne (moderate) and within less than 2 days, the Retin-A burned my face off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greasy like cold cream, and the smell was so strong that it made my eyes water and my nose run.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> And only use a little.</li>
            <li> I have used one small jar of creme de la mer on my son, this whole past winter.  </li>
            <li> but I never really though it was La Mer, per se, just genetics.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is about $100 for an ounce, but that should last you a few months...</li>
            <li> I know that this creme is expensive but is worth any penny.  </li>
            <li> longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I spent a few hundred dollars on all the different soaps, creams, lotions, medications, etc.  </li>
            <li> I used every cream I could find for a few days with minimal results - 2 days after the initial Retin-A fiasco (I stopped using it immediately)</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve abandoned all hope that it&#x27;s useful for any sort of anti-aging skin improvement, now I&#x27;m using the cream as a supplement to other moisturizers and treatments, when I need to return some moisture to my skin overall or protect it from cold, windy weather.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a significant disappointment.    </li>
            <li> It has been useful when the weather&#x27;s been cold and dry, when I need a thicker cream to moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li> For this price I think the company can afford to use a better base oil that the cheap and dangerous Mineral Oil.</li>
            <li> I use other creams as well, but I do like La Mer because of how soothing and moisturizing it is overnight.  </li>
            <li> Each time I used any other product recommended by the doctor, it would sting his rash.  </li>
            <li> which is lighter that any other brand.  </li>
            <li> It is also extremely sticky.</li>
            <li> Although I am a liberal spender and generally think you get what you pay for, this product is not worth the money--at least for me.</li>
            <li> I think the money spent on creme de la mer, was less than all the rest, and will never use anything else again.  </li>
            <li> This cream is unbelievably, average for the price and the rave reviews it tends to receive.</li>
            <li> People guessed my age 10 years less before I used this product, now . . .</li>
            <li> Lines are pronounced when skin is dry,thus all moisturizers work on keeping the skin moist which gives you the illusion of less lines.</li>
            <li> The 1 oz size is about half gone and has lasted me well over a month with 2 applications per day.</li>
            <li> I was the kid who had horrible acne as a teenager and mild scarring as an adult.</li>
            <li> Another point worth mentioning, is that he has an exceptionally bad case of Ketosis Polaris.  </li>
            <li> I have Mediterranean skin, with the pores that go along with it, and now some uneven pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> By the way,  I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of other facial creams including the Ponds cold cream someone mentioned previously, but I&#x27;ve found nothing else which is a copy of this.  </li>
            <li> La Prairie as also expensive, even double the price  , and it pales in comparison !</li>
            <li> And folks, a pair of expensive sunglasses has the same price !</li>
            <li> I would suggest trying a small size for 4 weeks and seeing how you get on.</li>
            <li> and this product delivered that in a way not many skin creams have.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m worried the richness of La Mer will break me out, but honestly, small hassle for glowing skin.</li>
            <li> I will say, that if some of the other less expensive product, even worked a bit, I would use them  on him &amp; keep the creme de la mer for myself, but nothing else workes at all, and this heals it in two days.  </li>
            <li> I mean, those compliments all but went away when I wasn&#x27;t using La Mer.   </li>
            <li> (I mean come on la mer people $150??!?)</li>
            <li> And I have ALWAYS gotten oily and broken out with any moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If I add up all the other drugstore type products I could buy in that time, the $200+ doesn&#x27;t seem so bad.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s expensive but</li>
            <li> is incredibly difficult to spread and practically melts on contact with your skin.</li>
            <li> now so had resorted to ordering it online - and it has come stale and impossible to use.    </li>
            <li> I have bad skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to hate it and say it was an overpriced hoax.</li>
            <li> I am a skeptic, I hate that I gave in to the hype, but I have to agrree</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Since I moved from a humid climate to a dry climate, this moisturizer has been a must. It leaves my skin smooth and hydrated for hours, unlike any other moisturizer.  No wonder they use this in space!</li>
            <li> A male friend of mine is devoted to Creme de la Mer, so based on his recommendation, I purchased a jar.  It&#x27;s been a significant disappointment.    The texture is very thick, and while we&#x27;re advised to warm the cream in our hands, it still ends up greasy and heavy.  I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in terms of my skin texture, no reduction in lines or wrinkles, and I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month.  Because of its greasy texture, I can only use it at night or for the relief of especially dry skin.    It has been useful when the weather&#x27;s been cold and dry, when I need a thicker cream to moisturize my skin.  While I&#x27;ve abandoned all hope that it&#x27;s useful for any sort of anti-aging skin improvement, now I&#x27;m using the cream as a supplement to other moisturizers and treatments, when I need to return some moisture to my skin overall or protect it from cold, windy weather.  However, I won&#x27;t make another purchase, and strongly prefer Dr. Sebagh or even Jurlique.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long (2 weeks), but I did notice a difference immediately.  It has the initial effect of shrinking your pores, and so your skin feels a little tight yet incredibly soft and dewy.  I think the most remarkable thing is how when I wake up in the morning, I still feel it.   I have no redness, no discomfort.  I wish I could afford to use this all over my body!</li>
            <li> Ok, the hype, expense, etc...  I received my first jar of La Mer when I was 26ish from my stepmother for Christmas.  I have very dry skin so it was perfect. I was hooked and used it for years. People have always told me I had great skin but I never really though it was La Mer, per se, just genetics. I loved La Mer because again, dry skin and it was so hydrating.  Anyway, my real love for La Mer came after my esthetician convinced me to try Skinceutical Epidermal Repair. I switched over and life went on for about 2 years. One day, I decided I missed La Mer so I made the switch back. Low and behold, people started complimenting me on my skin... and I realized that it had stopped. I mean, those compliments all but went away when I wasn&#x27;t using La Mer.   That convinced me that it really is great stuff. My skin loves it.   Now that I&#x27;m coming up on 40, I&#x27;m sold. I just love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I, too, was an unbeliever.  After 29 years of Erno Laszlo products for my oily skin, my complexion is quite good. I haven&#x27;t even tried a moisturizer of any kind for over 20 years.  Creme de la Mer is a revelation. It&#x27;s not too heavy or oily for my skin, it heals OVERNIGHT those pesky little \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; that still pop up from time to time, and I love how it makes my face look! People guessed my age 10 years less before I used this product, now . . . they will never believe the truth!</li>
            <li> I am the first to admit I&#x27;m easily charmed by positive reviews and remarkable claims, and I&#x27;ve tried dozens if not hundreds of products trying to find the best of the best. Although I am a liberal spender and generally think you get what you pay for, this product is not worth the money--at least for me. I have very sensitive skin and am very careful and particular when it comes to cosmetics and skin care. Creme de La Mer aggravates my skin  and caused an atopic dermatitis flare-up that took weeks to calm down. I have found superior moisturizers and sincerely believe La Mer is over-hyped.</li>
            <li> Of all things to splurge on, I&#x27;ve realized skincare is particularly worthwhile. And Creme de La Mer really works. A little goes a long way, so it can be used very sparingly. I&#x27;ve found that even though the initial purchase is pricey, one 2 oz jar can last me about 8 months. If I add up all the other drugstore type products I could buy in that time, the $200+ doesn&#x27;t seem so bad. You have to be sure you dry your hands and face completely before applying this product or it just won&#x27;t work. If you&#x27;re over 30, this little jar is one of the best investments you can make.</li>
            <li> I love it with all my heart ! But it&#x27;s not for everyone, if you can test it, do so ! Just bought it and found it perfect ! Yes it&#x27;s expensive but La Prairie as also expensive, even double the price  , and it pales in comparison ! I have dry sensitive skin and it worked like magic ! And folks, a pair of expensive sunglasses has the same price !</li>
            <li> Why is this product advertised here for $100 more than the cost of purchasing it directly from the La Mer website?</li>
            <li> The first two weeks, my skin is firm and glowing.  Then it begins to become peppered with several small pimples, and a few large ones.  Too rich for some people.  I would suggest trying a small size for 4 weeks and seeing how you get on.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is about $100 for an ounce, but that should last you a few months... and this stuff really is amazing. I find it so funny that so many reviews obsess about how expensive this is. Yes, it cost more than a lot of creams, but $100 every few months for glowing skin is NOT much in my book. No one complains when people spend that much on their hair, and dinner with wine at a good restaurant is more expensive! I think my face is worth it. Be sure to use the spatula, and warm it between your fingers prior to application.</li>
            <li> Over $1,000 for moisturizing cream?  As the saying goes: \\&quot;A fool and their money are soon parted\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This cream contains Mineral Oil, enough said.  The fact that it does contain this oil, prevents any of the sea kelp to actually be absorbed. For this price I think the company can afford to use a better base oil that the cheap and dangerous Mineral Oil. I am in the skin care business and hear from many people that La Mer is just hype.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first jar with the idea that most products don&#x27;t live up to the hype.  After faithfully applying the La Mer every evening before bed (no SPF so I don&#x27;t wear it during the day) I wasn&#x27;t really looking for a miracle.    I have Mediterranean skin, with the pores that go along with it, and now some uneven pigmentation.  Last night, while going through my evening bedtime routine I tilted my face up into the light and _wow!_ I noticed that my skin looks so much better!      I&#x27;m happy with Creme de la Mer.  No other product has ever given me this kind of result.  I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I finally tried La Mer a couple of years ago, and hoped I wouldn&#x27;t like it.  I  doubt if its grandiose claims are true, but that said, I really do love this face cream.  I have very sensitive skin and a lot of face creams and lotions I&#x27;ve tried sting and can cause red blotchiness.  I have found that La Mer does not do this, and it is very soothing to my skin.  I use it very sparingly, only at night, and not even every night.  In doing this, I have made the jar last over a year.  I use other creams as well, but I do like La Mer because of how soothing and moisturizing it is overnight.  By the way,  I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of other facial creams including the Ponds cold cream someone mentioned previously, but I&#x27;ve found nothing else which is a copy of this.  It&#x27;s odd that no one has tried to create a cheap clone....surely it could be done as I&#x27;m sure there is nothing particularly exclusive or expensive in La  Mer.  So despite all the devoted hype, which I don&#x27;t believe,  I still like it and wish it were priced below $30.</li>
            <li> Creme de la mer may be the answer to my son&#x27;s severe eczema, called Ketosis Polaris.  My six year old son was diagnosed with this form of eczema last summer.  I used all the medication, and over the counter products, recommended by the dermatologist, to no avail.  Quite by accident, I tried my creme de la mer, on his neck, and instantly it soothed his rash.  Each time I used any other product recommended by the doctor, it would sting his rash.  Since this was the first thing I was able to apply to his rash, for immediate comfort, I used it two days in a row. He even brought it to me and asked me to put it on him.  His rash dissapeared in a couple of days!  Now, when it pops up, I skip all the other products, and go directly for the creme de la mer.  I will say, that if some of the other less expensive product, even worked a bit, I would use them  on him &amp; keep the creme de la mer for myself, but nothing else workes at all, and this heals it in two days.  Another point worth mentioning, is that he has an exceptionally bad case of Ketosis Polaris.  My 11 year old daughter also has Ketosis Polaris, but it much less severe, and I don&#x27;t use creme de la mer on her.  I spent a few hundred dollars on all the different soaps, creams, lotions, medications, etc.  None of it worked a bit.  I have used one small jar of creme de la mer on my son, this whole past winter.  I think the money spent on creme de la mer, was less than all the rest, and will never use anything else again.  Besides, most products for the skin, sting people who have such sensitive skin, not creme de la mer.  Make sure you rub it a bit between your hands, to warm it up, than pat it gently onto sensitve skin.</li>
            <li> This creme is amazing! I have been using it and my skin looks so natural and fresh even with the make up which is lighter that any other brand.  I know that this creme is expensive but is worth any penny.  Buy it!!!</li>
            <li> LISTEN UP!!! ... L&#x27;OCCITANE SHEA 24 HOUR ULTRA RICH FACE CREAM 1.7 OUNCE- HAS THE SAME MOISTURIZING RESULTS- FOR A FRACTION OF THE COST!!!- :)</li>
            <li> I had third degree sun burn from the Texas sun off of the lake. My face blew up like a balloon. I looked like the elephant man and thought I would surely have a permanent scar. But with the use of La Mer my skin made it through and looked even better than it had before.     It has also cleared up acne scars and left my pores far smaller. I know some say it is all hype, but there is truth in this pudding.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the first time I put it on, I thought it looked, felt and smelled exactly like Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream. I admit that I wanted to believe that the whole \\&quot;sea broth\\&quot; thing was for real, but sea broth or no sea broth, this won&#x27;t help your skin unless you plan to swim the English channel and want to spread it all over as a very expensive barrier cream, and even then, Vaseline would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to begin? It&#x27;s greasy like cold cream, and the smell was so strong that it made my eyes water and my nose run. Very attractive :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may as well buy Pond&#x27;s for a twentieth of the price. If you buy this, you are being ripped off.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m only 23 and my skin is not particularly dry, the La Mer representatives advised me to use the Moisturizing Lotion, as opposed to the original Creme.  Let me tell you, I am a believer!  Within a week my skin looked more even, felt like satin, and was noticeably firmer.  I would absolutely recommend this to those with younger skin, or to people who don&#x27;t have chronically dry or itchy skin (more normal/combination).  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was the kid who had horrible acne as a teenager and mild scarring as an adult. My hormones went wild after my daughter was born and this stuff was a miracle!  The texture of my skin is perfect. I have people constantly say how gorgeous my skin is- then I have to confess that it&#x27;s completely the La Mer. WELL worth the money- the 1 oz lasts about four months so really you&#x27;re not paying anymore than you would for Clinique etc that doesn&#x27;t get the job done. Invest in La Mer, give it a few months, and you&#x27;ll have amazing skin.</li>
            <li> Ive tried all the supposed best of the moment,breakthrough skin care,anti-aging,anti-wrinkle products in the past 5 yrs,and I just keep going back to La Mer.I use other products for at least six months to reap their full benefits,and honestly,my skin looks its most radiant and best when Im back with La Mer.I just stopped trying out other products now since its only La Mer that brings the best results.My skin always looks radiant and dewey.In terms of wrinkle improvement,there will only be a cosmetic change due to the fact that your skin will look moist,which lessens the appearance of lines.Lines are pronounced when skin is dry,thus all moisturizers work on keeping the skin moist which gives you the illusion of less lines.But this product is truly the best among all!!!Nothing else!</li>
            <li> This cream is unbelievably, average for the price and the rave reviews it tends to receive. I steered clear of this product for a long, time but due to a convincing yet incredibly, annoying sales girl, I bought this at Saks last week and I&#x27;m not at all sure what I was expecting, but it far surpassed the product! For starters..I have normal/combination skin, so a large portion of the negativity of this review is probably due to the performance of the product on my skin type. I used this for only TWO nights in a row, and my normally, clear skin began forming whiteheads and my t-zone became extremely oily, and visibly so....the pores around the area became noticeable almost immediately. The texture too, is horrid. It can only be best described as hard, butter.. is incredibly difficult to spread and practically melts on contact with your skin. It is also extremely sticky. That being said, this is probably the first AND the last time I&#x27;ll purchase anything from La Mer!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me while in NYC - I went in begging for someone to show me a highly moisturizing line as my skin is ridiculously dry .. plus I&#x27;m 40 now!   The young woman inside SAKS brought me to La Mer and a direct French woman with amazing skin.  They both (as well as the young womans&#x27; husband) professed to love it.  I had been disappointed I couldn&#x27;t find the Givency Skin Products that I have loved and used w/much success at the SAKS in Denver (I live in Northern Colorado) now so had resorted to ordering it online - and it has come stale and impossible to use.    So, nutshell, with La Mer, you don&#x27;t even need to use all the &#x27;extras&#x27; (eye serum, etc) cause the creme is amazing!    Is it ever on sale though???????    &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am 32. I have bad skin. I have spent oodles on every kind of presription and OTC skin product I can think of. I hesitated over a year before I bought htis product. I wanted to hate it and say it was an overpriced hoax. Ok, while overpriced for face cream (I mean come on la mer people $150??!?) I will infact, to my husband&#x27;s horror, be buying this product again. And again. And again. The 1 oz size is about half gone and has lasted me well over a month with 2 applications per day. longer than I expected. I had my 2 month follow up dermatologist appt and she even said \\&quot;wow, your skin is looking great. I mean really, don&#x27;t you think?\\&quot;. Granted I have a Rx, but rather than dry skin and adding wrinkles like many acne meds do, my skin is more dewy and hydrated than ever before. And I have ALWAYS gotten oily and broken out with any moisturizer. I just switched from Hakansson moisturizer, a swedish skin care line. While it didn&#x27;t cause too many breakouts, it never really seemed to absorb well into my skin.  Ok Ok enough of the rambling...the basics:  I am a skeptic, I hate that I gave in to the hype, but I have to agrree it is the best moisturizer i have found in my oily, acne-prone 10 plus years of adult acne.  Recommendation, follow the instrux! Buy direct from la mer and get the free samples :) Do not apply when your skin is wet, it won&#x27;t spread. Warm on your fingertips first. And only use a little.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product is on the pricey side, and no its not for every skin type. I have dry skin that craves moisture and this product delivered that in a way not many skin creams have. I have also heard my friends with oily skin say this broke them out, so I would say if you are prone to break outs, this might not be the product for you. I would wholey recommend this product to people with normal, dry and mature skin. I purchesed the whole La Mer line and my skin was very happy.  Make sure you consult with a La Mer sales person to know how to properly apply the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I started using Retin-A for my acne (moderate) and within less than 2 days, the Retin-A burned my face off.  I used every cream I could find for a few days with minimal results - 2 days after the initial Retin-A fiasco (I stopped using it immediately) I was still hurting, peeling, flaking, red and stinging. I was at a friend&#x27;s house for the weekend and his mother handed me a tiny jar of La Mer. I was sceptical, because I&#x27;ve heard it can cause breakouts because it&#x27;s so rich, but by then, I&#x27;d have preferred acne to whatever my face was doing. I have to say - the stuff is impressive. I used it overnight, tiny amount, and I woke up about 50% better. I used it during the day, and then the next night and the next day my face was perfect. I&#x27;ve been using it sparingly overnight to soothe my skin when my acne meds dry it out and it&#x27;s fantastic. My skin looks like it did when I was about 12 years old.  The one thing I will say is that I do still use acne-specific products as well, I&#x27;m worried the richness of La Mer will break me out, but honestly, small hassle for glowing skin.</li>
            <li> My fiancee works for Estee Lauder Companies, who owns La Mer.  Every now and then he brings me home some products and one day he brought me home a 1oz. jar of Creme de la Mer, raving about how his female and even some male colleagues really loved it.  I tried it once and was hooked.  I am 26, have combination oily/dry skin, and have had no breakouts from this product in over 3 months straight of using it every night.  This is the ONLY night cream I have ever used that does not make me break out in my T-zone, and it actually seems to regulate the oily/dry combination and make it evenly moisturized.  I will also attest to the fact that faint lines I had around my eyes have diminished, so for those of you who don&#x27;t think it is necessarily a product for reversing the signs of aging, perhaps it&#x27;s more of a product for prevention.  Either way, the texture of my skin has improved greatly, and my pores appear smaller.  I love this product and will buy a refill once this pot is gone.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have a 6 inch scar on my arm. I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists and plastic surgeons. I&#x27;ve had cortisone injections, prescription creams, and surgery to reduce the appearance of it. All to no avail. This was my last hope, and it worked! Within two weeks, my scar was flat, and the rendess disappeared. I can wear short sleeves again! I&#x27;m so impressed with the product, I started using it on my face. Now, I can&#x27;t stop getting compliments on how great my skin looks!</li>
