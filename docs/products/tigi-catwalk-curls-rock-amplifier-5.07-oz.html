            <li>My favorite product for my hair!!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, TO A PERSON THAT HAS CURLY HAIR, IT MAKES YOUR CURLS VERY NICE AND SHINE.</li>
            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>This helps form my curls nicely before applying my gel!</li>
            <li>Strictly Curls Curl Envy Perfect Curl Cream and Curly Sexy Hair Curling Creme.</li>
            <li>Saw it on a 2013 top 13 best products list, gave it a try</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled about it!</li>
            <li>So far this is the best, but just experimenting with the best way to get the desired effect in my hair.</li>
            <li>This item is really good in curly hair...</li>
            <li>My sister got a perm and this stuff added that ever day touch to make it look good.</li>
            <li>When it dries, it&#x27;s then a good 3 inches shorter.  </li>
            <li>The product does leave your hair moisturesed and smelling good but does not amplify the curls.</li>
            <li>I would sometimes get the Curl Lock if there was a good BOGO deal at the Regis salons.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my curls gorgeous</li>
            <li>I loved this product, BUT it did leave a build-up after awhile.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s really good for a drug store product, it&#x27;s still not as good as the TIGI Catwalk Curl Collection Curlesque Curls Rock</li>
            <li>I have used a good bit of it at this point, so there&#x27;s no point in trying to return it or anything.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s a good plan.</li>
            <li>This product is superior to those products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a good product to curl and define any type of curls I would say.</li>
            <li>Was a good choice.  </li>
            <li>Loved this product.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s effect on the hair is good.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find it as good</li>
            <li>I use a good deal - probably close to 6 pumps when all is said and done and then diffuse it to 80% dryness.</li>
            <li>I loved this product for years, but since I no longer use silicones, I don&#x27;t use this.  </li>
            <li>Product itself is good.</li>
            <li>Good price for this item, at retail stores 17$</li>
            <li>Good product for curly hair</li>
            <li>The stylist at the salon used this product on my hair to give my curls more definition, which the product did beautifully.  </li>
            <li>It works great for fine hair!  </li>
            <li>Great product, love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It helps calm my frizziness and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Anyway all Catwalk products are worth trying, best quality for the money.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this product and this is a great price.</li>
            <li>My hair is now curly and frizz free - it hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years!  </li>
            <li>My hair does better with this product than any others I&#x27;ve tried (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot!).  </li>
            <li>Love it - please keep it in stock!</li>
            <li>, I love the way it works, and my hair never looks frizzy!</li>

            <li>Love!  </li>

            <li>Glad to see i&#x27;m not alone in my feelings on the &amp;#34;revamping&amp;#34; of this product!</li>
            <li>love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t give up, curly hair is FABULOUS!!</li>
            <li>well I gave it another shot this year in 2013, and I have to say my curls look amazing after I diffuse my hair with it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product that manages frizz and feels great in my hair.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for my curls.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s seriously amazing.</li>
            <li>This cream works great leaving my curls frizz free.</li>
            <li>about this amazing product.</li>
            <li>My hair was so moisturize and works amazing for braidouts and twistouts.</li>
            <li>And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>My curls look amazing with this product.  </li>
            <li>absolutely the best for my kinky, curly afro hair</li>
            <li>For best result apply to very damp hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ve got some kind of problem.  </li>
            <li>My curls are bouncy, defined, frizz-free (most of the time - still can&#x27;t find a product for that), and the cream smells good to boot.</li>
            <li>This product defines nicely.</li>
            <li>Your curls will spiral and gives a nice shine to your hair.  </li>
            <li>and I thought something like this might give me some nice waves.  </li>
            <li>I have tried almost every hair product made by man and TIGI Catwalk is the absolute best brand on the market for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Since using this product, I have gotten even more compliments on how good my curls look.  </li>
            <li>I rub about 2 pumps of it onto my hands, and work it into my hair, and then kind of scrunch it with my hands.  </li>
            <li>&quot; so to speak, on it&#x27;s own cap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is kind of greasy when you apply it, and I have to wash my hands after I have put it into my hair.</li>
            <li>I liked how it made my curls shiny</li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li>and Im good to go all day and night - love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, my hair has never looked so good.  </li>
            <li>I had nice curls non frizzy, that lasted all day.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too.</li>
            <li>This product really works the best for me!</li>
            <li>I love this product and it was delivered promptly, however the dates indicate the product was expired, it would have been good to know that up front!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing, then I ran into a woman at work with nice curls</li>
            <li>Really gives me great curls!  </li>
            <li>But used sparingly makes for nice defined curls</li>
            <li>good stuff, love the way it smells and the hold i get from the product</li>
            <li>Bottom line, do your own research and decide what is \\&quot;safe\\&quot; for your hair.    </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m 50 I want to look updated not old!this product works better in drier climates but works almost as good in humid.</li>
            <li>I was also a very loyal Curls Rock fan because it was amazing!</li>
            <li>I had heard some great reviews on this product from friends and was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>Love this, love the way it smells and good for my hair -</li>
            <li>Curls Rock has good hold, nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I feel very strongly that you will like this item.  </li>
            <li>best product ever for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>great product but the original formula is better</li>
            <li>Best curling product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Absolutely best thing for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had occasion where for some reason all my curls kind of...became uniform, but for the most part this has excellent hold and leaves my hair soft and the curls defined.</li>
            <li>So far so good!!</li>
            <li>best thing i&#x27;ve found for my hair: keeps my natural curls together, but without any stiffness/odd textures.</li>
            <li>Best curling product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>This product is the best I&#x27;ve tried in making my hair separate, and soft.</li>
            <li>Have very fine hair and this product does the trick.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>Also It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the original.</li>
            <li>Although I think this product has great hold, I have a routine that gets my hair to look exactly like I want.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not frizzy, has a great shine, curls are super bouncy and light</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>My curls and more defined.</li>
            <li>Comparable to Curl Envy but helps maximize the curl in my wavy hair better without leaving hair crunchy.</li>
            <li>I have to say I love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Catwalk Curls Rock Amplifier...</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t know too many pastes like this.  </li>
            <li>Had order more already.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I love my hair now.</li>
            <li>I also use BIo silk for a more softer curl and not crunchy.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Works okay.</li>
            <li>Smell is okay and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>I think this product would work great for really curly hair.</li>
            <li>I came across Curlesque and have been using it for a couple weeks now, it works fabulously!</li>
            <li>Most hair product scents dissipate, but not those by TIGI.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it because it&#x27;s kind of pricey; but it makes my hair crunchy, and I was looking for more of the smooth silky curls.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and have been using it for years on my curly head.  </li>
            <li>I love this for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love how it holds my hair and can manipulate it into anything I want it to do.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this creme.</li>

            <li>Like all curly girls, I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products and it was my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love it though.</li>
            <li>Love the item</li>
            <li>Unruly may be a better adjective?</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products.</li>
            <li>My hair type is a strict 3b/c with mostly 3b waves and curls.</li>
            <li>And some days they come out better than others.  </li>
            <li>Catwalk is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with that though</li>
            <li>and I really love the product.</li>
            <li>Have purchased on Amazon at a better price ever since.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love it for my curly hair but will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Great price, delivered fast.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase the \\&quot;old\\&quot; product in stores.  </li>
            <li>I have tried both products and still love them both.  </li>
            <li>Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>I love that it does not make my curls crunchy like gel</li>
            <li>(2) Wish the price was a bit better.</li>
            <li>and I like it :)</li>
            <li>also better price here  </li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>Since I started paying attention to how much my stylist puts in my hair (of whatever she has on hand, and it&#x27;s never my products lol)</li>
            <li>I still use more than she does, bc</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has to be the best curl cream I&#x27;ve ever used, especially for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years.</li>
            <li>Although I still use mouse, putting a couple of dabs of this product on my hair before adding mouse just gives my hair an even better look.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to make the curls more pronounced.  </li>
            <li>and this is my favorite hair product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using for many years.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my curls look fabulous!</li>

            <li>still using it &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it, though I need to use 4 squirts for my hair (and maybe could even use more, but I am too thrifty to try).  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair in better shape and seems to have more of a conditioning effect.</li>
            <li>It styles just as well or better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>so i knew i would love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>For now though, it&#x27;s my favorite hair product</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many products from mousses to gels to sprays to conditioners to cream/gels.....</li>
            <li>and I have yet to find anything better.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>

            <li>Love.  </li>

            <li>and I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will order again and again.</li>
            <li>Its a touch drying, so I always make sure to have some oil or leave in, just to keep it touchable.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better. :-)</li>
            <li>This is what makes this product such a great value though; one applications can amplify curls for days, perhaps even a week!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>

            <li>I love this product line</li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s okay to use for curly hair for those who like to still have the noticeable look like you do have product on your hair.  </li>
            <li>but, it works for those who love that look.</li>
            <li>this wonderful Curl Cream actually has hold and smoothing power.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product on the recommendation of a website for curly-haired people like me, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>The thing I like most about this is the smell.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser used this, and  my hair became a likable part of my body.  </li>
            <li>I am really glad that I purchased this and gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>When I found this product five years ago, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>and I am in love with it.</li>

            <li>perfect hold all day long without the afro or frizz that you can get from gel.</li>
            <li>Gives your hair a beautiful style, with natural curl.</li>
            <li>I get pretty good results with this method.</li>
            <li>I know there are more great reviews on this than poor ones, but the things people describe as results when using this product are just not at all what I&#x27;ve experienced!</li>
            <li>I have naturally (really) curly hair, and it keeps things looking nice!</li>
            <li>I controls my curly frizzy hair all day long, and is excellent for the humid summer days.  </li>
            <li>I even wake up and my curls are still in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li>but after scrunching it with my fingers, it is now soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>When done I always scrunch my hair and break the cast around the curl, creating a beautiful soft, drfined curl.</li>
            <li>The smell is very light and the shipment came fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for just a little wave or some nice, crinkly scrunched curls.</li>
            <li>I live in the Pacific NW where you shouldn&#x27;t look like you do anything to your hair -- it should just look naturally great.</li>
            <li>This product is super for that kind of hair.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair so more manageable and easy to style...</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to use</li>
            <li>This works awesome on my dry course curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love this gel, it smells good and make your hair looks really</li>
            <li>The best way I can describe it is that the original was very \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and required lots of soap and water to wash off your hands; this cream just washes right</li>
            <li>Love the quick delivery!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out right before a vacation and went to the salon to get more, but was devastated to find out that Tigi had discontinued it!</li>
            <li>Great for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Then I do the top layer, and do a light hairspray spritz.</li>
            <li>holds the hair perfect giving it a wet look until you run your hands thru it again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years -- works great on my naturally curly hair to keep it in line.</li>
            <li>The first time that I ordered this product I received it as it was pictured and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Catwalk curls is a great product for natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of moisturizing and separating her curls leaving them soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>this is a great product for holding my natural curls.  </li>
            <li>I also love coffee, but I would rather run out of coffee and arrive at work caffiene free than have to wear a baseball hat to work.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for my naturally curly/frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product, not heavy nor drying.</li>
            <li>I love this product I have use it for a long time and works great in my curly hair what I love the most is when I shampoo my hair</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying this product at a fair price...</li>
            <li>I really like this product but not as good as their Curvaceous</li>
            <li>The original Curls Rock Curl Amplifier was the magic it needed -- I used just the *tiniest* amount (the size of a pea for my shoulder-length hair), and it would curl up my ringlets like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li>Other than that its awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products but they end up sitting in my cabinet as I just like this one best.</li>
            <li>I am able to put this product in my hair after a shower at night and it still looks great the next morning on my curls and I can style a bit and wear to work.</li>
            <li>If they changed the fragrance to something more clean and feminine</li>
            <li>I have to give my hands a good scrub to make sure the sticky residue is completely off of my hands.</li>
            <li>It kinda smells like men&#x27;s perfume or something; a bit too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>Smell was so strong I never even used it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not into strong scents, buy another product.</li>
            <li>If this product is used right it really gives my hair great texture.</li>
            <li>I can go out like that since I have a nice cut, or use hot rollers or my curling brush or blowdry to style with this product.</li>
            <li>But if you have fine hair, you&#x27;re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is the best product I have found to add some curl where I previously had frizz.</li>
            <li>but this works fine for me.</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li>The new formula does!!!!!  </li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve found so far for my very naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I think Amazon should not require these feedbacks to be a certain length because honestly I run out of things to say.</li>
            <li>This product has kept my curls looking good during the very hot, very humid weather we&#x27;ve experienced this last month.  </li>
            <li>Thats a huge price difference.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s great for 2nd day curls as well.  </li>
            <li>Such a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>Works great, especially for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>and i even use in my daughter&#x27;s hair (she has mixed hair) and it works great for her too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this on amazon cheaper then in my local beauty supply store in my mall.</li>
            <li>This product is great for defining curls that last all day.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for blow drying your hair with a diffuser</li>
            <li>I fight with dryness and my stylist blamed my cheap mouse.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something light and lacking crunch.</li>
            <li>Below is the detailed breakdown of this gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCENT</li>
            <li>texture is smooth but sticky.</li>
            <li>I finally found a great product for the frizz of my hair curly.</li>
            <li>frizz free.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I use and it works great for my frizzy curls.</li>
            <li>This gel is great for curly hair, especially on humid summer days.</li>
            <li>The price I can get it from Amazon is fantastic.</li>
            <li>two get one free to get this price.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and elastic</li>
            <li>and I use devacurl products or sulfate free shampoos, etc.    </li>
            <li>I loved the old formula it never made my hair look or feel crunchy.  </li>
            <li>This is what my hair stylist used in my hair and although I will never be able to produce the same results as she can, I still think this is a good product.</li>
            <li>So while it&#x27;s not the best scent a guy can ask for, the benefits outweigh it, especially when considering that there aren&#x27;t really ANY curls amplifiers for guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strangers come up to me a lot and tell me they love my hair, so I must be doing something right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other products and never been as happy with them as I am with the Tigi line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best hair product I have ever used to tame my curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Thanks for selling this product!!!</li>
            <li>I, too, was a *huge fan* of the original Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li>Thing is, I can&#x27;t see any difference performance-wise from the original Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with the original.</li>
            <li>I may have cried when I found out that my Subscribe &amp; Save was canceled because TIGI discontinued the original Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li>I think I had reason to worry because my curls ended up with a crunch that didn&#x27;t exist when I used the original Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li>THE PACKAGE LASTS ABOUT 2 MONTHS LES THAN ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li>I work long shift and by the end of the day my hair still looks great.</li>
            <li>and this is the first product I have found that I can use alone that I love.  </li>
            <li>Works great on long curly hair and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li>I have used TIGI&#x27;s original Curls Rock product for almost a decade and nothing else has compared to it.</li>
            <li>gel does carry a somewhat feminine scent, and it is pretty potent, but it&#x27;s not so feminine that I would recommend against guys wearing it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve heard people say that they prefer the original Tigi Curls Rock that wasn&#x27;t from the Curlesque collection.</li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this because first off it was cheaper than the curl lock</li>
            <li>Anyway, I washed my hair seven times over the next 18 hours, including using clarifying shampoo twice (at the suggestion of the stylist, who was very nice and apologetic, and really didn&#x27;t know this product would cause so many issues).  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great for my daughters long curly hair!  </li>
            <li>I use 1-2 pumps throughout my whole hair, let product sit in my damp hair for about 10 minutes scrunched on top of my head with a clip to absorb, then I lightly spray with Aussie Sprunch Spray (pump Hair Spray), then diffuse with diffuser/blowdryer.  </li>
            <li>This is great for curly hair in dry or humid climates.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to the product when the \\&quot;new version\\&quot; came out, I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I used this when it used to be in the bright blue packaging (not as \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; looking at all), because it was recommended by a stylist when I went to Toni &amp; Guy (who sold the line).</li>
            <li>It becomes full and curly...</li>
            <li>I will sometimes mix this with Kinky Curly and it gives me nice soft curls.</li>
            <li>After fighting my curls for 30 years, I was able to embrace them thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>Is a good products for curls totally recommended for women that want to have the control of her hair tnhks</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great for my thick natural curly hair and gives me the great hold in the humid FL weather</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s just going to rain anyway, and nobody cool in Portland carries an umbrella</li>
            <li>but my hair looks just as good before I go to bed at night as when I did when I left my house in the morning!</li>
            <li>When hair drys hair I have full shiny hair.</li>
            <li>In fact, another guy friend of mine tried some of this gel I had in my bathroom (he has full curls) and has used it ever since.</li>
            <li>also, my curls stay in good shape even the next day.</li>
            <li>Running out of this in my house is a full on emergency.</li>
            <li>Definitely like the original Curls Rock better!</li>
            <li>It was quick shipping</li>
            <li>The product is creamy and super sticky in your hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also currently pregnant</li>
            <li>My daughter is biracial with SUPER CURLY hair.  </li>
            <li>In fact I actually thinks it leaves more of a residue than most products that I use.  </li>
            <li>It tends to dissolve in water quickly.</li>
            <li>was extremely quick.  </li>
            <li>I keep coming back to curls rock because it is the only thing that tames frizz and creates perfect curls without getting super crunchy.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it&#x27;s so much better than getting at the commercial stores.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because there were so many high reviews.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>I never tried the previous version of this product, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I am very pleased with the way this product is able to minimize frizz, define and hold my curls.  </li>
            <li>Great for keep the fizz down and not weighting dow the curls, but I went through the bottle really quick</li>
            <li>so he uses it more as a normal gel rather than a curl amplifier.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair (lots of it)  and natural curl</li>
            <li>I have long VERY curly hair and was SO happy when I found this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every product out there, and while they work, this is the only product that makes my curls soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>first impression was that the Curlesque is stickier than the original.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely devastated that TIGI discontinued their curls rock amplifier!!</li>
            <li>I have used this every day since the first time I tried it!</li>
            <li>you have very curly hair that just needs taming, this would probably work fine.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair, but so much of it</li>
            <li>Thanks TIGI and Amazon for having this available.</li>
            <li>Not greasy or heavy and smells great.  </li>
            <li>This was a referral from my friend who has amazing curly hair and bounce using this same product.  </li>
            <li>Makes some amazing ringlets, calms frizz and gives it such an overall nice curly look.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t help me get defined-frizz free curls.  </li>
            <li>Fast, free shipping.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and is very</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every dime.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s hair is naturally curly but looks even better</li>
            <li>and I use 2 pumps worth of product.  </li>
            <li>By far my favorite product to use when it comes to my curls.</li>
            <li>Curlesque is the only product of its kind that keeps my frizzy hair in check.</li>
            <li>I did notice more curl in my naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the great hold or definition that the old version had and left my hair frizzy and lifeless.</li>
            <li>This made my curls really soft and kept them in place better than the &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; products I used to use.</li>
            <li>but its worth it.</li>
            <li>Also, I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s medium in texture and has a good wave but not really a curl.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a million products, this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit of getting used to in terms of how much to use (hint, a tiny tiny amount), but it makes my curls look great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s costly too but worth it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave you with super crispy curls after applying and you don&#x27;t need very much to do the job.</li>
            <li>(although, would have been nice if they would have taken a few more minutes to package them right).</li>
            <li>, Regis has a product called Curl Lock Curl Cream that I was certain was identical to original Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li>Once dry it looked pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I love the original Curls Rock Amplifier that came in the blue pump bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Curlesque product for a long time and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I put it in my hair right after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>It was priced right, so I decided to purchase online instead of in a salon.  </li>
            <li>My hair went to moist and soft with the original \\&quot;Curls Rock\\&quot; to straw with your so called \\&quot;Curl Collection\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>It is especially useful for those who don&#x27;t shower every day and don&#x27;t want to hassle doing their hair every day, since it has carryover effects to subsequent days after first using.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to get too much - a pea size amount for a decent size section is really all you need.</li>
            <li>They more use, the more weighed down your curls look.  </li>
            <li>This cream is the best, I have wavy hair and thanks to this styling product my waves looks naturally hairdo without looking or feeling tight or greasy.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using the other TIGI Catwalk Curl Amplifier (that comes in the light blue bottle) and I LOVED that one, it worked best for my thick wavy curls.</li>
            <li>Using only a small amount of this product works best to have a healthy looking not stiff appearance.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that will curl nicely if properly coerced, but will frizz out otherwise.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it helps my curly hair have a little more curl and it calms the frizz</li>
            <li>Works great on wet hair (makes it a little crunchy, but you can scrunch that out when your hair dries and still have curls), but I love it even more for second day curls - just apply a little to my top layer, squirt hair with a spray of water, and re-crunch for curls that look nice and hold, too.</li>
            <li>just doesn&#x27;t provide a strong hold to the curl but isn&#x27;t a problem since I use other products as well that have more hold.</li>
            <li>AT the recommendation of a friend with curly/frizzy hair like mine, I bought this product with high hopes...and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, it works, but it comes nowhere near the quality of the old TIGI curls rock.</li>
            <li>I love it because it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin,its not sticky or greasy and really helps style</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great for other people, but I&#x27;ll be sticking to the other Catwalk amplifier.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many many things (some in combination) to try and tame my hair.</li>
            <li>She uses this on her hair that is very, very curly.  </li>
            <li>VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>This product is great for reducing the frizzies that I always fight due to my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells really good, but it does tend to leave your hair a little crunchy, which is what i was trying to avoid.</li>
            <li>And I love the extra ummpfff I have.</li>
            <li>I put in a small amount (rubbed between my hands) and apply after I have her hair in pig tails or a ponytail, and the instant difference is incredible!</li>
            <li>leave in conditioner first.  </li>
            <li>( first is Argan oil, then Catwalk Curlesque, then gel) .</li>
            <li>My hair seems to be more frizzy and uncontrollable but the last straw was it makes my hair line break out!</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I use a leave in conditioner first.</li>
            <li>I threw it away, and I use something different that I love!!!!!!I love it</li>
            <li>The reason I&#x27;ve only rated this product as okay is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I particularly love the &amp;#34;Curls Rock Amplifier&amp;#34; above all others.</li>
            <li>Ever since my last favorite product was discontinued, and I tried everything in between before finding this gem.</li>
            <li>First bought it at the salon, where I go my hair cut.</li>
            <li>Really works for curly hair!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>The oiliness is so potent that it makes a next day</li>
            <li>I like this product better than traditional mousse.</li>
            <li>great product for thick curly hair</li>
            <li>Great for long or short hair.</li>
            <li>All of those reviews saying that it dries crunchy must be using too much!</li>
            <li>I use my leave in conditioner for moisture first</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this at the salon</li>
            <li>Even though the packaging has changed I have tried many things and I continue to come back to the Curls Rock Amplifier.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several months and the more I use it</li>
            <li>This only does an ok job at holding the curl.</li>
            <li>THE EXACT ITEM SOLD IN STORES FOR $18</li>
            <li>My fiance even complimented me on how my hair looked after first time using it.</li>
            <li>I was finally able to throw out my giant bottles of hairspray after using this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy and I only use 5 pumps on all my hair and if have a lot!!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t fault this too much!  </li>
            <li>and I sure wish it came in a bigger container</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>First time I tried it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>As someone young and fresh out of college, this is budget friendly, and saves me time getting ready.</li>
            <li>I have used countless other products and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and this is great to use for just a little curl control.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it helps me make it wavy or curly, instead of just frizzy or flat.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a good product, as it does as it should with defining curls, yet there are definite drawbacks in texture, smell, and initial feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s so much cheaper here than in my local store.</li>
            <li>and it it&#x27;s great for thick wavy to very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>have bought several over the years and find it&#x27;s the right amount of light hold, without being sticky or goopy.  </li>
            <li>I just know that this product hardly has a scent to it at all, isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy, washes out easily, and leaves my hair curls well defined while really light and bouncy and with a great shine.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used Curl Lock in a long time since TIGI is available at major retailers and most salons,</li>
            <li>I was hesitating to buy this, but read the positive reviews and decided to go for it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t affect color or shine except in a positive way.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that effectively manages frizz, but doesn&#x27;t get hard, stick, or make my head feel too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I put a decent amount in my hair right after showering, run my fingers through, and go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used this product, I used 5 pumps which was waaaaayy too much</li>
            <li>I had higher hopes since it cost so much</li>
            <li>This product works okay, but it certainly is not any better than the cheaper mousse that I can get from the local store.  </li>
            <li>My hair is bouncy, not weighed down, not sticky, smells amazing and all of my curls are well defined all day without frizz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Tigi&#x27;s Curls Rock (in the aqua blue container) for several years and been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make her hair feel crispy, combs out easily and definitely controls the frizz!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would certainly recommend...</li>
            <li>It certainly holds curls but it feels like glue.</li>
            <li>I have VERY curly hair, past my shoulders when wet, and this stuff is the best yet!!</li>
            <li>I can wear my hair wet curly or dry curly and it looks great.</li>
            <li>It has a good amount of hold but doesn&#x27;t dry solid like a gel.</li>
            <li>(works best if the hair is still really wet - not starting to dry and frizz).  </li>
            <li>product would be fine for things like events and dinners and such.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this product is consistently rated so highly for curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I have found that this is the only one that will leave my hair very curly and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what this is</li>
            <li>No gel or hair serum has defined my curls so much like this one does when diffusing my hair.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even use much.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, that gets frizzy.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much product (1-1.5 pumps for med-long hair), and I concentrate it on the bottom</li>
            <li>I put it on my crown once and used too much.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t amplify or hold my curls as much as I would prefer.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, you&#x27;ll have crunchy/clumpy.</li>
            <li>I was very tempted b/c</li>
            <li>i have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I used to have either very frizzy hair or very crunchy curls.</li>
            <li>This also let my hair feeling very &#x27;gunky&#x27; and the alcohol in it caused a lot of dandruff.</li>
            <li>Thanks Catwalk</li>
            <li>I thought I might have just used too much but even when I adjusted it was still</li>
            <li>I would just recommend that you really &amp;quot;smooth&amp;quot; it out in your hands before putting in your hair.  </li>
            <li>so much I don&#x27;t even want to say what it is....</li>
            <li>This product works fabulously on very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sticky, so don&#x27;t put too much in your hair.  </li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t use too much your hair will not be sticky.  </li>
            <li>But after my hair dries I can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>Although, none were damaged really.</li>
            <li>, I just keep my hair very curly.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well on curly or wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>&quot; If you&#x27;re getting a \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; result from any curl cream or mousse - you&#x27;re using way too much...</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much...</li>
            <li>This really pops my curls but with out the greasy sticky feel.</li>
            <li>If you want your hair to really stay in place or if you really want a product to help control the frizz, this is the one I recommend.</li>
            <li>it does bring out the curls really well and leaves hair silky...</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>Very upsetting</li>
            <li>This will really accentuate your curls but beware that it leaves your hair crunchy.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, it leaves your hair weighted and greasy.</li>
            <li>It really makes your curls pop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very spreadable and you can just rewet your hair if you need to throughout the day.</li>
            <li>And the curls stay for the whole day, and longer.</li>
            <li>It really tames my curls and I use my finger to twist them and use the serum while doing so</li>
            <li>I bought this to use with foam rollers and it does not give much staying power.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly kinky hair</li>
            <li>and this really makes a difference in controlling that problem.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>no matter how much we shake it</li>
            <li>It really keeps hair curly and helps curl it too.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than hair salon.</li>
            <li>For real.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is a real lifesaver.</li>
            <li>I use it with the leave-in conditioner, and it really holds your curls&#x27; definition well.</li>
            <li>Holds curls very well.</li>
            <li>This stuff works wonders for my very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I really would recommend trying it if you have curly hair.</li>
            <li>Thinking, they are all using too much, or not applying it evenly.</li>
            <li>- This stuff is tacky to the touch when you apply it and very greasy when you try to wash it off your hands or your hair.</li>
            <li>Hair looks greasy, too, if you use too much.</li>
            <li>I really like how i maintain my curls</li>
            <li>Not crunchy at all, if yours is coming out that way then you are putting way too much stuff in it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t require too much work or products beyond the this product.</li>
            <li>makes your hair very &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;  brings out curl and body and gets rid of frizz.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use that much.  </li>
            <li>which I don&#x27;t really like doing-</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>This product can be a bit sticky, beware of using too much.</li>
            <li>Too much makes my hair itch.</li>
            <li>Gives curl, but the cream is very sticky - can also get crunchy if too much is used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper on amazon for about $11 vs. $16 in drugstores.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll buy a few bottles of the old formula before they&#x27;re gone for good and save some money.</li>
            <li>Best stuff ever for my thick, coarse, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s the only one that boots my natural curls</li>
            <li>Use warm water and one pump and goes on evenly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and smells good.</li>
            <li>BUT I&#x27;m wondering if Regis was smart enough to stick to their original Curl Lock formula.  </li>
            <li>So sad, it had great slip but didn&#x27;t perform right.</li>
            <li>Great product and serious seller!</li>
            <li>This product really wakes my curls up better than any other product that I have used.  </li>
            <li>I have too many other things I need to get done in the morning.</li>
            <li>I tried the original formula several times and loathed it.  </li>
            <li>I use this with other curling products that hold curl more...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare the two as I didn&#x27;t use the original one in the blue bottle</li>
            <li>Now I wish I could have tried the original version especially because I did not even get on sale!</li>
            <li>I plan to use the Curlesque products a couple more times before deciding one way or the other whether I like them.</li>
            <li>, this product does a better job than the other one I was buying.  </li>
            <li>For my medium-thick, just-above-shoulder length hair, I use a partial pump (don&#x27;t push quite all the way down) and put more at the bottom of my hair than the top.</li>
            <li>Great stuff been using it for years, little goes long way!</li>
            <li>My hair looks great when it&#x27;s wet, but as soon as it dries the frizz ruins the curl.  </li>
            <li>I will say there is a pretty weird residue on my hands, so I use a bit of baby shampoo to really clean them off (I keep that handy on the counter b/c I use it to wash makeup brushes anyway - a tip from a Sephora store mgr I met!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will have amazing, soft, frizz less waves.</li>
            <li>However, my hair was nice and soft and much, much less frizzy.</li>
            <li>SO far this has worked really well - just don&#x27;t touch the hair during the day!</li>
            <li>It gets pretty wavy in the summer, but often almost completely straightens out in the winter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a moisturizer gel almost - keeps my hair looking healthy visually at least and keeps my curls together with my just enough lovely volume.</li>
            <li>and I have a good volume - especially when I combine it with the mousse I use, which I apply in the same manner but only after I use the curl</li>
            <li>I am currently using Redken Curvaceous Full Swirl</li>
            <li>if you really have missed the back of your head, use a tiny bit more....</li>
            <li>its not bad, just ... different.</li>
            <li>It is a tiny bit crunchy, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair and this is the only product that has worked for me so far.</li>
            <li>~5 inches so that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair on top of my head.</li>
            <li>If my hair is heavier, I feel like this product weighs is down even more.</li>
            <li>It did make my curls look ok, just weighed them down a bit though.</li>
            <li>Works better than mousse and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like</li>
            <li>and I have to find something new!</li>
            <li>I wish I had gone straight to the Curlesque line rather than wasting quite a bit of money to try something new.</li>
            <li>Since I didn&#x27;t have much of a choice, I crossed my fingers and purchased the new Curlesque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this new product to be very drying</li>
            <li>I have very tight natural curls and this stuff really helps with frizzy hair and holds my curls nice all day.  </li>
            <li>Since my previous favorite hair product was discontinued, I have been searching for almost a year for another curly-hair product that worked well for my hair.</li>
            <li>Feels sticky when going on but dry&#x27;s light with no residue.</li>
            <li>less is more, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was still in decent shape</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for curly girls.</li>
            <li>is HIGH.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped a lot during the spring (90*F + high high humidity)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I sleep with my hair in a high pony tail.  </li>
            <li>Personally I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference between this new formula than the old one.</li>
            <li>I only have to use a very small amount of this product for great result.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;they must have changed their formula, as it is a little more drying than it used to be...</li>
            <li>Since I have a little natural wave in my hair TIGI really brings out the waves and I love the way it leaves my hair feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have literally tried all the curly products from inexpensive to expensive, this is the only kind that keeps my hair from looking huge &amp; not frizzy!</li>
            <li>Exellent product, works very well for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>THE RESULTS ARE AMAZING my hair is soft and the curl is unbelievable.</li>
            <li>so far nothing really seems to do that.  </li>
            <li>It binds to the hair shaft readily and is a frequent component of shampoos and hair conditioners (in concentrations of 0.1-1%).</li>
            <li>The top of one was missing.</li>
            <li>I have wavy/curly normal hair and bought this based on the reviews on this site.</li>
            <li>My hair, despite it&#x27;s many chemical treatments and dryness, always comes out very shiny with my usual treatments, but with the Curlesque products I used, the shine was diminished.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review if these do a better job of holding my do together for a few days.</li>
            <li>This should have been a clue that this wasn&#x27;t any normal hair product.  </li>
            <li>It makes my curl form beautifully, without weighing them down or looking like I have an oil slick of product on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my naturally curly hair more manageable and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I like to shower in the evening, and if I rewet this in the morning, it springs right back.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a way to tame your tangled, frizzy, runaway curls without loosing sexy volume and bounce, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, and my stylist recommended this product for me and honestly every single time I use, I like it less.</li>
            <li>Curls are crispy tho, the gel has consistency of elmers glue, but does great on thick, long, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Thank god for my new stylist and all her tips.</li>
            <li>live in Houston, TX, and humidity</li>
            <li>I seriously can&#x27;t live without this for my hair.</li>
            <li>I will def continue to buy this one, new product and all.</li>
            <li>I live in South FL</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m out to find a new hair product line.  </li>
            <li>This new Curlesque version just doesn&#x27;t have the chops.</li>
            <li>THIS NEW FORMULA IS GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida;</li>
            <li>I am always trying new curl products when I want to have a curly hair day.</li>
            <li>I was in search of a new product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years and don&#x27;t notice a difference with the new version.</li>
            <li>Great product, only product that works on my loose spiral hair (used to have tight spirals but not after pregnancies).</li>
            <li>i am letting my hair be curly for the first time as an adult (used to blow dry hair and then hot iron it).</li>
            <li>If this happens it&#x27;s easily fixed by smoothing wet hands over it and dabbing lightly with a towel.</li>
            <li>This product is decent, but when I happened to glance at the bottom of the bottle, I noticed it had been expired nearly a year.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that some bottles don&#x27;t smell too good</li>
            <li>I let my hair air dry with this product, but I am sure if you use a diffuser you will get that same natural soft look as well!</li>
            <li>Defines my fine , curls with out weighing them down or making my hair &amp;#34;crunchy &amp;#34; or greasy.</li>
            <li>You have to get the right amount, if you get too much product it makes the hair have a wet, crunchy look.</li>
            <li>I rub it between my palms, lightly tap all over my hair, and really get the ends, then work it all in as well and evenly as possible (while wet, just out of the shower).</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have found that REALLY works!  </li>
            <li>The only difference is the higher price.  </li>
            <li>The best did not materialize. :(  </li>
            <li>My throat starting itching, and I knew that there would sadly be no Curlesque Rocks in my future.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw it at a beauty supply shop, individually priced much, much higher than Amazon.</li>
            <li>Wow, way to budget cut a product Tigi!</li>
            <li>I also do not shampoo my hair, just a friendly tip for other curly hair girls.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than other products such as mouse.  </li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised by this product!  </li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past, and always enjoyed it, but was sent a product that expired 6 months ago.</li>
            <li>hair salon sells it and the bottle is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I tried it many times - both air dry and diffusing and each time I ended up with dry, frizzy hair with no bounce what so ever</li>
            <li>Brings out the curls, light hold, doesn&#x27;t weigh my medium-length hair down.</li>
            <li>It locks in my fine curls without making them too soft or weighing them down.</li>
            <li>When using Curlesque, my hair was soft and moist, never frizzy (and I live in the South).  </li>
            <li>Not only is Curlesque line (shampoo, conditioner, &amp; amplifier) not the same amazing product, it is far more expensive.</li>
            <li>Last night I shampooed and conditioned my dry, permed, fine, color treated hair (Yikes-haha).  </li>
            <li>Keep it simple folks, and just start with one product (don&#x27;t fall for the \\&quot;snowball effect that you need the full line at once) - otherwise you&#x27;ll just toss a bunch next time you do Spring Cleaning!</li>
            <li>Normally would take tons of different products and way too much time to style my curls but not since I tried this.</li>
            <li>I often use John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz Ease to help keep the volume down and was hoping for something similar or better with CurlsRock.  </li>
            <li>I was initially unsure, because it is so thick, but once I got past the consistency, I realized how awesome this is.</li>
            <li>any event, I&#x27;ve gone through so many different products and cocktails of products, and honestly I&#x27;m not so sure if there is any other product available that works as well as even this new Curlesque stuff.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s definitely good to at least have on hand, even if you can&#x27;t afford to use it every single day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between the old blue bottle and the new turquoise bottle, so this is a review for both.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only pure liquid</li>
            <li>Can also restyle the next day with some water and a little more product.</li>
            <li>The next morning I scrunch up my hair with some water and add just a little bit more of this.</li>
            <li>Can also restyle the next day with some water and a little more product.</li>
            <li>little more expensive than some products, but the leave-in conditioner won&#x27;t have to be replaced as often as the actual curl defining cream, and it&#x27;s definitely worth paying more.</li>
            <li>It was clearly packed this way.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Did nothing for my natural curly hair ... just made it feel sticky</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair &amp; this</li>
            <li>hair is naturally wavy, but I can trick into into some curl with a diffuser.</li>
            <li>I comb thru until I like the look and just sit near my ceiling fan til it dries in place.</li>
            <li>you have light curl, this product might be too heavy for your hair.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll be buying the old stuff online from now on.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be without this product for my natural curls.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy like gels or a mousse.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my curls soft and keeps the frizz gone.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This leaves my curls flowing, soft and not crunchy.  </li>
            <li>yet my hair is still soft.</li>
            <li>NOT SO NATURAL FEELING</li>
            <li>I am 44 years old and have tried just about everything out there</li>
            <li>Curls stay soft and natural.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly / frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I like this product for my naturally curly hair, to enhance the curl a bit.</li>
            <li>But if you have frizz near your scalp you&#x27;ll need a softer product for that area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve got a layered cut and a bit of natural wave in my hair that can tend towards fuzzy if it gets humid</li>
            <li>This makes my hair look natural and as if there is no product in my hair.  </li>
            <li>had not used the old \\&quot;Curls</li>
            <li>but so far, this product has done everything it promises.</li>
            <li>My waves are defined, frizz-free, and soft to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i like it because it&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li>My hair would either be crunchy from too much hold or frizzy from not enough.</li>
            <li>and I want soft curls</li>
            <li>But when the gel cast is released, it is quite soft.  </li>
            <li>To refreshen day old curls, I just dab some water on them with a hint of product too.  </li>
            <li>My hair was sticky and too perfumy with the old formula.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this prevents my frizz showing.</li>
            <li>my 17 year old son with natural curls has stolen mine....</li>
            <li>It calms the friz and and has a soft look and feel.  </li>
            <li>it defines and enhance my natural curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Can be styled so the curls are soft or crunchy.</li>
            <li>I can get this so much cheaper on Amazon than I can at my local salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always hoping a product will amp up the natural curl and</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Your curls stay soft while giving a look that you have used a mousse.</li>
            <li>I prefer soft curs or waves.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give it a try for soft curls.</li>
            <li>and I like the way it leaves my curls looking soft.</li>
            <li>It gives a soft hold.</li>
            <li>I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried TONS of products, but nothing makes my hair&#x27;s natural curl come out like this product does.  </li>
            <li>As far as the alcohol in ingredient list: Panthenol is a humectant, emollient and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft again.</li>
            <li>I can touch it after it dries and it doesn&#x27;t result in poofy, old lady hair.</li>
            <li>It holds pretty well, although I find if I put too much, it can weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>I have course curly hair and in all my years of looking for a product that smooth&#x27;s and holds my curls with out the stiff feeling</li>
            <li>, when my hair becomes dry, I just scruntch it a bit to release the crunchy quality it  first has.  </li>
            <li>With a head full of curly hair, my hair would be a wild mess without it.</li>
            <li>and I use less then a full pump</li>
            <li>and I use exactly one single pump, and that is all I need.</li>
            <li>I have used similar products from regular name brands that cost less, but I had to use alot more product which in the end does not save money.  </li>
            <li>so I can have decent hair throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li>The fact that this particular ingredient was left off of some sites says a lot.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you only use a small amount.  </li>
            <li>I have used many products in the past; however, for the last three years I have been using this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>My satisfaction with curlesque could be weighted slightly because the other product I tried (Deva Curl) totally dried out my hair and give it no shape at all, but I am really happy so far.</li>
            <li>Your hair comes out really curly but not natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I used Paul Mitchell conditioning mousse in the past and also enjoy that product.  </li>
            <li>gel.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE and will continue to use as long as price remains reasonable.</li>
            <li>did notice when I first wet my hair that it was sticky and felt strange...and not the way it does after using spray or mousse.  </li>
            <li>It helps a little bit but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do extraordinary work.</li>
            <li>I love this product it helps keep the frizz down in my natural curly hair but does so with put making my hair feel sticky and weighed down.</li>
            <li>This came in the mail with out the cap, and on top of that half empty because it was all over the box!</li>
            <li>After seeing all the bad reviews from Curls Rock users, I was really hesitant to try this product as I had loved Curls Rock, used it for years and was devastated when I saw it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>My very curly, dry hair could not survive without it!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>If I ever apply too much by accident I wait for my hair to be completely dry before I scrunch it out.</li>
            <li>I try to fix this by gently scrunching my hair when it&#x27;s almost dry...</li>
            <li>Hair blown dry remained straight and frizz-free even in the rain.</li>
            <li>and then I switch back to a day or two of straight hair or a simple ponytail.</li>
            <li>A little goes such a long way with most styling products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, you only need a small amount to make it work, if you combine it with a little bit of water.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, easily washes out and does not feel greasy or crunchy.</li>
            <li>My hair frizzes very easily and with other products I was not able to touch my hair because it would get</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and buy it at least three botles at a time!  </li>
            <li>if there are any frizzy curls, i just wet my hair with my hand and the leftover product makes the curl bounce right back</li>
            <li>I have a slight wave to my hair that can become a curl with the right product</li>
            <li>The original formula was heavy, greasy and made me just feel blah and gross.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that, when applied properly, controls my frizz and leaves my curls soft and looking very natural.</li>
            <li>I have long, naturally wavy hair - it doesn&#x27;t have tight curls, but it certainly couldn&#x27;t be considered straight.</li>
            <li>Many products I&#x27;ve tried have weighed down my curls making them look like a lifeless mess.</li>
            <li>As long as Amazon offers,  I&#x27;ll never use anything else on her hair!!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I have frizzy hard to manage curls and this stuff turns them into lovely little ringlets with almost no styling, just shower, towel dry and run it through your hair, though you have to be careful as it dries or the product on the back of your hair will get wiped away.</li>
            <li>products generally smell good to me, but they are so artificial and cloying</li>
            <li>This is NOT the same and doesn&#x27;t do for my curls what the old Curls Rock did.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this product if you have natural curly hair .</li>
            <li>(I think the old Curls Rock was only 4 oz</li>
            <li>This product makes your curls feel soft and provides enough hold</li>
            <li>I suspect that the curliness of each curl might actually curl even further in the subsequent days after the first application than in the hours after putting it on, for different reasons that I theorize.</li>
            <li>This product is the only thing that works for my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because it does glide through wet hair very well, and when I applied it to my dry hair while it was curled, it did give some decent definition without stiffness.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my gym instructor who&#x27;s hair obviously looked so soft and bouncy that I had to ask her where she bought this product.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that controls my hair and helps it stay clumped together in natural sort of way without also leaving it crispy or stringy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a secret :-)</li>
            <li>Love this product for my long, thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky or stiff, and really brings out curls so they look natural and soft.</li>
            <li>and they are the top ingredients in their new expensive product.</li>
            <li>If you blow dry your hair; will not dry &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; but give you soft natural curls.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t super heavy, and it hasn&#x27;t stopped me from using it often!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately for me, I can&#x27;t use this product because it is so heavily perfumed and it greatly bothers my allergies.  </li>
            <li>My curls did come out softly defined, but I could definitely feel product in my hair whereas with my old routine, I couldn&#x27;t feel any coating on my hair once dry.  </li>
            <li>Now, if you add too much, or you add it to dry hair, it WILL definitely be crispy (and possibly stringy if you shake your hair)</li>
            <li>Only need a small amount of this to tame my frizzy flyaways into nice curls and waves.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out your hair or make your hair crunchy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair (my heritage is Italian, Norwegian, French) and it can be so hard to manage with out the right products.</li>
            <li>then it will be a little crunchy at first.  </li>
            <li>My aforementioned friend with long curly hair down to his shoulders only uses about a nickel sized amount of gel, but he already has full curls</li>
            <li>With my naturally wavy and frizzy hair, it&#x27;s hard to find something that holds my business together for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for a long time because it works on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It not only conditions your hair as you apply it, but for all you curly thin haired women, it provides structure while keeping hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the only thing that controls my natural curly hair, and I have tried sooo many products, cheep and expensive.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how fresh it was?  </li>
            <li>It really defines curls and control frizz without weighing the hair down.</li>
            <li>My hair as far as texture, feels very similar with this product in it, to what it naturally feels like without (very soft), only it cures any frizzies and uneven curling like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon is usually wonderful, but I was a little disappointed this time.</li>
            <li>I have curly, coarse hair - just a little defines without drying crisply like mousse or gel.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy and will curl with the right product (usually spray  gel).  </li>
            <li>I have let dry naturally and have used diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I just work a bit through my hair either when towel dried on lazy days, or after blow drying when I&#x27;m feeling energetic and it does the trick.</li>
            <li>After the first day of using this, I will often not need to apply it for the next few days until I shower again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with curly hair, the trick is to scrunch it in from the bottom on up and let air dry!!!</li>
            <li>But then you just scrunch your hair in your hands, maybe let the car window down for a minute and will be soft and natural bouncy curls in no time.</li>
            <li>I have thick fine hair that has natural half waves.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have always had very dry natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It really stays all day and in the morning all you have to do is spray a little water to re-activate the product.</li>
            <li>When asked if I could only take one item with me to a deserted island, I seriously answered a suitcase full of this hair product.</li>
            <li>Smells odd, not bad per say but just slightly off.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> My favorite product for my hair!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, TO A PERSON THAT HAS CURLY HAIR, IT MAKES YOUR CURLS VERY NICE AND SHINE.</li>
            <li> It is amazing!</li>
            <li> This helps form my curls nicely before applying my gel!</li>
            <li> Strictly Curls Curl Envy Perfect Curl Cream and Curly Sexy Hair Curling Creme.</li>
            <li> Saw it on a 2013 top 13 best products list, gave it a try</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled about it!</li>
            <li> So far this is the best, but just experimenting with the best way to get the desired effect in my hair.</li>
            <li> This item is really good in curly hair...</li>
            <li> My sister got a perm and this stuff added that ever day touch to make it look good.</li>
            <li> When it dries, it&#x27;s then a good 3 inches shorter.  </li>
            <li> The product does leave your hair moisturesed and smelling good but does not amplify the curls.</li>
            <li> I would sometimes get the Curl Lock if there was a good BOGO deal at the Regis salons.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my curls gorgeous</li>
            <li> I loved this product, BUT it did leave a build-up after awhile.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s really good for a drug store product, it&#x27;s still not as good as the TIGI Catwalk Curl Collection Curlesque Curls Rock</li>
            <li> I have used a good bit of it at this point, so there&#x27;s no point in trying to return it or anything.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s a good plan.</li>
            <li> This product is superior to those products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a good product to curl and define any type of curls I would say.</li>
            <li> Was a good choice.  </li>
            <li> Loved this product.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s effect on the hair is good.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find it as good</li>
            <li> I use a good deal - probably close to 6 pumps when all is said and done and then diffuse it to 80% dryness.</li>
            <li> I loved this product for years, but since I no longer use silicones, I don&#x27;t use this.  </li>
            <li> Product itself is good.</li>
            <li> Good price for this item, at retail stores 17$</li>
            <li> Good product for curly hair</li>
            <li> The stylist at the salon used this product on my hair to give my curls more definition, which the product did beautifully.  </li>
            <li> It works great for fine hair!  </li>
            <li> Great product, love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It helps calm my frizziness and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Anyway all Catwalk products are worth trying, best quality for the money.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this product and this is a great price.</li>
            <li> My hair is now curly and frizz free - it hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years!  </li>
            <li> My hair does better with this product than any others I&#x27;ve tried (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot!).  </li>
            <li> Love it - please keep it in stock!</li>

            <li> Glad to see i&#x27;m not alone in my feelings on the &amp;#34;revamping&amp;#34; of this product!</li>
            <li> love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up, curly hair is FABULOUS!!</li>
            <li> well I gave it another shot this year in 2013, and I have to say my curls look amazing after I diffuse my hair with it.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product that manages frizz and feels great in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for my curls.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s seriously amazing.</li>
            <li> This cream works great leaving my curls frizz free.</li>
            <li> about this amazing product.</li>
            <li> My hair was so moisturize and works amazing for braidouts and twistouts.</li>
            <li> And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> My curls look amazing with this product.  </li>
            <li> absolutely the best for my kinky, curly afro hair</li>
            <li> For best result apply to very damp hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ve got some kind of problem.  </li>
            <li> My curls are bouncy, defined, frizz-free (most of the time - still can&#x27;t find a product for that), and the cream smells good to boot.</li>
            <li> This product defines nicely.</li>
            <li> Your curls will spiral and gives a nice shine to your hair.  </li>
            <li> and I thought something like this might give me some nice waves.  </li>
            <li> I have tried almost every hair product made by man and TIGI Catwalk is the absolute best brand on the market for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Since using this product, I have gotten even more compliments on how good my curls look.  </li>
            <li> I rub about 2 pumps of it onto my hands, and work it into my hair, and then kind of scrunch it with my hands.  </li>
            <li> &quot; so to speak, on it&#x27;s own cap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is kind of greasy when you apply it, and I have to wash my hands after I have put it into my hair.</li>
            <li> I liked how it made my curls shiny</li>
            <li> It also has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li> and Im good to go all day and night - love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, my hair has never looked so good.  </li>
            <li> I had nice curls non frizzy, that lasted all day.</li>
            <li> It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> This product really works the best for me!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it was delivered promptly, however the dates indicate the product was expired, it would have been good to know that up front!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing, then I ran into a woman at work with nice curls</li>
            <li> Really gives me great curls!  </li>
            <li> But used sparingly makes for nice defined curls</li>
            <li> good stuff, love the way it smells and the hold i get from the product</li>
            <li> Bottom line, do your own research and decide what is \\&quot;safe\\&quot; for your hair.    </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m 50 I want to look updated not old!this product works better in drier climates but works almost as good in humid.</li>
            <li> I was also a very loyal Curls Rock fan because it was amazing!</li>
            <li> I had heard some great reviews on this product from friends and was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li> Love this, love the way it smells and good for my hair -</li>
            <li> Curls Rock has good hold, nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I feel very strongly that you will like this item.  </li>
            <li> best product ever for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> great product but the original formula is better</li>
            <li> Best curling product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Absolutely best thing for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had occasion where for some reason all my curls kind of...became uniform, but for the most part this has excellent hold and leaves my hair soft and the curls defined.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!</li>
            <li> best thing i&#x27;ve found for my hair: keeps my natural curls together, but without any stiffness/odd textures.</li>
            <li> Best curling product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve tried in making my hair separate, and soft.</li>
            <li> Have very fine hair and this product does the trick.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> Also It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the original.</li>
            <li> Although I think this product has great hold, I have a routine that gets my hair to look exactly like I want.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not frizzy, has a great shine, curls are super bouncy and light</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> My curls and more defined.</li>
            <li> Comparable to Curl Envy but helps maximize the curl in my wavy hair better without leaving hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have to say I love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Catwalk Curls Rock Amplifier...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t know too many pastes like this.  </li>
            <li> Had order more already.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and I love my hair now.</li>
            <li> I also use BIo silk for a more softer curl and not crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works okay.</li>
            <li> Smell is okay and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I think this product would work great for really curly hair.</li>
            <li> I came across Curlesque and have been using it for a couple weeks now, it works fabulously!</li>
            <li> Most hair product scents dissipate, but not those by TIGI.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it because it&#x27;s kind of pricey; but it makes my hair crunchy, and I was looking for more of the smooth silky curls.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for years on my curly head.  </li>
            <li> I love this for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love how it holds my hair and can manipulate it into anything I want it to do.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this creme.</li>
            <li> 16 - just ordered 4 more units of this .</li>
            <li> love the smell of this product</li>
            <li> I will always have this!! :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it has practically changed me life :)</li>
            <li> Like all curly girls, I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products and it was my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love it though.</li>
            <li> Love the item</li>
            <li> Unruly may be a better adjective?</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products.</li>
            <li> My hair type is a strict 3b/c with mostly 3b waves and curls.</li>
            <li> And some days they come out better than others.  </li>
            <li> Catwalk is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with that though</li>
            <li> and I really love the product.</li>
            <li> Have purchased on Amazon at a better price ever since.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it for my curly hair but will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Great price, delivered fast.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase the \\&quot;old\\&quot; product in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have tried both products and still love them both.  </li>
            <li> Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> I love that it does not make my curls crunchy like gel</li>
            <li> (2) Wish the price was a bit better.</li>
            <li> and I like it :)</li>
            <li> also better price here  </li>
            <li> like the mousse but even better this amplifier.</li>
            <li> AND SHE HAS LOVELY CURLY HAIR LIKE MINE.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> Since I started paying attention to how much my stylist puts in my hair (of whatever she has on hand, and it&#x27;s never my products lol)</li>
            <li> I still use more than she does, bc</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has to be the best curl cream I&#x27;ve ever used, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for many years.</li>
            <li> Although I still use mouse, putting a couple of dabs of this product on my hair before adding mouse just gives my hair an even better look.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to make the curls more pronounced.  </li>
            <li> and this is my favorite hair product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for many years.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my curls look fabulous!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product ever.</li>
            <li> I love this product a lot.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but was shipped without a cap.  </li>
            <li> still using it &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it, though I need to use 4 squirts for my hair (and maybe could even use more, but I am too thrifty to try).  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair in better shape and seems to have more of a conditioning effect.</li>
            <li> It styles just as well or better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> so i knew i would love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> For now though, it&#x27;s my favorite hair product</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many products from mousses to gels to sprays to conditioners to cream/gels.....</li>
            <li> and I have yet to find anything better.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Get something better.</li>
            <li> Love.  </li>
            <li> then I apply the TIGI gel on top ..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will order again and again.</li>
            <li> Its a touch drying, so I always make sure to have some oil or leave in, just to keep it touchable.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better. :-)</li>
            <li> This is what makes this product such a great value though; one applications can amplify curls for days, perhaps even a week!</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve ordered more of the Tigi Curls Rock Amplifier</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else love this product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used Curlsrock for many years and have my sister and mother using it also.</li>
            <li> I REGRET NOT PURCHASING MORE BOTTLES.ITS</li>
            <li> I love this product line</li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s okay to use for curly hair for those who like to still have the noticeable look like you do have product on your hair.  </li>
            <li> but, it works for those who love that look.</li>
            <li> this wonderful Curl Cream actually has hold and smoothing power.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of a website for curly-haired people like me, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> The thing I like most about this is the smell.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this, and  my hair became a likable part of my body.  </li>
            <li> I am really glad that I purchased this and gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> When I found this product five years ago, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> and I am in love with it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> i love it and reordered it</li>
            <li> I love my hair</li>
            <li> Comparable to Curl Envy but helps maximize the curl in my wavy hair better without leaving hair crunchy.</li>

            <li> The product help keeps the curl in your hair all day and keeps them more defined.</li>
            <li> Just be sure that if you&#x27;re using it with a greasy shampoo (like coconut hibiscus) to use a clarifying shampoo every week or so to prevent against buildup.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery  Great Product</li>
            <li> and it works way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> It also has a nice very light, sweet lemon scentto it.</li>
            <li> Great product great price fast shipping highly recommend P</li>
            <li> perfect hold all day long without the afro or frizz that you can get from gel.</li>
            <li> Gives your hair a beautiful style, with natural curl.</li>
            <li> I get pretty good results with this method.</li>
            <li> I know there are more great reviews on this than poor ones, but the things people describe as results when using this product are just not at all what I&#x27;ve experienced!</li>
            <li> I have naturally (really) curly hair, and it keeps things looking nice!</li>
            <li> I controls my curly frizzy hair all day long, and is excellent for the humid summer days.  </li>
            <li> I even wake up and my curls are still in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li> but after scrunching it with my fingers, it is now soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> When done I always scrunch my hair and break the cast around the curl, creating a beautiful soft, drfined curl.</li>
            <li> The smell is very light and the shipment came fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for just a little wave or some nice, crinkly scrunched curls.</li>
            <li> I live in the Pacific NW where you shouldn&#x27;t look like you do anything to your hair -- it should just look naturally great.</li>
            <li> This product is super for that kind of hair.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair so more manageable and easy to style...</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use</li>
            <li> This works awesome on my dry course curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love this gel, it smells good and make your hair looks really</li>
            <li> The best way I can describe it is that the original was very \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and required lots of soap and water to wash off your hands; this cream just washes right</li>
            <li> Love the quick delivery!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out right before a vacation and went to the salon to get more, but was devastated to find out that Tigi had discontinued it!</li>
            <li> Great for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Then I do the top layer, and do a light hairspray spritz.</li>
            <li> holds the hair perfect giving it a wet look until you run your hands thru it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years -- works great on my naturally curly hair to keep it in line.</li>
            <li> The first time that I ordered this product I received it as it was pictured and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Catwalk curls is a great product for natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of moisturizing and separating her curls leaving them soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for holding my natural curls.  </li>
            <li> I also love coffee, but I would rather run out of coffee and arrive at work caffiene free than have to wear a baseball hat to work.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my naturally curly/frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product, not heavy nor drying.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have use it for a long time and works great in my curly hair what I love the most is when I shampoo my hair</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for carrying this product at a fair price...</li>
            <li> I really like this product but not as good as their Curvaceous</li>
            <li> The original Curls Rock Curl Amplifier was the magic it needed -- I used just the *tiniest* amount (the size of a pea for my shoulder-length hair), and it would curl up my ringlets like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li> Other than that its awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but they end up sitting in my cabinet as I just like this one best.</li>
            <li> I am able to put this product in my hair after a shower at night and it still looks great the next morning on my curls and I can style a bit and wear to work.</li>
            <li> If they changed the fragrance to something more clean and feminine</li>
            <li> I have to give my hands a good scrub to make sure the sticky residue is completely off of my hands.</li>
            <li> It kinda smells like men&#x27;s perfume or something; a bit too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> Smell was so strong I never even used it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not into strong scents, buy another product.</li>
            <li> If this product is used right it really gives my hair great texture.</li>
            <li> I can go out like that since I have a nice cut, or use hot rollers or my curling brush or blowdry to style with this product.</li>
            <li> But if you have fine hair, you&#x27;re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is the best product I have found to add some curl where I previously had frizz.</li>
            <li> but this works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li> The new formula does!!!!!  </li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve found so far for my very naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I think Amazon should not require these feedbacks to be a certain length because honestly I run out of things to say.</li>
            <li> This product has kept my curls looking good during the very hot, very humid weather we&#x27;ve experienced this last month.  </li>
            <li> Thats a huge price difference.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s great for 2nd day curls as well.  </li>
            <li> Such a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great, especially for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and i even use in my daughter&#x27;s hair (she has mixed hair) and it works great for her too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this on amazon cheaper then in my local beauty supply store in my mall.</li>
            <li> This product is great for defining curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for blow drying your hair with a diffuser</li>
            <li> I fight with dryness and my stylist blamed my cheap mouse.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something light and lacking crunch.</li>
            <li> Below is the detailed breakdown of this gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCENT</li>
            <li> texture is smooth but sticky.</li>
            <li> I finally found a great product for the frizz of my hair curly.</li>
            <li> frizz free.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use and it works great for my frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> This gel is great for curly hair, especially on humid summer days.</li>
            <li> The price I can get it from Amazon is fantastic.</li>
            <li> two get one free to get this price.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth and elastic</li>
            <li> and I use devacurl products or sulfate free shampoos, etc.    </li>
            <li> I loved the old formula it never made my hair look or feel crunchy.  </li>
            <li> This is what my hair stylist used in my hair and although I will never be able to produce the same results as she can, I still think this is a good product.</li>
            <li> So while it&#x27;s not the best scent a guy can ask for, the benefits outweigh it, especially when considering that there aren&#x27;t really ANY curls amplifiers for guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strangers come up to me a lot and tell me they love my hair, so I must be doing something right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other products and never been as happy with them as I am with the Tigi line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hair product I have ever used to tame my curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Thanks for selling this product!!!</li>
            <li> I, too, was a *huge fan* of the original Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li> Thing is, I can&#x27;t see any difference performance-wise from the original Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with the original.</li>
            <li> I may have cried when I found out that my Subscribe &amp; Save was canceled because TIGI discontinued the original Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li> I think I had reason to worry because my curls ended up with a crunch that didn&#x27;t exist when I used the original Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li> THE PACKAGE LASTS ABOUT 2 MONTHS LES THAN ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li> I work long shift and by the end of the day my hair still looks great.</li>
            <li> and this is the first product I have found that I can use alone that I love.  </li>
            <li> Works great on long curly hair and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> I have used TIGI&#x27;s original Curls Rock product for almost a decade and nothing else has compared to it.</li>
            <li> gel does carry a somewhat feminine scent, and it is pretty potent, but it&#x27;s not so feminine that I would recommend against guys wearing it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve heard people say that they prefer the original Tigi Curls Rock that wasn&#x27;t from the Curlesque collection.</li>
            <li> It smells great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this because first off it was cheaper than the curl lock</li>
            <li> Anyway, I washed my hair seven times over the next 18 hours, including using clarifying shampoo twice (at the suggestion of the stylist, who was very nice and apologetic, and really didn&#x27;t know this product would cause so many issues).  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great for my daughters long curly hair!  </li>
            <li> I use 1-2 pumps throughout my whole hair, let product sit in my damp hair for about 10 minutes scrunched on top of my head with a clip to absorb, then I lightly spray with Aussie Sprunch Spray (pump Hair Spray), then diffuse with diffuser/blowdryer.  </li>
            <li> This is great for curly hair in dry or humid climates.  </li>
            <li> I was first introduced to the product when the \\&quot;new version\\&quot; came out, I loved it.  </li>
            <li> I used this when it used to be in the bright blue packaging (not as \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; looking at all), because it was recommended by a stylist when I went to Toni &amp; Guy (who sold the line).</li>
            <li> It becomes full and curly...</li>
            <li> I will sometimes mix this with Kinky Curly and it gives me nice soft curls.</li>
            <li> After fighting my curls for 30 years, I was able to embrace them thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> Is a good products for curls totally recommended for women that want to have the control of her hair tnhks</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great for my thick natural curly hair and gives me the great hold in the humid FL weather</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s just going to rain anyway, and nobody cool in Portland carries an umbrella</li>
            <li> but my hair looks just as good before I go to bed at night as when I did when I left my house in the morning!</li>
            <li> When hair drys hair I have full shiny hair.</li>
            <li> In fact, another guy friend of mine tried some of this gel I had in my bathroom (he has full curls) and has used it ever since.</li>
            <li> also, my curls stay in good shape even the next day.</li>
            <li> Running out of this in my house is a full on emergency.</li>
            <li> Definitely like the original Curls Rock better!</li>
            <li> It was quick shipping</li>
            <li> The product is creamy and super sticky in your hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also currently pregnant</li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial with SUPER CURLY hair.  </li>
            <li> In fact I actually thinks it leaves more of a residue than most products that I use.  </li>
            <li> It tends to dissolve in water quickly.</li>
            <li> was extremely quick.  </li>
            <li> I keep coming back to curls rock because it is the only thing that tames frizz and creates perfect curls without getting super crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it&#x27;s so much better than getting at the commercial stores.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because there were so many high reviews.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> I never tried the previous version of this product, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I am very pleased with the way this product is able to minimize frizz, define and hold my curls.  </li>
            <li> Great for keep the fizz down and not weighting dow the curls, but I went through the bottle really quick</li>
            <li> so he uses it more as a normal gel rather than a curl amplifier.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair (lots of it)  and natural curl</li>
            <li> I have long VERY curly hair and was SO happy when I found this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product out there, and while they work, this is the only product that makes my curls soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> first impression was that the Curlesque is stickier than the original.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely devastated that TIGI discontinued their curls rock amplifier!!</li>
            <li> I have used this every day since the first time I tried it!</li>
            <li> you have very curly hair that just needs taming, this would probably work fine.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair, but so much of it</li>
            <li> Thanks TIGI and Amazon for having this available.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or heavy and smells great.  </li>
            <li> This was a referral from my friend who has amazing curly hair and bounce using this same product.  </li>
            <li> Makes some amazing ringlets, calms frizz and gives it such an overall nice curly look.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t help me get defined-frizz free curls.  </li>
            <li> Fast, free shipping.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and is very</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every dime.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair is naturally curly but looks even better</li>
            <li> and I use 2 pumps worth of product.  </li>
            <li> By far my favorite product to use when it comes to my curls.</li>
            <li> Curlesque is the only product of its kind that keeps my frizzy hair in check.</li>
            <li> I did notice more curl in my naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the great hold or definition that the old version had and left my hair frizzy and lifeless.</li>
            <li> This made my curls really soft and kept them in place better than the &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; products I used to use.</li>
            <li> but its worth it.</li>
            <li> Also, I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s medium in texture and has a good wave but not really a curl.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a million products, this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit of getting used to in terms of how much to use (hint, a tiny tiny amount), but it makes my curls look great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s costly too but worth it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you with super crispy curls after applying and you don&#x27;t need very much to do the job.</li>
            <li> (although, would have been nice if they would have taken a few more minutes to package them right).</li>
            <li> , Regis has a product called Curl Lock Curl Cream that I was certain was identical to original Curls Rock.  </li>
            <li> Once dry it looked pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I love the original Curls Rock Amplifier that came in the blue pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Curlesque product for a long time and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair right after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li> It was priced right, so I decided to purchase online instead of in a salon.  </li>
            <li> My hair went to moist and soft with the original \\&quot;Curls Rock\\&quot; to straw with your so called \\&quot;Curl Collection\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> It is especially useful for those who don&#x27;t shower every day and don&#x27;t want to hassle doing their hair every day, since it has carryover effects to subsequent days after first using.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to get too much - a pea size amount for a decent size section is really all you need.</li>
            <li> They more use, the more weighed down your curls look.  </li>
            <li> This cream is the best, I have wavy hair and thanks to this styling product my waves looks naturally hairdo without looking or feeling tight or greasy.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using the other TIGI Catwalk Curl Amplifier (that comes in the light blue bottle) and I LOVED that one, it worked best for my thick wavy curls.</li>
            <li> Using only a small amount of this product works best to have a healthy looking not stiff appearance.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that will curl nicely if properly coerced, but will frizz out otherwise.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it helps my curly hair have a little more curl and it calms the frizz</li>
            <li> Works great on wet hair (makes it a little crunchy, but you can scrunch that out when your hair dries and still have curls), but I love it even more for second day curls - just apply a little to my top layer, squirt hair with a spray of water, and re-crunch for curls that look nice and hold, too.</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t provide a strong hold to the curl but isn&#x27;t a problem since I use other products as well that have more hold.</li>
            <li> AT the recommendation of a friend with curly/frizzy hair like mine, I bought this product with high hopes...and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, it works, but it comes nowhere near the quality of the old TIGI curls rock.</li>
            <li> I love it because it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin,its not sticky or greasy and really helps style</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works great for other people, but I&#x27;ll be sticking to the other Catwalk amplifier.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many many things (some in combination) to try and tame my hair.</li>
            <li> She uses this on her hair that is very, very curly.  </li>
            <li> VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> This product is great for reducing the frizzies that I always fight due to my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Smells really good, but it does tend to leave your hair a little crunchy, which is what i was trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> And I love the extra ummpfff I have.</li>
            <li> I put in a small amount (rubbed between my hands) and apply after I have her hair in pig tails or a ponytail, and the instant difference is incredible!</li>
            <li> leave in conditioner first.  </li>
            <li> ( first is Argan oil, then Catwalk Curlesque, then gel) .</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be more frizzy and uncontrollable but the last straw was it makes my hair line break out!</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I use a leave in conditioner first.</li>
            <li> I threw it away, and I use something different that I love!!!!!!I love it</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;ve only rated this product as okay is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I particularly love the &amp;#34;Curls Rock Amplifier&amp;#34; above all others.</li>
            <li> Ever since my last favorite product was discontinued, and I tried everything in between before finding this gem.</li>
            <li> First bought it at the salon, where I go my hair cut.</li>
            <li> Really works for curly hair!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> The oiliness is so potent that it makes a next day</li>
            <li> I like this product better than traditional mousse.</li>
            <li> great product for thick curly hair</li>
            <li> Great for long or short hair.</li>
            <li> All of those reviews saying that it dries crunchy must be using too much!</li>
            <li> I use my leave in conditioner for moisture first</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this at the salon</li>
            <li> Even though the packaging has changed I have tried many things and I continue to come back to the Curls Rock Amplifier.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months and the more I use it</li>
            <li> This only does an ok job at holding the curl.</li>
            <li> THE EXACT ITEM SOLD IN STORES FOR $18</li>
            <li> My fiance even complimented me on how my hair looked after first time using it.</li>
            <li> I was finally able to throw out my giant bottles of hairspray after using this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy and I only use 5 pumps on all my hair and if have a lot!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t fault this too much!  </li>
            <li> and I sure wish it came in a bigger container</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> First time I tried it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> As someone young and fresh out of college, this is budget friendly, and saves me time getting ready.</li>
            <li> I have used countless other products and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and this is great to use for just a little curl control.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it helps me make it wavy or curly, instead of just frizzy or flat.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a good product, as it does as it should with defining curls, yet there are definite drawbacks in texture, smell, and initial feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s so much cheaper here than in my local store.</li>
            <li> and it it&#x27;s great for thick wavy to very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> have bought several over the years and find it&#x27;s the right amount of light hold, without being sticky or goopy.  </li>
            <li> I just know that this product hardly has a scent to it at all, isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy, washes out easily, and leaves my hair curls well defined while really light and bouncy and with a great shine.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used Curl Lock in a long time since TIGI is available at major retailers and most salons,</li>
            <li> I was hesitating to buy this, but read the positive reviews and decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t affect color or shine except in a positive way.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that effectively manages frizz, but doesn&#x27;t get hard, stick, or make my head feel too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I put a decent amount in my hair right after showering, run my fingers through, and go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used this product, I used 5 pumps which was waaaaayy too much</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes since it cost so much</li>
            <li> This product works okay, but it certainly is not any better than the cheaper mousse that I can get from the local store.  </li>
            <li> My hair is bouncy, not weighed down, not sticky, smells amazing and all of my curls are well defined all day without frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tigi&#x27;s Curls Rock (in the aqua blue container) for several years and been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make her hair feel crispy, combs out easily and definitely controls the frizz!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would certainly recommend...</li>
            <li> It certainly holds curls but it feels like glue.</li>
            <li> I have VERY curly hair, past my shoulders when wet, and this stuff is the best yet!!</li>
            <li> I can wear my hair wet curly or dry curly and it looks great.</li>
            <li> It has a good amount of hold but doesn&#x27;t dry solid like a gel.</li>
            <li> (works best if the hair is still really wet - not starting to dry and frizz).  </li>
            <li> product would be fine for things like events and dinners and such.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product is consistently rated so highly for curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I have found that this is the only one that will leave my hair very curly and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what this is</li>
            <li> No gel or hair serum has defined my curls so much like this one does when diffusing my hair.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even use much.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, that gets frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much product (1-1.5 pumps for med-long hair), and I concentrate it on the bottom</li>
            <li> I put it on my crown once and used too much.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t amplify or hold my curls as much as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you&#x27;ll have crunchy/clumpy.</li>
            <li> I was very tempted b/c</li>
            <li> i have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I used to have either very frizzy hair or very crunchy curls.</li>
            <li> This also let my hair feeling very &#x27;gunky&#x27; and the alcohol in it caused a lot of dandruff.</li>
            <li> Thanks Catwalk</li>
            <li> I thought I might have just used too much but even when I adjusted it was still</li>
            <li> I would just recommend that you really &amp;quot;smooth&amp;quot; it out in your hands before putting in your hair.  </li>
            <li> so much I don&#x27;t even want to say what it is....</li>
            <li> This product works fabulously on very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sticky, so don&#x27;t put too much in your hair.  </li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t use too much your hair will not be sticky.  </li>
            <li> But after my hair dries I can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> Although, none were damaged really.</li>
            <li> , I just keep my hair very curly.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well on curly or wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> &quot; If you&#x27;re getting a \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; result from any curl cream or mousse - you&#x27;re using way too much...</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too much...</li>
            <li> This really pops my curls but with out the greasy sticky feel.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair to really stay in place or if you really want a product to help control the frizz, this is the one I recommend.</li>
            <li> it does bring out the curls really well and leaves hair silky...</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> Very upsetting</li>
            <li> This will really accentuate your curls but beware that it leaves your hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, it leaves your hair weighted and greasy.</li>
            <li> It really makes your curls pop.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very spreadable and you can just rewet your hair if you need to throughout the day.</li>
            <li> And the curls stay for the whole day, and longer.</li>
            <li> It really tames my curls and I use my finger to twist them and use the serum while doing so</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with foam rollers and it does not give much staying power.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly kinky hair</li>
            <li> and this really makes a difference in controlling that problem.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> no matter how much we shake it</li>
            <li> It really keeps hair curly and helps curl it too.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than hair salon.</li>
            <li> For real.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is a real lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I use it with the leave-in conditioner, and it really holds your curls&#x27; definition well.</li>
            <li> Holds curls very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders for my very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I really would recommend trying it if you have curly hair.</li>
            <li> Thinking, they are all using too much, or not applying it evenly.</li>
            <li> - This stuff is tacky to the touch when you apply it and very greasy when you try to wash it off your hands or your hair.</li>
            <li> Hair looks greasy, too, if you use too much.</li>
            <li> I really like how i maintain my curls</li>
            <li> Not crunchy at all, if yours is coming out that way then you are putting way too much stuff in it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t require too much work or products beyond the this product.</li>
            <li> makes your hair very &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;  brings out curl and body and gets rid of frizz.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use that much.  </li>
            <li> which I don&#x27;t really like doing-</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> This product can be a bit sticky, beware of using too much.</li>
            <li> Too much makes my hair itch.</li>
            <li> Gives curl, but the cream is very sticky - can also get crunchy if too much is used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper on amazon for about $11 vs. $16 in drugstores.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll buy a few bottles of the old formula before they&#x27;re gone for good and save some money.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever for my thick, coarse, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s the only one that boots my natural curls</li>
            <li> Use warm water and one pump and goes on evenly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and smells good.</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;m wondering if Regis was smart enough to stick to their original Curl Lock formula.  </li>
            <li> So sad, it had great slip but didn&#x27;t perform right.</li>
            <li> Great product and serious seller!</li>
            <li> This product really wakes my curls up better than any other product that I have used.  </li>
            <li> I have too many other things I need to get done in the morning.</li>
            <li> I tried the original formula several times and loathed it.  </li>
            <li> I use this with other curling products that hold curl more...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare the two as I didn&#x27;t use the original one in the blue bottle</li>
            <li> Now I wish I could have tried the original version especially because I did not even get on sale!</li>
            <li> I plan to use the Curlesque products a couple more times before deciding one way or the other whether I like them.</li>
            <li> , this product does a better job than the other one I was buying.  </li>
            <li> For my medium-thick, just-above-shoulder length hair, I use a partial pump (don&#x27;t push quite all the way down) and put more at the bottom of my hair than the top.</li>
            <li> Great stuff been using it for years, little goes long way!</li>
            <li> My hair looks great when it&#x27;s wet, but as soon as it dries the frizz ruins the curl.  </li>
            <li> I will say there is a pretty weird residue on my hands, so I use a bit of baby shampoo to really clean them off (I keep that handy on the counter b/c I use it to wash makeup brushes anyway - a tip from a Sephora store mgr I met!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will have amazing, soft, frizz less waves.</li>
            <li> However, my hair was nice and soft and much, much less frizzy.</li>
            <li> SO far this has worked really well - just don&#x27;t touch the hair during the day!</li>
            <li> It gets pretty wavy in the summer, but often almost completely straightens out in the winter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a moisturizer gel almost - keeps my hair looking healthy visually at least and keeps my curls together with my just enough lovely volume.</li>
            <li> and I have a good volume - especially when I combine it with the mousse I use, which I apply in the same manner but only after I use the curl</li>
            <li> I am currently using Redken Curvaceous Full Swirl</li>
            <li> if you really have missed the back of your head, use a tiny bit more....</li>
            <li> its not bad, just ... different.</li>
            <li> It is a tiny bit crunchy, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy hair and this is the only product that has worked for me so far.</li>
            <li> ~5 inches so that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair on top of my head.</li>
            <li> If my hair is heavier, I feel like this product weighs is down even more.</li>
            <li> It did make my curls look ok, just weighed them down a bit though.</li>
            <li> Works better than mousse and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like</li>
            <li> and I have to find something new!</li>
            <li> I wish I had gone straight to the Curlesque line rather than wasting quite a bit of money to try something new.</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t have much of a choice, I crossed my fingers and purchased the new Curlesque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this new product to be very drying</li>
            <li> I have very tight natural curls and this stuff really helps with frizzy hair and holds my curls nice all day.  </li>
            <li> Since my previous favorite hair product was discontinued, I have been searching for almost a year for another curly-hair product that worked well for my hair.</li>
            <li> Feels sticky when going on but dry&#x27;s light with no residue.</li>
            <li> less is more, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was still in decent shape</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for curly girls.</li>
            <li> is HIGH.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped a lot during the spring (90*F + high high humidity)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I sleep with my hair in a high pony tail.  </li>
            <li> Personally I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference between this new formula than the old one.</li>
            <li> I only have to use a very small amount of this product for great result.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;they must have changed their formula, as it is a little more drying than it used to be...</li>
            <li> Since I have a little natural wave in my hair TIGI really brings out the waves and I love the way it leaves my hair feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have literally tried all the curly products from inexpensive to expensive, this is the only kind that keeps my hair from looking huge &amp; not frizzy!</li>
            <li> Exellent product, works very well for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> THE RESULTS ARE AMAZING my hair is soft and the curl is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> so far nothing really seems to do that.  </li>
            <li> It binds to the hair shaft readily and is a frequent component of shampoos and hair conditioners (in concentrations of 0.1-1%).</li>
            <li> The top of one was missing.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly normal hair and bought this based on the reviews on this site.</li>
            <li> My hair, despite it&#x27;s many chemical treatments and dryness, always comes out very shiny with my usual treatments, but with the Curlesque products I used, the shine was diminished.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review if these do a better job of holding my do together for a few days.</li>
            <li> This should have been a clue that this wasn&#x27;t any normal hair product.  </li>
            <li> It makes my curl form beautifully, without weighing them down or looking like I have an oil slick of product on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my naturally curly hair more manageable and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I like to shower in the evening, and if I rewet this in the morning, it springs right back.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a way to tame your tangled, frizzy, runaway curls without loosing sexy volume and bounce, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, and my stylist recommended this product for me and honestly every single time I use, I like it less.</li>
            <li> Curls are crispy tho, the gel has consistency of elmers glue, but does great on thick, long, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Thank god for my new stylist and all her tips.</li>
            <li> live in Houston, TX, and humidity</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t live without this for my hair.</li>
            <li> I will def continue to buy this one, new product and all.</li>
            <li> I live in South FL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m out to find a new hair product line.  </li>
            <li> This new Curlesque version just doesn&#x27;t have the chops.</li>
            <li> THIS NEW FORMULA IS GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida;</li>
            <li> I am always trying new curl products when I want to have a curly hair day.</li>
            <li> I was in search of a new product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years and don&#x27;t notice a difference with the new version.</li>
            <li> Great product, only product that works on my loose spiral hair (used to have tight spirals but not after pregnancies).</li>
            <li> i am letting my hair be curly for the first time as an adult (used to blow dry hair and then hot iron it).</li>
            <li> If this happens it&#x27;s easily fixed by smoothing wet hands over it and dabbing lightly with a towel.</li>
            <li> This product is decent, but when I happened to glance at the bottom of the bottle, I noticed it had been expired nearly a year.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that some bottles don&#x27;t smell too good</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry with this product, but I am sure if you use a diffuser you will get that same natural soft look as well!</li>
            <li> Defines my fine , curls with out weighing them down or making my hair &amp;#34;crunchy &amp;#34; or greasy.</li>
            <li> You have to get the right amount, if you get too much product it makes the hair have a wet, crunchy look.</li>
            <li> I rub it between my palms, lightly tap all over my hair, and really get the ends, then work it all in as well and evenly as possible (while wet, just out of the shower).</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have found that REALLY works!  </li>
            <li> The only difference is the higher price.  </li>
            <li> The best did not materialize. :(  </li>
            <li> My throat starting itching, and I knew that there would sadly be no Curlesque Rocks in my future.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw it at a beauty supply shop, individually priced much, much higher than Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wow, way to budget cut a product Tigi!</li>
            <li> I also do not shampoo my hair, just a friendly tip for other curly hair girls.  </li>
            <li> Works much better than other products such as mouse.  </li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised by this product!  </li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past, and always enjoyed it, but was sent a product that expired 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> hair salon sells it and the bottle is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I tried it many times - both air dry and diffusing and each time I ended up with dry, frizzy hair with no bounce what so ever</li>
            <li> Brings out the curls, light hold, doesn&#x27;t weigh my medium-length hair down.</li>
            <li> It locks in my fine curls without making them too soft or weighing them down.</li>
            <li> When using Curlesque, my hair was soft and moist, never frizzy (and I live in the South).  </li>
            <li> Not only is Curlesque line (shampoo, conditioner, &amp; amplifier) not the same amazing product, it is far more expensive.</li>
            <li> Last night I shampooed and conditioned my dry, permed, fine, color treated hair (Yikes-haha).  </li>
            <li> Keep it simple folks, and just start with one product (don&#x27;t fall for the \\&quot;snowball effect that you need the full line at once) - otherwise you&#x27;ll just toss a bunch next time you do Spring Cleaning!</li>
            <li> Normally would take tons of different products and way too much time to style my curls but not since I tried this.</li>
            <li> I often use John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz Ease to help keep the volume down and was hoping for something similar or better with CurlsRock.  </li>
            <li> I was initially unsure, because it is so thick, but once I got past the consistency, I realized how awesome this is.</li>
            <li> any event, I&#x27;ve gone through so many different products and cocktails of products, and honestly I&#x27;m not so sure if there is any other product available that works as well as even this new Curlesque stuff.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s definitely good to at least have on hand, even if you can&#x27;t afford to use it every single day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between the old blue bottle and the new turquoise bottle, so this is a review for both.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only pure liquid</li>
            <li> Can also restyle the next day with some water and a little more product.</li>
            <li> The next morning I scrunch up my hair with some water and add just a little bit more of this.</li>
            <li> Can also restyle the next day with some water and a little more product.</li>
            <li> little more expensive than some products, but the leave-in conditioner won&#x27;t have to be replaced as often as the actual curl defining cream, and it&#x27;s definitely worth paying more.</li>
            <li> It was clearly packed this way.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my natural curly hair ... just made it feel sticky</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair &amp; this</li>
            <li> hair is naturally wavy, but I can trick into into some curl with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I comb thru until I like the look and just sit near my ceiling fan til it dries in place.</li>
            <li> you have light curl, this product might be too heavy for your hair.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll be buying the old stuff online from now on.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be without this product for my natural curls.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy like gels or a mousse.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my curls soft and keeps the frizz gone.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This leaves my curls flowing, soft and not crunchy.  </li>
            <li> yet my hair is still soft.</li>
            <li> NOT SO NATURAL FEELING</li>
            <li> I am 44 years old and have tried just about everything out there</li>
            <li> Curls stay soft and natural.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly / frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product for my naturally curly hair, to enhance the curl a bit.</li>
            <li> But if you have frizz near your scalp you&#x27;ll need a softer product for that area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a layered cut and a bit of natural wave in my hair that can tend towards fuzzy if it gets humid</li>
            <li> This makes my hair look natural and as if there is no product in my hair.  </li>
            <li> had not used the old \\&quot;Curls</li>
            <li> but so far, this product has done everything it promises.</li>
            <li> My waves are defined, frizz-free, and soft to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i like it because it&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li> My hair would either be crunchy from too much hold or frizzy from not enough.</li>
            <li> and I want soft curls</li>
            <li> But when the gel cast is released, it is quite soft.  </li>
            <li> To refreshen day old curls, I just dab some water on them with a hint of product too.  </li>
            <li> My hair was sticky and too perfumy with the old formula.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this prevents my frizz showing.</li>
            <li> my 17 year old son with natural curls has stolen mine....</li>
            <li> It calms the friz and and has a soft look and feel.  </li>
            <li> it defines and enhance my natural curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Can be styled so the curls are soft or crunchy.</li>
            <li> I can get this so much cheaper on Amazon than I can at my local salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hoping a product will amp up the natural curl and</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Your curls stay soft while giving a look that you have used a mousse.</li>
            <li> I prefer soft curs or waves.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give it a try for soft curls.</li>
            <li> and I like the way it leaves my curls looking soft.</li>
            <li> It gives a soft hold.</li>
            <li> I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried TONS of products, but nothing makes my hair&#x27;s natural curl come out like this product does.  </li>
            <li> As far as the alcohol in ingredient list: Panthenol is a humectant, emollient and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft again.</li>
            <li> I can touch it after it dries and it doesn&#x27;t result in poofy, old lady hair.</li>
            <li> It holds pretty well, although I find if I put too much, it can weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have course curly hair and in all my years of looking for a product that smooth&#x27;s and holds my curls with out the stiff feeling</li>
            <li> , when my hair becomes dry, I just scruntch it a bit to release the crunchy quality it  first has.  </li>
            <li> With a head full of curly hair, my hair would be a wild mess without it.</li>
            <li> and I use less then a full pump</li>
            <li> and I use exactly one single pump, and that is all I need.</li>
            <li> I have used similar products from regular name brands that cost less, but I had to use alot more product which in the end does not save money.  </li>
            <li> so I can have decent hair throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li> The fact that this particular ingredient was left off of some sites says a lot.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you only use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I have used many products in the past; however, for the last three years I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> My satisfaction with curlesque could be weighted slightly because the other product I tried (Deva Curl) totally dried out my hair and give it no shape at all, but I am really happy so far.</li>
            <li> Your hair comes out really curly but not natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I used Paul Mitchell conditioning mousse in the past and also enjoy that product.  </li>
            <li> gel.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE and will continue to use as long as price remains reasonable.</li>
            <li> did notice when I first wet my hair that it was sticky and felt strange...and not the way it does after using spray or mousse.  </li>
            <li> It helps a little bit but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do extraordinary work.</li>
            <li> I love this product it helps keep the frizz down in my natural curly hair but does so with put making my hair feel sticky and weighed down.</li>
            <li> This came in the mail with out the cap, and on top of that half empty because it was all over the box!</li>
            <li> After seeing all the bad reviews from Curls Rock users, I was really hesitant to try this product as I had loved Curls Rock, used it for years and was devastated when I saw it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> My very curly, dry hair could not survive without it!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> If I ever apply too much by accident I wait for my hair to be completely dry before I scrunch it out.</li>
            <li> I try to fix this by gently scrunching my hair when it&#x27;s almost dry...</li>
            <li> Hair blown dry remained straight and frizz-free even in the rain.</li>
            <li> and then I switch back to a day or two of straight hair or a simple ponytail.</li>
            <li> A little goes such a long way with most styling products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, you only need a small amount to make it work, if you combine it with a little bit of water.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, easily washes out and does not feel greasy or crunchy.</li>
            <li> My hair frizzes very easily and with other products I was not able to touch my hair because it would get</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and buy it at least three botles at a time!  </li>
            <li> if there are any frizzy curls, i just wet my hair with my hand and the leftover product makes the curl bounce right back</li>
            <li> I have a slight wave to my hair that can become a curl with the right product</li>
            <li> The original formula was heavy, greasy and made me just feel blah and gross.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that, when applied properly, controls my frizz and leaves my curls soft and looking very natural.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally wavy hair - it doesn&#x27;t have tight curls, but it certainly couldn&#x27;t be considered straight.</li>
            <li> Many products I&#x27;ve tried have weighed down my curls making them look like a lifeless mess.</li>
            <li> As long as Amazon offers,  I&#x27;ll never use anything else on her hair!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have frizzy hard to manage curls and this stuff turns them into lovely little ringlets with almost no styling, just shower, towel dry and run it through your hair, though you have to be careful as it dries or the product on the back of your hair will get wiped away.</li>
            <li> products generally smell good to me, but they are so artificial and cloying</li>
            <li> This is NOT the same and doesn&#x27;t do for my curls what the old Curls Rock did.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product if you have natural curly hair .</li>
            <li> (I think the old Curls Rock was only 4 oz</li>
            <li> This product makes your curls feel soft and provides enough hold</li>
            <li> I suspect that the curliness of each curl might actually curl even further in the subsequent days after the first application than in the hours after putting it on, for different reasons that I theorize.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that works for my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because it does glide through wet hair very well, and when I applied it to my dry hair while it was curled, it did give some decent definition without stiffness.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my gym instructor who&#x27;s hair obviously looked so soft and bouncy that I had to ask her where she bought this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that controls my hair and helps it stay clumped together in natural sort of way without also leaving it crispy or stringy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a secret :-)</li>
            <li> Love this product for my long, thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky or stiff, and really brings out curls so they look natural and soft.</li>
            <li> and they are the top ingredients in their new expensive product.</li>
            <li> If you blow dry your hair; will not dry &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; but give you soft natural curls.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t super heavy, and it hasn&#x27;t stopped me from using it often!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I can&#x27;t use this product because it is so heavily perfumed and it greatly bothers my allergies.  </li>
            <li> My curls did come out softly defined, but I could definitely feel product in my hair whereas with my old routine, I couldn&#x27;t feel any coating on my hair once dry.  </li>
            <li> Now, if you add too much, or you add it to dry hair, it WILL definitely be crispy (and possibly stringy if you shake your hair)</li>
            <li> Only need a small amount of this to tame my frizzy flyaways into nice curls and waves.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out your hair or make your hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair (my heritage is Italian, Norwegian, French) and it can be so hard to manage with out the right products.</li>
            <li> then it will be a little crunchy at first.  </li>
            <li> My aforementioned friend with long curly hair down to his shoulders only uses about a nickel sized amount of gel, but he already has full curls</li>
            <li> With my naturally wavy and frizzy hair, it&#x27;s hard to find something that holds my business together for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for a long time because it works on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> It not only conditions your hair as you apply it, but for all you curly thin haired women, it provides structure while keeping hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing that controls my natural curly hair, and I have tried sooo many products, cheep and expensive.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how fresh it was?  </li>
            <li> It really defines curls and control frizz without weighing the hair down.</li>
            <li> My hair as far as texture, feels very similar with this product in it, to what it naturally feels like without (very soft), only it cures any frizzies and uneven curling like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon is usually wonderful, but I was a little disappointed this time.</li>
            <li> I have curly, coarse hair - just a little defines without drying crisply like mousse or gel.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and will curl with the right product (usually spray  gel).  </li>
            <li> I have let dry naturally and have used diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I just work a bit through my hair either when towel dried on lazy days, or after blow drying when I&#x27;m feeling energetic and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> After the first day of using this, I will often not need to apply it for the next few days until I shower again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with curly hair, the trick is to scrunch it in from the bottom on up and let air dry!!!</li>
            <li> But then you just scrunch your hair in your hands, maybe let the car window down for a minute and will be soft and natural bouncy curls in no time.</li>
            <li> I have thick fine hair that has natural half waves.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have always had very dry natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It really stays all day and in the morning all you have to do is spray a little water to re-activate the product.</li>
            <li> When asked if I could only take one item with me to a deserted island, I seriously answered a suitcase full of this hair product.</li>
            <li> Smells odd, not bad per say but just slightly off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky, so I wash my hands after applying and try to be aware not to touch my hair until fully dry.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair, and most products either don&#x27;t have enough hold or are too stiff.</li>
            <li> Worth the few extra dollars compared to some other curling products.</li>
            <li> Worth the few extra dollars compared to some other curling products.</li>
            <li> The curls are separated and not frizzy (except in really humid/rainy weather), but yet, not too stiff.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair, this is the only product that can control the frizz and still have natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> Main component of my hair product regiment of Wen Styling Creme and Curls Rock, topped with a little Morroccan Oil Luminous Hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have natural wavy/curly hair and this products seems like every other product I&#x27;ve used.....</li>
            <li> I do like this product, it makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t leave it crunchy like other curling products tend to do.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was ready for a fight because that seems to be the status quo  for most companies I have dealt with in the past, so a &amp;#34;Thumbs Up!&amp;#34; to Amazon for resolving the problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll sometimes use another product if I don&#x27;t need as long lasting of an effect, so this bottle should last a bit.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a very small amount even for long hair and make sure you spread it evenly because if not you will have some stiff places.</li>
            <li> It is the only one that keeps my curls soft and springy and keeps the frizz down.  </li>
            <li> Hard to believe that we found something that works this well on really curly hair after all the trial and error!</li>
            <li> I am pretty lazy with my hair, I just wash and air dry.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any white residue or specs left in my hair after it air dry either ..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s a bit pricey when your hair is thick and long, but curls look great and the product doesn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> I wanted it \\&quot;then\\&quot; (impatient!), but after staring at all the options for 20 minutes, I realized I really just wanted to start with theone product, then decided if I needed all the \\&quot;complementary\\&quot; products they sell.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect this to last long.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all curly that it is pretty thick in that regard.</li>
            <li> My curls are soft and defined without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Then I leave it for about half hour (while doing other things to get ready) until the curls start to set.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few years now and couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hands slimy and wastes a lot of water rinsing (I live in the drought-ridden west coast so I notice these things).</li>
            <li> But it left my scalp dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Finally, I just let it air dry.</li>
            <li> the amount she uses ends up not being quite enough when my hair is dry, but again...</li>
            <li> but now I could finally wash, towel dry and \\&quot;Curlesque\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> My hair has the same texture and shape as it did with Curls Rock and requires the same minimal amount of cream.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that if I want to keep my hair for days, it gets harder to make the product last longer.</li>
            <li> creamy-- feels like you are really putting in something that will tame the frizz!  </li>
            <li> This product brings out the natural wave but tames my hair so that I&#x27;m not a frizzed out mess.</li>
            <li> The curl amplifier aspect of it can last several days though, the only downside to this being the white flakes that all dried up gels</li>
            <li> Especially when I air dry my hair!</li>
            <li> my hair feels silky soft not like other products that leave your hair rough after you wash it.</li>
            <li> I saw the review on the older version, and I can&#x27;t compare them, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any excessive drying out of my granddaughters hair.</li>
            <li> This is misleading labelling, which is disappointing for sure.  </li>
            <li> I tried everything from cheap to expensive.</li>
            <li> I used to call my hair witch hair because if I styled while wet I would only get frizz &amp; no waves.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this for my long curly hair.</li>
            <li> No &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; curls as long as you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> (1) the products were very loosely packaged in shipping, the tops all popped off and I had to put them all back on.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product to use on her hair as long as it remains on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN WANTING TO BUY IT AND TRY IT FOR A LONG TIME .  </li>
            <li> Before I would be trying to control my curls and frizz and by leaving in some conditioner it would sort of do the job, but the curls wouldn&#x27;t stay in as long as when I use this.</li>
            <li> I have colored, long, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fairly long, but all I need is one squirt (this is sold in a pump dispenser rather than an aerosol).</li>
            <li> I have long (bottom of shoulder blades)</li>
            <li> This is completely not natural and makes crispy hair.</li>
            <li> This makes it look wet and gives me stronger curls for the entire day.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say is that be careful with how much you use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and my curls stay for a long time.</li>
            <li> My long silver wavy hair turns into ringlets, and I get compliments all day/ night long.</li>
            <li> I have long</li>
            <li> Really helps with thick and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair a little stiff, but not a big deal really.</li>
            <li> Too much will leave you with greasy hair and that is not very attractive</li>
            <li> This stuff left my hair looking wet, even after air-drying...and after I fingercombed it (which occasionally works with other products)</li>
            <li> Not sure if bottle was actually &#x27;new&#x27;</li>
            <li> Took too long to dry, frizzy, and unmanagable.  </li>
            <li> Not a miracle product but definitely helped my hair from getting crazy and super frizzy, the product itself looks like elmers glue, so I can see how one of the other reviews said it caused a flaking dandruff look,I have not had this issue so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Curls Rock Amplifier for years to tame my frizzy locks into soft curls.</li>
            <li> It is not the same as the old blue bottle catwalk, but I&#x27;m ok with that because I hated that one.</li>
            <li> No matter how much or how little I used, my curls were limp and my hair either frizzy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I finally can wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking wet, crunchy and greasy!</li>
            <li> I do use it in combination with other products such as oils etc...  </li>
            <li> Will purchase as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> Having had this issue with other products, I left the store I was shopping in, went home and washed</li>
            <li> so I have to put in blow drying serum after I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Then I rinse, BLOT dry with a towel, and apply this product from the my neck to my ends.</li>
            <li> Just apply after towel drying hair and let air dry.</li>
            <li> Then blow dry with a defuser attachment.  </li>
            <li> but if you let your hair air dry, it&#x27;s almost as if there&#x27;s no product in it at all.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry, and the curls pop out.</li>
            <li> I use the diffuser and dry until almost dry.  </li>
            <li> Air dry the rest of the way</li>
            <li> Yes if I let it air dry, it may be a bit crunchy but as soon as I shake my curls out a bit, the crunchiness is gone.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by the person that cuts her hair and keeps those curls from looking frizzy or dry.</li>
            <li> I used about 3 pumps, let it air dry, then slept on it.  </li>
            <li> I never blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> After it was partially dry</li>
            <li> Since I always touch up my hair once dry with a curling iron, I&#x27;m waiting to see if the Curlesque products hold my curls through humidity, wind, and sleeping on them.  </li>
            <li> Just use a dime size in your hair and use diffuser to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the stiffness, just crunch when dry.</li>
            <li> I use this when I curl or even when I just blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> When it dried it left white streaks in my hair.</li>
            <li> I use \\&quot;Samy: Big Curls\\&quot; which can be bought at almost anywhere that sells your everyday drugstore hair stuff like Suave and Herbal Essences, and comes in a yellow tube (which sits \\&quot;upside down\\</li>
            <li> You only need a few tiny pumps.</li>
            <li> A word of caution - a little goes a long way, if you use too much your hair will look wet and stiff.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so thick, I used half the can the FIRST time, and my hair isn&#x27;t even shoulder length.</li>
            <li> One last thing like the other reviewers have mentioned be careful with the amount used.</li>
            <li> and since you need such a small amount it seems like the bottle will last a really long time</li>
            <li> Holds my curls in place with a small amount of firmness, yet still soft.  </li>
            <li> At 43 years old, I have tried every curly hair product in the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> Typically it takes a few pumps to get the product to come out of a new bottle, but it had already been pumped.</li>
            <li> They were having a sale where if you bought 3 products from that line, you got it down to about the same price.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it seems to weigh down my curls a bit, but it&#x27;s left them&lt;br /&gt;looking</li>
            <li> and it actually cut the smell down, but it didn&#x27;t get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find a product that I can put into my wet hair, let it air dry, and end up with dry curly hair that looks like dry hair, not like the \\&quot;wet look.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> had not tried this product before it was revamped with a new formula that people have complained about so</li>
            <li> then it looks perfectly dry and doesn&#x27;t afro out!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  touch your hair hair when it&#x27;s dry!</li>
            <li> I like to spend less time as possible on my hair plus my hair is already curly</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair wet, wait 10 minutes then blow dry.</li>
            <li> This lacks crunch but definitely has a weight to it and leaves you feeling slightly oily and damp-ish.</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t say Curlesque on the bottle (my previous bottles did)</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair when wet and then use a diffuser on my hair dryer to wrap the hair in air and dry it.  </li>
            <li> I apply it either on wet or dry hair, and it works every time.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, naturally curly hair and this helps to control the curls and the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and I have tried EVERYTHING to try to tame the frizz without weighing down my curls.  </li>
            <li> I walk around feeling like a dirty greasy mess all day, even if my hair *looks* ok.</li>
            <li> I used to use a handful or this or that or the other when younger and then have to fight to get the crunch out of my hair, and it would be weighed down.</li>
            <li> One squirt gives you a little dollop of product and that&#x27;s enough for my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I&#x27;m low on my TIGI product (and $), I will use a little of it and the Samy together.</li>
            <li> Actually my hair has a little body-no curl.  </li>
            <li> Any other styling or scrunching should be done when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is it is a little crunchy, but if used correctly won&#x27;t make your hair look wet.</li>
            <li> With naturally curly hair it is hard to sometimes keep it under control.</li>
            <li> the shipping is really bad, cost more than 1 week to arrive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use big gobs of it as it will make your curls crunch, but a small amount will go a long way.</li>
            <li> Use it when hair is still wet.  </li>
            <li> When my hair is wet</li>
            <li> I apply when wet and let my hair air-dry.</li>
            <li> Actually makes it stringy and dead looking .  </li>
            <li> It is my second product everyday</li>
            <li> I now have straw-like, not very curly, hair.  </li>
            <li> My hairdressed introduced me a few years ago and I&#x27;ve never looked back.</li>
            <li> Be careful with some ingredient lists online.</li>
            <li> A few things to mention as to why I only gave four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> Today in dripping wet hair...</li>
            <li> It made my hair big once it was all dried up.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like, is that it is a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> I found this product a few years back</li>
            <li> I use this with my hair still wet and scrunch my hair afterwards, then I apply gel that is specifically for curly hair over it.</li>
            <li> It .I apply to wet hair.</li>
            <li> just a nut size on the palm of the hand and apply on wet hair, section to section.</li>
            <li> When I need a &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; I just use a bit on wet hands and scrunch it through</li>
            <li> Tames frizz and leaves curls that don&#x27;t look wet and crunchy.</li>
            <li> It defines your curls without making your hair crunchy and wet looking.</li>
            <li> It is what my wife expected</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s harder to locate in stores, and my beauty supply stores no longer carry it, I purchase it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I just wet my hair each day and it revives my curls.  </li>
            <li> (mid back), 3b thick curly hair...</li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair a little stiff and not as soft as my Herbal Essence mouse.</li>
            <li> The directions recommend to only use it from halfway down your hair down.</li>
            <li> I then usually have to use several paper towels or a towel, wash them again, and finally dry them again in order to get everything off.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; packing and formula wouldn&#x27;t measure up to the previous Curls Rock Amplifier (especially after reading a few negative reviews), but I can&#x27;t tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> My hair is coarse wavy/but gets wavy/curly with mouse/ gel or spray just gets stiff or poofy after which was the problem .</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this stuff is that it leaves my hair slightly stiff and crunchy.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way though so don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will have a gluey texture when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> One of the few things I have found that work for white people with curly hair, it&#x27;s not greasy like some other products.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it does nothing for my hair - adds a little weight but kills the curls and leaves my hair super greasy even if I only use a little.  </li>
            <li> Careful with this one too - a little goes a long way, and sometimes a lot likes to come out of the bottle from sitting on the cap.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of really thick, long hair and only need 2-3 pumps at a time to style all of it.</li>
            <li> This product is a literal apply and go, plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that a little of this stuff goes a long ways...</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for my medium length curly hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> your hair.a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It creates tight, small scrunchy curls in my hair that last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So this product was suggested to me after i bought a couple other products i didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely curly hair</li>
            <li> I have the in-between hair- that can become extremely poofy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I found that if I used it every other day that that would help up with the build-up (It stays in your hair for a looong time).</li>
            <li> I am caucasian with extremely curly hair.  </li>
            <li> JUST LIKE ANY OTHER PRODUCT</li>
            <li> but be careful!</li>
            <li> A bit of advice: a little of this stuff goes a long  way!</li>
            <li> you rub it in your palms and then squeeze and scrunch your hair EVENLY, you WILL have ROCKING curls without the crunch of other stylers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> She has extremely curly hair and is complaining that it \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t hold the way it used to\\&quot;</li>
            <li> it is just like any other cream</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Then I turn my head upside-down and scrunch the curls up and then dry it just a little bit with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> A little spritz of hair spray after I dry it a bit with a diffuser works well.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> In between washing I just wet it slightly with a spray of water to freshen it up.</li>
            <li> I was loosing my hair and it was very dry and damage!!</li>
            <li> If it is a little stiff, but fluff it out with your fingers after hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Your hair will look a little rough.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair a little harder than eco styler &amp; miss jessie&#x27;s gels</li>
            <li> Just a little dab, while your hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> I have very thick natural curly hair...</li>
            <li> This did enhance my curls but felt heavy and sticky and I only used a very little bit.</li>
            <li> Lately it has been a pain and not wanting to curl and being frizzy, especially around the front of my face.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use about 2-3 pumps from this bottle (each is about a Quarter size each) for my short but thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair that has some wavy.  </li>
            <li> one pump of Curls Rock per side and top....wrap it in my Turbie Twist and let down and leave alone.</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizz down and the curls up.  </li>
            <li> Holds all day, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down - defines every curl.  </li>
            <li> It defines the curls, holds the frizz down.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who needs to add body to their hair and doesn&#x27;t have the time to use the other hair products!</li>
            <li> It takes only a small amount!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, and usually let your hair air dry</li>
            <li> I somewhat allow to air dry, usually don&#x27;t have a lot of time</li>
            <li> Other products leave my curls frizzy or limp but this product holds up every time.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re getting greasy or flaky results, just use less.</li>
            <li> NO TOUCHING until it&#x27;s completely dry!</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts me about a month, sometimes less.</li>
            <li> Samy runs about half the cost.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m wondering if I have the previous version.</li>
            <li> the less</li>
            <li> With the wrong product, it looks like frizz and there are many wrong products for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Elongates the curls slightly too.</li>
            <li> Ditto to all previous comments here-</li>
            <li> and I mean EVERYTHING, I&#x27;ve tried has made my hair look sticky, crunchy, greasy, flat, etc.  </li>
            <li> I thought hard and long before ordering and I regret buying .</li>
            <li> Other than that, it doesn&#x27;t really tame in humidity</li>
            <li> - I would think that would be a sticky, greasy mess.</li>
            <li> but as I grew my hair was a mess.  </li>
            <li> cause I have long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> After 26 years of product testing for my long, thick, curly hair, I&#x27;ve met my &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Curls looked clean (not messy or frizzy) and the product didn&#x27;t leave a nasty chemical smell afterwards when applied.</li>
            <li> just hand squeeze out excess water after my shower, DO NOT COMB, then I clip up half and scrunch it into shape, then dry using a diffuser (at least half-dry).</li>
            <li> I have tight curly hair</li>
            <li> This product is really thick and creamy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am so very disappointed because I thought I had finally found the best product out there for curly hair. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much &amp;#34;the worst hair on the planet&amp;#34; my hairdresser likes to tell me.</li>
            <li> I can go 2-3 days between washing, just by spritzing a little bit of water on my hair each morning to wake up the curls.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was causing the little bumps on my forehead because I have never had problem skin.</li>
            <li> I scrunch a little bit in my hair after I shower before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> A little bit will do it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend when using to brush out your hair, put a little bit on your hands and put it everywhere on your hair, brush it out again, and then either use a diffuser or scrunch with a towel.</li>
            <li> and it was a little crunchy</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I have little bumpy rashes on my face anywhere my hair hits.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes those clumps of cream can stay in a glob and dry in your hair as a big flake that is difficult to get all out of your hair.</li>
            <li> This products did help keep curls but is a little heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have crazy curly hair that is made extremely frizzy and poofy in the humid town I live in.</li>
            <li> It keeps your curls from looking limp and frizzy.</li>
            <li> One of the few products that just gets my curls.</li>
            <li> I apply 3 to 4 pumps to towel dried hair and scrunch.</li>
            <li> I like this one because it isn&#x27;t too heavy on my hair but responds well to the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Once you get it in your hair though it has a heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday and go through about a bottle a month.</li>
            <li> the frizz, the goo, the heavy.</li>
            <li> incase you need a little something to tame your curls - this is the stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff was AWFUL in my hair and I agree with most of the other posts.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make hair hard like other products.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit stiff if you use it close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> you can tell the product dries on your hair and leaves it stiff looking.</li>
            <li> One pump will make your hair a bit stiff, but NOTHING like hairspray.</li>
            <li> It holds my curls in place without ever being stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I did like this product, but found it too &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; and stiff which is not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have very tight curly hair when naturally dried.  </li>
            <li> helps tame the frizz</li>
            <li> When I have to reapply to tame frizz after a day or two, it adds build up to my hair.</li>
            <li> Never leaves my hair gunky and helps to tame frizz.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long spiral curls.</li>
            <li> I have tried others looking for a less expensive alternative, but I keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, thick hair and found this product just took a nap on my head - weighed down and goopy.</li>
            <li> Have very long curly hair and it keeps it under control, to where it&#x27;s not fly away.  </li>
            <li> A little does the job!  </li>
            <li> It rejuvenates with a little water!  </li>
            <li> Left my hair very dull!</li>
            <li> I have thick, tight, corkscrew curly hair.</li>
            <li> Makes dried hair feel heavy, even with a very small amount used.&lt;br /&gt;First time used and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like products that are sticky, hard or heavy, but I also don&#x27;t like frizz.  </li>
            <li> I put a small dab  on my hand to smell it as soon as it arrived from Amazon today.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it EVERY day, usually no more than 3 days in a row</li>
            <li> My curls are spiral, highlighted every month and past my shoulder.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mouse in the past to fix my hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will do once the humidity kicks in</li>
            <li> Gel and mousse would be a thing of the past if you try this product</li>
            <li> My curls go two inches past my shoulders</li>
            <li> usually put this stuff in on my hair after washing my hair</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and find it works well on my hair to control frizz and give definition and separation.</li>
            <li> This is wrongly called &#x27;Curlesque&#x27; in the description; it is actually a different product.  </li>
            <li> The difference in appearance from using my usual routine (argon oil, Matrix Miracle Treat Lotion Spray, and It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Silk Leave-in) was one of shine.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have tried a lot of hair products in the past.</li>
            <li> usually to have curly hair</li>
            <li> I am usually looking for an elastic by mid-day.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, within about ten minutes of leaving the salon, I started to develop severely itchy/painful eyes and</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick heavy duty curls.</li>
            <li> like I have done in the past.</li>
            <li> I also suggest putting a small amount in damp hair at night and twisting it up.</li>
            <li> I bought this with hesitation because I usually go to the salon for my hair products.  </li>
            <li> Thick or stiff buildup on your hair.</li>
            <li> This seriously makes my hair look like a million bucks, with little effort.</li>
            <li> I have tried the old curls rock multiple times over the years and hated it.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t really mess it up!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and just a small amount of this product helps define the waves/curls.</li>
            <li> I have tried using less of the product at once, but it&#x27;s just not a great product for my taste.</li>
            <li> The scent is so strong it gives me a horrible headache.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy to me but does leave some film on my hands and is hard to rinse off.  </li>
            <li> but tj made them really hard</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair in place without being rock hard.</li>
            <li> it is rock hard from product.</li>
            <li> The portions of my hair to which it was applied looked sticky and dull.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky, like school glue, and makes your hair as hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, I don&#x27;t - not now at least, just a bit of hairspray which I already had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent tons of $$$ finding all the wrong products for decades and this</li>
            <li> I buy this product at least every 2 months for my household.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 5 years now and wouldn&#x27;t consider changing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone that has curly hair needs to at least try this product.</li>
            <li> It does have silicates in it, so if you have to shampoo your hair at least once a week.</li>
            <li> The frizz is still there and it makes my hair look sort of dirty if I don&#x27;t wash it daily.</li>
            <li> Now that the formula has changed, there are no curls anymore, it&#x27;s just frizzy and my hair feels thick and mushed together.  </li>
            <li> covers my medium length and thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick corse Hispanic curly hair and all products I have used does not do my curls justice.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t mean that it is not causing them to have eczema.</li>
            <li> I mean lets face it</li>
            <li> At first my husband had posted a review for me on 12/21/2010 saying that I hated this product...</li>
            <li> If you like the old one, you&#x27;ll be disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very slick, doesn&#x27;t go on your hair well.  </li>
            <li> I have been a Ouidad user for some time now, but am seeking a less expensive alternative.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is very thin, and on the limp side.</li>
            <li> goes on too sticky and extremely hard to wash off your hair and hands!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (the original) for 7 years now, sadly I bought this and have become very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must for thick, curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and is very hard to find a product that would define your curls and not let your hair look frizzy.</li>
            <li> (curly girls - you know what I mean!)</li>
            <li> Not sure what I would do with out it now!!</li>
            <li> My thin curly hair is frizzy with this product.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and wavy/curly.  </li>
            <li> The container I received was broken.</li>
            <li> This decreased the smell, but did not eliminate it.  </li>
            <li> once again, decreased the smell but did NOT get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when the store where I purchase it from told me that they had discontinued it and that this new product was it&#x27;s replacement.</li>
            <li> I hate that I spent the money to use it a couple times.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick course hair and it softens and allows my curls to be curls!!</li>
            <li> I recommend using a squirt of Ouidad heat and humidity gel ( doesn&#x27;t feel like a gel) through the base of your hair and use curl amplifier from the crown down.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product and TiGi.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed overall.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it made my forehead break out.  </li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with TIGI.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it leaves a sticky residue on your hands after applying.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this hair product.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using this wrong or something</li>
            <li> Ill be buying these (in bulk) till the sun burns out.</li>
            <li> * Sorry, but TIGI Catwalk Curlesque did not do anything for my wavy curls  </li>
            <li> just shy of my shoulder,</li>
            <li> Sorry it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I dearly wish I were one of those people raving about this product , but unfortunately for me, I&#x27;m not.  </li>
            <li> (Is shoulder length but very thin).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like mousse&#x27;s b/c of the alcohol in them, which is horrible for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It works and prevents crazy frizz problems--&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes me feel dirty, and no product should be like that.</li>
            <li> The weather is quite cold and windy now here, and my hair tends to be frizzy when it&#x27;s cold.</li>
            <li> So sad that they change this product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say it has been used, but it certainly is skeptical!</li>
            <li> With the humidity the crunch isn&#x27;t so bad and it keeps my hair from getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have been getting so frustrated with it.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that I no longer have my go to hair product.</li>
            <li> If you hate frizz give it a try.</li>
            <li> It can just be annoying to wash off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> I hate having anything sticky in my hair.</li>
            <li> , it is one of those creams that is impossible to rinse off your hands!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly a &#x27;bad hair day&#x27; when I don&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed .</li>
            <li> the meantime, I think we curly heads should all contact TIGI and let them know that they made a terrible, terrible mistake.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the review that the formula changed to contain alcohol because this is the WORST thing that you can put on curly hair!  </li>
            <li> This product I&#x27;d terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best product ever!  I have naturally curly hair, and I have tried EVERYTHING to try to tame the frizz without weighing down my curls.  Gel, mousse, cream, etc.  This is the only product that I have found that REALLY works!  I absolutely love it.  I put it in my hair right after I get out of the shower (works best if the hair is still really wet - not starting to dry and frizz).  Then I turn my head upside-down and scrunch the curls up and then dry it just a little bit with a diffuser.  I can go 2-3 days between washing, just by spritzing a little bit of water on my hair each morning to wake up the curls.  I highly recommend this product for curly girls.</li>
            <li> I like all Tigi products....  Another great one!</li>
            <li> absolutely the best for my kinky, curly afro hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every product there is for curly hair. For years I&#x27;ve stuck w mousse for curly hair and spray. But it left my scalp dry and flaky. I decided to take a chance on this especially bc of the price. It&#x27;s worth every dime. Doesn&#x27;t leave me frizzy. My curls and more defined. My hair is shiny and soft. And I love the extra ummpfff I have.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what this is but the wife loves this stuff.  So it&#x27;s a win.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think its the only product besides Kenra HairSpray that will keep my curls together without frizz so I can have decent hair throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li> i am letting my hair be curly for the first time as an adult (used to blow dry hair and then hot iron it). So this product was suggested to me after i bought a couple other products i didn&#x27;t like. So far this is the best, but just experimenting with the best way to get the desired effect in my hair.</li>
            <li> I like this cream but it leaves hair crunchy so I have to put in blow drying serum after I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely curly hair and I&#x27;ve been using this product on her for years.  It separates &amp; defines the curls beautifully.  Also keeps the frizz away.</li>
            <li> Best curling product I&#x27;ve used so far. Comparable to Curl Envy but helps maximize the curl in my wavy hair better without leaving hair crunchy. Can also restyle the next day with some water and a little more product. Worth the few extra dollars compared to some other curling products.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love the quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Great for naturally curly hair. Curls are crispy tho, the gel has consistency of elmers glue, but does great on thick, long, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> At first my husband had posted a review for me on 12/21/2010 saying that I hated this product...well I gave it another shot this year in 2013, and I have to say my curls look amazing after I diffuse my hair with it.  No gel or hair serum has defined my curls so much like this one does when diffusing my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tigi&#x27;s Curls Rock (in the aqua blue container) for several years and been very satisfied.  When I saw this \\&quot;new\\&quot; Tigi item, I thought I would give it a try.  Thing is, I can&#x27;t see any difference performance-wise from the original Curls Rock.  The only difference is the higher price.  I&#x27;m sticking with the original.</li>
            <li> This item is really good in curly hair...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the stuff but my wife and sister do. My wife&#x27;s hair is naturally curly but looks even better w/this stuff. My sister got a perm and this stuff added that ever day touch to make it look good. Curls looked clean (not messy or frizzy) and the product didn&#x27;t leave a nasty chemical smell afterwards when applied.</li>
            <li> I have to say I love, love this product.  I have been looking for something like this for years.  It makes my curl form beautifully, without weighing them down or looking like I have an oil slick of product on my hair.  Unfortunately, it made my forehead break out.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was causing the little bumps on my forehead because I have never had problem skin. This had been going on for 3 months and finally I decided to take a vacation from this product, and it has cleared up.  I am so very disappointed because I thought I had finally found the best product out there for curly hair. :(</li>
            <li> the TIGI catwalk is excelent for curly hair. My daughter have the hair so curly and bloond . This product is super for that kind of hair. I used all the TIGI product for curly hair. They are so awesome.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my natural curly hair ... just made it feel sticky and I didn&#x27;t even use much.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Holds hair but leaves a crispy curl which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Great product, love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for years since I discovered it. It&#x27;s the only thing that, when applied properly, controls my frizz and leaves my curls soft and looking very natural.</li>
            <li> I am a curly-haired southern girl-summer in the south means lots of humidity, which means lots of frizz.  I&#x27;m always looking for hair products that reduce frizz and define curls.  This product has kept my curls looking good during the very hot, very humid weather we&#x27;ve experienced this last month.  I will purchse this product again-it is great!</li>
            <li> This is NOT the same and doesn&#x27;t do for my curls what the old Curls Rock did.  If you like the old one, you&#x27;ll be disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Catwalk Curls Rock Amplifier... I saw the review on the older version, and I can&#x27;t compare them, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any excessive drying out of my granddaughters hair. Her hair is very thin, and on the limp side. I put in a small amount (rubbed between my hands) and apply after I have her hair in pig tails or a ponytail, and the instant difference is incredible! It becomes full and curly... I recommend this to anyone who needs to add body to their hair and doesn&#x27;t have the time to use the other hair products!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and I cannot go without it.  It makes your hair so more manageable and easy to style...</li>
            <li> Great product. Helps keep curls together and from frizzing in central Florida. Been using it for a few years now and couldn&#x27;t live without it. Main component of my hair product regiment of Wen Styling Creme and Curls Rock, topped with a little Morroccan Oil Luminous Hairspray.</li>
            <li> I like to spend less time as possible on my hair plus my hair is already curly no use in taking time to curl it... I have too many other things I need to get done in the morning. This product is a literal apply and go, plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have just discovered this stuff.  I LOVE IT!! It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff or sticky.  And it&#x27;s great for 2nd day curls as well.  I have VERY curly hair, past my shoulders when wet, and this stuff is the best yet!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick natural curly hair... I have literally tried all the curly products from inexpensive to expensive, this is the only kind that keeps my hair from looking huge &amp; not frizzy! Definitely recommend this product if you have natural curly hair .</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that will curl nicely if properly coerced, but will frizz out otherwise. The original Curls Rock Curl Amplifier was the magic it needed -- I used just the *tiniest* amount (the size of a pea for my shoulder-length hair), and it would curl up my ringlets like nobody&#x27;s business. I&#x27;ve used it for 7 years with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out right before a vacation and went to the salon to get more, but was devastated to find out that Tigi had discontinued it! They recommended Kenra curl cream, but I&#x27;d tried that and it didn&#x27;t provide enough curl \\&quot;oomph.\\&quot; So I purchased Curlesque Curls Rock and just hoped for the best. The best did not materialize. :(  No matter how much or how little I used, my curls were limp and my hair either frizzy or greasy. The best way I can describe it is that the original was very \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and required lots of soap and water to wash off your hands; this cream just washes right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very curly hair that just needs taming, this would probably work fine. If you&#x27;re getting greasy or flaky results, just use less. But if you have fine hair, you&#x27;re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now going to buy up all the stock I can find from \\&quot;unauthorized\\&quot; outlets thta haven&#x27;t gotten rid of their stuff yet...</li>
            <li> Comes out as a paste, it&#x27;s not a mousse or gel.  Use it when hair is still wet.  When my hair is wet it&#x27;s mid shoulder length and I use 2 pumps worth of product.  When it dries, it&#x27;s then a good 3 inches shorter.  If you blow dry your hair; will not dry &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; but give you soft natural curls.  If you&#x27;re like me, and usually let your hair air dry then it will be a little crunchy at first.  But then you just scrunch your hair in your hands, maybe let the car window down for a minute and will be soft and natural bouncy curls in no time. I don&#x27;t like mousse&#x27;s b/c of the alcohol in them, which is horrible for my dry hair.  And I don&#x27;t know too many pastes like this.  Curly hair must have</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, that gets frizzy.  I don&#x27;t like products that are sticky, hard or heavy, but I also don&#x27;t like frizz.  This is a great product that effectively manages frizz, but doesn&#x27;t get hard, stick, or make my head feel too heavy.  My hair does better with this product than any others I&#x27;ve tried (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot!).  I also like using the Catwalk Curl COllection leave in conditioner first.  Seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I will sometimes mix this with Kinky Curly and it gives me nice soft curls. Definitely my go-to curly girl product for the last couple of years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Curls Rock Amplifier for years to tame my frizzy locks into soft curls. It doesn&#x27;t take much product (1-1.5 pumps for med-long hair), and I concentrate it on the bottom ~5 inches so that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair on top of my head. I apply when wet and let my hair air-dry.</li>
            <li> Love it - please keep it in stock!</li>
            <li> This helps form my curls nicely before applying my gel!</li>
            <li> My thin curly hair is frizzy with this product. Also It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the original. Definitely like the original Curls Rock better!</li>
            <li> Great for keep the fizz down and not weighting dow the curls, but I went through the bottle really quick cause I have long thick hair.  Had order more already.  It going to get pricey with all this hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy hair and this is the only product that has worked for me so far. Adds touchable hold with shine &amp; softness. The trick is not to touch your hair while its drying otherwise you&#x27;ll activate the frizz. I wash my hair &amp; comb it in the shower when I&#x27;m conditioning. Then I rinse, BLOT dry with a towel, and apply this product from the my neck to my ends. Finally, I just let it air dry. NO TOUCHING until it&#x27;s completely dry! You will have amazing, soft, frizz less waves. Any other styling or scrunching should be done when it&#x27;s dry. I used to call my hair witch hair because if I styled while wet I would only get frizz &amp; no waves. Thank god for my new stylist and all her tips. I love this product and I love my hair now. Can&#x27;t wait to try the shampoo and conditioner. One last thing like the other reviewers have mentioned be careful with the amount used. I put it on my crown once and used too much. When it dried it left white streaks in my hair. If this happens it&#x27;s easily fixed by smoothing wet hands over it and dabbing lightly with a towel.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair &amp; this is the best product I have found to give me the perfect curls.  My hair isn&#x27;t frizzy after using this product. I also use BIo silk for a more softer curl and not crunchy.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works okay. Doesn&#x27;t amplify or hold my curls as much as I would prefer. I still need to use some gel or my curls will start to frizz and fall by mid-day. Smell is okay and not too overpowering. I am a wavy type hair. I think this product would work great for really curly hair.</li>
            <li> Recommended by Timothy at Timothy John&#x27;s salon on the West Side, NYC - and its great! Apply it on the ends and scrunch it through, just like he said to do and Voila - it works!</li>
            <li> Since my previous favorite hair product was discontinued, I have been searching for almost a year for another curly-hair product that worked well for my hair. I have thick, wavy hair, and most products either don&#x27;t have enough hold or are too stiff. I came across Curlesque and have been using it for a couple weeks now, it works fabulously!</li>
            <li> Exellent product, works very well for naturally curly hair. Using only a small amount of this product works best to have a healthy looking not stiff appearance.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I can&#x27;t use this product because it is so heavily perfumed and it greatly bothers my allergies.  I put a small dab  on my hand to smell it as soon as it arrived from Amazon today.  Then I washed my hands, but the scent stayed and stayed and stayed.  My throat starting itching, and I knew that there would sadly be no Curlesque Rocks in my future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIGI products generally smell good to me, but they are so artificial and cloying I think.  Most hair product scents dissipate, but not those by TIGI.</li>
            <li> I used this when it used to be in the bright blue packaging (not as \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; looking at all), because it was recommended by a stylist when I went to Toni &amp; Guy (who sold the line). I did notice that the price went up with the rebranding/packaging, but that&#x27;s not this review....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally wavy, but I can trick into into some curl with a diffuser. This product has been awesome in helping - just hand squeeze out excess water after my shower, DO NOT COMB, then I clip up half and scrunch it into shape, then dry using a diffuser (at least half-dry). Then I do the top layer, and do a light hairspray spritz. I will say there is a pretty weird residue on my hands, so I use a bit of baby shampoo to really clean them off (I keep that handy on the counter b/c I use it to wash makeup brushes anyway - a tip from a Sephora store mgr I met!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Houston, TX, and humidity is HIGH. SO far this has worked really well - just don&#x27;t touch the hair during the day! It&#x27;s helped a lot during the spring (90*F + high high humidity) and I anticipate the same into summer. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments. If you use too much, you&#x27;ll have crunchy/clumpy. For my medium-thick, just-above-shoulder length hair, I use a partial pump (don&#x27;t push quite all the way down) and put more at the bottom of my hair than the top. It does get sticky, so I wouldn&#x27;t advise this unless you wash your hair every day - I would think that would be a sticky, greasy mess. I don&#x27;t use it EVERY day, usually no more than 3 days in a row and then I switch back to a day or two of straight hair or a simple ponytail. Overall, I&#x27;m impressed. I saw it at a beauty supply shop, individually priced much, much higher than Amazon. They were having a sale where if you bought 3 products from that line, you got it down to about the same price. I was very tempted b/c I wanted it \\&quot;then\\&quot; (impatient!), but after staring at all the options for 20 minutes, I realized I really just wanted to start with theone product, then decided if I needed all the \\&quot;complementary\\&quot; products they sell. As it turns out, I don&#x27;t - not now at least, just a bit of hairspray which I already had. Keep it simple folks, and just start with one product (don&#x27;t fall for the \\&quot;snowball effect that you need the full line at once) - otherwise you&#x27;ll just toss a bunch next time you do Spring Cleaning!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, and my stylist recommended this product for me and honestly every single time I use, I like it less. I wanted to love it because it&#x27;s kind of pricey; but it makes my hair crunchy, and I was looking for more of the smooth silky curls. I have tried using less of the product at once, but it&#x27;s just not a great product for my taste. It does hold your curls greatly though!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for years on my curly head.  It works and prevents crazy frizz problems--&lt;br /&gt;It is WAY more expensive at the local CVS</li>
            <li> I love this for my curly hair. It has the perfect hold and doesn&#x27;t make it crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, can&#x27;t stand that crunchy look or feel. This is the ONLY line of products I will use on my hair along with Tigi Curlesque Lightweight Mousse. My curls are soft and defined without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you with super crispy curls after applying and you don&#x27;t need very much to do the job. For best result apply to very damp hair.</li>
            <li> incase you need a little something to tame your curls - this is the stuff. i have very curly hair and all i do is put just a pump of this stuff on just out of the shower... holds the hair perfect giving it a wet look until you run your hands thru it again then it looks perfectly dry and doesn&#x27;t afro out! perfect hold all day long without the afro or frizz that you can get from gel.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I love how it holds my hair and can manipulate it into anything I want it to do.  It&#x27;s not greasy to me but does leave some film on my hands and is hard to rinse off.  I&#x27;ve used this product since January and it&#x27;s helped manage my shorter hair at the time.  I would say it works and is a great product.</li>
            <li> After seeing all the bad reviews from Curls Rock users, I was really hesitant to try this product as I had loved Curls Rock, used it for years and was devastated when I saw it was discontinued. I decided to give another product a try, which turned into a disaster and in desperation I came back to TIGI. My satisfaction with curlesque could be weighted slightly because the other product I tried (Deva Curl) totally dried out my hair and give it no shape at all, but I am really happy so far. My hair has the same texture and shape as it did with Curls Rock and requires the same minimal amount of cream. Yes, its more expensive, but the bottle is bigger (I think the old Curls Rock was only 4 oz, this is 5 oz).  I wish I had gone straight to the Curlesque line rather than wasting quite a bit of money to try something new.</li>
            <li> The product does leave your hair moisturesed and smelling good but does not amplify the curls. My hair is coarse wavy/but gets wavy/curly with mouse/ gel or spray just gets stiff or poofy after which was the problem . I was looking for something that would moisture and hold the curls but this doesn&#x27;t hold them at all . Actually makes it stringy and dead looking .  I thought hard and long before ordering and I regret buying . Very disappointed .</li>
            <li> So sad that they change this product!  I loved the old formula it never made my hair look or feel crunchy.  The new formula does!!!!!  I am so disappointed that I no longer have my go to hair product.</li>
            <li> I, too, was a *huge fan* of the original Curls Rock.  I may have cried when I found out that my Subscribe &amp; Save was canceled because TIGI discontinued the original Curls Rock.  Since I didn&#x27;t have much of a choice, I crossed my fingers and purchased the new Curlesque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that the Curlesque is stickier than the original.  That made me worry.  I think I had reason to worry because my curls ended up with a crunch that didn&#x27;t exist when I used the original Curls Rock.  Bummer.  I don&#x27;t like crunchy hair.  However, it still defines the curl and eliminates frizz, but I just don&#x27;t like crunchy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Regis has a product called Curl Lock Curl Cream that I was certain was identical to original Curls Rock.  I would sometimes get the Curl Lock if there was a good BOGO deal at the Regis salons.  I haven&#x27;t used Curl Lock in a long time since TIGI is available at major retailers and most salons, BUT I&#x27;m wondering if Regis was smart enough to stick to their original Curl Lock formula.  I&#x27;ll have to check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I&#x27;ve gone through so many different products and cocktails of products, and honestly I&#x27;m not so sure if there is any other product available that works as well as even this new Curlesque stuff.  So, I&#x27;ll continue using it, but I will definitely go see about the Curl Lock Curl Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I think we curly heads should all contact TIGI and let them know that they made a terrible, terrible mistake.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair. I LOVE this creme. It is my second product everyday ( first is Argan oil, then Catwalk Curlesque, then gel) . This keeps the curls defined, frizz away, all without drying. EXCELLENT stuff. I hope they never stop making this. My curls depend on it!  Update 5. 25. 16 - just ordered 4 more units of this . I seriously can&#x27;t live without this for my hair. The best product I&#x27;ve used in years.</li>
            <li> Great product great price fast shipping highly recommend P</li>
            <li> love the smell of this product</li>
            <li> TGI CATWALK HAS REDESIGNED THEIR PACKAGING. AND WOULDN&#x27;T YOU KNOW.... THE CUSTOMER IS SHORTED OUT ONCE AGAIN!!!! THE PACKAGE LASTS ABOUT 2 MONTHS LES THAN ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li> I have crazy curly hair that is made extremely frizzy and poofy in the humid town I live in. I have been looking and trying different hair products for years and I think I may have finally found it! I scrunch a little bit in my hair after I shower before I go to bed. The next morning I scrunch up my hair with some water and add just a little bit more of this. It leaves my curls gorgeous and I have gotten several compliments on it! Such a great product for the price. I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  My very curly, dry hair could not survive without it!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would certainly recommend...helps tame the frizz</li>
            <li> Just picked this up yesterday and tried it today.  Maybe I&#x27;ve got some kind of problem.  I&#x27;m trying to find a product that I can put into my wet hair, let it air dry, and end up with dry curly hair that looks like dry hair, not like the \\&quot;wet look.\\&quot;  This stuff left my hair looking wet, even after air-drying...and after I fingercombed it (which occasionally works with other products) I now have straw-like, not very curly, hair.  Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> One of the few things I have found that work for white people with curly hair, it&#x27;s not greasy like some other products.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite product to use when it comes to my curls. My hairdressed introduced me a few years ago and I&#x27;ve never looked back. It&#x27;s perfect for just a little wave or some nice, crinkly scrunched curls.</li>
            <li> Get it!! I have wavy and frizzy hair. This product gets the job done! I will always have this!! :)</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and is very hard to find a product that would define your curls and not let your hair look frizzy. I work long shift and by the end of the day my hair still looks great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it has practically changed me life :) I used to have either very frizzy hair or very crunchy curls. I couldn&#x27;t seem to find a balance, until I tried this product on a whim. What a difference! My curls are bouncy, defined, frizz-free (most of the time - still can&#x27;t find a product for that), and the cream smells good to boot. I get asked all the time what I use on my hair. The bottle lasts me about a month, sometimes less. I have very thick, long hair. When my hair was chin-length I could use one bottle for 2 months. If I ever apply too much by accident I wait for my hair to be completely dry before I scrunch it out. My hair still holds its shape with no crunch or frizz. I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between the old blue bottle and the new turquoise bottle, so this is a review for both. Some people can tell a difference between the two formulas but I can&#x27;t. I think I&#x27;ll buy a few bottles of the old formula before they&#x27;re gone for good and save some money.</li>
            <li> This product has been recommended by my haircutter.  A little does the job!  Thanks Amazon for carrying this product at a fair price...</li>
            <li> Curlesque is the only product of its kind that keeps my frizzy hair in check. If I want to go curly I just scrunch away. If I want a straighter look I comb thru until I like the look and just sit near my ceiling fan til it dries in place. It really stays all day and in the morning all you have to do is spray a little water to re-activate the product. I finally can wash my hair every other day. Thanks TIGI and Amazon for having this available.</li>
            <li> A great product for curly hair that needs a bit of structure. It keeps my hair from getting frizzy in the summer!&lt;br /&gt;If you have light curl, this product might be too heavy for your hair.</li>
            <li> I love the original Curls Rock Amplifier that came in the blue pump bottle. Like all curly girls, I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products and it was my favorite. I was very disappointed when the store where I purchase it from told me that they had discontinued it and that this new product was it&#x27;s replacement. I&#x27;ve found this new product to be very drying and it doesn&#x27;t give me the wonderful polished curls that it&#x27;s predecessor did. This also let my hair feeling very &#x27;gunky&#x27; and the alcohol in it caused a lot of dandruff. Overall, I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product and TiGi. I guess I&#x27;ll be buying the old stuff online from now on.</li>
            <li> Take heed to the recommendation to use a tiny! I didn&#x27;t listen and ended up with some crunchy curls! I love it though. I tend to rotate Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Curl Envy Perfect Curl Cream and Curly Sexy Hair Curling Creme. This is one is definitely in the mix now!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this for my long curly hair. It does a great job of holding the curl and avoiding the frizz. No &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; curls as long as you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products that I have ever used. It not only conditions your hair as you apply it, but for all you curly thin haired women, it provides structure while keeping hair soft and smooth.  LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (the original) for 7 years now, sadly I bought this and have become very disappointed. My hair seems to be more frizzy and uncontrollable but the last straw was it makes my hair line break out! Thanks Catwalk but I will be taking my business elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My hair falls somewhere between wavy and curly. I love this product because it helps me make it wavy or curly, instead of just frizzy or flat. It holds pretty well, although I find if I put too much, it can weigh my hair down. A little spritz of hair spray after I dry it a bit with a diffuser works well.</li>
            <li> arrived as indicated. Love the item</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product is consistently rated so highly for curly hair. It left my hair looking wet, crunchy and greasy! I thought I might have just used too much but even when I adjusted it was still terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is one of those creams that is impossible to rinse off your hands! Leaves your hands slimy and wastes a lot of water rinsing (I live in the drought-ridden west coast so I notice these things). Not a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be without this product for my natural curls. I&#x27;ve spent tons of $$$ finding all the wrong products for decades and this, this is the s***!</li>
            <li> If you want defined curls this is it.  If you use a lot it will be cruchy. If you hate frizz give it a try.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with TIGI.  I have been buying this product for a long time because it works on my naturally curly hair.  I buy this product at least every 2 months for my household.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well.  There was a bit of a learning curve to get it to work with my hair but I like it and since you need such a small amount it seems like the bottle will last a really long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years -- works great on my naturally curly hair to keep it in line.</li>
            <li> After fighting my curls for 30 years, I was able to embrace them thanks to this product. My hair would be a ball of frizzy hair without any defined curls. This product works! Wonderful, defined curls and no frizz whatsoever. Just apply after towel drying hair and let air dry. I have a ton of really thick, long hair and only need 2-3 pumps at a time to style all of it. Great product at a very good price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell or work the same as catwalk I get at the store. Kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Curlesque product for a long time and I absolutely love it! I have long, naturally wavy hair - it doesn&#x27;t have tight curls, but it certainly couldn&#x27;t be considered straight. Unruly may be a better adjective? Either way, Curlesque is the best product I have found. It defines my curls without leaving a crunchy, sticky, or otherwise &amp;#34;product-y&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Points: It smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving it a 2 star rating is because I received this bottle without a cap! Typically it takes a few pumps to get the product to come out of a new bottle, but it had already been pumped. I&#x27;m not going to say it has been used, but it certainly is skeptical!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have naturally curly hair, and this is great to use for just a little curl control.  It is not heavy like gels or a mousse.  Gives your hair a beautiful style, with natural curl.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products. I have very tight curly hair when naturally dried.  This product defines nicely. I would just recommend that you really &amp;quot;smooth&amp;quot; it out in your hands before putting in your hair.  It can clump and when dries you have a white clump of goo in your hair if you don&#x27;t!  I use a leave in conditioner first.</li>
            <li> This stuff defined some of my curls...but just could not elevate the frizz from my hair. It also made it crunchy and straw like. So sad, it had great slip but didn&#x27;t perform right. My hair type is a strict 3b/c with mostly 3b waves and curls. And, if that wasn&#x27;t enough from this product...I believe it made my skin breakout once I rinsed it in the shower. There is a chemical in it (Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde) which is known to cause ECZEMA! So for some of you who think your eczema is just about who you are...think again, especially if you wash your hair in the shower.  Be careful with some ingredient lists online. Some places do not list ALL of the ingredients. The fact that this particular ingredient was left off of some sites says a lot.  Even if some like this product...it doesn&#x27;t mean that it is not causing them to have eczema. But what can I say, everyone is different.  My hair is so thick, I used half the can the FIRST time, and my hair isn&#x27;t even shoulder length. I threw it away, and I use something different that I love!!!!!!I love it so much I don&#x27;t even want to say what it is....it&#x27;s a secret :-)</li>
            <li> I am bi-racial.  I have the in-between hair- that can become extremely poofy and frizzy.  This product works fabulously on very curly hair.  Your curls will spiral and gives a nice shine to your hair.  I do use it in combination with other products such as oils etc...  BUT.. you may not have to.</li>
            <li> To begin, I don&#x27;t have curly hair.  It gets pretty wavy in the summer, but often almost completely straightens out in the winter.  I&#x27;ve been wanting to try some sort of mousse/gel that would make my hair look nicer and I thought something like this might give me some nice waves.  I am pretty lazy with my hair, I just wash and air dry.  I scrunch this product in after briefly towel drying my hair.  It does give me some waves, which is great!  And some days they come out better than others.  The reason I&#x27;ve only rated this product as okay is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) It&#x27;s very sticky, so don&#x27;t put too much in your hair.  But if you don&#x27;t use too much your hair will not be sticky.  It can just be annoying to wash off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) I kinda feel I could get similar results with a cheaper hair product, so even though I like this enough, I don&#x27;t see myself buying it again</li>
            <li> Catwalk is fabulous! I have been using it for years and have not found another product that performs as well as this. I have wavy to curly hair, and this product does amplify the curl effect of my hair. It is a great styling aid!</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every hair product made by man and TIGI Catwalk is the absolute best brand on the market for my hair.  I particularly love the &amp;#34;Curls Rock Amplifier&amp;#34; above all others.</li>
            <li> This product really wakes my curls up better than any other product that I have used.  A little bit will do it.</li>
            <li> Love it I have curly hair and it is great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tigi curl rocks for years now. Ever since my last favorite product was discontinued, and I tried everything in between before finding this gem. Personally I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference between this new formula than the old one. What I did notice was when I was without either. I am able to put this product in my hair after a shower at night and it still looks great the next morning on my curls and I can style a bit and wear to work. I&#x27;ve tried so many other products and never been as happy with them as I am with the Tigi line. I will def continue to buy this one, new product and all. One note though, is I do find it to be a \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; product if you don&#x27;t use any type of diffuser on your hair. I&#x27;m ok with that though, I love the way it works, and my hair never looks frizzy!</li>
            <li> Hard to believe that we found something that works this well on really curly hair after all the trial and error!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin curly hair. Many products I&#x27;ve tried have weighed down my curls making them look like a lifeless mess. I am using Puerology products for shampoo, spray on curl product and a curl tamer cream for frizz. I added Catwalk Curl to my routine and I really love the product. One squirt gives you a little dollop of product and that&#x27;s enough for my medium length hair. Catwalk Curl brought my curls back to life. I will buy this product again and again. As a side note it does smell like men&#x27;s cologne.  But after my hair dries I can&#x27;t really smell it anymore. If they changed the fragrance to something more clean and feminine this would be a perfect product.</li>
            <li> Wow, way to budget cut a product Tigi! I have looong curly hair and I&#x27;ve been using your product for 10 years. My hair went to moist and soft with the original \\&quot;Curls Rock\\&quot; to straw with your so called \\&quot;Curl Collection\\&quot;! Read the label and not the packaging, alcohol is what drys out your hair and they are the top ingredients in their new expensive product. Keep your cucumbers and give me back my Curls Rock.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 years. This is the best product on the market for holding your hair in place. Plus, it was cheaper to purchase on Amazon than buying from my hair salon.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to flowers. The scent is so strong it gives me a horrible headache.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever for my thick, coarse, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is what I use on my hair every morning. Keeps my curls soft and keeps the frizz gone. Lots of compliments on my hair since I started using it. First bought it at the salon, where I go my hair cut. Have purchased on Amazon at a better price ever since.</li>
            <li> I had heard some great reviews on this product from friends and was excited to try it out.  My hair is wavy and will curl with the right product (usually spray  gel).  I often use John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz Ease to help keep the volume down and was hoping for something similar or better with CurlsRock.  Sadly, it does nothing for my hair - adds a little weight but kills the curls and leaves my hair super greasy even if I only use a little.  I am very disappointed overall.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; packing and formula wouldn&#x27;t measure up to the previous Curls Rock Amplifier (especially after reading a few negative reviews), but I can&#x27;t tell a difference.  I love this stuff!  I just wish that I could do the subscription through Amazon with this one.</li>
            <li> The first time that I ordered this product I received it as it was pictured and was very satisfied. Because of this I re-ordered from the same seller. The second time, the product I received was in a different bottle with a red label, it was scratched, and it had no lid. I have used this product for years and love it for my curly hair but will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Great price, delivered fast.</li>
            <li> Catwalk curls is a great product for natural curly hair. Unfortunately it&#x27;s a bit pricey when your hair is thick and long, but curls look great and the product doesn&#x27;t dry your ends.&lt;br /&gt;Curls do rock!!!</li>
            <li> Only need a small amount of this to tame my frizzy flyaways into nice curls and waves.  I started using this about a year ago and it is the best product I have found to add some curl where I previously had frizz.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this is the first product I have found that I can use alone that I love.  I put it in my hair wet, wait 10 minutes then blow dry.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to the product when the \\&quot;new version\\&quot; came out, I loved it.  I was able to purchase the \\&quot;old\\&quot; product in stores.  I have tried both products and still love them both.  Prior to using this product I was using Vavoom volumizing mouse, which I still use depending on the look I am going for.  The best part about the Curls Rock is that it is a wash n go product.  I have all of the products in the line but only use the curls rock religously.  When I use all the products, my curls get too big for my liking.  This leaves my curls flowing, soft and not crunchy.  Since using this product, I have gotten even more compliments on how good my curls look.  I also have an issue especially during the winter with itchy scalp but with this product I do not get the itchy product buildup on my scalp.  I also do not shampoo my hair, just a friendly tip for other curly hair girls.  Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that manages frizz and feels great in my hair. I love that it does not make my curls crunchy like gel does (curly girls - you know what I mean!) nor does it flake out of my hair. I wear my hair curly all the time so I use this product almost daily!</li>
            <li> I have thick, tight, corkscrew curly hair. This stuff was AWFUL in my hair and I agree with most of the other posts. It doesn&#x27;t hold your hair at all and does give it a straw like texture. I actually haven&#x27;t found a Tigi styling product I&#x27;m completely happy with yet. I have used the CatWalk Curls Rock Curl Booster. I loved this product, BUT it did leave a build-up after awhile. I found that if I used it every other day that that would help up with the build-up (It stays in your hair for a looong time). Probably going to give the S Factor Smoothing a try.</li>
            <li> Works quite well. Didn&#x27;t give it five starts because my curls get crunchy sometimes.</li>
            <li> Awesome for curly hair</li>
            <li> Is a good products for curls totally recommended for women that want to have the control of her hair tnhks</li>
            <li> I do like this product, I have curly hair, and when I use this product my curls are defined and hair is not as frizzy. These results are yielded by the use of this product and a defuser. The only thing I do not like about this product is that your hair can become crunchy and flaky if too concentrated in one area.</li>
            <li> Good product, am very happy with it. A few things to mention as to why I only gave four stars instead of five. (1) the products were very loosely packaged in shipping, the tops all popped off and I had to put them all back on. Although, none were damaged really. (2) Wish the price was a bit better. That&#x27;s it.  It was quick shipping (although, would have been nice if they would have taken a few more minutes to package them right).</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I don&#x27;t have frizz yet my hair is still soft.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that controls my natural curly hair, and I have tried sooo many products, cheep and expensive.  I am caucasian with extremely curly hair.  Instead of fighting my natural,God given curls, I just keep my hair very curly.  This product does make my hair a bit &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, but this is the only product I have found that controls the curls with no frizz. I rub about 2 pumps of it onto my hands, and work it into my hair, and then kind of scrunch it with my hands.  Then I leave it for about half hour (while doing other things to get ready) until the curls start to set. Then blow dry with a defuser attachment.  Strangers come up to me a lot and tell me they love my hair, so I must be doing something right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a moisturizer gel almost - keeps my hair looking healthy visually at least and keeps my curls together with my just enough lovely volume. Saw it on a 2013 top 13 best products list, gave it a try and I like it :)also better price here  than say dvd if they even carry it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works great, especially for curly hair.  Works much better than other products such as mouse.  I don&#x27;t even have to use hair spray either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 5 years now and wouldn&#x27;t consider changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for my thick natural curly hair and gives me the great hold in the humid FL weather conditions.&lt;br /&gt;It helps calm my frizziness and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Defines my fine , curls with out weighing them down or making my hair &amp;#34;crunchy &amp;#34; or greasy. I live in South FL so humidity is a constant battle. Finally a product that does what I need it to!!</li>
            <li> This is great for curly hair!</li>
            <li> This product works very well on curly or wavy hair.  Better than I expected. I have already let someone try it out and they purchased this product after that.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my African-American daughter. It does a great job of moisturizing and separating her curls leaving them soft and bouncy. I will buy this product to use on her hair as long as it remains on the market.</li>
            <li> This is what my hair stylist used in my hair and although I will never be able to produce the same results as she can, I still think this is a good product. My go to hair regime is Kinky Curly Knot Today in dripping wet hair...one pump of Curls Rock per side and top....wrap it in my Turbie Twist and let down and leave alone. I get pretty good results with this method.</li>
            <li> like the mousse but even better this amplifier. Anyway all Catwalk products are worth trying, best quality for the money.</li>
            <li> Best product for curly hair. I have used it for years!</li>
            <li> A CO WORKER USES THIS PRODUCT AND SHE HAS LOVELY CURLY HAIR LIKE MINE.  SHE LIVES BY THIS PRODUCT AND SHE RECOMMENDED IT.  I&#x27;VE BEEN WANTING TO BUY IT AND TRY IT FOR A LONG TIME .  WHEN I FINALLY DID TRY IT I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE IT.  IT DOESN&#x27;T AMPLIFY MY CURLS OR MAKE THEM NICER LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD.  IT LEAVES HAIR CRUNCHY NOT SO NATURAL FEELING WHICH IS WHAT I LIKE. JUST LIKE ANY OTHER PRODUCT YOU WONT KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU UNLESS YOU TRY IT.  I WISH THEY HAD CHEAPER  SMALLER BOTTLE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN TRY IT BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT IN A PRODUCT THAT ONE DOES NOT KNOW IF IT WILL WORK OUT OR NOT.  ANOTHER BEAUTY ITEM NOT BEING USED ADDED TO MY COLLECTION...</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keeps your curls from looking limp and frizzy. I&#x27;ve used it for years and now my daughter who has curlier hair loves it!!</li>
            <li> I know there are more great reviews on this than poor ones, but the things people describe as results when using this product are just not at all what I&#x27;ve experienced! I love this stuff... I use it either alone, or with a curl/volume boosting mousse. Neither products even together, leave my hair with a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look or \\&quot;crunchy.\\&quot; If you&#x27;re getting a \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; result from any curl cream or mousse - you&#x27;re using way too much... I have really fine hair, but so much of it and it&#x27;s all curly that it is pretty thick in that regard. A little goes such a long way with most styling products. I used to use a handful or this or that or the other when younger and then have to fight to get the crunch out of my hair, and it would be weighed down. Since I started paying attention to how much my stylist puts in my hair (of whatever she has on hand, and it&#x27;s never my products lol), I learned to cut WAAAAY back. I still use more than she does, bc the amount she uses ends up not being quite enough when my hair is dry, but again... I use two pumps of this. That&#x27;s it. I rub it between my palms, lightly tap all over my hair, and really get the ends, then work it all in as well and evenly as possible (while wet, just out of the shower). My hair is not frizzy, has a great shine, curls are super bouncy and light and I have a good volume - especially when I combine it with the mousse I use, which I apply in the same manner but only after I use the curl cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has to be the best curl cream I&#x27;ve ever used, especially for the money. A second choice when short on money, or in a pinch I use \\&quot;Samy: Big Curls\\&quot; which can be bought at almost anywhere that sells your everyday drugstore hair stuff like Suave and Herbal Essences, and comes in a yellow tube (which sits \\&quot;upside down\\&quot; so to speak, on it&#x27;s own cap. Careful with this one too - a little goes a long way, and sometimes a lot likes to come out of the bottle from sitting on the cap. It also has a nice very light, sweet lemon scentto it. Sometimes if I&#x27;m low on my TIGI product (and $), I will use a little of it and the Samy together. Samy runs about half the cost. While it&#x27;s really good for a drug store product, it&#x27;s still not as good as the TIGI Catwalk Curl Collection Curlesque Curls Rock Amplifier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not tried this product before it was revamped with a new formula that people have complained about so, I don&#x27;t know any difference. I just know that this product hardly has a scent to it at all, isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy, washes out easily, and leaves my hair curls well defined while really light and bouncy and with a great shine. I&#x27;m allergic to everything under the sun, and this product doesn&#x27;t bother me in any way. My hair as far as texture, feels very similar with this product in it, to what it naturally feels like without (very soft), only it cures any frizzies and uneven curling like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Def buy this! It&#x27;s way more expensive in every store locally that I&#x27;ve seen (anywhere from $12.95 - $16.95).</li>
            <li> this is a great product for holding my natural curls.  I&#x27;ve used it for many years.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Really works for curly hair! Unfortunately it leaves a sticky residue on your hands after applying. It makes the hair curly with no fuzz!</li>
            <li> Great product!  It works great for fine hair!  I love this product!  It tames the frizz and the split ends!</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair, this is the only product that can control the frizz and still have natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> excellent value. Delivery was fast. Thanks</li>
            <li> A excellent product, I really liked. but be careful! Don&#x27;t put too much... Your hair will look a little rough. Hahahah</li>
            <li> This product holds my curl and reduces frizz.  I switched to this product because Fashionista Big &amp; Bigger was discontinued.</li>
            <li> The top of one was missing.</li>
            <li> I tried the original formula several times and loathed it.  The original formula was heavy, greasy and made me just feel blah and gross.  THIS REHAUL IS AWESOME.  My curles are bouncy, lightweight and not frizzy.  It doesnt feel like I have ANY product in my hair at all.  My curls are spiral, highlighted every month and past my shoulder.  I use five pumps of product evenly distributed through my hair.  Smells great!</li>
            <li> Biracial solution to the max.. This really pops my curls but with out the greasy sticky feel. It works well with the TIGI Catwalk Leave in conditioner.  I recommend this to anyone of any race with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and just a small amount of this product helps define the waves/curls. A little goes a long way, easily washes out and does not feel greasy or crunchy.</li>
            <li> I love the product! I have very curly hair (my heritage is Italian, Norwegian, French) and it can be so hard to manage with out the right products. I&#x27;ve used mouse in the past to fix my hair. Although I still use mouse, putting a couple of dabs of this product on my hair before adding mouse just gives my hair an even better look. If you want your hair to really stay in place or if you really want a product to help control the frizz, this is the one I recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product. I have very fine hair (lots of it)  and natural curl I am 44 years old and have tried just about everything out there Nothing has worked I heard of this product from a woman I work with so I figured what the heck I purchased the shampoo, conditioner and amplifier. THE RESULTS ARE AMAZING my hair is soft and the curl is unbelievable. I will definitely purchase this product again</li>
            <li> Only product I use on my curly hair.  Doesn&#x27;t make hair hard like other products.  Curls stay soft and natural.</li>
            <li> I use this with other curling products that hold curl more...it does bring out the curls really well and leaves hair silky...just doesn&#x27;t provide a strong hold to the curl but isn&#x27;t a problem since I use other products as well that have more hold. Still use it as part of my curl maintenance...I have really curly hair and i even use in my daughter&#x27;s hair (she has mixed hair) and it works great for her too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price on here as well! Will buy on Amazon again when we run out!</li>
            <li> Everyone that has curly hair needs to at least try this product. It works the best that I have found.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using the other TIGI Catwalk Curl Amplifier (that comes in the light blue bottle) and I LOVED that one, it worked best for my thick wavy curls. I figured this would do the trick since it&#x27;s the same brand, but for some reason it didn&#x27;t. It made my hair big once it was all dried up. I&#x27;m sure it works great for other people, but I&#x27;ll be sticking to the other Catwalk amplifier.</li>
            <li> Love it. I get spiral perms and this has given me the best results in keeping the bounce without frizz. I use a diffuser blow dryer tip.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to make the curls more pronounced.  Not greasy or heavy and smells great.  Not sure how it will do once the humidity kicks in</li>
            <li> This came in the mail with out the cap, and on top of that half empty because it was all over the box! Very upsetting</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this is my favorite hair product.  I have been using for many years.  I use with Paul Mitchell mousse.</li>
            <li> I love this product it helps keep the frizz down in my natural curly hair but does so with put making my hair feel sticky and weighed down.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for my curls. Hydrating and keeps frizz at bay, even in humid Florida.</li>
            <li> This product makes my curls look fabulous! I was happy to find this on amazon cheaper then in my local beauty supply store in my mall. This product makes your curls feel soft and provides enough hold so you dont get that unwanted frizz. Work this all over your hair and comb through with your hands. I let my hair air dry with this product, but I am sure if you use a diffuser you will get that same natural soft look as well!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  This was a referral from my friend who has amazing curly hair and bounce using this same product.  I tried it many times - both air dry and diffusing and each time I ended up with dry, frizzy hair with no bounce what so ever that I could not run my fingers through. Back to my DevaCurl gel.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly / frizzy hair. This product is great for defining curls that last all day. A little bit goes a long way though so don&#x27;t use too much or your hair will have a gluey texture when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> I like the curl this product gives. When my hair is kept up with shaping and trims, this product gives it a lot of curl and bounce. If my hair is heavier, I feel like this product weighs is down even more. You have to get the right amount, if you get too much product it makes the hair have a wet, crunchy look. Not something I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I continue to purchase this product, my stylist recommended it and I like it.</li>
            <li> Works great on wet hair (makes it a little crunchy, but you can scrunch that out when your hair dries and still have curls), but I love it even more for second day curls - just apply a little to my top layer, squirt hair with a spray of water, and re-crunch for curls that look nice and hold, too.</li>
            <li> This products did help keep curls but is a little heavy feeling.  I needed to wash my hair and get it out the next day.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product ever. I have naturally (really) curly hair, and it keeps things looking nice! It does have silicates in it, so if you have to shampoo your hair at least once a week. But it&#x27;s seriously amazing.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my hair. This is the only product I have found that actually does what it says it will for curly hair. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for controlling curly hair frizziness. We can&#x27;t say enough about it. All our curly haired family members use Curls Rock!</li>
            <li> I love this product a lot. Before I would be trying to control my curls and frizz and by leaving in some conditioner it would sort of do the job, but the curls wouldn&#x27;t stay in as long as when I use this. I would recommend when using to brush out your hair, put a little bit on your hands and put it everywhere on your hair, brush it out again, and then either use a diffuser or scrunch with a towel.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years. It is great for curly hair. Keeps frizz away and holds the curls.</li>
            <li> I like this product for my naturally curly hair, to enhance the curl a bit. I think Amazon should not require these feedbacks to be a certain length because honestly I run out of things to say.</li>
            <li> This will really accentuate your curls but beware that it leaves your hair crunchy. Just depends what type of product you are looking for I guess.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because there were so many high reviews. This product is decent, but when I happened to glance at the bottom of the bottle, I noticed it had been expired nearly a year. I guess it might work better if it wasn&#x27;t expired! I did notice more curl in my naturally wavy hair. A bit of advice: a little of this stuff goes a long  way! If you use too much, it leaves your hair weighted and greasy. I have used a good bit of it at this point, so there&#x27;s no point in trying to return it or anything. Amazon is usually wonderful, but I was a little disappointed this time.</li>
            <li> I learned about TIGI Curl Collection about three years ago.  Since I have a little natural wave in my hair TIGI really brings out the waves and I love the way it leaves my hair feeling.  I can&#x27;t imagine not using it at each shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but was shipped without a cap.  Not sure if bottle was actually &#x27;new&#x27;</li>
            <li> Makes dried hair feel heavy, even with a very small amount used.&lt;br /&gt;First time used and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is great for curly hair.  Keeps the frizz down and the curls up.  It takes only a small amount!</li>
            <li> Great Stuff,. still using it &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my curly hair and I have found that this is the only one that will leave my hair very curly and frizz free.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> and inexpensive. A tiny bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s a bit stiff if you use it close to the scalp. The directions recommend to only use it from halfway down your hair down. I think that&#x27;s a good plan. But if you have frizz near your scalp you&#x27;ll need a softer product for that area.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It really makes your curls pop. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like, is that it is a bit heavy. It isn&#x27;t super heavy, and it hasn&#x27;t stopped me from using it often! I have very thick, long spiral curls.</li>
            <li> BEST THING I FOUND FOR MY KIDS BED HEAD!!! I WISH I KNEW ABOUT IT YEARS AGO. MY KID WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic for blow drying your hair with a diffuser but if you let your hair air dry, it&#x27;s almost as if there&#x27;s no product in it at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This cream works great leaving my curls frizz free. This is my second bottle purchased. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have colored, long, wavy hair.  I use a cowash only (like Wen).  I fight with dryness and my stylist blamed my cheap mouse. She uses this on her hair that is very, very curly.  I love it, though I need to use 4 squirts for my hair (and maybe could even use more, but I am too thrifty to try).  I don&#x27;t expect this to last long.  I have tried others looking for a less expensive alternative, but I keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this and we both have curly hair.  I have used countless other products and this is by far the best! It gives awesome texture without stickiness or stiffness.  It eliminates frizz!  Once you start using this, you won&#x27;t ever use anything else.  I once went to 3 stores to try to find it when we ran out!  Now I buy from amazon in bulk! LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something light and lacking crunch. This lacks crunch but definitely has a weight to it and leaves you feeling slightly oily and damp-ish. The oiliness is so potent that it makes a next day hair wash mandatory.</li>
            <li> Works great on long curly hair and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. It&#x27;s very spreadable and you can just rewet your hair if you need to throughout the day. It&#x27;s a white cream. It does not dry out your hair or make your hair crunchy. Gel and mousse would be a thing of the past if you try this product and it definitely takes away the frizz and accentuates the curl. I recommend using a squirt of Ouidad heat and humidity gel ( doesn&#x27;t feel like a gel) through the base of your hair and use curl amplifier from the crown down. It&#x27;s a great combination. I am not affiliated with either brand, just a very experienced customer. I&#x27;ve been using Curl Amplifier for years and keep coming back to it if I try something else. The shipping was prompt and the product was well packaged.</li>
            <li> I live in the Pacific NW where you shouldn&#x27;t look like you do anything to your hair -- it should just look naturally great. Also, it&#x27;s just going to rain anyway, and nobody cool in Portland carries an umbrella, so you want a hairstyle that can handle that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a layered cut and a bit of natural wave in my hair that can tend towards fuzzy if it gets humid (EVERY DAY in Portland). This product brings out the natural wave but tames my hair so that I&#x27;m not a frizzed out mess. I just work a bit through my hair either when towel dried on lazy days, or after blow drying when I&#x27;m feeling energetic and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than traditional mousse. It leaves my hair in better shape and seems to have more of a conditioning effect. It styles just as well or better. I have permed hair, and this product works well to preserve and enhance the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of greasy when you apply it, and I have to wash my hands after I have put it into my hair. My hair is fairly long, but all I need is one squirt (this is sold in a pump dispenser rather than an aerosol). I let my hair air dry, and the curls pop out. I can go out like that since I have a nice cut, or use hot rollers or my curling brush or blowdry to style with this product.</li>
            <li> I too do not like that the formula was changed.  I have long VERY curly hair and was SO happy when I found this product.  When using Curlesque, my hair was soft and moist, never frizzy (and I live in the South).  Now that the formula has changed, there are no curls anymore, it&#x27;s just frizzy and my hair feels thick and mushed together.  They&#x27;ve definitely lost me as a customer.  I&#x27;m out to find a new hair product line.  Goodbye TIGI !!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it to help control my curls. Always bought it from the salon and it was always more expensive. Have bought it twice now and always comes intact. Great price. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> great product for thick curly hair</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product for curly hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love the price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it before so i knew i would love it</li>
            <li> Love this, love the way it smells and good for my hair - only thing is the way it feels on your hands but washes off</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this hair product.  My hair is thin and wavy/curly.  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, I&#x27;ve tried has made my hair look sticky, crunchy, greasy, flat, etc.  This makes my hair look natural and as if there is no product in my hair.  My waves/curls have bounce, body, and are frizz-free.  I use this with a diffuser and it has changed my life.  The product is creamy and super sticky in your hands. I don&#x27;t know how it transfers to hair without the same feeling. I have to give my hands a good scrub to make sure the sticky residue is completely off of my hands.</li>
            <li> With a head full of curly hair, my hair would be a wild mess without it. I decided to have it sent monthly so I never run out of it. I also love coffee, but I would rather run out of coffee and arrive at work caffiene free than have to wear a baseball hat to work. It&#x27;s a must for thick, curly hair!</li>
            <li> great product but the original formula is better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky or stiff, and really brings out curls so they look natural and soft. Great for long or short hair.</li>
            <li> I am wildly impressed with this product. I have long (bottom of shoulder blades) wavy hair and I have tried many many things (some in combination) to try and tame my hair. My hair frizzes very easily and with other products I was not able to touch my hair because it would get too frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not used the old \\&quot;Curls Rock\\&quot; product that I have seen others mention so I cannot compare but so far, this product has done everything it promises. My waves are defined, frizz-free, and soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this product, I used 5 pumps which was waaaaayy too much and my hair was crunchy and felt sticky. Since then, I have used one pump and it has been perfect.</li>
            <li> It certainly holds curls but it feels like glue.</li>
            <li> a friend that is a hairdresser turned me onto this product and I love it!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  i like it because it&#x27;s not heavy and it still allows my curls to flow rather then be held in place.</li>
            <li> My favorite product for my hair!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely devastated that TIGI discontinued their curls rock amplifier!! I have used TIGI&#x27;s original Curls Rock product for almost a decade and nothing else has compared to it. This new Curlesque version just doesn&#x27;t have the chops. It doesn&#x27;t have the great hold or definition that the old version had and left my hair frizzy and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I use this worldwide. It always does the job keeping my curls in the best shape. And the curls stay for the whole day, and longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually WORKS.  That almost never happens.  I&#x27;ll  never be without this product!  Makes your hair a little stiff, but not a big deal really.</li>
            <li> I have wavy frizzy hair.. this stuff is awesome. It really tames my curls and I use my finger to twist them and use the serum while doing so it works great then I use some moose and a diffuser</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product for people with curly hair! I will never use anything but this. It is amazing! It&#x27;s the only thing that mike my hair not look like a frizzy mop!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years. It&#x27;s been the best thing I have found for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It&#x27;s truly a &#x27;bad hair day&#x27; when I don&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that a little of this stuff goes a long ways...I have very long, thick, naturally curly hair and this helps to control the curls and the frizz. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this stuff is that it leaves my hair slightly stiff and crunchy. For now though, it&#x27;s my favorite hair product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  I controls my curly frizzy hair all day long, and is excellent for the humid summer days.  I do not need to use alot  2-3 pumps covers my medium length and thick hair.  I have used similar products from regular name brands that cost less, but I had to use alot more product which in the end does not save money.  Plus those products do not work as well. This product is superior to those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not dry out my hair.  I use the diffuser and dry until almost dry.  Air dry the rest of the way and it turns out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have curly hair, I recommend to you.</li>
            <li> I have tight curly hair and I have tried so many products from mousses to gels to sprays to conditioners to cream/gels..... My hair would either be crunchy from too much hold or frizzy from not enough. I found this product a few years back and I have yet to find anything better. It has a good amount of hold but doesn&#x27;t dry solid like a gel. It is rather sticky as you are applying it but my hair looks just as good before I go to bed at night as when I did when I left my house in the morning! You don&#x27;t need to use a lot either. My curls go two inches past my shoulders and I use less then a full pump so it lasts me 3+ months!!! All of those reviews saying that it dries crunchy must be using too much! Yes if I let it air dry, it may be a bit crunchy but as soon as I shake my curls out a bit, the crunchiness is gone. I have people come up and ask how I get my curls so perfect and this is the product I have to thank!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair would be a disaster without it.</li>
            <li> Really helps with thick and curly hair.  Keeps the frizz out and curls stay maintained throughout the entire day.  I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Too sticky. Terrible. Don&#x27;t buy this, please. Get something better. This is completely not natural and makes crispy hair.</li>
            <li> I use this with my hair still wet and scrunch my hair afterwards, then I apply gel that is specifically for curly hair over it. The cream keeps frizzes out.</li>
            <li> Love.  It .I apply to wet hair. When hair drys hair I have full shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! If you have curly hair buy it!</li>
            <li> I like it .. it makes my hair a little harder than eco styler &amp; miss jessie&#x27;s gels but over all I like the volume TIGI adds .. I didn&#x27;t have any white residue or specs left in my hair after it air dry either .. I use my leave in conditioner for moisture first then I apply the TIGI gel on top .. I will purchase this again</li>
            <li> I liked how it made my curls shiny but tj made them really hard and I want soft curls so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving this product a three</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It is perfect for my permed hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely best thing for naturally curly hair.  My curls are springy, and the product smells great!  Get a a ton of compliments the days I use it.</li>
            <li> I have thick corse Hispanic curly hair and all products I have used does not do my curls justice. I was first introduced to this at the salon and I absolutely love this product. I use three pumps and it works all day!!! I highly recommend this to anyone with curly hair, the trick is to scrunch it in from the bottom on up and let air dry!!!</li>
            <li> It is a good product to curl and define any type of curls I would say. just a nut size on the palm of the hand and apply on wet hair, section to section. Just love it! I would recommand to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will order again and again. It keeps my hair in place without being rock hard.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with foam rollers and it does not give much staying power.  I have a slight wave to my hair that can become a curl with the right product and this didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  It just makes my hair very coarse.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised by this product!  I googled an article on best products for curly hair, and this was recommended.  Was a good choice.  Kept my frizzy curls neat and together, when my hair becomes dry, I just scruntch it a bit to release the crunchy quality it  first has.  But when the gel cast is released, it is quite soft.  To refreshen day old curls, I just dab some water on them with a hint of product too.  I have been a Ouidad user for some time now, but am seeking a less expensive alternative.  I believe I found it!</li>
            <li> One of the few products that just gets my curls. Makes some amazing ringlets, calms frizz and gives it such an overall nice curly look. Its a touch drying, so I always make sure to have some oil or leave in, just to keep it touchable. Lovelovelove this stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for my daughters long curly hair!  It doesn&#x27;t make her hair feel crispy, combs out easily and definitely controls the frizz!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have very curly kinky hair and this really makes a difference in controlling that problem. I get crispy curls that I can control every day with water spritzer when I wake up. This is the best price that I could find too! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using this wrong or something but it really doesn&#x27;t help me get defined-frizz free curls.  I have natural wavy/curly hair and this products seems like every other product I&#x27;ve used.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually put this stuff in on my hair after washing my hair and then I let my hair air-dry.  It helps a little bit but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do extraordinary work.</li>
            <li> I was sent an expired product. I have used this product in the past, and always enjoyed it, but was sent a product that expired 6 months ago. I assume when I&#x27;m purchasing a health and beauty supply it will be un-expired.</li>
            <li> Works wonders with curly hair!  Would not use anything else for my hair and does not leave. Thick or stiff buildup on your hair.</li>
            <li> I was running out of my Tigi Curls Rock Amplifier and found it on amazon.  It was priced right, so I decided to purchase online instead of in a salon.  I received it promptly and didn&#x27;t miss a beat on my morning hair ritual.  I will definitely go to amazon in the future for my hair care needs.</li>
            <li> My favorite all around hair product!  I have curly, coarse hair - just a little defines without drying crisply like mousse or gel.</li>
            <li> Ill be buying these (in bulk) till the sun burns out.</li>
            <li> The best for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. My hair has never looked better. :-)</li>
            <li> This is the best curl amplifier I have used as a guy. I have wavy hair that breaks into curls using this stuff. Below is the detailed breakdown of this gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCENT&lt;br /&gt;This gel does carry a somewhat feminine scent, and it is pretty potent, but it&#x27;s not so feminine that I would recommend against guys wearing it. In fact, another guy friend of mine tried some of this gel I had in my bathroom (he has full curls) and has used it ever since. So while it&#x27;s not the best scent a guy can ask for, the benefits outweigh it, especially when considering that there aren&#x27;t really ANY curls amplifiers for guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEXTURE/APPLICATION&lt;br /&gt;The texture is smooth but sticky. It&#x27;s one of the hardest gels to get off my hands I&#x27;ve come across; I will have to wash my hands for 30 seconds rubbing them as if trying to scrape something off of them. I then usually have to use several paper towels or a towel, wash them again, and finally dry them again in order to get everything off. My aforementioned friend with long curly hair down to his shoulders only uses about a nickel sized amount of gel, but he already has full curls so he uses it more as a normal gel rather than a curl amplifier. I use about 2-3 pumps from this bottle (each is about a Quarter size each) for my short but thick wavy hair. This makes it look wet and gives me stronger curls for the entire day. The curl amplifier aspect of it can last several days though, the only downside to this being the white flakes that all dried up gels have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VALUE&lt;br /&gt;Phenomenal. After the first day of using this, I will often not need to apply it for the next few days until I shower again. I suspect that the curliness of each curl might actually curl even further in the subsequent days after the first application than in the hours after putting it on, for different reasons that I theorize. One such reason could be the weight of the curl reduces when it&#x27;s not clumped together, so each strand of hair curls easier and isn&#x27;t as bottom-weighted, which can straighten the hair out. This is what makes this product such a great value though; one applications can amplify curls for days, perhaps even a week! And for 10 bucks on Amazon, it&#x27;s a steal, especially since Salons sell the same container for double the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;It is a must buy, whether you&#x27;re a guy or a girl, if you&#x27;re looking to have curlier hair. It is especially useful for those who don&#x27;t shower every day and don&#x27;t want to hassle doing their hair every day, since it has carryover effects to subsequent days after first using. Highly recommended, highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It locks in my fine curls without making them too soft or weighing them down.</li>
            <li> I finally found a great product for the frizz of my hair curly.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The best I&#x27;ve found so far for my very naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that frizzes. I&#x27;ve tried every product out there, and while they work, this is the only product that makes my curls soft and beautiful. also, my curls stay in good shape even the next day. if there are any frizzy curls, i just wet my hair with my hand and the leftover product makes the curl bounce right back frizz free. Amazon has the best price for this product that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my naturally curly hair more manageable and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like a mousse. It&#x27;s only pure liquid no matter how much we shake it. But it&#x27;s effect on the hair is good.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and find it works well on my hair to control frizz and give definition and separation. I am currently using Redken Curvaceous Full Swirl and I don&#x27;t find it as good so I&#x27;ve ordered more of the Tigi Curls Rock Amplifier and I&#x27;ll stick with that. The only thing I noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t say Curlesque on the bottle (my previous bottles did) and I&#x27;ve heard people say that they prefer the original Tigi Curls Rock that wasn&#x27;t from the Curlesque collection. So I&#x27;m wondering if I have the previous version. Probably not as I heard they discontinued it. I can&#x27;t compare the two as I didn&#x27;t use the original one in the blue bottle but this works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but not as good as their Curvaceous</li>
            <li> I have tried the old curls rock multiple times over the years and hated it. My hair was sticky and too perfumy with the old formula. THIS NEW FORMULA IS GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mid back length hair, about medium thickness. I&#x27;m also currently pregnant so I have a ton of hair. I use a good deal - probably close to 6 pumps when all is said and done and then diffuse it to 80% dryness. My hair is bouncy, not weighed down, not sticky, smells amazing and all of my curls are well defined all day without frizz. I am absolutely in love with this product and am switching to it as my curl product!</li>
            <li> I have tried a multitude of hair products and this is the only one that works.  I kept trying to save money and use different combinations of hair products, but nothing worked as well as the Catwalk Curl Amplifier.  It is the only one that keeps my curls soft and springy and keeps the frizz down.  Nothing else works as well.  It also has a nice smell to it.  Works all night too.  I even wake up and my curls are still in pretty good shape.  A definite product to try for anyone with curly hair.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It works great on my curly hair!</li>
            <li> It really defines curls and control frizz without weighing the hair down. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else love this product</li>
            <li> I was hesitating to buy this, but read the positive reviews and decided to go for it. I am very happy that I did! This product does wonders for my medium length curly hair and a little goes a long way. Even in the rain or humidity this controls my hair and it doesnt get frizzy. When I need a &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; I just use a bit on wet hands and scrunch it through and Im good to go all day and night - love it. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thank you.  Love this product and this is a great price.</li>
            <li> This is wrongly called &#x27;Curlesque&#x27; in the description; it is actually a different product.  What arrived was &amp;#34;Catwalk by Tigi Curls Rock Amplifier&amp;#34; which is a different Tigi product to the Tigi Curlesque line of hair care.  This is misleading labelling, which is disappointing for sure.  I&#x27;m using it anyway because it&#x27;s here -- it&#x27;s okay but I don&#x27;t like that it leaves my curls  crunchy.  I try to fix this by gently scrunching my hair when it&#x27;s almost dry...that seems to break the crunchy hold of the amplifier.  I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  My daughter is biracial with SUPER CURLY hair.  This was recommended to me by the person that cuts her hair and keeps those curls from looking frizzy or dry. As long as Amazon offers,  I&#x27;ll never use anything else on her hair!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It really keeps hair curly and helps curl it too.  Use one pump and scrunch it into hair.  I have let dry naturally and have used diffuser.  Works well either way.  I always have a backup, nothing in drug store works as well.  Amazon price is great.  Much cheaper than hair salon.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. It works great on your hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it crunchy feeling. You only have to use a very small amount even for long hair and make sure you spread it evenly because if not you will have some stiff places. 😄</li>
            <li> Even though the packaging has changed I have tried many things and I continue to come back to the Curls Rock Amplifier. I have naturally curly hair and this prevents my frizz showing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. For real. When asked if I could only take one item with me to a deserted island, I seriously answered a suitcase full of this hair product. Running out of this in my house is a full on emergency.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months and the more I use it the less I like it.  I have wavy/curly normal hair and bought this based on the reviews on this site. I wish I had read the review that the formula changed to contain alcohol because this is the WORST thing that you can put on curly hair!  Wavy/Curly hair needs moisture.  Now I am searching for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy curly hair and this works great! I use two pumps for my hair (Is shoulder length but very thin). Feels sticky when going on but dry&#x27;s light with no residue.</li>
            <li> I do like this product, it makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t leave it crunchy like other curling products tend to do. The only negative thing I have to say is that be careful with how much you use. Too much will leave you with greasy hair and that is not very attractive</li>
            <li> This product is great for reducing the frizzies that I always fight due to my naturally curly hair.  After I wash my hair I work this through with my fingers and leave it.  The rest of the day I can forget about my hair, even in the humidity of Florida!  This really works.</li>
            <li> AT the recommendation of a friend with curly/frizzy hair like mine, I bought this product with high hopes...and I was not disappointed. Hair blown dry remained straight and frizz-free even in the rain. Will purchase as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have frizzy hard to manage curls and this stuff turns them into lovely little ringlets with almost no styling, just shower, towel dry and run it through your hair, though you have to be careful as it dries or the product on the back of your hair will get wiped away. comparable to mouse but lasts longer and I think it makes my hair look nicer</li>
            <li> Best styling product I&#x27;ve found for curly hair. Tames frizz and leaves curls that don&#x27;t look wet and crunchy. Also this is the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I used alot of this product.  Very good.  It amplifies your curls.  It doesn&#x27;t give you curls.  Actually my hair has a little body-no curl.  I like how it works when styling my hair.</li>
            <li> This product works okay, but it certainly is not any better than the cheaper mousse that I can get from the local store.  In fact I actually thinks it leaves more of a residue than most products that I use.  Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s the only one that boots my natural curls just the way I like them. No frizz, and they hold shape. (Weather depending)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, my hair has never looked so good.  Have not had a &amp;#34;bad hair day&amp;#34; since using it.  Will defintely continue to use.</li>
            <li> For me, this is the only product from those over the counter ones that have actually gotten my hair scrunched close to the salon style.</li>
            <li> After 26 years of product testing for my long, thick, curly hair, I&#x27;ve met my &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34;. This seriously makes my hair look like a million bucks, with little effort. I apply 3 to 4 pumps to towel dried hair and scrunch. That&#x27;s it! It is a little sticky, so I wash my hands after applying and try to be aware not to touch my hair until fully dry.</li>
            <li> * Sorry, but TIGI Catwalk Curlesque did not do anything for my wavy curls  * Now I wish I could have tried the original version especially because I did not even get on sale!</li>
            <li> I have very tight natural curls and this stuff really helps with frizzy hair and holds my curls nice all day.  Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair.  Lately it has been a pain and not wanting to curl and being frizzy, especially around the front of my face.  I have been getting so frustrated with it.  So I tried this and it has solved the hair dilemma!  My hair is now curly and frizz free - it hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years!  I used about 3 pumps, let it air dry, then slept on it.  Woke up this morning and it was a little crunchy but after scrunching it with my fingers, it is now soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! With naturally curly hair it is hard to sometimes keep it under control. The perfect companion is Curls Rock Amplifier. It separates and holds your curls throughout the entire day. I like to shower in the evening, and if I rewet this in the morning, it springs right back. My only wish is that there weren&#x27;t clumps in the cream. Sometimes those clumps of cream can stay in a glob and dry in your hair as a big flake that is difficult to get all out of your hair. Otherwise, it is a real lifesaver.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy/curly. This only does an ok job at holding the curl. I had higher hopes since it cost so much but oh well.</li>
            <li> Pro: Defines Curls  Con: Crunches&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Defrizzes  Con: Sometimes dries out hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Longlasting hold  Con: Smells odd, not bad per say but just slightly off.&lt;br /&gt;  Con: Sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a good product, as it does as it should with defining curls, yet there are definite drawbacks in texture, smell, and initial feel.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, it works, but it comes nowhere near the quality of the old TIGI curls rock.</li>
            <li> Another Catwalk Curl Collection product I have to have.  It helps with the frizzies.  I put it on and go.  I never blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Curlsrock for many years and have my sister and mother using it also. My beautician introduced me to the TIGI Catwalk products and I have used them ever since. Exceptional product! Happy customer in Houston, TX.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT .IT WAS A STEAL . I REGRET NOT PURCHASING MORE BOTTLES.ITS THE EXACT ITEM SOLD IN STORES FOR $18</li>
            <li> Finally found a product that works for my hair! This is the only product I use and it works great for my frizzy curls. Normally would take tons of different products and way too much time to style my curls but not since I tried this. Use warm water and one pump and goes on evenly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and sticky. My fiance even complimented me on how my hair looked after first time using it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff. I can&#x27;t say anything about it myself, but if she is REAL happy, then I am REAL happy :)</li>
            <li> I love this product line but, it&#x27;s okay to use for curly hair for those who like to still have the noticeable look like you do have product on your hair.  Your hair comes out really curly but not natural looking.  you can tell the product dries on your hair and leaves it stiff looking. but, it works for those who love that look.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this! It smells wonderful and is an amazing product for curly/wavy hair. I was initially unsure, because it is so thick, but once I got past the consistency, I realized how awesome this is. Where have you been all my life?!</li>
            <li> Curl creams used to have the smoothing power without the hold...this wonderful Curl Cream actually has hold and smoothing power.  I love it!  I have to switch around hair products every once in a while, and this is always in my cycle.  I put it on my hair when wet and then use a diffuser on my hair dryer to wrap the hair in air and dry it.  When done I always scrunch my hair and break the cast around the curl, creating a beautiful soft, drfined curl.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that likes to be...individual. I bought this product on the recommendation of a website for curly-haired people like me, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I use it with the leave-in conditioner, and it really holds your curls&#x27; definition well. It is very easy to get too much - a pea size amount for a decent size section is really all you need. I&#x27;ve had occasion where for some reason all my curls kind of...became uniform, but for the most part this has excellent hold and leaves my hair soft and the curls defined. I went to a concert and then slept on my hair after using this product and it was still in decent shape the next morning!&lt;br /&gt;A little more expensive than some products, but the leave-in conditioner won&#x27;t have to be replaced as often as the actual curl defining cream, and it&#x27;s definitely worth paying more. I&#x27;ll sometimes use another product if I don&#x27;t need as long lasting of an effect, so this bottle should last a bit. In my opinion, it&#x27;s definitely good to at least have on hand, even if you can&#x27;t afford to use it every single day. (Which most of us curly haired people don&#x27;t redo our hair every day anyways!)</li>
            <li> I loved this product for years, but since I no longer use silicones, I don&#x27;t use this.  If you are someone that uses silicone products, this is great!  It is good for curls and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it!</li>
            <li> Holds curls very well.</li>
            <li> So far so good!! I have extremely thick course hair and it softens and allows my curls to be curls!! I love how easy it is to use and you can&#x27;t really mess it up!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders for my very curly hair. Only one pump does this trick. I was finally able to throw out my giant bottles of hairspray after using this product. I really would recommend trying it if you have curly hair. One pump will make your hair a bit stiff, but NOTHING like hairspray.</li>
            <li> Last night I shampooed and conditioned my dry, permed, fine, color treated hair (Yikes-haha).  After it was partially dry I put some argon oil, then Curlesque Leave-in Conditioner, then this Curlesque Amplifier in my finger combed hair. After that I scrunched my hair well. Once dry it looked pretty good.  The difference in appearance from using my usual routine (argon oil, Matrix Miracle Treat Lotion Spray, and It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Silk Leave-in) was one of shine.  My hair, despite it&#x27;s many chemical treatments and dryness, always comes out very shiny with my usual treatments, but with the Curlesque products I used, the shine was diminished.  I plan to use the Curlesque products a couple more times before deciding one way or the other whether I like them. My curls did come out softly defined, but I could definitely feel product in my hair whereas with my old routine, I couldn&#x27;t feel any coating on my hair once dry.  Since I always touch up my hair once dry with a curling iron, I&#x27;m waiting to see if the Curlesque products hold my curls through humidity, wind, and sleeping on them.  I&#x27;ll update this review if these do a better job of holding my do together for a few days.</li>
            <li> This gel is great for curly hair, especially on humid summer days. It defines your curls without making your hair crunchy and wet looking. A definite must if you have curly hair.</li>
            <li> This made my curls really soft and kept them in place better than the &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; products I used to use.</li>
            <li> It is what my wife expected</li>
            <li> best thing i&#x27;ve found for my hair: keeps my natural curls together, but without any stiffness/odd textures. recommend.</li>
            <li> The thing I like most about this is the smell. Other than that, it doesn&#x27;t really tame in humidity and it leaves my hair a little stiff and not as soft as my Herbal Essence mouse.</li>
            <li> I read all the complaints???? about this amazing product. Thinking, they are all using too much, or not applying it evenly. My curls are rocking and rolling and my 17 year old son with natural curls has stolen mine....so, here I am buying one for each of us. (((SMILES)))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not know what the \\&quot;old\\&quot; CATWALK was like, or after browsing even found anything sub standard.&lt;br /&gt;If you rub it in your palms and then squeeze and scrunch your hair EVENLY, you WILL have ROCKING curls without the crunch of other stylers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shoulder length and I use exactly one single pump, and that is all I need. If your hair is longer, use one pump, scrunch and then if you really have missed the back of your head, use a tiny bit more....less is more, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair salon sells it and the bottle is exactly the same. Saving a bundle purchasing it on AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Holds all day, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down - defines every curl.  Re activates with ease, just dampen your hands and re scrunch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Product itself is good. The container I received was broken. Pump was not attached and once I put it on I had to pump the product up from the bottom. It was clearly packed this way.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my naturally curly/frizzy hair.  It calms the friz and and has a soft look and feel.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like some products do. I used Paul Mitchell conditioning mousse in the past and also enjoy that product.  I tried this product to try something different.  Great price through amazon too!</li>
            <li> This product is not the easiest to find,so I ordered two.I love it because it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin,its not sticky or greasy and really helps style your hair.a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for about 3 years. I absolutely love it! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and my curls stay for a long time. Even after I sleep on them. And they still look great!</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair that has some wavy.  I had pin curls as child but as I grew my hair was a mess.  Took too long to dry, frizzy, and unmanagable.  My hair dresser used this, and  my hair became a likable part of my body.  Granted, I had to grow my hair out to  just shy of my shoulder, but now I could finally wash, towel dry and \\&quot;Curlesque\\&quot;.  I had nice curls non frizzy, that lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this product some time before I made this review. I&#x27;ve owned and used it for a while now, and I purchased it based on its popularity and all of the glowing recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS - This stuff is tacky to the touch when you apply it and very greasy when you try to wash it off your hands or your hair. I walk around feeling like a dirty greasy mess all day, even if my hair *looks* ok. If you&#x27;re the type who likes to run your fingers through your hair - or your lover&#x27;s - forget it with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS - The stuff does work. I live in Florida; hello humidity! With my naturally wavy and frizzy hair, it&#x27;s hard to find something that holds my business together for more than a few hours. It creates tight, small scrunchy curls in my hair that last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would be fine for things like events and dinners and such. NOT for a day at work or around town. Don&#x27;t even try to sweat with this in your hair - you&#x27;ll feel gummy. It makes me feel dirty, and no product should be like that. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is really thick and creamy and a little goes a long way. My hair was so moisturize and works amazing for braidouts and twistouts. I am really glad that I purchased this and gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> The directions for its use is not included with the product.  My hair stylist recommended it . Once I get a chance to call her I will get the proper instructions. I&#x27;d recommend it just get directions for its use.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best, I have wavy hair and thanks to this styling product my waves looks naturally hairdo without looking or feeling tight or greasy. This is a very good product, truly recommended.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve been using this products for over 10 years now .... it is great for my curly hair .</li>
            <li> I have used this every day since the first time I tried it! It&#x27;s the best hair product I have ever used to tame my curly, frizzy hair and it actually holds the curls.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way! Just use a dime size in your hair and use diffuser to dry hair.  Gives you great curls with plenty of bounce.  They more use, the more weighed down your curls look.  Hair looks greasy, too, if you use too much.</li>
            <li> Good price for this item, at retail stores 17$</li>
            <li> Love!  Holds curl awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this product! it defines and enhance my natural curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;I have 3a-3b curls and frizzy hair. I use this product in combination with the leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and it works for my hair!</li>
            <li> good stuff!!  have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Best curly hair product on the market!!! if you are looking for a way to tame your tangled, frizzy, runaway curls without loosing sexy volume and bounce, then this is the product for you. only complaint is the smell. its not bad, just ... different. but its worth it. i have been using for years. you&#x27;ll love it! a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I found this product five years ago, I fell in love with it. I haven&#x27;t used anything else since then. Now that it&#x27;s harder to locate in stores, and my beauty supply stores no longer carry it, I purchase it on Amazon. Fast, free shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this gel, it smells good and make your hair looks really nice~!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using TIGI catwalk curls amplifier for years. This is the only styling product that I use on my 3b curly hair! As someone young and fresh out of college, this is budget friendly, and saves me time getting ready. It smells nice too. The only thing is that if I want to keep my hair for days, it gets harder to make the product last longer. It tends to dissolve in water quickly. When I have to reapply to tame frizz after a day or two, it adds build up to my hair. So if you want to make your hair last longer, I recommend using another product along with/ after TIGI catwalk curls rock amplifier.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Curls Rock has good hold, nice light fragrance. Can be styled so the curls are soft or crunchy.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that works for my natural curly hair.  This is the best price I can find.  It is often $14.99 plus in stores.</li>
            <li> Have very fine hair and this product does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have tried a lot of hair products in the past. This product really works the best for me!</li>
            <li> great hair gel that does teh trick everytime. it&#x27;s also $5 cheaper on amazon than in local stores. Thats a huge price difference.  I really like how i maintain my curls but my hair isn&#x27;t sticky. usually to have curly hair it is rock hard from product.</li>
            <li> I have thick fine hair that has natural half waves. It&#x27;s pretty much &amp;#34;the worst hair on the planet&amp;#34; my hairdresser likes to tell me. I am always trying new curl products when I want to have a curly hair day. I like this one because it isn&#x27;t too heavy on my hair but responds well to the diffuser. I can wear my hair wet curly or dry curly and it looks great. You only need a few tiny pumps. And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I am Puerto Rican and so I have some curly hair!! And of course it does like to frizz up I mean lets face it what curly hair doesn&#x27;t. Unless you have a great product like this. I have been using this for over a year now since they redid it and I am in love with it. I put it on my hair while it&#x27;s damp along with my mousse and just defuse it with my dryer and it comes out great. Not crunchy at all, if yours is coming out that way then you are putting way too much stuff in it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time as promised.  Great product, only product that works on my loose spiral hair (used to have tight spirals but not after pregnancies). Without it my hair looks damaged and frizzy and will not curl. Doesn&#x27;t require too much work or products beyond the this product. I use 1-2 pumps throughout my whole hair, let product sit in my damp hair for about 10 minutes scrunched on top of my head with a clip to absorb, then I lightly spray with Aussie Sprunch Spray (pump Hair Spray), then diffuse with diffuser/blowdryer.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it helps my curly hair have a little more curl and it calms the frizz and I don&#x27;t have to use a conditioner as often. In between washing I just wet it slightly with a spray of water to freshen it up. I usually wash my hair every other day. The price is quite a bit lower through Amazon than the price in a salon.</li>
            <li> Love it. I Use it regularly and it keeps my curls in place and my frizz away.  I buy ahead so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Sorry it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Left my hair very dull!</li>
            <li> i love it and reordered it</li>
            <li> I love this product is!!! Not sure what I would do with out it now!! My hair is curly and when I used to use gel notice I was loosing my hair and it was very dry and damage!! After using this product for 3 month I will not change or go back!!! My hair is healthy and I only use 5 pumps on all my hair and if have a lot!!! I love my hair and I get lost of compliments!! 😊😊😊</li>
            <li> I can get this so much cheaper on Amazon than I can at my local salon. I love it for my permed hair!!!!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t a winner for me.  Product smelled a bit on the off side so I&#x27;m not sure how fresh it was?  Also, I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s medium in texture and has a good wave but not really a curl.  I&#x27;m always hoping a product will amp up the natural curl and so far nothing really seems to do that.  This product did not, but then again, I haven&#x27;t found a product that does so I can&#x27;t fault this too much!  I gave it three stars because it does glide through wet hair very well, and when I applied it to my dry hair while it was curled, it did give some decent definition without stiffness.</li>
            <li> makes your hair very &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;  brings out curl and body and gets rid of frizz. but i end up squeezing out that crusty-ness all day...</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product! Helps me to manage and control the curls...especially on humid days.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I dearly wish I were one of those people raving about this product , but unfortunately for me, I&#x27;m not.  I have extremely thick, wavy hair.  This product did not even hold a curl for me.  The portions of my hair to which it was applied looked sticky and dull.  I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff been using it for years, little goes long way!</li>
            <li> I have always had very dry natural curly hair.  This product is awesome.  My curls are well defined and hold in place until my next wash.  This product is a must have.  My frizzy curls are tamed and under control.  I feel very strongly that you will like this item.  I only have to use a very small amount of this product for great result.  Make sure you only use a small amount.  I use a quarter size.</li>
            <li> The frizz is still there and it makes my hair look sort of dirty if I don&#x27;t wash it daily. My hair is not curly, I have think medium wavy hair. The smell is very light and the shipment came fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li> My curls look amazing with this product.  I use an oil and then use the Curls Rock to finish.  Don&#x27;t use big gobs of it as it will make your curls crunch, but a small amount will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go out without Catwalk. My long silver wavy hair turns into ringlets, and I get compliments all day/ night long.</li>
            <li> Too sticky to my liking</li>
            <li> Best curling product I&#x27;ve used so far. Comparable to Curl Envy but helps maximize the curl in my wavy hair better without leaving hair crunchy. Can also restyle the next day with some water and a little more product. Worth the few extra dollars compared to some other curling products.</li>
            <li> I have been trying every product I could find to get these results!  I read about this crème in an article and it is fabulous!  I have naturally curly/wavy hair.  My sister says it looks like an 80&#x27;s perm!  With the wrong product, it looks like frizz and there are many wrong products for my hair.  I am usually looking for an elastic by mid-day.  This stuff is WONDERFUL!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product; haven&#x27;t found a lower price anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps her frizzy hair in check.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I think they have stopped manufacturing this, though.  Which is why I had to buy it online.</li>
            <li> Truly impressive product for curly hair.  Lifts and gives your hair volume when you leave your hair curly.  Another great product purchased on line.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me b/c I have curly hair.  The consistency is very slick, doesn&#x27;t go on your hair well.  Once you get it in your hair though it has a heavy feeling.  I didn&#x27;t use that much.  It leaves you feeling like you have product on your hair, which is what I try to avoid. It did make my curls look ok, just weighed them down a bit though.</li>
            <li> Perfect curl amplifier! A must have if you have curly hair 😉</li>
            <li> Locks curls in perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it was delivered promptly, however the dates indicate the product was expired, it would have been good to know that up front!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Wife is saying that the product is not the same since they changed the packaging and ingredients.  She has extremely curly hair and is complaining that it \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t hold the way it used to\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is great for my curly hair and I sure wish it came in a bigger container so I won&#x27;t have to buy it so often.  I would think they could make a bigger container so I could get it a better price by buying bulk?</li>
            <li> Love this product. Does exactly what I want. The price I can get it from Amazon is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have tried literally dozens of hair styling treatments. This one is awesome!  It holds my curls in place without ever being stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> best product ever for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> Just what I want to get curls without frizz.  If it is a little stiff, but fluff it out with your fingers after hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I have used many products in the past; however, for the last three years I have been using this product. It is the best product for curly hair. Your curls stay soft while giving a look that you have used a mousse. It also stopped my split ends. My son, who has curly hair, just starting using it as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and buy it at least three botles at a time!  It smells fantastic and is very creamy-- feels like you are really putting in something that will tame the frizz!  Hair comes out silky yet curl is defined and not frizzy.  I dread the day when they discontinue the product and I have to find something new!</li>
            <li> I hate having anything sticky in my hair. This was recommended to me by a hair stylist who was convinced I should wear my hair curly all the time- which I don&#x27;t really like doing- I prefer soft curs or waves. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try for soft curls. This did enhance my curls but felt heavy and sticky and I only used a very little bit. I hate that I spent the money to use it a couple times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  only  used this product twice and I like the way it leaves my curls looking soft. It was recommended by my gym instructor who&#x27;s hair obviously looked so soft and bouncy that I had to ask her where she bought this product.</li>
            <li> It is sticky and smell when you apply. I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell at all.Please stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my unruly curly hair.  It reduces frizz and has great hold.  A word of caution - a little goes a long way, if you use too much your hair will look wet and stiff.  Great smell too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  Works better than mousse and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like gel.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE and will continue to use as long as price remains reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Oiudad products I was using and found this one.  After reading many&lt;br /&gt;reviews on various websites, I found this.  Love it!  I have to say that it seems to weigh down my curls a bit, but it&#x27;s left them&lt;br /&gt;looking like beachy waves and I&#x27;m thrilled about it!</li>
            <li> This product I&#x27;d terrible. It&#x27;s sticky, like school glue, and makes your hair as hard as a rock. Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> Best product ever for curly, frizzy curls!</li>
            <li> it is the best for curly hair</li>
            <li> My go to curl cr&amp;egrave;me. Never leaves my hair gunky and helps to tame frizz. Only complaint is that some bottles don&#x27;t smell too good but I suppose it depends on who you buy it from. Other than that its awesome.</li>
            <li> This order was lost in transit so I cant give the product any review. I can, however give a 5 star rating for Amazon&#x27;s quickness at refunding my money. They refunded my money the next day!  Needless to say I was ready for a fight because that seems to be the status quo  for most companies I have dealt with in the past, so a &amp;#34;Thumbs Up!&amp;#34; to Amazon for resolving the problem.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  Great product, not heavy nor drying.</li>
            <li> The stylist at the salon used this product on my hair to give my curls more definition, which the product did beautifully.  Unfortunately, within about ten minutes of leaving the salon, I started to develop severely itchy/painful eyes and my scalp and face began to itch anywhere my hair touched it.  Having had this issue with other products, I left the store I was shopping in, went home and washed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knew that this product would NOT come out of my hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice when I first wet my hair that it was sticky and felt strange...and not the way it does after using spray or mousse.  This should have been a clue that this wasn&#x27;t any normal hair product.  Anyway, I washed my hair seven times over the next 18 hours, including using clarifying shampoo twice (at the suggestion of the stylist, who was very nice and apologetic, and really didn&#x27;t know this product would cause so many issues).  It was Paul Mitchell clarifying shampoo.  This decreased the smell, but did not eliminate it.  I even tried treating it like an hair odor issue and used vinegar rinses on my hair...once again, decreased the smell but did NOT get rid of it.  I even treated my hair with coconut oil because all this shampooing left it so crispy my conditioner wouldn&#x27;t even touch it...it helped re-moisturize my hair and skin and it actually cut the smell down, but it didn&#x27;t get rid of it.  Two days later, my head still smells and my face, scalp and eyes still itch.  I have little bumpy rashes on my face anywhere my hair hits.  It&#x27;s like this product embedded itself into my hair shaft!  Do NOT use this product if you are an even-remotely allergic person.  IT DOES NOT COME OUT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do. Brings out the curls, light hold, doesn&#x27;t weigh my medium-length hair down. Doesn&#x27;t affect color or shine except in a positive way. Also, keeps my hair from having a flyaway look. I&#x27;ve purchased this 3 times now and will again.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT, VERY MUCH I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, TO A PERSON THAT HAS CURLY HAIR, IT MAKES YOUR CURLS VERY NICE AND SHINE.</li>
            <li> First time I tried it. It&#x27;s a good product, you only need a small amount to make it work, if you combine it with a little bit of water.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years, they changed the packaging but not the formula. If you have curly hair this and a defrizzer are all you need.</li>
            <li> Holds my curls in place with a small amount of firmness, yet still soft.  Elongates the curls slightly too.</li>
            <li> This stuff changed my life! Every time my hair is wet,mi put some of this on. It defines the curls, holds the frizz down. If you don&#x27;t like the stiffness, just crunch when dry. Hint for curly heads.... Don&#x27;t  touch your hair hair when it&#x27;s dry! You&#x27;ll be happier with it.</li>
            <li> After having a product of mine discontinued. I was in search of a new product. I tried everything from cheap to expensive. Nothing, then I ran into a woman at work with nice curls she happened to also be a part time hairdresser. She advised me to me the curlesgue amplifier with paul mitchell skinny serum and it is great. Alone it is just like any other cream but combined it does my curls well. I have extremely thick heavy duty curls.Also very good price on Amazon I can get it on sale at ulta but I have to use a coupon and wait for the buy two get one free to get this price.</li>
            <li> Good product for curly hair but I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and I love this product.  It defines my curls without leaving my hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.  It smells great and lasts a long time.  Buying through Amazon saved me some $$ over buying it at a salon like I have done in the past.</li>
            <li> TIGI is always perfect. It makes my hair smooth and elastic&lt;br /&gt;I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;But the shipping is really bad, cost more than 1 week to arrive. And the shipping tracking information is not correct.</li>
            <li> Really gives me great curls!  Especially when I air dry my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but a little goes a long way! This product can be a bit sticky, beware of using too much.</li>
            <li> goes on too sticky and extremely hard to wash off your hair and hands!</li>
            <li> Love this product for my long, thick, curly hair. This is the only product I need; It manages frizz, without being crunchy. It is not the same as the old blue bottle catwalk, but I&#x27;m ok with that because I hated that one. I use this almost everyday and go through about a bottle a month.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use this when I curl or even when I just blow dry my hair.  I only apply a pea-size amount so that my hair won&#x27;t be crunchy.  I apply it either on wet or dry hair, and it works every time. The weather is quite cold and windy now here, and my hair tends to be frizzy when it&#x27;s cold. However, my hair was nice and soft and much, much less frizzy. My curls stayed longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the smell. It kinda smells like men&#x27;s perfume or something; a bit too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, but it does tend to leave your hair a little crunchy, which is what i was trying to avoid. Still use it in the summer. With the humidity the crunch isn&#x27;t so bad and it keeps my hair from getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> Great! A little goes a long way! love this product. Too much makes my hair itch. But used sparingly makes for nice defined curls</li>
            <li> Wow! Glad to see i&#x27;m not alone in my feelings on the &amp;#34;revamping&amp;#34; of this product! Ditto to all previous comments here- the frizz, the goo, the heavy. I was also a very loyal Curls Rock fan because it was amazing! Not only is Curlesque line (shampoo, conditioner, &amp; amplifier) not the same amazing product, it is far more expensive. What a shame. I hope TIGI reads these comments and just puts it back. If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it!!</li>
            <li> Gives curl, but the cream is very sticky - can also get crunchy if too much is used.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle product but definitely helped my hair from getting crazy and super frizzy, the product itself looks like elmers glue, so I can see how one of the other reviews said it caused a flaking dandruff look,I have not had this issue so far</li>
            <li> This is great for wavy/curly hair. It gives a soft hold.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have use it for a long time and works great in my curly hair what I love the most is when I shampoo my hair my hair feels silky soft not like other products that leave your hair rough after you wash it. I recommend this product to anyone that has curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for defining my curls. It takes my frizzy hair and defines it into beautiful ringlets. I was so happy to find this product at Amazon and it was a very good price and delivery was extremely quick.  It is everything that you said it would be. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have the curliest hair of anyone I have ever seen.  I keep coming back to curls rock because it is the only thing that tames frizz and creates perfect curls without getting super crunchy.  I have tried a million products, this is by far my favorite.  A little expensive but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy hair. If this product is used right it really gives my hair great texture. I also suggest putting a small amount in damp hair at night and twisting it up. This is the best method for &#x27;no heat curls&#x27; I have tried so far. The product help keeps the curl in your hair all day and keeps them more defined.</li>
            <li> I did like this product, but found it too &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; and stiff which is not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Smell was so strong I never even used it. If you&#x27;re not into strong scents, buy another product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for curly hair I&#x27;ve found! Other products leave my curls frizzy or limp but this product holds up every time. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I love that it&#x27;s so much cheaper here than in my local store. Thanks!</li>
            <li> love this stuff!  have bought several over the years and find it&#x27;s the right amount of light hold, without being sticky or goopy.  I&#x27;ve tried other products but they end up sitting in my cabinet as I just like this one best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 years now. It takes a bit of getting used to in terms of how much to use (hint, a tiny tiny amount), but it makes my curls look great! I get compliments constantly. Just be sure that if you&#x27;re using it with a greasy shampoo (like coconut hibiscus) to use a clarifying shampoo every week or so to prevent against buildup.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it&#x27;s so much better than getting at the commercial stores.  Thanks for selling this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have very coarse frizzy hair.  My hair looks great when it&#x27;s wet, but as soon as it dries the frizz ruins the curl.  That is, until I tried Curls Rock.  I&#x27;ve tried TONS of products, but nothing makes my hair&#x27;s natural curl come out like this product does.  The only downfall is it is a little crunchy, but if used correctly won&#x27;t make your hair look wet. Try this product!</li>
            <li> This works awesome on my dry course curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this curly hair product for years and it it&#x27;s great for thick wavy to very curly hair.  It&#x27;s much cheaper on amazon for about $11 vs. $16 in drugstores.</li>
            <li> Yes, my curly-haired compadres, THIS is the shizz. This is the only thing that controls my hair and helps it stay clumped together in natural sort of way without also leaving it crispy or stringy. Now, if you add too much, or you add it to dry hair, it WILL definitely be crispy (and possibly stringy if you shake your hair) so don&#x27;t do that. Just a little dab, while your hair is still wet. Scrunch, scrunch, scrunch, go to bed. Wake up -- perfect curls.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery  Great Product</li>
            <li> Great product and serious seller! Fully recommended!!</li>
            <li> I threw it out after about six uses. I have wavy, thick hair and found this product just took a nap on my head - weighed down and goopy.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for curly hair.  I hope they never stop making this...although at some point years ago&lt;br /&gt;they must have changed their formula, as it is a little more drying than it used to be...but it is still&lt;br /&gt;better at controlling my curls and frizz than anything else.</li>
            <li> good stuff, love the way it smells and the hold i get from the product</li>
            <li> At 43 years old, I have tried every curly hair product in the past 30 years. This is one of the best I have found. I put a decent amount in my hair right after showering, run my fingers through, and go. The curls are separated and not frizzy (except in really humid/rainy weather), but yet, not too stiff. Works quite well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years and don&#x27;t notice a difference with the new version. This stuff is perfect (except for the price). It&#x27;s thick and smells good. I have long naturally curly hair and it works way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. And I&#x27;ve tried alot! The best conditioner I&#x27;ve found is [[ASIN:B002CM73AY Sexy Hair Curly Sexy Hair Moisturizing Conditioner Unisex, 33.8 Ounce]]. It&#x27;s costly too but worth it.</li>
            <li> Have very long curly hair and it keeps it under control, to where it&#x27;s not fly away.  But doesn&#x27;t cake on my scalp.</li>
            <li> As far as the alcohol in ingredient list: Panthenol is a humectant, emollient and moisturizer. It binds to the hair shaft readily and is a frequent component of shampoos and hair conditioners (in concentrations of 0.1-1%). It coats the hair and seals its surface[citation needed], lubricating the hair shaft and making strands appear shiny. (Wikipedia).  There is also an interesting article at [...]Might shine some different perspectives on the matter. Bottom line, do your own research and decide what is \\&quot;safe\\&quot; for your hair.    I never tried the previous version of this product, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I am very pleased with the way this product is able to minimize frizz, define and hold my curls.  I have long (mid back), 3b thick curly hair...lots of it! I like the creamy texture and I believe this contributes to the the frizz being minimized because it clings to the hair shaft.  I somewhat follow the \\&quot;curly girl\\&quot; method and I use devacurl products or sulfate free shampoos, etc.    Although I think this product has great hold, I have a routine that gets my hair to look exactly like I want.  I am crazy about my hair, every ringlet has to look nice so, after I wash my hair, I use a leave in conditioner like Mixed Chicks (anyone can use, I am Latina not mixed), or Shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie, I finish with oil, like argan oil, jojoba oil, etc. Then I apply this product evenly throughout.  I somewhat allow to air dry, usually don&#x27;t have a lot of time so I spray a heat protectant and diffuse with my head flipped over. No crunchy hair! Make sure you don&#x27;t use tons and if you do, try scrunching it with oil to reduce crunchiness.    This lasts me 3-4 days! I just wet my hair each day and it revives my curls.  I sleep with my hair in a high pony tail.  There are soooo many products and methods you can use, and sadly, there is no one method fits all approach.  Trial and error is the only way to know what your hair likes and how you would like your curls to look.  Don&#x27;t give up, curly hair is FABULOUS!!</li>
            <li> I bought this with hesitation because I usually go to the salon for my hair products.  I am so glad I tried this because first off it was cheaper than the curl lock I was buying and second, this product does a better job than the other one I was buying.  I can mist my hair the next day and it looks like I just did my hair.  It rejuvenates with a little water!  I have now set this up to come every month seeing that 4 of us are using it!  Next I will try the shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have course curly hair and in all my years of looking for a product that smooth&#x27;s and holds my curls with out the stiff feeling I FOUND THIS ONE!</li>
            <li> This is great for curly hair in dry or humid climates.  It is a tiny bit crunchy, but not bad at all. The day after you wash it&#x27;s soft again. Great hold.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly thick hair. I wear it in a pixie style. This product is the best I&#x27;ve tried in making my hair separate, and soft. I can touch it after it dries and it doesn&#x27;t result in poofy, old lady hair. Since I&#x27;m 50 I want to look updated not old!this product works better in drier climates but works almost as good in humid.</li>
