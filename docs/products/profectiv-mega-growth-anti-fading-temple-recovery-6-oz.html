            <li>I love this product, but I am giving it four stars because when I use it during the day, it shows a white films when I go out in the sun.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several more but not from amazon.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works if used as directed and comes in a very large jar.</li>

            <li>This product is amazing my edges are thick and full now.</li>
            <li>Love this product, just be careful not to use too much.  </li>
            <li>and i appy it to my edges and its really greasy it</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t see any growth.  </li>
            <li>and i really havent seen any change in the hair</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping</li>
            <li>I really like the way it feels too.</li>
            <li>And my edges have been growing very well from this product too.</li>
            <li>My edges are growing back quickly and it even doubles as</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Before i would have to use gel to hold my edges because my natural hair is very curly, now I just apply this product</li>
            <li>You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this product</li>
            <li>It is definitely making my edges grow and worth the money.</li>

            <li>so far i had this for 2 days</li>
            <li>I was almost completely bald at the edges, so I couldn&#x27;t even rock braids.</li>
            <li>Smells divine, leaves hair silky, soft and luscious.</li>
            <li>My hairline is growing slowly but, surely.</li>
            <li>Actually getting better results with plain shea butter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricier than I remember (many hair care prices in Amazon are), but a little goes a long way too, and I&#x27;m not mad about it.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and you don&#x27;t really need to apply a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it and can see new hair beginning to grow back in the temple arrea.  </li>
            <li>I had my doubts at first like with any other product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It has successfully grown my hair back several times. It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product really works or not.  I think I need to use it for a longer period of time.  I only put it on my edges.  Been using it for about 2 months on and off and do not see a huge difference but it keeps my edges moisturized.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have thinning edges due to stress. This product worked quickly and efficiently. It&#x27;s greasy when you apply but that goes away fairly fast and the smell is great!</li>
            <li> It actually is working.. I had my doubts at first like with any other product. But my edges are actually growing and getting fuller..Thank u.  Will definitely purchase again plus their other products</li>
            <li> Bought this product for thinning edges and breakage at the crown after pregnancy. Slowly but surely it has worked!!! I will purchase this product again and continue to use.</li>
            <li> Yes this stuff works!!!  Absolutely amazing!!!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It smells really good and a small amount goes a long way. I have actually been using it on all of my hair especially the edges and ends. I have also been using this with Right on Activator/Moisturizer, Moroccan Argan Oil and Mist Moisturizer. My hair is now soft, moisturized and I can actually run my fingers through it. I have gotten good results using it once a day however, instructions suggest using it twice a day. My hair hasn&#x27;t felt or looked this good in a year. I am so happy that I finally found something that works for my 4B Natural Hair. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff,, for year my hair wouldnt grown now by using this i edges have somwhat grew enough to braid</li>
            <li> This stuff really works if used as directed and comes in a very large jar. You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this product</li>
            <li> I gave this only three stars because the product was not as described. I was expecting the anti-thinning cream and received the anti-fading cream instead  (on both orders ). Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve used this product prior to ordering, and it works great! But I don&#x27;t recommend using this seller because he or she did not resolve the problem or even attempt to communicate.</li>
            <li> I saw the difference right away, I&#x27;ll search anywhere for my replacements! My hair is thin, and I see the fullness and growth!</li>
            <li> Smell great, but I can say its a good hair oil, haven&#x27;t seen no improvement,  but I will continue use for smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just one week and I am seeing improvement of my hair. Before i would have to use gel to hold my edges because my natural hair is very curly, now I just apply this product and I&#x27;m good to go. Thanks profectiv!</li>
            <li> It is definitely making my edges grow and worth the money. It&#x27;s a lot, so it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> I had used this product in the past, and had some really good results.  I have some fragile edges, and after wearing my hair in braids, needed to regrow my temples out.  So far, I am seeing results.  It&#x27;s not going to grow them out overnight, but it is helping.  It isn&#x27;t heavy and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> so far i had this for 2 days and i appy it to my edges and its really greasy it it even drips. i will wait for 2 weeks to see if i see any new results</li>
            <li> A little background...&lt;br /&gt;African-American&lt;br /&gt;Natural Hair (3a/b)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I broke my edges off by wearing my hair up in a bun without sleeping with a satin scarf for consecutive nights. So bad to the point I had to use gel and bobby pins to do any kind of up do or my edges would make an appearance like hello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this years ago and remembered it worked well and decided to give it a shot again. Yes yes yes...it works ya&#x27;ll! My edges are growing back quickly and it even doubles as a sealant like others have said. It can get a little oily of you use too much, so careful. It&#x27;s a little pricier than I remember (many hair care prices in Amazon are), but a little goes a long way too, and I&#x27;m not mad about it. It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> After several years of relaxing my hair, I stopped almost two years ago after my hair started to fall out . I was almost completely bald at the edges, so I couldn&#x27;t even rock braids. I could only use weave on extensions since they covered the front. Last November, I picked this up at a black hair products store in Leicester and started to apply it to my edges night and morning. Gradually my braider got some hair to braid at the edges ( I loosen the edges of braids after two weeks to prevent damage). Just recently my mother pointed out that my hairline is growing and &#x27;would soon come down to my brows). Then I remembered, this product is supposed to help my temples recover. It&#x27;s a good product, simple and it&#x27;s working. I still wouldn&#x27;t braid my edges for long though, cos while the hair is growing out  its still weak. I love this product, but I am giving it four stars because when I use it during the day, it shows a white films when I go out in the sun.( or maybe I did not rub it in well the few times I have noticed that). Definitely would buy again, but I see this jar lasting another five months as a little goes a long way, I only use it on my edges and hairline though. Pleasant fragrance too.</li>
            <li> Did not get the growth for the temple it is a good moisturizer for dry hair but it is kinda heavy for that</li>
            <li> I have used Growth n Healing since about 2006 -It is the only hair product I know of that actually delivers on all the promises. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Smells divine, leaves hair silky, soft and luscious. Great product!  can even use for lotion on dry legs/feet, I&#x27;m serious!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. too many chemicals for my kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li> I’ve only been using this product for a few weeks, and the hair around my temple is filling in, and is much thicker</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see any growth.  Actually getting better results with plain shea butter.</li>
            <li> I got this  in a speedy amount of time and i really havent seen any change in the hair but it was with the try.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a four because of often i have to apply and it tends to get my edges a little hard. But otherwise it is great and i do see results.</li>
            <li> Love this product, just be careful not to use too much.  Will make hair limp.  Wish it was unscented.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> received this product and it was just as described.  I&#x27;ve been using it and can see new hair beginning to grow back in the temple arrea.  Thanks for the fast shipping I will shop with you again soon.</li>
            <li> Tight braids damaged hair around temples.  I have been using this item for several weeks and have already regained some hair lost at the temple.  See weekly improvements.  I have ordered several more but not from amazon.  You can find great deals and cheaper prices for products made by this company on the web.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly satisfied with this product. I have been trying to grow my hair on the front right side of my head after burning my hair, accidentally, for about 4 years now. After couple weeks I can see the big difference. My hair is finally growing back! I have tried other products and some started to grow my hair but then it falls out and even castor oil did the same thing...hmm  I feel like marketing this product for them for free or something lol...  It says use twice a day but i only use it in the morning.</li>
            <li> Great pricing, a wonderful product. Good pricing and I can see my edges growing out as described in the product description.</li>
            <li> Effective product and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Had It For Two Weeks,Haven&#x27;t Seen A Difference Yet!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing on my hair, whether it&#x27;s been relaxed or natural. I really like the way it feels too. It&#x27;s lightweight, yet holds my edges and ends nicely. And there is absolutely no build-up. I&#x27;ve never found a styling product this good. Ever.  I&#x27;m sad I didn&#x27;t find this sooner. I plan to stock up. But I&#x27;ve had my jar for quite a while. It lasts a long time and you don&#x27;t really need to apply a lot. I can&#x27;t wait to use this in the summertime! And my edges have been growing very well from this product too.</li>
            <li> Profectiv is a very good brand.This product works! Filled in a quarter size bald spot. My hairline is growing slowly but, surely. You don&#x27;t need a lot. This product is WAYYYYY better than Doo Gro Medicated Hair Vitalizer. Profectiv don&#x27;t stop making this product!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing my edges are thick and full now.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair - and since using this product my hair is thickening and growing.  Can&#x27;t say enough.  I highly recommend.</li>
