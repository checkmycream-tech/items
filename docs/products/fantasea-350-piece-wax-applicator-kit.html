            <li>Tons of wooden sticks in different sizes - great quality!</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m ready to wax, I pull the wax pot out and my handy plastic case, and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>I had to keep them in the inner plastic lining initially, so they could spill over into spaces but still a great find!</li>

            <li>I dont know why i waited so long to snag such a great deal!!</li>
            <li>Made very well!!</li>
            <li>a ton of sticks different sizes for all waxing needs with a handy container.</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice quality plastic container that can later on be reused .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth getting it with the Melting Pot stripless wax kit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>really nice having the different sizes as well</li>
            <li>Nice case and I like the different sizes.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched back to my old brand, but I used these until they were gone, and they were good quality and perfectly adequate.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these because they are super easy to use, they don&#x27;t break if you put too much wax on them as I did in the beginning.</li>
            <li>There are three varying sizes of sticks which is great, since sometimes you need the smaller ones for eyebrows or upper lip.</li>
            <li>There are so many it was well worth the low cost.</li>
            <li>Enough to last for years at a great price.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the medium sized sticks are a bit too many to fit in the side compartment so it doesn&#x27;t close all the way at first, but of course once you use enough it&#x27;ll close just fine.  </li>
            <li>They are very smooth and you get 3 different sizes.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price as well.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a lot to say about wax applicators for wax removal other than the size variety is good and they package them very well to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li>Love the different sizes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did, I love the applicators, there are several different lengths and widths in this kit.</li>
            <li>I love how the box has 3 compartments for different sizes.</li>
            <li>The smaller ones work better if your a beginner I use for any part of my body to apply the wax.</li>
            <li>Exactly as you see in picture, not all fits in the container</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>I love having multiple sizes of applicators.</li>
            <li>exactly as they had described.  </li>
            <li>It all fits well and as I run low on sticks, I just pull some more out and add.</li>
            <li>I would recommend but the price was higher than should have been.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I love all that this comes with so many sticks and in several different sizes.</li>
            <li>x 2.5&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so you really get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I love the 3 different sizes that the applicators came in.</li>
            <li>so called wax applicators are nothing more than different sized popsicle sticks.</li>
            <li>Shipping was FAST!</li>
            <li>I love the different sizes of applicators and that the container has separate compartments for them.</li>
            <li>The sticks are great and are lasting a long time too, theres</li>
            <li>More than enough applicators</li>
            <li>great price, will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>I liked the box too, because I can put other sticks in it when I run out or use it for something else.</li>
            <li>Decent quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Gives you a lot of different sizes to choose from good for different parts of the body.</li>
            <li>The product arrive  quickly , thanks, looking good, some of this applicator is defective:(, but is ok, for the price:)))</li>
            <li>The three different sizes make it so easy to do any area.</li>
            <li>the compartments that are built in makes it easy to separate your different sized utensils.</li>
            <li>But for the price, these are pretty cheap per applicator price, and you get them in three different sizes.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to keep them separate and know you&#x27;re getting the size you want and need while in the middle of a service.</li>
            <li>Large amount.</li>
            <li>My kit arrived on time, and it was exactly as I expected it to be :) thanks</li>
            <li>The storage container is very convenient.</li>
            <li>They arrived fast and work really well for waxing.</li>
            <li>These wooden wax applicators are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I really like this applicator box.</li>
            <li>So much that I bought 2...one for my treatment room and one for home use.</li>
            <li>Thanks......</li>
            <li>However, most of the sticks were not straight.</li>
            <li>I am save so much money on waxing.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Thanks so much to the seller .</li>
            <li>The applicators all work very well.</li>
            <li>3 Sizes, and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>They are rough and many of them have splinters sticking out.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I just really wanted the case...</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t really used them yet...</li>
            <li>The box is really something.</li>
            <li>Salon wax sticks, not different than you&#x27;d find in any salon, but the container to hold the sticks is very useful for storage.  </li>
            <li>The small ones are great for brows and upper lip.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product mainly for the container.</li>
            <li>The plastic container the sticks came housed in is made of solid compartmental construction, and the wooden sticks themselves are of various shapes and sizes and good quality, however I would like to point out that there are far more smaller sticks than larger ones included in this particular set.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Probable more than I will use in a few years.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this set, should last me a long time.</li>
            <li>All the sizes are just right for all different areas.  </li>
            <li>I usually use a different brand of applicator, but the container that these come in is perfect for organizing large, medium and small applicators.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to home waxing</li>
            <li>Very professional presentation.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised!</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it&#x27;s a pretty bulky set (something like 9&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The sticks are pretty solid, too, haven&#x27;t yet had an issue where they break or splinter like using them.</li>
            <li>This cost half the price of Satin Smooth Stick.</li>
            <li>Contains a total of 350 wax applicator sticks, 150 eyebrow, 100 medium and 100 large applicator sticks included.</li>
            <li>but I just wish it wouldn&#x27;t remove completely from the case.</li>
            <li>The different sizes is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Soft edges.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and doesnt feel \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; at all considering they are just wooden sticks.</li>
            <li>Contains every size needed for professional waxing.</li>
            <li>WOW what a variety too choose from👍</li>
            <li>Sizes include those for waxing large parts (bikini, legs), medium parts (armpits) and small detailed parts (such as eyebrows)</li>
            <li>No more fumbling to open ziplick baggies for more sticks with waxy glove hands.</li>
            <li>Although, I wish there were more bigger applicators rather then small ones.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>They are thicker than some of the other applicators that come with some waxes and seem to hold up pretty well for reuse.</li>
            <li>The smaller sticks are pretty thick and kind of hard to use on the lower sections of the eye brow</li>
            <li>Actual tongue depressors, adult size and infant size, feel stronger.</li>
            <li>They were kind of bent, making it difficult to put wax on.</li>
            <li>All in all a good product for waxing, may be a little too expensive for craft projects</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s crazy never had such fast free shipping .</li>

            <li> I highly recommend these because they are super easy to use, they don&#x27;t break if you put too much wax on them as I did in the beginning.</li>
            <li> There are three varying sizes of sticks which is great, since sometimes you need the smaller ones for eyebrows or upper lip.</li>
            <li> There are so many it was well worth the low cost.</li>
            <li> Enough to last for years at a great price.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the medium sized sticks are a bit too many to fit in the side compartment so it doesn&#x27;t close all the way at first, but of course once you use enough it&#x27;ll close just fine.  </li>
            <li> They are very smooth and you get 3 different sizes.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price as well.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a lot to say about wax applicators for wax removal other than the size variety is good and they package them very well to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> Love the different sizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did, I love the applicators, there are several different lengths and widths in this kit.</li>
            <li> I love how the box has 3 compartments for different sizes.</li>
            <li> The smaller ones work better if your a beginner I use for any part of my body to apply the wax.</li>
            <li> Exactly as you see in picture, not all fits in the container</li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> I love having multiple sizes of applicators.</li>
            <li> exactly as they had described.  </li>
            <li> It all fits well and as I run low on sticks, I just pull some more out and add.</li>
            <li> I would recommend but the price was higher than should have been.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I love all that this comes with so many sticks and in several different sizes.</li>
            <li> x 2.5&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> so you really get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I love the 3 different sizes that the applicators came in.</li>
            <li> so called wax applicators are nothing more than different sized popsicle sticks.</li>
            <li> Shipping was FAST!</li>
            <li> I love the different sizes of applicators and that the container has separate compartments for them.</li>
            <li> The sticks are great and are lasting a long time too, theres</li>
            <li> More than enough applicators</li>
            <li> great price, will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I liked the box too, because I can put other sticks in it when I run out or use it for something else.</li>
            <li> Decent quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Gives you a lot of different sizes to choose from good for different parts of the body.</li>
            <li> The product arrive  quickly , thanks, looking good, some of this applicator is defective:(, but is ok, for the price:)))</li>
            <li> The three different sizes make it so easy to do any area.</li>
            <li> the compartments that are built in makes it easy to separate your different sized utensils.</li>
            <li> But for the price, these are pretty cheap per applicator price, and you get them in three different sizes.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to keep them separate and know you&#x27;re getting the size you want and need while in the middle of a service.</li>
            <li> Large amount.</li>
            <li> My kit arrived on time, and it was exactly as I expected it to be :) thanks</li>
            <li> The storage container is very convenient.</li>
            <li> They arrived fast and work really well for waxing.</li>
            <li> These wooden wax applicators are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I really like this applicator box.</li>
            <li> So much that I bought 2...one for my treatment room and one for home use.</li>
            <li> Thanks......</li>
            <li> However, most of the sticks were not straight.</li>
            <li> I am save so much money on waxing.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Thanks so much to the seller .</li>
            <li> The applicators all work very well.</li>
            <li> 3 Sizes, and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> They are rough and many of them have splinters sticking out.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I just really wanted the case...</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really used them yet...</li>
            <li> The box is really something.</li>
            <li> Salon wax sticks, not different than you&#x27;d find in any salon, but the container to hold the sticks is very useful for storage.  </li>
            <li> The small ones are great for brows and upper lip.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product mainly for the container.</li>
            <li> The plastic container the sticks came housed in is made of solid compartmental construction, and the wooden sticks themselves are of various shapes and sizes and good quality, however I would like to point out that there are far more smaller sticks than larger ones included in this particular set.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Probable more than I will use in a few years.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this set, should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> All the sizes are just right for all different areas.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a different brand of applicator, but the container that these come in is perfect for organizing large, medium and small applicators.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to home waxing</li>
            <li> Very professional presentation.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised!</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it&#x27;s a pretty bulky set (something like 9&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The sticks are pretty solid, too, haven&#x27;t yet had an issue where they break or splinter like using them.</li>
            <li> This cost half the price of Satin Smooth Stick.</li>
            <li> Contains a total of 350 wax applicator sticks, 150 eyebrow, 100 medium and 100 large applicator sticks included.</li>
            <li> but I just wish it wouldn&#x27;t remove completely from the case.</li>
            <li> The different sizes is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Soft edges.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and doesnt feel \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; at all considering they are just wooden sticks.</li>
            <li> Contains every size needed for professional waxing.</li>
            <li> WOW what a variety too choose from👍</li>
            <li> Sizes include those for waxing large parts (bikini, legs), medium parts (armpits) and small detailed parts (such as eyebrows)</li>
            <li> No more fumbling to open ziplick baggies for more sticks with waxy glove hands.</li>
            <li> Although, I wish there were more bigger applicators rather then small ones.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> They are thicker than some of the other applicators that come with some waxes and seem to hold up pretty well for reuse.</li>
            <li> The smaller sticks are pretty thick and kind of hard to use on the lower sections of the eye brow</li>
            <li> Actual tongue depressors, adult size and infant size, feel stronger.</li>
            <li> They were kind of bent, making it difficult to put wax on.</li>
            <li> All in all a good product for waxing, may be a little too expensive for craft projects</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy never had such fast free shipping .</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I received this package, but the lid was broken in a few places, so I do not even have a secure container!...  :(</li>
            <li> You get so much for your $$ compared to buying this in small quantities at the beauty stores.  </li>
            <li> I only wish they had different combinations as per quantities as I use double the amount of wide sticks than I do of the others.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional</li>
            <li> is that I do not see the need for them to be so long.  </li>
            <li> the sticks are all really durable they are not cheap and flimsey like some other ones that you will pay 5X the amount for!</li>
            <li> I mean what can I really say about this beside</li>
            <li> Other wax applicator kits were going for almost double what this one was.</li>
            <li> The different sizes are extremely convenient.</li>
            <li> First i was sent the wrong item, but i went ahead and purchased again only to be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it took a little longer to get to my house than it did for the rest of my waxing purchases made at the same time.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the lid to this kit does not stay on which ins&#x27;t even remotely a big deal, but I like to store them in the container they came in</li>
            <li> so I have be careful and remember the lid is not latching closed</li>
            <li> Quality/Material is poor but it still does what it&#x27;s supposed to, very flimsy.</li>
            <li> It arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Will tell the other stylist this is a must buy.</li>
            <li> For big areas to small</li>
            <li> The only complaint</li>
            <li> half the width and the smallest are half the medium size width.</li>
            <li> even enough room for some small strips for small jobs.</li>
            <li> I fing myself breaking them in half to shorten them up for easier use.  </li>
            <li> However the thin applicators (small ones) are not very useful compared to thick applicators (large ones).</li>
            <li> A little bit problematic to get them out sometimes</li>
            <li> Less mess!</li>
            <li> They are a bit flimsy and a few have cracked on me in use.</li>
            <li> It gives you a few sizes and tons of them.</li>
            <li> I ended up putting cloths and wipes in it and just a few of the applicators.</li>
            <li> I have used these a few times now for my home waxing purposes.  </li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I thought there should have been a few wax strips to make a starter kit.</li>
            <li> I try to use all the sizes anyway so that I won&#x27;t waste any.</li>
            <li> I wax myself and my twin daughters every few weeks.</li>
            <li> I used the plastic case to hold all of my waxing products in one spot ie: numbing cream , small powder, small baby oil, strips etc.</li>
            <li> The box is slightly small for the amount of sticks.</li>
            <li> Other than hanging out behind an ice cream truck, this is the way to keep these on hand.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the GiGi hard wax kit and decided to purchase this set to apply the wax.</li>
            <li> and I wax at least once a week.</li>
            <li> At least my kids will be doing some crafts with these.</li>
            <li> and I wont run out of sticks for at least a year.</li>
            <li> It makes waxing less complicated and works well with any wax.</li>
            <li> The sticks work well and are NOT too thin or flimsy.</li>
            <li> Set for the price, can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> How can anyone who wax go wrong with this product!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> How convenient is this??! I love it! The sticks are organized and tidy with this. No more fumbling to open ziplick baggies for more sticks with waxy glove hands.</li>
            <li> Slightly more expensive Popsicle sticks. I like them because when you pay more For something you know it has to be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually it&#x27;s a good price. Various sizes. I like various sizes.</li>
            <li> Good price for quanity received.</li>
            <li> Good buy will definitely buy these again</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Tons of wooden sticks in different sizes - great quality!</li>
            <li> Great quality and reusable container for applications</li>
            <li> I dont know why i waited so long to snag such a great deal!! a ton of sticks different sizes for all waxing needs with a handy container. I love it!!!! My lid stays on by the way, came super fast and packaged perfectly:)</li>
            <li> The case, the large quantity of sticks, the convenience--I love everything about this package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this deal to ANYONE who self-waxes on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> These applicators are sturdy, smooth and of good quality. The storage container is very convenient. A good value; however, plan ahead or your \\&quot;smooth as a babiesbutt\\&quot; skin will be \\&quot;soft as kitten down\\&quot; by the time the applicators arrive... Ordered on the 9th, delivered on the 20th! (One day ahead of their last possible \\&quot;Deliver By\\&quot; date.)</li>
            <li> Love the different sizes. Nice storage container. All the sizes are just right for all different areas.  350 pieces  Awesome</li>
            <li> My kit arrived on time, and it was exactly as I expected it to be :) thanks</li>
            <li> As advertised. Comes with doctor size tongue depressors as the large.sticks. Medium sticks are the same length but half the width and the smallest are half the medium size width.</li>
            <li> This product works great and would definitely butymore of. I would definitely do business with this company again.  Very Happy.</li>
            <li> Kit is awesome/perfect for DIY waxing! Applicators come in great little container that makes it easy to store/access/put away &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered. Like that it was in a divided container for the different sizes.</li>
            <li> Keeps applicator at your finger tips no digging to find what you need. Will probably reorder in the future. Thank you</li>
            <li> i like it There are three sizes for face and body.And it can also be used for bleaching of body hair.</li>
            <li> best value i found &amp; perfect container.</li>
            <li> Product as described and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to home waxing so I thought I would purchase items separately rather than in a kit. I&#x27;m so glad I did, I love the applicators, there are several different lengths and widths in this kit. I highly recommend these because they are super easy to use, they don&#x27;t break if you put too much wax on them as I did in the beginning. They are thicker than some of the other applicators that come with some waxes and seem to hold up pretty well for reuse. Also my daughter filched some for a craft project and made a nice pencil holder with them. All in all a good product for waxing, may be a little too expensive for craft projects but they work for both.</li>
            <li> Great sizes and quality.</li>
            <li> The applicators are smooth and durable. They are neatly stacked in the container (with plastic).</li>
            <li> You get so much for your $$ compared to buying this in small quantities at the beauty stores.  This is what I am ordering from now on, and I also love the storage that it comes in.</li>
            <li> It is very good, low cost, easy to use. You can use it in your salon....good, and very professional  product</li>
            <li> Great value and variety of sizes.  Perfect condition and quality.</li>
            <li> These are great. Have had nothing but good experiences with them and have used them several times. They arrived fast and work really well for waxing.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist and I was so happy when I received this! It came the very next day I was so surprised! The case they come in is great and the sticks were perfect in size! Will buy from again!</li>
            <li> Great starter for waxing</li>
            <li> Other than hanging out behind an ice cream truck, this is the way to keep these on hand.  Didn&#x27;t know how many I would need, so bought extras.  Makes the job easier when you can just toss em after ur done instead of cleaning and re-using.</li>
            <li> love these applicator sticks better than the ones that come in kits .Smooth and true to its advertiment.Will Buy Again.</li>
            <li> Love the container, makes keeping my station organized. Love it. Will tell the other stylist this is a must buy.</li>
            <li> These wooden wax applicators are fantastic.  They&#x27;re excellent for anyone who waxes a lot either at home or if they have a business.  These are good quality applicators.  The container is great even once the sticks are gone.</li>
            <li> Great value, good product.</li>
            <li> You might as well go to hobby lobby and get some craft sticks for 40% off with a coupon. These are grossly overpriced.</li>
            <li> I really like this applicator box. So much that I bought 2...one for my treatment room and one for home use. Keeps my applicatpors separated and even enough room for some small strips for small jobs. I really like it and it suits my needs beautifully. Thanks......Marti M</li>
            <li> I love how the box has 3 compartments for different sizes. However, most of the sticks were not straight. They were kind of bent, making it difficult to put wax on.</li>
            <li> The smaller ones work better if your a beginner I use for any part of my body to apply the wax.</li>
            <li> I do my own home waxing of my face after spending tons of money at a salon for many years, I decided to buy all the products and do at home myself. I bought this a couple of years ago and still have tons of wax applicators to use. I will buy this product again, when I have depleted the current box, but it won&#x27;t be anytime soon as I still have plenty and I wax at least once a week. There are three varying sizes of sticks which is great, since sometimes you need the smaller ones for eyebrows or upper lip.</li>
            <li> It is very handy.  I keep it with my wax warmer.  I like because all of the sizes are seperated.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am save so much money on waxing. Very easy to use.  I will recommend it.</li>
            <li> I liked the sticks. I liked the box too, because I can put other sticks in it when I run out or use it for something else.</li>
            <li> Great value for all that you get. They are very smooth and you get 3 different sizes. Perfect! I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.</li>
            <li> Just fantastic. Lots of applicators. Great container. My wife loves how there are three differnt sizes. Great price for this.</li>
            <li> was the perfect amount for the price</li>
            <li> This set is wonderful for the price!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use with the wax warmer for home use. They work great. I will purchase these again.</li>
            <li> This cost half the price of Satin Smooth Stick. The stick is strong and doesnt break easy. I wont recommended to others.</li>
            <li> They came in cool packaging and it will be easy to refill when needed. It was exaclty what i expected and perfect for what i needed.</li>
            <li> This is a nice selection of wooden paddles in a reusable case - good product.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I almost thought this was too good to be true. Other wax applicator kits were going for almost double what this one was. In this kit you get PLENTY of sticks, and they&#x27;re good quality. Comes in a nice container too.</li>
            <li> These sticks are ok. Actual tongue depressors, adult size and infant size, feel stronger. I liked the container that they come in and it&#x27;s one of the reasons why I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> The plastic container the sticks came housed in is made of solid compartmental construction, and the wooden sticks themselves are of various shapes and sizes and good quality, however I would like to point out that there are far more smaller sticks than larger ones included in this particular set. If your looking for mainly larger sticks (tongue depressor size), I would suggest trying another kit.</li>
            <li> This wooden boards do the job they come in different sizes. the inside has dividers for them not to get mixed. The top it&#x27;s easy to put on and off but I just wish it wouldn&#x27;t remove completely from the case. the case it&#x27;s not as big as I thought and it fits just where I wanted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsito..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so big but the variety is wonderful and it&#x27;ll definitely last you a while.  The only thing is that the medium sized sticks are a bit too many to fit in the side compartment so it doesn&#x27;t close all the way at first, but of course once you use enough it&#x27;ll close just fine.  Very neat and professional looking, the quality of the sticks is great.</li>
            <li> Love having the case and the fact that its all in one place and sorted. That being said the sticks are decent at best. They are a bit flimsy and a few have cracked on me in use.</li>
            <li> How can anyone who wax go wrong with this product!!!</li>
            <li> Nice kit. Includes all different sizes of applicators.</li>
            <li> Plenty of applicators to use.  I am not a professional so they came in handy to use to wax eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Exactly as you see in picture, not all fits in the container so I have extras which is also a plus!! when I run out I will buy this again! THANKS!</li>
            <li> Very cheap! Tons of sticks! I feel like i will never run out, and i wax quite often. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product mainly for the container. I was super excited when I received this package, but the lid was broken in a few places, so I do not even have a secure container!...  :(</li>
            <li> I love having multiple sizes of applicators. Less mess!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Good product! Fast delivery</li>
            <li> First time home waxer, found this kit perfect!! The three different sizes make it so easy to do any area. The small are perfect for eyebrows. Large perfect for legs and (bikini) if you practice. The medium is great for touch-ups and/or chin/upper-lip. We will be buying more!!</li>
            <li> it is very good and easy to use. Although, I wish there were more bigger applicators rather then small ones. Overall quite happy</li>
            <li> These will last you forever</li>
            <li> Love the options here.</li>
            <li> Plenty of sticks, good quality. They don&#x27;t splinter or break. The small ones are great for brows and upper lip.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. No damage. Haven&#x27;t used them yet but look good</li>
            <li> Kind of thin...but flexible</li>
            <li> Great product. What you see is what you get. I only wish they had different combinations as per quantities as I use double the amount of wide sticks than I do of the others.</li>
            <li> Great kit for waxing. Holds all sizes of applicators and keeps everything neat</li>
            <li> As advertised. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a great quantity for the price. I am Happy it came with the storage container . The different sizes is very helpful.</li>
            <li> The case these come in is awesome, getting 350 is a great value too.</li>
            <li> The smaller sticks are pretty thick and kind of hard to use on the lower sections of the eye brow</li>
            <li> This product is great. I love the case that came with it. The sticks work well and are NOT too thin or flimsy.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Easy storage, clean, convenient box, with nice wooden quality sticks and spats. Great price, too. Would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> These are great. Just your standard popsicle sticks that included 3 different sizes and widths. There are so many it was well worth the low cost.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery! the small skinny stick is the perfect size sticks for eyebrows! I would definitely recommend this to my friends</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!!</li>
            <li> Nice pack assortment of waxing sticks. Enough to last for years at a great price. Nice quality. Soft edges. Nice assortment of sizes.</li>
            <li> Must have for any esthetician needing a great assortment of waxing sticks. Very sturdy and doesnt feel \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; at all considering they are just wooden sticks. I love the storage container too, keeps them sanitary.</li>
            <li> The FantaSea 350 piece Wax applicator kit is great for numerous types of waxing jobs since the waxing areas vary in size.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. It makes waxing less complicated and works well with any wax.</li>
            <li> Hi everyone so when I purchased my wax kit I wanted to get some extra sticks . This was the best choice . Comes in a nice quality plastic container that can later on be reused . The quality of the wood sticks is always very sturdy and great . Worth the money for sure . Also the best part of all was the shipping I ordered Friday afternoon ! And today Monday when I got home from work my package was here it&#x27;s crazy never had such fast free shipping . Thanks so much to the seller . Very pleased would reccomend and purchase again .</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s plenty in the box and you can&#x27;t beat the price. The container is a big plus too!</li>
            <li> Great set of wax application sticks. The only complaint is the lid to this kit does not stay on which ins&#x27;t even remotely a big deal, but I like to store them in the container they came in so I have be careful and remember the lid is not latching closed, maybe this is a problem with my container only, but who knows. Otherwise great kit, worth the money.</li>
            <li> the compartments that are built in makes it easy to separate your different sized utensils.</li>
            <li> just want i have been looking for and a good price and comes right to your door</li>
            <li> This was the most effective variety pack of waxing sticks that I could find. What can I say, they are 3 different sizes and work well.</li>
            <li> Good purchase I bought one for my daughter in  law  and she liked it . I am now going to purchase one for myself.</li>
            <li> Well there isn&#x27;t anything to complain about this product.  It is what it is.  It&#x27;s not flimsy or cheap.  The container it comes in is well made and is a great way to keep these applicators organized.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> :) Sticks were great. exactly as they had described.  I def. recommend this product, It covers any size waxing job</li>
            <li> Hey, they are wax application sticks. What else can i say. They do apply wax and that&#x27;s what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The wax applicator kit was an excellent price and probably will last for years. I love the variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect set to order with the wax kit. It gives you a few sizes and tons of them. It is bigger than it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> For the price and number of sticks. It&#x27;s worth getting it with the Melting Pot stripless wax kit.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this set. Like others have said, the container is very useful. I ended up putting cloths and wipes in it and just a few of the applicators. When I&#x27;m ready to wax, I pull the wax pot out and my handy plastic case, and I&#x27;m ready to go. Good buy. The applicators all work very well. 3 Sizes, and very sturdy. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Large amount. Good price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful assortment of sticks in a great box. Decent quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Product is better then described</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Will buy more. I wax a lot. Easy and organized. I will reuse the container! Highly recommend. Salons this is a great buy!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a lot to say about wax applicators for wax removal other than the size variety is good and they package them very well to prevent breakage. Would like to see a refill option without the included container to reduce the cost of the refills.</li>
            <li> good buy, keep all the sticks organized and easy to store.</li>
            <li> Perfect, love the container and the different sizes. It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> I love the case and all the applicators. really nice having the different sizes as well, makes wax removal handy</li>
            <li> Great way to have your waxing sticks organized and ready at your fingertips!  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am currently an Esthetician student here at Gary Manuel AVEDA Institute, and we got this in our kit. Awesome product to have and start out with! Variety of applicator sticks to use for waxing. Contains a total of 350 wax applicator sticks, 150 eyebrow, 100 medium and 100 large applicator sticks included.</li>
            <li> Nice case and I like the different sizes.</li>
            <li> I love this. I actually pulled some sticks out and put it in there and stored the rest. I used the plastic case to hold all of my waxing products in one spot ie: numbing cream , small powder, small baby oil, strips etc. It all fits well and as I run low on sticks, I just pull some more out and add. I love that I have everything in one kit. Great idea to put the sticks in that kit. love it.</li>
            <li> Quality/Material is poor but it still does what it&#x27;s supposed to, very flimsy. I give it a 3 for a GREAT PRICE + Storage!!!</li>
            <li> Really useful for waxing, sizes are perfect... A little bit problematic to get them out sometimes but are a really good deal and good price</li>
            <li> Was as promised.  There were enough waxing sticks of a variety of sizes to use.  I would recommend but the price was higher than should have been.</li>
            <li> I have used these a few times now for my home waxing purposes.  The only complaint I guess I would have is that I do not see the need for them to be so long.  I fing myself breaking them in half to shorten them up for easier use.  Overall I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> The product arrive  quickly , thanks, looking good, some of this applicator is defective:(, but is ok, for the price:)))</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I knew it would be a good bargain. The weird-angled applicators that are sold by some wax manufacturers totally stink.&lt;br /&gt;I love the large applicators. They are very easy to use. You probably could just find the same in an arts &amp; crafts store and use those. But for the price, these are pretty cheap per applicator price, and you get them in three different sizes.</li>
            <li> Good product put I have only used 1 lol, I keep using the same one over and over and it has last so 350 pieces may be way too many for you.</li>
            <li> Salon wax sticks, not different than you&#x27;d find in any salon, but the container to hold the sticks is very useful for storage.  Smooth transaction.  Thank you seller.</li>
            <li> This convenient wax applicator kit puts everything in one place to make for an easy application and clean up. Very professional presentation.</li>
            <li> Purchased for our daughter she has used already and loved it</li>
            <li> Good quality,good price. I love it.</li>
            <li> I usually use a different brand of applicator, but the container that these come in is perfect for organizing large, medium and small applicators. I&#x27;ve switched back to my old brand, but I used these until they were gone, and they were good quality and perfectly adequate.</li>
            <li> Sticks are sticks. What can I say. There are lots of them in the kit. Probable more than I will use in a few years.</li>
            <li> I love all that this comes with so many sticks and in several different sizes. The only thing is that it&#x27;s a pretty bulky set (something like 9&amp;#34; x 6&amp;#34; x 2.5&amp;#34;). The sticks are pretty solid, too, haven&#x27;t yet had an issue where they break or splinter like using them.</li>
            <li> Perfect sizes for all your needs.  Sturdy sticks that resist breaking. What else&#x27;s can ii say about this product.  Nice</li>
            <li> I wax often as an esthetician and these sticks are a great deal for the price I love them! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I thought there should have been a few wax strips to make a starter kit. It arrived as expected. The box is clean the applicators were in a separate  packaging by size. It works fine with it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Contains every size needed for professional waxing. The box is slightly small for the amount of sticks. I had to keep them in the inner plastic lining initially, so they could spill over into spaces but still a great find!</li>
            <li> You get a lot of sticks that&#x27;s for sure! I am pleased with this set, should last me a long time. I would totally recommend this if your looking for something to apply wax to your skin with, this set is amazing, and comes in a very nice and convenient storage container.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy because of the case that comes with the kit. There are individual sections for each size of waxing stick. The only con I would have is that I wished this was offered as an item on Amazon Prime bc it took a little longer to get to my house than it did for the rest of my waxing purchases made at the same time. Overall, I think it was a good price for the amount of sticks and the container it comes in.</li>
            <li> I love this item.  I loved the 3 variety of sticks as well as the convenient container that it comes in.</li>
            <li> Nice clean cut sticks! Plenty of sticks to use for waxing. When I&#x27;m done I&#x27;ll order more probably. No splinters.</li>
            <li> I like how the product comes with a box and it comes with a good price.</li>
            <li> I like the container because it is nice and organized. These sticks are flimsy if you are trying to do art and crafts, but works fine for waxing.</li>
            <li> I purchased these sticks for waxing and they get the job done for me.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll run out for the next six months so you really get your money&#x27;s worth.  The sticks are sturdy too.  No complaints here.</li>
            <li> I love the 3 different sizes that the applicators came in. The container was the perfect organization box needed. Very reasonable price as well.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I will not have to worry about wax applicators for a LONG time. I love that they came in a variety of sizes, and the price was awesome.</li>
            <li> I mean what can I really say about this beside it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> Huge kit, great selection</li>
            <li> Love the quantity and variety</li>
            <li> Honestly, being very frugal, I think popsicle sticks would work just fine.</li>
            <li> This has a good selection of waxing sticks and great storage container. Good quality and received quickly. Overall, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> great price, will last me a very long time. i like the container!</li>
            <li> This kit is great. It helps organize you applicators by size and has a container to keep them.  It holds a lot of applicators of the various sizes.</li>
            <li> I love that there are huge number of wax applicators. However the thin applicators (small ones) are not very useful compared to thick applicators (large ones). I try to use all the sizes anyway so that I won&#x27;t waste any. I like that these come with a plastic box specifically made for that. It&#x27;s very useful too. Overall excellent product with great quality.</li>
            <li> First i was sent the wrong item, but i went ahead and purchased again only to be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These so called wax applicators are nothing more than different sized popsicle sticks. They are rough and many of them have splinters sticking out. I will not be using these to apply wax anywhere on me.... ouch!! If you don&#x27;t care about the quality of the applicators you use, go to the dollar store and buy yourself the popsicle sticks they have there, they are the same thing. I should have known this deal was too good to be true, but i gave it a shot and lost. I would give this product no stars if it gave me the option. At least my kids will be doing some crafts with these.</li>
            <li> the sticks are all really durable they are not cheap and flimsey like some other ones that you will pay 5X the amount for! will def purchse again. Shipping was FAST!</li>
            <li> this a nice package so i recomended if you are looking for something like this you should go for it haahhahahaa</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Set for the price, can&#x27;t go wrong WOW what a variety too choose from👍</li>
            <li> Came with plenty of sticks in different sizes. Love the skinny ones for waxing my brows.</li>
            <li> Worth the money. Fast shipping. All sizes you can imagine are included. Pleanty of supplies packed</li>
            <li> Still using it, months later!</li>
            <li> I was worried the applicators would be cheap (and was already planning on tossin them out) I just really wanted the case... Turns out that the applicators are perfect.  I&#x27;ve already used several and had no issues.</li>
            <li> The quality is decent I think its a good deal for the lot, nice product :) And the container is nice too</li>
            <li> I love the different sizes of applicators and that the container has separate compartments for them. Makes it easy to keep them separate and know you&#x27;re getting the size you want and need while in the middle of a service.</li>
            <li> Has every size i need for all body parts!! So happy I found this and at a decent price here!</li>
            <li> Great quality and container for storage.  highly recommend.  You can always refill with bulk.</li>
            <li> I like that there are separate sections for each size</li>
            <li> there is plenty to do me for a while,, very nice compartments ,seperated. it is something you are going to need for waxing.</li>
            <li> love the differnt sizes so i can do my own waxing</li>
            <li> great amount of  product for the price. like it.</li>
            <li> The sticks are great and are lasting a long time too, theres so many this should last me for a long time, easy to use and looks like the picture, nicely wrapped in plastic to keep them safe as well:)</li>
            <li> Love this set. I self wax a lot and I wont run out of sticks for at least a year. Sizes include those for waxing large parts (bikini, legs), medium parts (armpits) and small detailed parts (such as eyebrows)</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really used them yet... a fair amt came with the applicator kit.</li>
            <li> On time and in one piece. Very nice. Different sizes as described. The box is really something. Made very well!!</li>
            <li> Lots to choose from.  For big areas to small</li>
            <li> More than enough applicators and they come in a handy staorage container.</li>
            <li> Perfect variety of applicators. I won&#x27;t necessarily use the smaller widths therefor my next purchase will be just for the wider applicators.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of sticks - all in great condition. the case they come in is really handy! I am glad I got this.</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;They will last me forever.</li>
            <li> I love the storage case, very convenient.</li>
            <li> Gives you a lot of different sizes to choose from good for different parts of the body. Should last me a while.</li>
            <li> I purchased the GiGi hard wax kit and decided to purchase this set to apply the wax. The different sizes are extremely convenient. Furthermore, there are an abundance of sticks, so no need to replenish any time soon. I wax myself and my twin daughters every few weeks. Great value as well. Enjoy your waxing!!</li>
