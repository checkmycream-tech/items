            <li>The price was better than buying three individual ones.  </li>

            <li> They were all pretty much the same for me, considering I hate the cosmetology industry for its cruelty to animals and because they just make up words to sell you more expensive products, but this shampoo was really different on my hair..</li>

            <li> /&gt;Washes all the gel/pomade out of my hair...and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t build up on your hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair with tendency to oily scapl and very dry ends, but this shampoo eliminated that problem.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes as well as strips built up hairspray and other products that gradually coat my hair (made worse by hot rollers).  </li>
            <li> He had difficulty finding it in the usual places</li>
            <li> so try 1 bottle or a small sample</li>

            <li> tough to find in stores</li>

            <li> The best shampoo, no build up. Gentle. Great smell.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo but a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are allergic to a lot of products. This one cleans your hair and you don&#x27;t need a separate conditioner. We are flake and pimple free. This is the second time I have ordered this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this Neutrogena shampoo for years.  After I used up my last bottle, I could no longer find this shampoo in stores. I finally located some on line through Amazon and purchased 3 bottles. My hair is again feeling great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become really hard to find this product, our family&#x27;s favorite shampoo, in local stores.  So great to be able to have a three-pack delivered right to our door!</li>

            <li> I love this shampoo!  It cleans well, but not harshly.  It is moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t add volume.  Barely any scent at all as well, which I appreciate in this much overly-perfumed world we live in.</li>
            <li> I think I found the best shampoo for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I love its smell because its not that strong.&lt;br /&gt;It also leaves my hair clean &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> I bought one bottle before and liked it so much, I wanted to order more than just one bottle.  I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I never paid attention to shampoos. They were all pretty much the same for me, considering I hate the cosmetology industry for its cruelty to animals and because they just make up words to sell you more expensive products, but this shampoo was really different on my hair.. it felt so nice the first time I used it. I fell in love.. It is great for my normal to dry hair. I would really recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this shampoo all the time. He had difficulty finding it in the usual places he shops found it on Amazon for a good price</li>

            <li> good product came fast</li>
            <li> They discontinued this in the stores.  Luckily, I was able to find it here.  Cleans thoroughly without leaving hair feeling weighted.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo !&lt;br /&gt;It  makes my hair so beautifully clean!</li>
            <li> I was actually looking for a stop loss hair product when I came across this  shampoo and conditioner, even when these products aren´t  for the loss of hair, it worked, just having a healthier hair I could feel the difference and the loss hair has reduced.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for a ge/pomade user like myself...&lt;br /&gt;though...it was discontinued recently&lt;br /&gt;Damn shame as i LOVE this shampoo...been using for years with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washes all the gel/pomade out of my hair...and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very tough to find in stores so try 1 bottle or a small sample (you can find them on ebay) and you&#x27;ll see what i mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I better stock up soon.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. I have allergies and have been using Neutrogena Clean for over 5 years. Leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is now the only shampoo I use.  Other shampoos left my scalp itchy.  Not Neutrogena CLEAN.  I can use it daily with no problems with build-up or dryness.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for my hair.  I have used it for years on my untreated hair--no coloring or perm, etc.  No need for conditioner. Hair is soft and healthy. I have very long hair with tendency to oily scapl and very dry ends, but this shampoo eliminated that problem.  Too bad it has become so hard to find--nowhere in local drug, grocery or megamart stores. and, by the law of supply and demand, the price is so much more (relatively) than when I first started using...but worth the cost.</li>
