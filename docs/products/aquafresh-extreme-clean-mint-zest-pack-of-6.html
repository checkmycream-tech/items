    <ol>
            <li>Best toothpaste I have used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be great for parents to have on hand to use in punishing their children for swearing.</li>
            <li>Great taste and</li>
            <li>My husband and I both agree that this is the best tasting, tangy, tingly and refreshing toothpaste we have ever used.  </li>
            <li>And it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Chose this because it seemed like a good deal to purchase in bulk.  </li>
            <li>Good deal on this product.</li>
            <li>It is mild (not aggressive) and taste good while providing awesome cleaning.</li>
            <li>Morning is best with it because of its fresh taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product is great, just not the one I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously amazing.</li>
            <li>I work in close proximity to people at work, and my co-workers are the kind of people who will let you know if you have dog breath.</li>
            <li>that just be the dogs you own?</li>
            <li>This toothpaste in Mint Zest is absolutely the greatest toothpaste I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Bubbles nicely.  </li>
            <li>I think this is attributed to it foaming more than most toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a preference thing, I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>This probably a whole years work of toothpaste and for what we paid a great deal.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that is does not leave an after taste.  </li>
            <li>Kind of light orange and vanilla and perhaps some mint flavor that has a refreshing burst.</li>
            <li>I taste more of a cough drop.</li>
            <li>And toothpaste is supposed to taste good right?</li>
            <li>It creates a thicker foam which (according to the box) is supposed to get in between your teeth and clean them better, or something.  </li>
            <li>I like an strong, almost overpowering mint.</li>
            <li>This does not have that strong of a mint flavor or feel.</li>
            <li>It tastes amazing and makes my mouth feel so clean and fresh</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fine with me.  </li>
            <li>Only kind I use because it doesn&#x27;t have that overwhelming spearmint taste that I loathe.</li>
            <li>In all fairness, my teeth do feel clean.</li>
            <li>But it does clean well</li>
            <li>It has an orange-vanilla taste to it, and it leaves your mouth feeling so clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth feeling clean longer than anything else we&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that I find to taste pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I definitely admit that I didn&#x27;t like it at first, but I LOVED how clean it made my mouth feel, definitely more than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Anything that makes Listerine taste good should never have left the Aquafresh test labs.</li>
            <li>it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Surely a toothpaste would not recreate that particular odor.\\&quot;     </li>
            <li>The foaming action is really what makes this toothpaste better IMO - so many toothpastes don&#x27;t want to &#x27;travel&#x27; in the embrasures and gingival crevices, but this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, more importantly, while this toothpaste might clean pretty well it has a couple major things going against it.</li>
            <li>but it makes your breath taste fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to have a bright white smile.</li>
            <li>It says so right on the box:</li>
            <li>My gums are clean, my teeth are fully polished, My tounge is operating normally all thanks to this marvel of an invention from the fine folks at Aquafresh.</li>
            <li>It leaves your whole mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Despite tasting like a Hall&#x27;s mentholated cough drop, it really does clean well and leave you feeling minty.</li>
            <li>The other flavors in Aquafresh have the same results, but for me personally I love love love this flavor</li>
            <li>After using a bunch of the major toothpaste brands out there (Crest, Colgate, Arm &amp; Hammer), AND comparing it to other Aquafresh toothpastes, I&#x27;d say this is the most effective toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work as far as getting my mouth clean and fresh, even whitens noticeably.  </li>
            <li>The six-pack is pretty convenient.</li>
            <li>The first is that it makes your breath smell like dog gas.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;d say if you are interested in trying this toothpaste, check out the travel size section of the drug store; I&#x27;ve seen this toothpaste offered in travel size, so it&#x27;d be an easy/low risk way to sample it and decide for yourself.    </li>
            <li>but personally I think its the better tasting toothpaste in the market today.  </li>
            <li>Love the tooth paste flavor and have enough for a year!</li>
            <li>First off, let&#x27;s get something straight here:</li>
            <li>I really, really dislike the taste of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This tube went straight off the counter into the trash.</li>
            <li>It cleans your mouth very well.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste as the deep action foam makes my teeth feel extra clean.  </li>
            <li>Not much to say other than this is a great toothpaste to use.  </li>
            <li>This toothe paste not only makes your teeth feel clean</li>
            <li>Now, we all know that Luden&#x27;s cough drops only have the ability to cure a sweet tooth.</li>
            <li>Hands down the most repulsive smell and taste of any toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li>EXTREME CLEAN!</li>
            <li>Aquafresh Extreme Clean Whitening tastes like the smell of a combination of turpentine and Vicks VapoRub.  </li>
            <li>TAKE THE FEELING OF CLEAN TO THE EXTREME!      </li>
            <li>Stick to plain ole Aquafresh &amp; you&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
            <li>My favorite by far and sometimes hard to find locally.</li>
            <li>you aren&#x27;t into a citrus mint flavor then try the other Extreme Clean flavors, they all have the foaming extreme clean properties.</li>
            <li>Tested it out on a few people and sure enough, I got the urge to get the leash and scramble to get the pup outside before a massive accident occurs.    </li>
            <li>and I had to throw away half of the first</li>
            <li>They are all just different combinations of the same ingredients, unless you go with a natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It has a different texture, I assume from the deep bubbling action it claims to have.</li>
            <li>To address the \\&quot;dog breath\\&quot; issue, nothing personal, but I&#x27;ve seen this happen with other toothpastes/flosses/toothbrushes (with myself and family members), and I think it&#x27;s not the toothpaste&#x27;s fault, so much as it cleaning out areas of your teeth that perhaps weren&#x27;t being reached before, and as a result, the smell of the bacteria being unearthed might come to the surface.  </li>
            <li>Especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant, I can hardly get my teeth brushed without gagging.</li>

            <li> Especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant, I can hardly get my teeth brushed without gagging.</li>
            <li> Nearly any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Does feel like it cleans my teeth well, but I&#x27;m not willing to say it does anything different from the next toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Next time, I was trying to identify the odd smell, flavor, sensation, and could only think of dry-cleaning fluid</li>
            <li> To cite a specific example, my teeth feel cleaner after one minute of brushing (with the same toothbrush) than TWO minutes with other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> would love to see any test data they have on this cesspool of solvents.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had such an unpleasant experience with toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Yes, for as long as I can without vomiting.</li>
            <li> My regimen consists of 2x/day : tongue scraper (silver), floss (glide, or reach if you like the rope like me), and Sonicare&#x27;s sensitive brush heads (the regular brush heads are a little too brutal for daily use) - with aqua fresh extreme clean.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the standard mint flavor of other toothpastes, regardless of brand.  </li>
            <li> Combined with the foaminess of this toothpaste, Aquafresh&#x27;s new EXTREME CLEAN is EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT.    </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I actually grabbed the tube in alarm, confused that perhaps I had picked up something other than toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Aside from a small reference to its \\&quot;distinctive citrus mint flavor\\&quot; on the back of the box (who has time to read every word of packaging in-store?), there was no obvious indication that it was lemon-flavored.    </li>
            <li> Even though I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth any differently than usual, it somehow felt as though the toothpaste reached every possible surface area in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Again, it was almost alarming.  </li>
            <li> This toothpast has the absolute worse taste i&#x27;ve ever tried in a paste before.  </li>
            <li> I mean, we all are different and have different tastes.  </li>
            <li> You know how some things taste like other things smell?  </li>
            <li> but this is the one in the store (not the one pictured and described by other reviewers).  </li>
            <li> The price is lower than other brands and it appears to whiten just as well.  </li>
            <li> (not exactly).</li>
            <li> (Could it be the sodium laurel sulfate breaks down with some other chemical to produce that malodorous stench?)    </li>
            <li> is slowing down and will probably stop dispensing</li>
            <li> The taste might throw you off slightly as its not mint</li>
            <li> The taste is what is a little off.</li>
            <li> So to get this out of the way: Yes, this toothpaste is not the traditional mint flavor, it&#x27;s like a weird orange-y citrus flavor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, I got them from amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store....</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t contact the mfr when I don&#x27;t like something.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I pick up on lemon like others are describing.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it did make my mouth feel extremely clean...but almost numb like how it feels after getting work done at the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Seeks out hard to reach places.\\&quot; Seeks?</li>
            <li> It is decently thick and can be used with a sonic toothbrush without mirror splatter.</li>
            <li> Taste like Eucalyptus cough drops...so not very great brushing that around your mouth.</li>
            <li> I hate wasting, but I&#x27;m buying a new type ASAP because I can&#x27;t stand this stuff.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I just hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this version, since it seems so many people hate it :(</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s EXTREMELY hard to dispense!  </li>
            <li> As some other reviewers have noted, this Aquafresh toothpaste has a terrible taste.  </li>
            <li> But still, it&#x27;s an unpleasant medicine flavor.</li>
            <li> It was so bad I had to rinse my mouth out with Listerine.</li>
            <li> I will be throwing this in the garbage and buying something that doesn&#x27;t make me sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I HATE all cherry flavored candy/soda/actual cherries because I think THOSE taste like medicine.  </li>
            <li> Some idiot made orange juice flavored toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cap is gone and lost, hate the non flip too caps.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so nasty!!</li>
            <li> Nasty doesn&#x27;t begin to describe it.</li>
            <li> Nowhere on the package does it mention the disgusting citrus/mint combo flavor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so horrible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely disgusting.  </li>
            <li> The taste is nasty though.</li>
            <li> Kinda nasty</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really, really dislike the taste of this toothpaste. Especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant, I can hardly get my teeth brushed without gagging. I hate wasting, but I&#x27;m buying a new type ASAP because I can&#x27;t stand this stuff.</li>
            <li> Only kind I use because it doesn&#x27;t have that overwhelming spearmint taste that I loathe. And it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste. It is decently thick and can be used with a sonic toothbrush without mirror splatter. Does feel like it cleans my teeth well, but I&#x27;m not willing to say it does anything different from the next toothpaste. They are all just different combinations of the same ingredients, unless you go with a natural toothpaste. I immediately noticed that the flavor was different, but in no way was I repulsed by it. I have now become quite accustomed to its flavor. I haven&#x27;t noticed the \\&quot;dog breath\\&quot; phenomenon described by another reviewer. I work in close proximity to people at work, and my co-workers are the kind of people who will let you know if you have dog breath. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> ....Or just mix a bunch of chemicals and flavors together?&lt;br /&gt;First use, I thought it was very different and a bit chemically flavored. I could swear the taste lasted all day and even irritated my lips. Next time, I was trying to identify the odd smell, flavor, sensation, and could only think of dry-cleaning fluid (perc).&lt;br /&gt;Three uses was enough! I&#x27;ll let my teeth rot before using this again. Is this industrial strentgh for cleaning elephant tusks?&lt;br /&gt;After reading the ingredents, it sounds like shampoo and drain cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see any test data they have on this cesspool of solvents.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had such an unpleasant experience with toothpaste. The product I used came in the pump dispenser rather than a tube, but I would assume is the same formula.&lt;br /&gt;Edit: look up isopentane. A volitile petroleum product. cross between propane and lighter fluid. Ack.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste. It is mild (not aggressive) and taste good while providing awesome cleaning. The six-pack is pretty convenient.</li>
            <li> First off, let&#x27;s get something straight here: Toothpaste is getting out of control. EXTREME CLEAN! EXTRA PLUS ULTRA WHITENING! TAKE THE FEELING OF CLEAN TO THE EXTREME!      SHUT UP!    It&#x27;s toothpaste.    But, more importantly, while this toothpaste might clean pretty well it has a couple major things going against it. The first is that it makes your breath smell like dog gas. I know, you&#x27;re thinking, \\&quot;Couldn&#x27;t that just be the dogs you own? Surely a toothpaste would not recreate that particular odor.\\&quot;     No. It&#x27;s the toothpaste. Tested it out on a few people and sure enough, I got the urge to get the leash and scramble to get the pup outside before a massive accident occurs.    (Could it be the sodium laurel sulfate breaks down with some other chemical to produce that malodorous stench?)    Alright, problem number two: It tastes like Luden&#x27;s cough drops. Now, we all know that Luden&#x27;s cough drops only have the ability to cure a sweet tooth. But still, it&#x27;s an unpleasant medicine flavor. Combined with the foaminess of this toothpaste, Aquafresh&#x27;s new EXTREME CLEAN is EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT.    While I&#x27;m at it, why is it sentient? Seriously. It says so right on the box: \\&quot;Seeks out hard to reach places.\\&quot; Seeks? Is this toothpaste operated by burrowing Jack Russell Terriers trying to catch their quarry? Might explain the after effects....    My recommendation? Nearly any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> If you like toothpaste that tastes like cough medicine, then you&#x27;ll like this stuff. I bought mine on the clearance shelf at our local grocery store. I found out why it was on clearance on the 1st try!! Yuck!! This stuff is so nasty!! I&#x27;d pass on it if I were you. Stick to plain ole Aquafresh &amp; you&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
            <li> This is the worst-tasting toothpaste I have ever used. I cannot understand why they decided to go with LEMON. It was so bad I had to rinse my mouth out with Listerine. Anything that makes Listerine taste good should never have left the Aquafresh test labs. Aside from a small reference to its \\&quot;distinctive citrus mint flavor\\&quot; on the back of the box (who has time to read every word of packaging in-store?), there was no obvious indication that it was lemon-flavored.    In all fairness, my teeth do feel clean. But at what price? This tube went straight off the counter into the trash.</li>
            <li> So to get this out of the way: Yes, this toothpaste is not the traditional mint flavor, it&#x27;s like a weird orange-y citrus flavor.  I definitely admit that I didn&#x27;t like it at first, but I LOVED how clean it made my mouth feel, definitely more than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  I think this is attributed to it foaming more than most toothpastes.  It creates a thicker foam which (according to the box) is supposed to get in between your teeth and clean them better, or something.  Whatever it&#x27;s doing, I can definitely feel it.  After using a bunch of the major toothpaste brands out there (Crest, Colgate, Arm &amp; Hammer), AND comparing it to other Aquafresh toothpastes, I&#x27;d say this is the most effective toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.  To cite a specific example, my teeth feel cleaner after one minute of brushing (with the same toothbrush) than TWO minutes with other toothpastes. (note: yes, I know you&#x27;re supposed to brush for two minutes+, I&#x27;m just using this as a comparison example)    Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now, and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the flavor.  I guess if given the choice I&#x27;d prefer mint, but I actually don&#x27;t dislike the flavor anymore, it&#x27;s fine with me.  It&#x27;s just a preference thing, I&#x27;m sure.  Some people said this tastes like medicine.  I don&#x27;t agree.  Meanwhile, I HATE all cherry flavored candy/soda/actual cherries because I think THOSE taste like medicine.  So yeah, it&#x27;s just dependent on the person.    To address the \\&quot;dog breath\\&quot; issue, nothing personal, but I&#x27;ve seen this happen with other toothpastes/flosses/toothbrushes (with myself and family members), and I think it&#x27;s not the toothpaste&#x27;s fault, so much as it cleaning out areas of your teeth that perhaps weren&#x27;t being reached before, and as a result, the smell of the bacteria being unearthed might come to the surface.  I dunno, I&#x27;m not a dentist, but that&#x27;s just my guess.    All in all, I&#x27;d say if you are interested in trying this toothpaste, check out the travel size section of the drug store; I&#x27;ve seen this toothpaste offered in travel size, so it&#x27;d be an easy/low risk way to sample it and decide for yourself.    I just hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this version, since it seems so many people hate it :(</li>
            <li> Wish this hadn&#x27;t been discontinued. It tastes amazing and makes my mouth feel so clean and fresh</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers have noted, this Aquafresh toothpaste has a terrible taste.  To me, it has an acrid chemical taste, like when you&#x27;re outside and someone covers themselves with bug spray.  The first time I used it, I actually grabbed the tube in alarm, confused that perhaps I had picked up something other than toothpaste.  On the other hand, it did make my mouth feel extremely clean...but almost numb like how it feels after getting work done at the dentist&#x27;s office.  Even though I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth any differently than usual, it somehow felt as though the toothpaste reached every possible surface area in my mouth.  Again, it was almost alarming.  I&#x27;ve never felt so torn about a toothpaste!  Will I continue to use it?  Yes, for as long as I can without vomiting.</li>
            <li> You know how some things taste like other things smell?  Aquafresh Extreme Clean Whitening tastes like the smell of a combination of turpentine and Vicks VapoRub.  (My hubby agreed, saying I nailed the description.)  Nasty doesn&#x27;t begin to describe it.</li>
            <li> My favorite by far and sometimes hard to find locally. Morning is best with it because of its fresh taste. Love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the standard mint flavor of other toothpastes, regardless of brand.  This is the only one that I find to taste pleasant.  So here I am, buying 33 ounces on Amazon because I can&#x27;t get it in the local stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than this is a great toothpaste to use.  It leaves your whole mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking about the 4.3 oz canister so may not be the same as the tube but it&#x27;s EXTREMELY hard to dispense!  Second can and I had to throw away half of the first can because it quit dispensing altogether - now this second can (dummy me - I bought it again) is slowing down and will probably stop dispensing and I&#x27;ve only had it a week!  But it does clean well so gave it another shot - guess I&#x27;ll call the 800-number on the can.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I have used. I have been using it for about 8 years now - I recommend it to all my patients. The foaming action is really what makes this toothpaste better IMO - so many toothpastes don&#x27;t want to &#x27;travel&#x27; in the embrasures and gingival crevices, but this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the softest brush you can find, and use this toothpaste 2x a day for at least 2 mins each, and your gums, teeth, and smile will reap the rewards. It&#x27;s not hard to have a bright white smile. My regimen consists of 2x/day : tongue scraper (silver), floss (glide, or reach if you like the rope like me), and Sonicare&#x27;s sensitive brush heads (the regular brush heads are a little too brutal for daily use) - with aqua fresh extreme clean.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste in Mint Zest is absolutely the greatest toothpaste I have ever used! After using I cannot and will not ever use another toothpaste again! It has an orange-vanilla taste to it, and it leaves your mouth feeling so clean. The other flavors in Aquafresh have the same results, but for me personally I love love love this flavor and I now buy it in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t into a citrus mint flavor then try the other Extreme Clean flavors, they all have the foaming extreme clean properties.</li>
            <li> I was sent the mint flavored toothpaste not the orangy flavored one I ordered....I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, I got them from amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store....but this is the one in the store (not the one pictured and described by other reviewers).  I&#x27;m sure the product is great, just not the one I ordered.  Sigh.....</li>
            <li> Some idiot made orange juice flavored toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be great for parents to have on hand to use in punishing their children for swearing.</li>
            <li> This is the wife&#x27;s favorite toothpaste and it&#x27;s sometime difficult to locate locally so we just purchased 6 packages from amazon.  This probably a whole years work of toothpaste and for what we paid a great deal.</li>
            <li> It has a different texture, I assume from the deep bubbling action it claims to have. It is different, but I like it. The taste is what is a little off. I like an strong, almost overpowering mint. This does not have that strong of a mint flavor or feel.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste as the deep action foam makes my teeth feel extra clean.  The taste might throw you off slightly as its not mint but personally I think its the better tasting toothpaste in the market today.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Never in the history of toothpastes has such a toothpaste graced the inside of my mouth.  My gums are clean, my teeth are fully polished, My tounge is operating normally all thanks to this marvel of an invention from the fine folks at Aquafresh.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this toothpaste! It leaves your mouth feeling clean longer than anything else we&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Great taste and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  My favorite part is that is does not leave an after taste.  It cleans your mouth very well.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both agree that this is the best tasting, tangy, tingly and refreshing toothpaste we have ever used.  The price is lower than other brands and it appears to whiten just as well.  Kind of light orange and vanilla and perhaps some mint flavor that has a refreshing burst.</li>
            <li> Hands down the most repulsive smell and taste of any toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever encountered. Nowhere on the package does it mention the disgusting citrus/mint combo flavor. I will be throwing this in the garbage and buying something that doesn&#x27;t make me sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously amazing. This toothe paste not only makes your teeth feel clean but it makes your breath taste fresh. If you havent tried this I would suggest going to your local Walmart and trying it. Then purchase this package for all the tooth paste you will ever need!!! (not exactly). I reccommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Taste like Eucalyptus cough drops...so not very great brushing that around your mouth. Whoever taste tested this before it hit shelves should be fired! It seems to work as far as getting my mouth clean and fresh, even whitens noticeably.  Bubbles nicely.  Cap is gone and lost, hate the non flip too caps.</li>
            <li> This toothpast has the absolute worse taste i&#x27;ve ever tried in a paste before.  It&#x27;s so horrible.  It actually tastes like cough medicine or cough drops.  I usually don&#x27;t contact the mfr when I don&#x27;t like something.  I mean, we all are different and have different tastes.  However, I did contact them on this one.  It&#x27;s absolutely disgusting.  And toothpaste is supposed to taste good right?</li>
            <li> Chose this because it seemed like a good deal to purchase in bulk.  Love the tooth paste flavor and have enough for a year!</li>
            <li> Good deal on this product.</li>
            <li> Us this all the time lov it</li>
            <li> Despite tasting like a Hall&#x27;s mentholated cough drop, it really does clean well and leave you feeling minty. The taste is nasty though. Not sure if I pick up on lemon like others are describing. I taste more of a cough drop. Kinda nasty but you get used to it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this flavor again.</li>
