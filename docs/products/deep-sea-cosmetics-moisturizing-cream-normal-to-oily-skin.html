            <li>Fast shipping and great product thank you</li>
            <li>Much cheaper through Amazon and great service.</li>
            <li>this lotion again.it moisturizes pretty good.</li>
            <li>Great for your skin and will moisturized your face leaving a soft feel.  </li>
            <li>This price is incredible considering other sellers charge up to $45.  </li>
            <li>It is very light, yet leaves your face feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel as light and gentle as before, it basically feels just as if I am applying sunscreen rather than a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in good condition as expected.</li>
            <li>I usually deal with a rep out of Florida who gives me great discounts.</li>
            <li>I used to absolutely LOVE the Deep Sea Cosmetics moisturizer.</li>

            <li>highly recommend this cream for people with combination to oily skin.</li>
            <li>but after using it for a few days I fell in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is normal to oily and keeps my forehead from feeling oil.</li>
            <li>It prevents my skin from becoming oily during the day (which has always been a problem for me with other face creams!) and reduces the appearance of pimples/acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So much that now I buy it regularly from Amazon...thankfully for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li>I only gave this product a 3 star because there&#x27;s to much perfume.</li>

            <li>After trying various moisturizing creams and being disappointed, I finally found the perfect one for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin, so it is hard to find a moisturizer that preps my face for makeup, and I love this Deep Sea moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Initially I felt like I spent too much money for such a tiny bottle because I did buy it after talking with a very persuasive sales girl at the local mall...</li>
            <li>looking for something other than my normal gifts.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost two years and I am very pleased with it! It prevents my skin from becoming oily during the day (which has always been a problem for me with other face creams!) and reduces the appearance of pimples/acne.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream for people with combination to oily skin.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product a 3 star because there&#x27;s to much perfume. I don&#x27;t like to put perfume on my face, sad they don&#x27;t make it without perfume otherwise I would purchase this lotion again.it moisturizes pretty good.</li>
            <li> I used to absolutely LOVE the Deep Sea Cosmetics moisturizer. It was the only one I would use.   It was very light and gentle and left the skin radiant.  Now they have changed the formula to add sunblock to it, and it is completely different. It doesn&#x27;t feel as light and gentle as before, it basically feels just as if I am applying sunscreen rather than a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you have somewhat oily skin, this product is great.  It will help keep oils under control and soften the skin as well.</li>
            <li> Great for your skin and will moisturized your face leaving a soft feel.  You will really love this product. A++++</li>
            <li> After trying various moisturizing creams and being disappointed, I finally found the perfect one for my sensitive skin.  Initially I felt like I spent too much money for such a tiny bottle because I did buy it after talking with a very persuasive sales girl at the local mall...but after using it for a few days I fell in love with this product.  So much that now I buy it regularly from Amazon...thankfully for a much cheaper price :o)</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best facial lotions i have ever used.  It has firming effects and even helps with large pores.  This price is incredible considering other sellers charge up to $45.  Definitely a great addition to your skincare collection.</li>
            <li> DSC is the best thing I&#x27;ve put on my face, and I was grateful to find what I needed online with Amazon quickly.  I usually deal with a rep out of Florida who gives me great discounts.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It is very light, yet leaves your face feeling very soft. I have oily skin, so it is hard to find a moisturizer that preps my face for makeup, and I love this Deep Sea moisturizer. Also, a little goes a long way, so this will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> My wife likes it so. I dont know what it does, but she keeps it like a diamond</li>
            <li> My husband was walking the&lt;br /&gt;Mall looking for something other than my normal gifts. He came home with a big bag of deep sea cosmetics. They sold him the milk facewash but no toner or lotion. I guess i didn&#x27;t really need it but after a few days I ordered this lotion. Cute container and packaging. You only need one pump for your face, another if yih do your neck and chest. Smells okay. Decent product</li>
            <li> I just love this product. It has improved my skin and given me a more youthful look. I didn&#x27;r realize how much it had improved my looks until I went to visit some relatives I had not seen for a year. I got great compliments. I noticed my skin has tightened,because  I am a sagger and it had lifted my jaws.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in good condition as expected. The ingredients listed are quite standard as they go for these types of creams - with the addition of dead sea minerals. Being that I look for the luxury and natural ingredients incl. allantoin, aloe, olive oil, pycnogel,green tea, etc. and hope for elimination of acrylates .... sadly the latter ingredient is part of the product but not the former ones. However, I like the fragrance much and how it spreads on skin.... but it feels like abit thick on my picky combination skin - even though it is rated for normal to oily complexions... so I&#x27;ll be using it on arms and neck instead.&lt;br /&gt;For oilier complexions I have found serums to work better , and the brand from Vitacost&#x27;s line CSI work well for me as well as the Andalou line. Facial Skin hygeine  is difficult to figure out for some... Good Luck!</li>
            <li> So glad to have found this product on amazon, the price at the mall was outrageous. I love this product mostly, because after you apply it, you cant even tell its there, (so lightweight). I have oily skin, and this product seems to absorb it, also my face is smoother. I am sold, i even switched from a brand name moisturizer, (it&#x27;s just not nice to say which one), hope this helps, have a blessed day!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product thank you</li>
            <li> Did not like this product. It was very hard to rub in and was somewhat greasy. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I have very dry skin, but still had a problem getting it rubbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> Discovered this product through the kiosk at the mall. I like that it is normal to oily and keeps my forehead from feeling oil. Nice to have sunscreen built in the moisturizer. Much cheaper through Amazon and great service.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great!</li>
            <li> I really like this product . but the one I recieved from here it seams to break down for some reason</li>
