            <li>one of my favorite colors of china glaze</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and looks glossy and nice.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite go to summer colors.</li>

            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>Not to bright, just right.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own right, and for $4.99 and no shipping for this brand, a bargain!</li>
            <li>THAT I DO AMAZINGLY GOOD THANKS</li>
            <li>It looks so gorgeous, especially in natural light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M FABULOUS AND MY NAILS</li>
            <li>Coral color with a light sparkle.</li>
            <li>China Glaze Nail Lacquer, Mimosa&#x27;s Before Mani&#x27;s is a beautiful shimmery coral/orange pink.</li>

            <li>Ok not exactly as I imagined but not a bad color</li>
            <li>It is such a pretty color polish!!</li>
            <li>Color is not as vibrant as shown.  </li>
            <li>This seems a little watery, and sometimes it likes to settle with more pigment near the cuticle</li>
            <li>Everyone who has seen my nails has asked me what color it is and what salon I went to (since China Glaze ALWAYS looks professional, even when doing it at home and chasing a toddler around!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it at least applies well, but I wish it lasted longer on my nails.</li>
            <li>but if you apply enough coats carefully it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>

            <li> There is a slight glittery finish.</li>
            <li> bubble wrapped and in a small box.</li>
            <li> Too thin difficulty applying looks</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
