            <li>The almond oil (made by Now Solutions) seems to be working the best for me - it&#x27;s sold on Amazon and comes in a 16-ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>been on a quest to find the best organic aloe, but ironically Now Foods Aloe Gel has been the best performer even though it&#x27;s not organic.</li>

            <li>Easily the best Aloe gel I have found.</li>
            <li>I think applying it two times aday give you the optimum results</li>
            <li>Seeing a doctor might be a good idea too..</li>
            <li>To end this review all I have to say is that this product is good for just about any skin problem.</li>
            <li>Based on the ingredients this is a good aloe product but the smell is off putting.  </li>
            <li>It looks about as good as it smells in the bottle but disappears on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Ugh! would be good.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s good, but I don&#x27;t know how it works yet.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good price for an 8 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>and they also loved how their skin felt.</li>
            <li>This is a good product which I have ordered a number of times before and, as always , it came promptly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>but  there is nothing turn good.</li>
            <li>I decided to try aloe since i heard a lot of good thing about its healing properties.</li>
            <li>Regardless how you apply to your skin feels so good.</li>
            <li>It may be good for alot of things</li>
            <li>But my type of skin did not get a good reaction from the ingredients it had.</li>
            <li>Good for just about anything, except I wouldn&#x27;t use it on your face or neck, because the glycerin can cause cystic outbreaks if you&#x27;re prone.</li>
            <li>My skin glows all day and I&#x27;ve received many comments on how good my skin looks since I started doing this!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good for SoOoo Much more than that too!</li>
            <li>This is great to apply any time of day; it does not peel and feels cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li>great for so many uses.</li>
            <li>Not for face unless at night and then wash off as this stuff will peel, but otherwise this is awesome - best I&#x27;ve found for dry hands and sunburns</li>
            <li>Simply love it!</li>
            <li>The skin gel was one of the first products that I bought and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This product is one of my favorite things on Earth!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Sooo glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Those are pretty impressive</li>
            <li>so I sometimes mix it with my lotion and it leaves my skin silky smooth!!</li>
            <li>It is an okay product!</li>
            <li>My sister sent me bottle of this, and I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of the aloe is so pleasant, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Why is that amazing?</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s amazing to me.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s amazing on any skin issue I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, you can eat it put on your body ( for cuts bruises etc or body lotion) , hair(shampoo), face ( like an astringent) lubricant ( use your imagination).</li>
            <li>This product is really, really nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the skin&#x27;s own instinct to overproduce sebum to compensate loss of moisture.</li>
            <li>and marks are fading nicely.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice application and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>It works, loving this one.</li>
            <li>This product is great for your skin and it helps it look so clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>the CVS brand that I use does not flake off so I can use it more like a moisturizer, but because of the flaking off I always have to wash my face after using it which kind of defeats the purpose of using it.</li>
            <li>the best part is that is mostly natural</li>
            <li>This is also great to have on hand for your first aid kit, as Aloe Vera heals sunburns, cuts, abrasions, etc.</li>
            <li>, it has made a HUGE difference in my skin tone!</li>
            <li>Your skin will love this.</li>
            <li>I should have done more research, there are way too many additives</li>
            <li>The next best thing to breaking off a leaf from a growing plant!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I was healthy.  </li>
            <li>On top I put on some heavier lotion.     </li>
            <li>Like S. Morris, I had been using Lily of the Desert Aloe Vera Gelly for many years.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much more spreadable</li>
            <li>Most people say to use arnica.  </li>
            <li>So, the purer the better.   </li>
            <li>My skin continues to get better and better as time goes on.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I thought ok I&#x27;m gonna try it.</li>
            <li>I told him I&#x27;d rather have him be healthy</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Cleared up a bit of dermatitis that I had not been able to get rid of for months.</li>
            <li>better than store bought.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;flowers and berries&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>Provides relief for many skin issues including sunburn, itching, bug bites, etc.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This product works as a toner and moisturizer without stripping or thinning your skin as most toners will do</li>
            <li>Do you have ANY idea how many over-the-counter, beauty department, pharmacy, and &#x27;chemical&#x27;  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>so make sure to do so).</li>
            <li>We love this product..</li>
            <li>the hubby is a garbage man and every spring through fall the top of his arms itch.</li>
            <li>This has become one of my top beauty regimen.  </li>
            <li>this gel is wonderful and makes my skin look clearer and younger.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks a lot better.</li>
            <li>Love this aloe gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that this is an excellent product for burns and wounds (and I will save the 8 oz bottle I purchased for that purpose), but it didn&#x27;t work as a moisturizer for facial skin.  </li>
            <li>My favorite Aloe gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this gel.</li>

            <li>I love love love this gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product on my face and now my body for more than 2 months</li>
            <li>Use on my baby&#x27;s eczema with Vaseline on top.</li>
            <li>Works like magic.</li>
            <li>Also, I noticed that Aloe Life Skin Gel works the best out of all the different brands of aloe vera because it is 99% aloe vera (and has vitamins) unlike the drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Many would state they were, and then chemicals would be listed on the product label.</li>
            <li>love this aloe vera as close to the plant as you can get to, i use this as a eye lash growth,moisturizer,sun damage</li>
            <li>i use it more than one month</li>
            <li>Now they&#x27;ve added glycerin, xanthan gum, and more that I don&#x27;t feel like typing out...</li>
            <li>I love this aloe as I have skin allergies.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this skin gel.</li>
            <li>I used more than a dozen</li>
            <li>I cut myself shaving a couple times and this worked like magic in removing the marks afterwards.</li>
            <li>In fact, were it not for the root cause of IBS still being an issue, Im sure it would be healed already.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a year now, mostly in my hair.</li>
            <li>I  just love this gel.  </li>
            <li>In prevention of acne is my main reason for using this product, and it helps greatly in this</li>
            <li>This is my second order for this outstanding product, I will continue to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for dealer&#x27;s thoughtful service, Best!</li>
            <li>Pretty good for burns and rashes.</li>
            <li>Plus it doesn&#x27;t burn like most spot treatment, which is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Much better price and free prime shipping.    </li>
            <li>I am a 58 years old woman, and this works great on my skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and does not feel sticky or greasy</li>
            <li>This product is great for so many different things.  </li>
            <li>(And good luck finding one you like - none of the vaporizers on amazon are rated as high as I would like).</li>
            <li>This was, hands down, the best product that I used.</li>
            <li>To use as body lotion, I used a bit of jojoba oil (as suggested in previous reviews) and it works great!</li>
            <li>I am a person in my 50&#x27;s who wanted a product that would help with my fine wrinkles on my face as well as age spots.</li>
            <li>This product works fine and does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>this  is a wonderful product and it makes my skin  look and feel clean, it can be use for other stuff to</li>

            <li>I put a light coating on 2 to 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Free of clumps of additive junk (no perfumes, no alcohol), you can feel secure putting it on your face, your burns, or anywhere else.   </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make him acne free, but it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>fact that it doesn&#x27;t have to go in the frig is important to me because I put it on my son when he&#x27;s asleep.</li>
            <li>There is no secret as to how amazing aloe vera it.</li>
            <li>This a genuine organic product that works for everything.</li>

            <li>I puchased this product to use as a light moisturizer and healing agent under my makeup for my acne prone skin.  </li>

            <li>my friends have noticed how smooth my skin feels I let them&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li>and it came in secure packaging</li>
            <li>Someone please tell me this product is alcohol free?</li>
            <li>My skin type is fair, sensitive and I&#x27;ve had no issues with this</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great under my oil-free, water-based makeup, and I have definitely noticed an improvement in how healthy my skin looks, even after the first use.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product over a decade ago when it was called \\&quot;Wound Gel\\</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li>I hope all of this helps; even if it helps one person, it will be worth the time I took to write this review!</li>
            <li>I have been using fresh Certified Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Juice for many many years.  </li>
            <li>seemed to make the bites more hot and itchy</li>
            <li>Now I rarely ever get acne!</li>
            <li>After using it for just a week, my face redness and dryness has been significantly reduced and I have clearer, healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li>Also great for sun burns and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Just a bit of this + toilet paper works SO much better &amp; is MUCH better for the environment:)  </li>
            <li>This stuff goes on smooth, dries quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly because it&#x27;s a light oil and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Great for sunburn, winter dry skin, abrasions.</li>
            <li>The combination is lovely and flattering for my more mature fair skin and it is my daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I just cannot say enough good about this gel, it goes on silky smooth, dries quick</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more pure form of the gel.</li>
            <li>but I can say I LOVE this particular Aloe!</li>
            <li>The Now Solutions sweet almond oil is also reviewed on Amazon and a couple people said a 16-ounce bottle is a large amount of product, but if you have widespread skin issues, you&#x27;ll be glad you purchased the sweet almond oil in a 16-ounce size.</li>
            <li>looks like good stuff but hasnt help me heal some scarring i recently had.  </li>
            <li>It immediately felt soothing and cooling, and my very overstimulated skin was able to handle it.  </li>
            <li>My whole family loves it as well :)</li>
            <li>course having an aloe plant around is always a natural option too, but this is a nice, convenient size to have around the house.</li>
            <li>Get this stuff and create your own natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use this when wiping to cool and lubricate</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite aloe gel because it is alcohol free so it doesn&#x27;t sting when it gets into cuts, abrasions, cracked or damaged skin.</li>
            <li>I mean not aromatic, this is a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks VitaCost and Amazon.</li>
            <li>Oh, this item was shipped pretty quickly as well!</li>
            <li>It has improved my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>This brand of aloe vera gel is the most natural available for purchase.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly .</li>
            <li>Heals my rashes quickly</li>
            <li>But dries quickly with no sticky residue.</li>
            <li>I had to wash it off quickly and give him some allergy medication.</li>
            <li>So far so good, it lessens the itchiness to a point where it does not bother me as much as it used to.</li>
            <li>The smell during application does take time to get used to, but it evaporates quickly.  </li>
            <li>No other aloe products I&#x27;ve used gave me this kind of reaction.</li>
            <li>Good for minor skin irritations.  </li>
            <li>I have found that what works best is mixing this aloe gel with peppermint essential oil on a piece of toilet paper and applying as you would a tucks pad.</li>
            <li>Skin gel makes my face and hands feel so very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>With this product, I can wash my face with my gentle cleanser and be fine.</li>
            <li>No need to buy the special formula at the higher price per ounce.</li>
            <li>I believe aloe is such an amazing healing product</li>
            <li>I purchased this for post chemical peel skin care, and it works beautifully to calm and moisturize.</li>
            <li>Whole leaf Aloe makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Use whatever ratio works for you and have fun with this product.</li>
            <li>Many people in the natural health community believe that this explains why 50% of children with eczema will develop asthma.</li>
            <li>It has a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell to it; it seems that no fragrance was added as far as I can tell (and that&#x27;s a good thing for anyone whose skin is sensitive to skin products with fragrance in the formula).</li>
            <li>; is worth trying too, but it may or may not work on your skin.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It tightens my skin and give me a natural glow that I love.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the price scare you, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I know that fresh Aloevera gel can do wonders if it is taken out of the plant.</li>
            <li>I will write another review, once I get rid of my scars completely :)</li>
            <li>It is worth it for how well it works on sunburn.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t fault the product, as my son is sensitive to many things.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is organic and as close as you can get to using the natural aloe plant, but in a convenient bottle that you can travel with or keep in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>It is truly a hydrating and moisturizing gel and always makes my skin look fresh and youthful.  </li>
            <li>Amazon apparently sees this as OK based upon the fact that I made a special effort to bring this concern to an Amazon customer service BEFORE the order was prepared and shipped and they assured me it was the right product as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The product dries (not absorbs) pretty quick but after a minute it feels like my face has a mask on it</li>
            <li>This product stops the itchy right away.</li>
            <li>This aloe seems like it&#x27;s right out of the plant and into the bottle.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too soon right now to say.</li>
            <li>Buy a shampoo that&#x27;s formulated for sensitive skin (I purchased Sweet Baby Shampoo, 16 oz., Sulfate Free, No Parabens, Phthalates, Dyes, etc.).</li>
            <li>My current favorite solution is the sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>anyone who wants more hydrated youthful looking skin, who wants to heal blemishes quickly and help prevent scarring, who wants natural beauty care for their skin, and who wants a great anti-itch, cooling and healing topical for mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li>It is a very pure form of aloe unlike aloe that you find in drug stores and organic.</li>
            <li>Fast absorbing &amp; easy to dispense bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in LOVE with this product and it&#x27;s for a reasonable price and ALL natural!  </li>
            <li>I used fresh aloe vera plants when i could find them and fresh Certified Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Juice gel in addition.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help my son&#x27;s sensitive skin and acne, thinking it would be fine because it&#x27;s ALOE.  </li>
            <li>WHAT&#x27;S MORE, it dry out quickly on face....</li>
            <li>I went back and bought two more bottles.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it helps with myacne and it has helped to fade a lotof acne scaring left over years.</li>
            <li>Enough that I warned my family when they asked to use it they might not be pleased with the scent.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>At first I used it as a &#x27;primer&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Be gentle!).</li>
            <li>I found lots of uses for the gel, I use it on my hair,skin,and as a personal lubricant works lots better than KY gel</li>
            <li>and it works better than any commercial hair product.</li>
            <li>After a couple of days, when scabbing was evident and the wound was drying a bit, I began applying Aloe LIfe Skin Gel liberally on and around the injury.</li>
            <li>I love this and am  starting to read reviews to make sure I use in every way possible.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it makes my skin fell smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear foundation of face powder because I feel that they age me, but the aloe gel combined with the facial oil gives my skin a more youthful and dewy appearance.</li>
            <li>- I think because it was so hot during the day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend fresh Certified Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Juiceto</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m so glad I found this product</li>
            <li>just look at the most recent review and someone else has posted all of the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive never had skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>You do have to be consistent night and day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first I use on family and friends if they hurt themselves.</li>
            <li>This gel was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more</li>
            <li>It gives your hair a cool shine and it shapes hair nicely without being stiff as a board.</li>
            <li>Watery with clumps of gel, so you can easily end up with a huge mass of it on your hand even if you are careful.</li>
            <li>There are many other uses that I have also heard of e.g to cool and heal sunburn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a somewhat thin consistency and is odorless, good product!</li>
            <li>It also worked great on a hemorrhoid that came and went quickly because I used this gel mixed with a little bit of Tropical Traditions Coconut Oil</li>
            <li>If you read the Dead Sea Salts reviews on amazon, just keep in mind that a high percentage of the people who posted reviews were given free samples of the produce in exchange for &amp;#34;an honest review&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve rarely seen products on amazon reviewed in such large numbers in exchange for free samples.</li>
            <li>Most of the ingredients are from vitamins or herbs, the only one that&#x27;s not is potassium sorbate, which is considered a mild preservative and is a naturally occurring organic acid that is used as a mold</li>
            <li>Although both Eucerin and Cerave are dermatologist recommended products, I found that these two products (Cerave and Eucerin) work better after my skin is clear, rather than to clear it up after or during an outbreak.</li>
            <li>Slowly I transferred to using this product more and more.</li>
            <li>It is good to apply to mosquito bites in the summer and on little cooking burns!</li>
            <li>but this stuff is pretty close to pure and it works for all I use it for.</li>
            <li>find the aloe can be a little drying when used alone, so a little moisturizer applied right after is best.  </li>
            <li>I do not see positive results yet either.</li>
            <li>The long term solution is of course a lifestyle change for the better.</li>
            <li>No weird smell and really helps heal.  </li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much all the spot treatments, (benzyl peroxide, salicylic acid, ect.)</li>
            <li>recently discovered other great use for this aloe very is for anti-itch, cooling off and healing mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cooling and refreshing, but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I did not notice any tan coloring on my skin (and I am very fair skinned), or any flaking or peeling, as some other reviewers noted, but those problems could very well be due to applying it too thickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product claims it has pure ingredients, but I have seen no improvement in skin redness using this product.  </li>
            <li>That over the counter stuff is only good on roids that remain dry and don&#x27;t leak or bleed at all--I don&#x27;t think roids are so well behaved...</li>
            <li>However in time I started to notice the fine lines getting smaller and age spots started to fade.</li>
            <li>I did mix very high grade lavender in the gel for my wound.  </li>
            <li>Yes it costs a little more, but I think the cost is worth the results.</li>
            <li>and I see a huge difference in that area as well as my entire face.  </li>
            <li>and it really seems to help.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is really what aloe smells like when ground up, but the smell is really pungent.</li>
            <li>Feels very soothing after shaving and on sunburn.</li>
            <li>It also works much faster for my eczema than the Fruit of the Earth.</li>
            <li>It speeds cell recovery and heals your skin, just dont put t much on your face.</li>
            <li>Aloe Life Skin Gel has really calmed my skin.  </li>
            <li>This aloe gel has really healed exsisting acne scars and blemishes.  </li>
            <li>it added some much needed shine and softness.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really sticky, but its the real deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 99% certified organic whole leaf aloe vera, and contains vitamins A, C, &amp; E.</li>
            <li>To use as hair gel, use it straight (no adding needed).</li>
            <li>Used this on a skin graft and it really hurt going on but really protected the graft.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The Aloe Life Skin Gel product was received promptly, so thanks for that.</li>
            <li>of caution: It IS real aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>the delivery was very speedy as well....</li>
            <li>It seems to be very healing and quickens the healing  process of skin irritations or cuts on the body.</li>
            <li>Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Barbadensis Juice Concentrate, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Chamomimlla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Allantoin, Phospholipid, Retinol (</li>
            <li>fast shipment</li>
            <li>Not the real deal.</li>
            <li>feels very sticky when you try to remove it....</li>
            <li>and that can happen if you use too much of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that when I rub some on my t-zone it helps reduce some of the oil (and I have REALLY oily skin).</li>
            <li>I really regret buying it, for it doesn&#x27;t help at all</li>
            <li>And very soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li>Straight from the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ingredients: 99% certified organic whole leaf aloe vera juice concentrate, seaweed thickening agent, vitamin A, vitamin E, chamomile extract, extract from comfrey, vitamin C, citric acid, potassium sorbate.  </li>
            <li>So it really didn&#x27;t make any difference, to me.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I used it one time and it burned so much I had to wash it off.</li>
            <li>I suppose this is expected with a more natural version but is still worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ingredients are non-toxic, non-drying and very helpful.</li>
            <li>and it really helped soothe, shrink and heal it.</li>
            <li>Will clear it up right away.</li>
            <li>You know,the old \\&quot;eating right and exercise\\&quot; spiel...</li>
            <li>(so it&#x27;s actually a better deal compare to other cheaper gels since this gel lasts much longer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it on my skin as a moisturizer and for so many other things.  </li>
            <li>Great for oily/combination skin, especially when a normal products can be too heavy.</li>
            <li>It is the real deal and even though it cost more, it really costs less because you don&#x27;t need so much so often.</li>
            <li>I now just use a very gentle natural face wash and then this let it sit and fully absorb in</li>
            <li>I will not wait that long to enjoy this products benefits.</li>
            <li>I am currently going on Accutane, because my dermatologist agreed with me that, other than my acne, my skin &#x27;is&#x27; very healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool long lasting vitamin filled drink for my skin.</li>
            <li>That won&#x27;t solve the problem and you can&#x27;t use it daily for full body coverage.</li>
            <li>This successfully moisturizes my skin without being remotely irritating.</li>
            <li>It really makes my face feel healthy and tight.</li>
            <li>Works great after shaving, for small scars, and also after you come back indoors from the sun (I live in TX).   </li>
            <li>It stings, doesn&#x27;t get absorbed at all, sits at top of your skin like a plastic, hard transparent flaky mask...</li>
            <li>Less is better.</li>
            <li>Less is better.</li>
            <li>The results have been nothing less than astonishing to me.</li>
            <li>I use a lot more of it at night time and slather it on my face  for maximum benefits but use less during the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps my skin feel smooth, and it helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I thought I could use it at night during the summer as a light, natural facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I also tried Eucerin Skin Calming Daily Moisturizing Creme (14 Ounce Tube) and used this religiously for more than two years, every day.</li>
            <li>Extraordinary to watch it as it heals a simple cut over 3 days.</li>
            <li>Local people were amazed at how quickly my bites healed, that I wasn&#x27;t scratching them and that I had no scarring.  </li>
            <li>The bottle shown is from an older product line.</li>
            <li>When I tried to use a cosmetic sponge to put foundation on over top of it, it dissolved into a gooey mess.  </li>
            <li>you have a eczema problem like me and don&#x27;t want to use steroid, I highly recommend to try this gel.</li>
            <li>I ordered this a year ago on Amazon from BIG FLY SPORTS for $13.28... &amp; one year later the same product, same everything $28 ?!?  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for quicker-than-average healing of sunburns.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>The original Gelly had only 5 ingredients, all natural except for some carbomer for thickening.  </li>
            <li>It completely heals and repairs your skin!!</li>
            <li>I also rub a little aloe around my necks and smear up from my forehead into my hairline and top of head.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and mixes well with other products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally gush about beauty products</li>
            <li>I used to slather skin injuries with antibacterial ointments such as Neosporin, but I noticed that, while healing was complete, it was slow, and the scars remained bright pink for many months and even years.</li>
            <li>It is just a waste to buy something else when this product performs so much better</li>
            <li>I was pretty confused at first because I never though aloe would do anything for acne, but the next day my acne was sooooo much better!</li>
            <li>For now eat only easy to digest food,like brothy soups and salads with a simple oil and vinegar dressing...</li>
            <li>Has not caused any breakouts with my super sensitive skin, completly the opposite.</li>
            <li>I checked amazon right from my phone in the store (discreetly in a different part of the store).</li>
            <li>, however the acne gel is too strong for my chin area and caused a dark spot.</li>
            <li>price of a bottle is very reasonable and a large bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with the product and that a little of the gel goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t find it in a pharmacy store when I needed to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Now we are testing it on new tattoos.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li>Very natural.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty basic &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; routine and</li>
            <li>it has even helped to fade all my old acne scars too!</li>
            <li>I rubbed a small amount on my hands and face and found it interesting</li>
            <li>As a couple of people have already mentioned in comments attached to S. Morris&#x27;s review, I find that if I use the same amount of this Gel as I was accustomed to using of the Gelly, it&#x27;s far too much!  </li>
            <li>It leaves a smooth, thin layer on my skin which dries quickly</li>
            <li>, it felt very slimy going on, then dried onto skin quickly, did not leave any sticky or slimy residue on my hands or face.</li>
            <li>but if you rubbed it into your skin, it should be fine after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Or, if it does work, it might only work on certain parts of your body but not others.</li>
            <li>For now, I will go back to using the clear Lily of the Desert 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel.  </li>
            <li>there is other mild products, i will try them.</li>
            <li>I liked that this appeared natural w/o other dyes or alcohol that typical drug store &amp;#34;aloe&amp;#34; would have.</li>
            <li>I mix with Now almond oil for skin care that is natural and products are not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>This is a light moisturizer so it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy or filmy feeling at all on your skin.</li>
            <li>But I thought what the heck, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>As a result this gel cannot be used for all purposes as a/v directly from the leaf.  </li>
            <li>BUT,I would use Mill Creek a/v or a/v directly from the leaf...</li>
            <li>I will be looking for an organic product without so many negative ingredients.   </li>
            <li>Aloe contains salicylic acid naturally, so you gain the blemish fighting properties of SA without the drying.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for an all natural emmoliant to feed my skin after summer sun, winter dryness, and to neutralize after microdermabrasion treatments.</li>
            <li>Often as the child recovers from asthma, the eczema will reappear before complete healing takes place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then I use a natural sun screen with moisturizer in it and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>This happened to be once from Aloe Vera gel direct from the plant</li>
            <li>This happened to be once from Aloe Vera gel direct from the plant</li>
            <li>natural these days:</li>
            <li>My natural hair regimen is Jamaican Pimento Oil and aloe gel.</li>
            <li>I use this with oil as an all natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this to anyone who want a clear soft complexion and YES, I will be ordering this item again and again.</li>
            <li>If you avoid chemical products and are into natural alternatives, this is for you.</li>
            <li>so was surprised aloe in a jar worked so well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m on my second bottle and its really working.</li>
            <li>It also mixes well with oils and natural moisturizers</li>
            <li>I was searching for a natural.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be a natural alternative to reduce acne and oily face, it worsen both.</li>
            <li>The aloe draws heat out of the inflamed area and the peppermint cools it -- dual action.</li>
            <li>so I add a bit of natural oil...</li>
            <li>An unqualified endorsement as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>I also recommend Aloe Life&#x27;s personal lubricant gel for women; it really works and won&#x27;t irritate your flora or stain the sheets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used aloe before for burns and scars (and usually use it fresh from my aloe plant), but this was the first time for bruises.  </li>
            <li>This aloe gel is bit more expensive than others, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Skin Gel, by Aloe Life, is made from the entire plant using fresh juice and the yellow sap.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Now just finish up,wash your hands,and slowly sit down,this will secure the roid pad so it doesn&#x27;t slip away on you,lol!  </li>
            <li>This aloe gel is awesome, use it as an aftershave or for a moisturizer base before applying a longer term face care product with sun screen.</li>
            <li>I hate putting lotion or anything oily on my face but do need a moisturizer and this fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>and [[ASIN:B000PILCJU Avalon Organic Botanicals, Oil-Free Moisturizer, Rejuvenating, Vitamin C, 2 oz]]; however, this product is superior and does not have a ton of random nut and flower oils.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin A and E in my bottle are listed much lower in the ingredient list which means there is less of each vitamin in my bottle than the one shown; instead my bottle lists Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, and Phospholipid first...</li>
            <li>I wash my face with raw organic honey and jojoba oil and then mix a small dab of the aloe gel with jojoba oil or another of my favorite facial oils and smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li>Clean, firm, organic.</li>
            <li>I had read about this exact brand in numerous places online and went to a local health food store to test and buy it.</li>
            <li>I have re-ordered this product due to the high quality and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Bronners Castille soap and use a small amount of organic, fragrance free conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am usually for the purest source, but for every day use, I do prefer something which feels smooth instead.</li>
            <li>After searching several health-food stores for an acceptable replacement, I was delighted to find Aloe Life Skin Gel, which smells like a very weak herbal tea and even uses a seaweed derivative for thickening.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my dry skin (even without sunburn) and it really helped.</li>
            <li>My skin gets really dry in the winter, so I&#x27;ve done a lot of research (really a lot) on how to deal with it.</li>
            <li>I have dry, very curly hair</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne prone skin as an adult female.</li>
            <li>rather it was truly just aloe vera and not other ingredients.</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild adult acne, and I&#x27;ve found out that the harsh products I used as a teen don&#x27;t cut it anymore.  </li>
            <li>Also, the consistency is more liquidy than other aloe gels, which is not a huge problem, but after it dries, it starts to flake off.</li>
            <li>In the photos, the ingredients clearly list seaweed thickening agent as the second ingredient.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s enough to completely cover my face neck and collar of my chest.</li>
            <li>That product absorbs completely into the skin with no funky layer left over.</li>
            <li>This Aloe is not only natural but not overly smelly and sticky.</li>
            <li>I immediately applied it to his burn, and in a matter of hours he could barely feel the tingles of the burn.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work on my sensitive, picky, facial skin, but I do use it as a hair gel.</li>
            <li>I rub down with it twice a week after a hot bath.</li>
            <li>This Aloe provides a very pure source of Aloe, but it feels a little sticky.  </li>
            <li>A small wart had developed on the side of my face right at the edge where my sideburns end.  </li>
            <li>My favorite facial skin gel, just a little dab does the trick and the bottle lasted me 6 months!!!</li>
            <li>really like this product and will continue using for a long long time</li>
            <li>several occasions, I have used regular aloe from the drug store, and it does not work nearly as well as the whole-leaf aloe in this product.  </li>
            <li>Finally I bought this at a local natural foods store and applied it to the sores about every 30-60 minutes from 1pm until bedtime...</li>
            <li>My skin was becoming somewhat dry and dull.</li>
            <li>I also purchased &amp;#34;Babytime by Episencial Soothing Cream - Organic Eczema and Itchy Skin&amp;#34; (also sold on Amazon) but this product, designed for sensitive baby&#x27;s skin, seems to have fallen into 3rd place for daily use application - and it costs $11 for a small tube, which won&#x27;t last long when using it for nearly full body coverage.</li>
            <li>My wife wasn&#x27;t much of a fan because it has a odd odor.</li>
            <li>But now that I know to use considerably less, it works very well for me.    </li>
            <li>and she said it makes her make-up go on so much easier and spreads evenly while using less.</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old with a dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes this gel causes burning sensation on my face but it does work well both on moisturizing and  killing acnes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using it on my entire body I noticed a difference over night 5 days later my body is almost completely healed of the scars what more could I possibly ask for the smell is faint</li>
            <li>The gel is thick but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a little sticky but that is a sign of pure aloe.</li>
            <li>This aloe vera gel is great my only two complaints are that it smells a bit odd and it flakes like crazy.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Aloe Skin Gel for eczema along with Sweet Almond Oil and a couple other items in the hopes that at least one of them would help clear up my skin.</li>

            <li> I think applying it two times aday give you the optimum results</li>
            <li> Seeing a doctor might be a good idea too..</li>
            <li> To end this review all I have to say is that this product is good for just about any skin problem.</li>
            <li> Based on the ingredients this is a good aloe product but the smell is off putting.  </li>
            <li> It looks about as good as it smells in the bottle but disappears on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Ugh! would be good.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s good, but I don&#x27;t know how it works yet.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good price for an 8 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> and they also loved how their skin felt.</li>
            <li> This is a good product which I have ordered a number of times before and, as always , it came promptly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> but  there is nothing turn good.</li>
            <li> I decided to try aloe since i heard a lot of good thing about its healing properties.</li>
            <li> Regardless how you apply to your skin feels so good.</li>
            <li> It may be good for alot of things</li>
            <li> But my type of skin did not get a good reaction from the ingredients it had.</li>
            <li> Good for just about anything, except I wouldn&#x27;t use it on your face or neck, because the glycerin can cause cystic outbreaks if you&#x27;re prone.</li>
            <li> My skin glows all day and I&#x27;ve received many comments on how good my skin looks since I started doing this!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good for SoOoo Much more than that too!</li>
            <li> This is great to apply any time of day; it does not peel and feels cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li> great for so many uses.</li>
            <li> Not for face unless at night and then wash off as this stuff will peel, but otherwise this is awesome - best I&#x27;ve found for dry hands and sunburns</li>
            <li> Simply love it!</li>
            <li> The skin gel was one of the first products that I bought and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product is one of my favorite things on Earth!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Sooo glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Those are pretty impressive</li>
            <li> so I sometimes mix it with my lotion and it leaves my skin silky smooth!!</li>
            <li> It is an okay product!</li>
            <li> My sister sent me bottle of this, and I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of the aloe is so pleasant, I love it.  </li>
            <li> Why is that amazing?</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s amazing to me.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s amazing on any skin issue I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, you can eat it put on your body ( for cuts bruises etc or body lotion) , hair(shampoo), face ( like an astringent) lubricant ( use your imagination).</li>
            <li> This product is really, really nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the skin&#x27;s own instinct to overproduce sebum to compensate loss of moisture.</li>
            <li> and marks are fading nicely.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice application and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> It works, loving this one.</li>
            <li> This product is great for your skin and it helps it look so clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> the CVS brand that I use does not flake off so I can use it more like a moisturizer, but because of the flaking off I always have to wash my face after using it which kind of defeats the purpose of using it.</li>
            <li> the best part is that is mostly natural</li>
            <li> This is also great to have on hand for your first aid kit, as Aloe Vera heals sunburns, cuts, abrasions, etc.</li>
            <li> , it has made a HUGE difference in my skin tone!</li>
            <li> Your skin will love this.</li>
            <li> I should have done more research, there are way too many additives</li>
            <li> The next best thing to breaking off a leaf from a growing plant!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I was healthy.  </li>
            <li> On top I put on some heavier lotion.     </li>
            <li> Like S. Morris, I had been using Lily of the Desert Aloe Vera Gelly for many years.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much more spreadable</li>
            <li> Most people say to use arnica.  </li>
            <li> So, the purer the better.   </li>
            <li> My skin continues to get better and better as time goes on.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I thought ok I&#x27;m gonna try it.</li>
            <li> I told him I&#x27;d rather have him be healthy</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Cleared up a bit of dermatitis that I had not been able to get rid of for months.</li>
            <li> better than store bought.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;flowers and berries&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li> Provides relief for many skin issues including sunburn, itching, bug bites, etc.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This product works as a toner and moisturizer without stripping or thinning your skin as most toners will do</li>
            <li> Do you have ANY idea how many over-the-counter, beauty department, pharmacy, and &#x27;chemical&#x27;  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> so make sure to do so).</li>
            <li> We love this product..</li>
            <li> the hubby is a garbage man and every spring through fall the top of his arms itch.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my top beauty regimen.  </li>
            <li> this gel is wonderful and makes my skin look clearer and younger.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> Love this aloe gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that this is an excellent product for burns and wounds (and I will save the 8 oz bottle I purchased for that purpose), but it didn&#x27;t work as a moisturizer for facial skin.  </li>
            <li> My favorite Aloe gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this gel.</li>

            <li> I love love love this gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product on my face and now my body for more than 2 months</li>
            <li> Use on my baby&#x27;s eczema with Vaseline on top.</li>
            <li> Works like magic.</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that Aloe Life Skin Gel works the best out of all the different brands of aloe vera because it is 99% aloe vera (and has vitamins) unlike the drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Many would state they were, and then chemicals would be listed on the product label.</li>
            <li> love this aloe vera as close to the plant as you can get to, i use this as a eye lash growth,moisturizer,sun damage</li>
            <li> i use it more than one month</li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;ve added glycerin, xanthan gum, and more that I don&#x27;t feel like typing out...</li>
            <li> I love this aloe as I have skin allergies.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this skin gel.</li>
            <li> I used more than a dozen</li>
            <li> I cut myself shaving a couple times and this worked like magic in removing the marks afterwards.</li>
            <li> In fact, were it not for the root cause of IBS still being an issue, Im sure it would be healed already.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year now, mostly in my hair.</li>
            <li> I  just love this gel.  </li>
            <li> In prevention of acne is my main reason for using this product, and it helps greatly in this</li>
            <li> This is my second order for this outstanding product, I will continue to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for dealer&#x27;s thoughtful service, Best!</li>
            <li> Pretty good for burns and rashes.</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t burn like most spot treatment, which is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Much better price and free prime shipping.    </li>
            <li> I am a 58 years old woman, and this works great on my skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and does not feel sticky or greasy</li>
            <li> This product is great for so many different things.  </li>
            <li> (And good luck finding one you like - none of the vaporizers on amazon are rated as high as I would like).</li>
            <li> This was, hands down, the best product that I used.</li>
            <li> To use as body lotion, I used a bit of jojoba oil (as suggested in previous reviews) and it works great!</li>
            <li> I am a person in my 50&#x27;s who wanted a product that would help with my fine wrinkles on my face as well as age spots.</li>
            <li> This product works fine and does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> this  is a wonderful product and it makes my skin  look and feel clean, it can be use for other stuff to</li>
            <li> No alcohol (no stinging), just pure aloe goodness that is remarkably effective to heal damaged skin.</li>
            <li> Enjoy ^_^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I put a light coating on 2 to 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Free of clumps of additive junk (no perfumes, no alcohol), you can feel secure putting it on your face, your burns, or anywhere else.   </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make him acne free, but it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> fact that it doesn&#x27;t have to go in the frig is important to me because I put it on my son when he&#x27;s asleep.</li>
            <li> There is no secret as to how amazing aloe vera it.</li>
            <li> This a genuine organic product that works for everything.</li>
            <li> Use Basis soap instead (available on amazon in a six pack).</li>
            <li> A light moisturizer for all seasons.</li>
            <li> I puchased this product to use as a light moisturizer and healing agent under my makeup for my acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I can see that it is GENUINE Aloevera</li>
            <li> your skin will be a smooth a glass...........</li>
            <li> my friends have noticed how smooth my skin feels I let them&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li> and it came in secure packaging</li>
            <li> Someone please tell me this product is alcohol free?</li>
            <li> My skin type is fair, sensitive and I&#x27;ve had no issues with this</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great under my oil-free, water-based makeup, and I have definitely noticed an improvement in how healthy my skin looks, even after the first use.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product over a decade ago when it was called \\&quot;Wound Gel\\</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li> I hope all of this helps; even if it helps one person, it will be worth the time I took to write this review!</li>
            <li> I have been using fresh Certified Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Juice for many many years.  </li>
            <li> seemed to make the bites more hot and itchy</li>
            <li> Now I rarely ever get acne!</li>
            <li> After using it for just a week, my face redness and dryness has been significantly reduced and I have clearer, healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> Also great for sun burns and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Just a bit of this + toilet paper works SO much better &amp; is MUCH better for the environment:)  </li>
            <li> This stuff goes on smooth, dries quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly because it&#x27;s a light oil and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Great for sunburn, winter dry skin, abrasions.</li>
            <li> The combination is lovely and flattering for my more mature fair skin and it is my daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I just cannot say enough good about this gel, it goes on silky smooth, dries quick</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more pure form of the gel.</li>
            <li> but I can say I LOVE this particular Aloe!</li>
            <li> The Now Solutions sweet almond oil is also reviewed on Amazon and a couple people said a 16-ounce bottle is a large amount of product, but if you have widespread skin issues, you&#x27;ll be glad you purchased the sweet almond oil in a 16-ounce size.</li>
            <li> looks like good stuff but hasnt help me heal some scarring i recently had.  </li>
            <li> It immediately felt soothing and cooling, and my very overstimulated skin was able to handle it.  </li>
            <li> My whole family loves it as well :)</li>
            <li> course having an aloe plant around is always a natural option too, but this is a nice, convenient size to have around the house.</li>
            <li> Get this stuff and create your own natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use this when wiping to cool and lubricate</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite aloe gel because it is alcohol free so it doesn&#x27;t sting when it gets into cuts, abrasions, cracked or damaged skin.</li>
            <li> I mean not aromatic, this is a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks VitaCost and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Oh, this item was shipped pretty quickly as well!</li>
            <li> It has improved my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> This brand of aloe vera gel is the most natural available for purchase.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly .</li>
            <li> Heals my rashes quickly</li>
            <li> But dries quickly with no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I had to wash it off quickly and give him some allergy medication.</li>
            <li> So far so good, it lessens the itchiness to a point where it does not bother me as much as it used to.</li>
            <li> The smell during application does take time to get used to, but it evaporates quickly.  </li>
            <li> No other aloe products I&#x27;ve used gave me this kind of reaction.</li>
            <li> Good for minor skin irritations.  </li>
            <li> I have found that what works best is mixing this aloe gel with peppermint essential oil on a piece of toilet paper and applying as you would a tucks pad.</li>
            <li> Skin gel makes my face and hands feel so very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> With this product, I can wash my face with my gentle cleanser and be fine.</li>
            <li> No need to buy the special formula at the higher price per ounce.</li>
            <li> I believe aloe is such an amazing healing product</li>
            <li> I purchased this for post chemical peel skin care, and it works beautifully to calm and moisturize.</li>
            <li> Whole leaf Aloe makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Use whatever ratio works for you and have fun with this product.</li>
            <li> Many people in the natural health community believe that this explains why 50% of children with eczema will develop asthma.</li>
            <li> It has a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell to it; it seems that no fragrance was added as far as I can tell (and that&#x27;s a good thing for anyone whose skin is sensitive to skin products with fragrance in the formula).</li>
            <li> ; is worth trying too, but it may or may not work on your skin.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It tightens my skin and give me a natural glow that I love.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price scare you, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I know that fresh Aloevera gel can do wonders if it is taken out of the plant.</li>
            <li> I will write another review, once I get rid of my scars completely :)</li>
            <li> It is worth it for how well it works on sunburn.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t fault the product, as my son is sensitive to many things.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is organic and as close as you can get to using the natural aloe plant, but in a convenient bottle that you can travel with or keep in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It is truly a hydrating and moisturizing gel and always makes my skin look fresh and youthful.  </li>
            <li> Amazon apparently sees this as OK based upon the fact that I made a special effort to bring this concern to an Amazon customer service BEFORE the order was prepared and shipped and they assured me it was the right product as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The product dries (not absorbs) pretty quick but after a minute it feels like my face has a mask on it</li>
            <li> This product stops the itchy right away.</li>
            <li> This aloe seems like it&#x27;s right out of the plant and into the bottle.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too soon right now to say.</li>
            <li> Buy a shampoo that&#x27;s formulated for sensitive skin (I purchased Sweet Baby Shampoo, 16 oz., Sulfate Free, No Parabens, Phthalates, Dyes, etc.).</li>
            <li> My current favorite solution is the sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> anyone who wants more hydrated youthful looking skin, who wants to heal blemishes quickly and help prevent scarring, who wants natural beauty care for their skin, and who wants a great anti-itch, cooling and healing topical for mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li> It is a very pure form of aloe unlike aloe that you find in drug stores and organic.</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing &amp; easy to dispense bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with this product and it&#x27;s for a reasonable price and ALL natural!  </li>
            <li> I used fresh aloe vera plants when i could find them and fresh Certified Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Juice gel in addition.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my son&#x27;s sensitive skin and acne, thinking it would be fine because it&#x27;s ALOE.  </li>
            <li> WHAT&#x27;S MORE, it dry out quickly on face....</li>
            <li> I went back and bought two more bottles.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, it helps with myacne and it has helped to fade a lotof acne scaring left over years.</li>
            <li> Enough that I warned my family when they asked to use it they might not be pleased with the scent.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> At first I used it as a &#x27;primer&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Be gentle!).</li>
            <li> I found lots of uses for the gel, I use it on my hair,skin,and as a personal lubricant works lots better than KY gel</li>
            <li> and it works better than any commercial hair product.</li>
            <li> After a couple of days, when scabbing was evident and the wound was drying a bit, I began applying Aloe LIfe Skin Gel liberally on and around the injury.</li>
            <li> I love this and am  starting to read reviews to make sure I use in every way possible.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it makes my skin fell smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear foundation of face powder because I feel that they age me, but the aloe gel combined with the facial oil gives my skin a more youthful and dewy appearance.</li>
            <li> - I think because it was so hot during the day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend fresh Certified Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Juiceto</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m so glad I found this product</li>
            <li> just look at the most recent review and someone else has posted all of the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive never had skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> You do have to be consistent night and day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the first I use on family and friends if they hurt themselves.</li>
            <li> This gel was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more</li>
            <li> It gives your hair a cool shine and it shapes hair nicely without being stiff as a board.</li>
            <li> Watery with clumps of gel, so you can easily end up with a huge mass of it on your hand even if you are careful.</li>
            <li> There are many other uses that I have also heard of e.g to cool and heal sunburn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a somewhat thin consistency and is odorless, good product!</li>
            <li> It also worked great on a hemorrhoid that came and went quickly because I used this gel mixed with a little bit of Tropical Traditions Coconut Oil</li>
            <li> If you read the Dead Sea Salts reviews on amazon, just keep in mind that a high percentage of the people who posted reviews were given free samples of the produce in exchange for &amp;#34;an honest review&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve rarely seen products on amazon reviewed in such large numbers in exchange for free samples.</li>
            <li> Most of the ingredients are from vitamins or herbs, the only one that&#x27;s not is potassium sorbate, which is considered a mild preservative and is a naturally occurring organic acid that is used as a mold</li>
            <li> Although both Eucerin and Cerave are dermatologist recommended products, I found that these two products (Cerave and Eucerin) work better after my skin is clear, rather than to clear it up after or during an outbreak.</li>
            <li> Slowly I transferred to using this product more and more.</li>
            <li> It is good to apply to mosquito bites in the summer and on little cooking burns!</li>
            <li> but this stuff is pretty close to pure and it works for all I use it for.</li>
            <li> find the aloe can be a little drying when used alone, so a little moisturizer applied right after is best.  </li>
            <li> I do not see positive results yet either.</li>
            <li> The long term solution is of course a lifestyle change for the better.</li>
            <li> No weird smell and really helps heal.  </li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much all the spot treatments, (benzyl peroxide, salicylic acid, ect.)</li>
            <li> recently discovered other great use for this aloe very is for anti-itch, cooling off and healing mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cooling and refreshing, but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any tan coloring on my skin (and I am very fair skinned), or any flaking or peeling, as some other reviewers noted, but those problems could very well be due to applying it too thickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product claims it has pure ingredients, but I have seen no improvement in skin redness using this product.  </li>
            <li> That over the counter stuff is only good on roids that remain dry and don&#x27;t leak or bleed at all--I don&#x27;t think roids are so well behaved...</li>
            <li> However in time I started to notice the fine lines getting smaller and age spots started to fade.</li>
            <li> I did mix very high grade lavender in the gel for my wound.  </li>
            <li> Yes it costs a little more, but I think the cost is worth the results.</li>
            <li> and I see a huge difference in that area as well as my entire face.  </li>
            <li> and it really seems to help.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is really what aloe smells like when ground up, but the smell is really pungent.</li>
            <li> Feels very soothing after shaving and on sunburn.</li>
            <li> It also works much faster for my eczema than the Fruit of the Earth.</li>
            <li> It speeds cell recovery and heals your skin, just dont put t much on your face.</li>
            <li> Aloe Life Skin Gel has really calmed my skin.  </li>
            <li> This aloe gel has really healed exsisting acne scars and blemishes.  </li>
            <li> it added some much needed shine and softness.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really sticky, but its the real deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 99% certified organic whole leaf aloe vera, and contains vitamins A, C, &amp; E.</li>
            <li> To use as hair gel, use it straight (no adding needed).</li>
            <li> Used this on a skin graft and it really hurt going on but really protected the graft.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The Aloe Life Skin Gel product was received promptly, so thanks for that.</li>
            <li> of caution: It IS real aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> the delivery was very speedy as well....</li>
            <li> It seems to be very healing and quickens the healing  process of skin irritations or cuts on the body.</li>
            <li> Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Barbadensis Juice Concentrate, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Chamomimlla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Allantoin, Phospholipid, Retinol (</li>
            <li> fast shipment</li>
            <li> Not the real deal.</li>
            <li> feels very sticky when you try to remove it....</li>
            <li> and that can happen if you use too much of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that when I rub some on my t-zone it helps reduce some of the oil (and I have REALLY oily skin).</li>
            <li> I really regret buying it, for it doesn&#x27;t help at all</li>
            <li> And very soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li> Straight from the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ingredients: 99% certified organic whole leaf aloe vera juice concentrate, seaweed thickening agent, vitamin A, vitamin E, chamomile extract, extract from comfrey, vitamin C, citric acid, potassium sorbate.  </li>
            <li> So it really didn&#x27;t make any difference, to me.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I used it one time and it burned so much I had to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I suppose this is expected with a more natural version but is still worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ingredients are non-toxic, non-drying and very helpful.</li>
            <li> and it really helped soothe, shrink and heal it.</li>
            <li> Will clear it up right away.</li>
            <li> You know,the old \\&quot;eating right and exercise\\&quot; spiel...</li>
            <li> (so it&#x27;s actually a better deal compare to other cheaper gels since this gel lasts much longer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it on my skin as a moisturizer and for so many other things.  </li>
            <li> Great for oily/combination skin, especially when a normal products can be too heavy.</li>
            <li> It is the real deal and even though it cost more, it really costs less because you don&#x27;t need so much so often.</li>
            <li> I now just use a very gentle natural face wash and then this let it sit and fully absorb in</li>
            <li> I will not wait that long to enjoy this products benefits.</li>
            <li> I am currently going on Accutane, because my dermatologist agreed with me that, other than my acne, my skin &#x27;is&#x27; very healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool long lasting vitamin filled drink for my skin.</li>
            <li> That won&#x27;t solve the problem and you can&#x27;t use it daily for full body coverage.</li>
            <li> This successfully moisturizes my skin without being remotely irritating.</li>
            <li> It really makes my face feel healthy and tight.</li>
            <li> Works great after shaving, for small scars, and also after you come back indoors from the sun (I live in TX).   </li>
            <li> It stings, doesn&#x27;t get absorbed at all, sits at top of your skin like a plastic, hard transparent flaky mask...</li>
            <li> Less is better.</li>
            <li> Less is better.</li>
            <li> The results have been nothing less than astonishing to me.</li>
            <li> I use a lot more of it at night time and slather it on my face  for maximum benefits but use less during the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps my skin feel smooth, and it helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I thought I could use it at night during the summer as a light, natural facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I also tried Eucerin Skin Calming Daily Moisturizing Creme (14 Ounce Tube) and used this religiously for more than two years, every day.</li>
            <li> Extraordinary to watch it as it heals a simple cut over 3 days.</li>
            <li> Local people were amazed at how quickly my bites healed, that I wasn&#x27;t scratching them and that I had no scarring.  </li>
            <li> The bottle shown is from an older product line.</li>
            <li> When I tried to use a cosmetic sponge to put foundation on over top of it, it dissolved into a gooey mess.  </li>
            <li> you have a eczema problem like me and don&#x27;t want to use steroid, I highly recommend to try this gel.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a year ago on Amazon from BIG FLY SPORTS for $13.28... &amp; one year later the same product, same everything $28 ?!?  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for quicker-than-average healing of sunburns.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> The original Gelly had only 5 ingredients, all natural except for some carbomer for thickening.  </li>
            <li> It completely heals and repairs your skin!!</li>
            <li> I also rub a little aloe around my necks and smear up from my forehead into my hairline and top of head.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily and mixes well with other products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally gush about beauty products</li>
            <li> I used to slather skin injuries with antibacterial ointments such as Neosporin, but I noticed that, while healing was complete, it was slow, and the scars remained bright pink for many months and even years.</li>
            <li> It is just a waste to buy something else when this product performs so much better</li>
            <li> I was pretty confused at first because I never though aloe would do anything for acne, but the next day my acne was sooooo much better!</li>
            <li> For now eat only easy to digest food,like brothy soups and salads with a simple oil and vinegar dressing...</li>
            <li> Has not caused any breakouts with my super sensitive skin, completly the opposite.</li>
            <li> I checked amazon right from my phone in the store (discreetly in a different part of the store).</li>
            <li> , however the acne gel is too strong for my chin area and caused a dark spot.</li>
            <li> price of a bottle is very reasonable and a large bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with the product and that a little of the gel goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t find it in a pharmacy store when I needed to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Now we are testing it on new tattoos.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li> Very natural.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty basic &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; routine and</li>
            <li> it has even helped to fade all my old acne scars too!</li>
            <li> I rubbed a small amount on my hands and face and found it interesting</li>
            <li> As a couple of people have already mentioned in comments attached to S. Morris&#x27;s review, I find that if I use the same amount of this Gel as I was accustomed to using of the Gelly, it&#x27;s far too much!  </li>
            <li> It leaves a smooth, thin layer on my skin which dries quickly</li>
            <li> , it felt very slimy going on, then dried onto skin quickly, did not leave any sticky or slimy residue on my hands or face.</li>
            <li> but if you rubbed it into your skin, it should be fine after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Or, if it does work, it might only work on certain parts of your body but not others.</li>
            <li> For now, I will go back to using the clear Lily of the Desert 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel.  </li>
            <li> there is other mild products, i will try them.</li>
            <li> I liked that this appeared natural w/o other dyes or alcohol that typical drug store &amp;#34;aloe&amp;#34; would have.</li>
            <li> I mix with Now almond oil for skin care that is natural and products are not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> This is a light moisturizer so it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy or filmy feeling at all on your skin.</li>
            <li> But I thought what the heck, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> As a result this gel cannot be used for all purposes as a/v directly from the leaf.  </li>
            <li> BUT,I would use Mill Creek a/v or a/v directly from the leaf...</li>
            <li> I will be looking for an organic product without so many negative ingredients.   </li>
            <li> Aloe contains salicylic acid naturally, so you gain the blemish fighting properties of SA without the drying.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural emmoliant to feed my skin after summer sun, winter dryness, and to neutralize after microdermabrasion treatments.</li>
            <li> Often as the child recovers from asthma, the eczema will reappear before complete healing takes place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I use a natural sun screen with moisturizer in it and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> This happened to be once from Aloe Vera gel direct from the plant</li>
            <li> This happened to be once from Aloe Vera gel direct from the plant</li>
            <li> natural these days:</li>
            <li> My natural hair regimen is Jamaican Pimento Oil and aloe gel.</li>
            <li> I use this with oil as an all natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this to anyone who want a clear soft complexion and YES, I will be ordering this item again and again.</li>
            <li> If you avoid chemical products and are into natural alternatives, this is for you.</li>
            <li> so was surprised aloe in a jar worked so well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m on my second bottle and its really working.</li>
            <li> It also mixes well with oils and natural moisturizers</li>
            <li> I was searching for a natural.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a natural alternative to reduce acne and oily face, it worsen both.</li>
            <li> The aloe draws heat out of the inflamed area and the peppermint cools it -- dual action.</li>
            <li> so I add a bit of natural oil...</li>
            <li> An unqualified endorsement as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> I also recommend Aloe Life&#x27;s personal lubricant gel for women; it really works and won&#x27;t irritate your flora or stain the sheets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used aloe before for burns and scars (and usually use it fresh from my aloe plant), but this was the first time for bruises.  </li>
            <li> This aloe gel is bit more expensive than others, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Skin Gel, by Aloe Life, is made from the entire plant using fresh juice and the yellow sap.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Now just finish up,wash your hands,and slowly sit down,this will secure the roid pad so it doesn&#x27;t slip away on you,lol!  </li>
            <li> This aloe gel is awesome, use it as an aftershave or for a moisturizer base before applying a longer term face care product with sun screen.</li>
            <li> I hate putting lotion or anything oily on my face but do need a moisturizer and this fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> and [[ASIN:B000PILCJU Avalon Organic Botanicals, Oil-Free Moisturizer, Rejuvenating, Vitamin C, 2 oz]]; however, this product is superior and does not have a ton of random nut and flower oils.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin A and E in my bottle are listed much lower in the ingredient list which means there is less of each vitamin in my bottle than the one shown; instead my bottle lists Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, and Phospholipid first...</li>
            <li> I wash my face with raw organic honey and jojoba oil and then mix a small dab of the aloe gel with jojoba oil or another of my favorite facial oils and smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li> Clean, firm, organic.</li>
            <li> I had read about this exact brand in numerous places online and went to a local health food store to test and buy it.</li>
            <li> I have re-ordered this product due to the high quality and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Bronners Castille soap and use a small amount of organic, fragrance free conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am usually for the purest source, but for every day use, I do prefer something which feels smooth instead.</li>
            <li> After searching several health-food stores for an acceptable replacement, I was delighted to find Aloe Life Skin Gel, which smells like a very weak herbal tea and even uses a seaweed derivative for thickening.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my dry skin (even without sunburn) and it really helped.</li>
            <li> My skin gets really dry in the winter, so I&#x27;ve done a lot of research (really a lot) on how to deal with it.</li>
            <li> I have dry, very curly hair</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone skin as an adult female.</li>
            <li> rather it was truly just aloe vera and not other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild adult acne, and I&#x27;ve found out that the harsh products I used as a teen don&#x27;t cut it anymore.  </li>
            <li> Also, the consistency is more liquidy than other aloe gels, which is not a huge problem, but after it dries, it starts to flake off.</li>
            <li> In the photos, the ingredients clearly list seaweed thickening agent as the second ingredient.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s enough to completely cover my face neck and collar of my chest.</li>
            <li> That product absorbs completely into the skin with no funky layer left over.</li>
            <li> This Aloe is not only natural but not overly smelly and sticky.</li>
            <li> I immediately applied it to his burn, and in a matter of hours he could barely feel the tingles of the burn.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my sensitive, picky, facial skin, but I do use it as a hair gel.</li>
            <li> I rub down with it twice a week after a hot bath.</li>
            <li> This Aloe provides a very pure source of Aloe, but it feels a little sticky.  </li>
            <li> A small wart had developed on the side of my face right at the edge where my sideburns end.  </li>
            <li> My favorite facial skin gel, just a little dab does the trick and the bottle lasted me 6 months!!!</li>
            <li> really like this product and will continue using for a long long time</li>
            <li> several occasions, I have used regular aloe from the drug store, and it does not work nearly as well as the whole-leaf aloe in this product.  </li>
            <li> Finally I bought this at a local natural foods store and applied it to the sores about every 30-60 minutes from 1pm until bedtime...</li>
            <li> My skin was becoming somewhat dry and dull.</li>
            <li> I also purchased &amp;#34;Babytime by Episencial Soothing Cream - Organic Eczema and Itchy Skin&amp;#34; (also sold on Amazon) but this product, designed for sensitive baby&#x27;s skin, seems to have fallen into 3rd place for daily use application - and it costs $11 for a small tube, which won&#x27;t last long when using it for nearly full body coverage.</li>
            <li> My wife wasn&#x27;t much of a fan because it has a odd odor.</li>
            <li> But now that I know to use considerably less, it works very well for me.    </li>
            <li> and she said it makes her make-up go on so much easier and spreads evenly while using less.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old with a dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes this gel causes burning sensation on my face but it does work well both on moisturizing and  killing acnes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using it on my entire body I noticed a difference over night 5 days later my body is almost completely healed of the scars what more could I possibly ask for the smell is faint</li>
            <li> The gel is thick but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky but that is a sign of pure aloe.</li>
            <li> This aloe vera gel is great my only two complaints are that it smells a bit odd and it flakes like crazy.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Aloe Skin Gel for eczema along with Sweet Almond Oil and a couple other items in the hopes that at least one of them would help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> This aloe gel, on the other hand, has worked perfectly so far in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Also, as with all other natural products, you may have an allergic reaction to it if you &#x27;glob&#x27; it on.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure if this product is made of pure aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and I have tried so many moisturizers over the years, but they would either be too greasy or unable to combat the dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li> It also gives me a some slight sun protection too from what I understand (I have read that aloe and the facial oils that I use have a natural SPF).  </li>
            <li> 3 star only because of smell though it didn&#x27;t for long time .</li>
            <li> Ride long enough and it happens.</li>
            <li> It felt nice, but was very expensive.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s recovering from eczema, and if the gel is cold, it is more likely to wake him up.</li>
            <li> this is the only aloe lotion my wife will buy, with Dry itchy skin in the winter</li>
            <li> It does, however, dry my skin out, but I think that is from applying a larger amount.</li>
            <li> It has replaced my previous moisturizer completely.</li>
            <li> Using the toilet at times.</li>
            <li> but if you use it/mix it with lotions that are thin (not creamy and absorb quickly)</li>
            <li> When the price soared months ago, I tried some products from some other brands, but finally decided to go back to this one.</li>
            <li> I use this as my hand lotion, facial moisturizer, cure for dry itchy skin, and healer for dry cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> I had a minor scratch on my cheek</li>
            <li> after a few days my feet heels are almost completely soft again.</li>
            <li> It does not have any added perfume, and has minimal preservatives (citric acid and potassium sorbate, which is not an issue for me personally.)</li>
            <li> The flakiness of this product, while indicative of sap present, makes it harder to work with and has to be paired with lotion.</li>
            <li> Something else that I noticed was my skin did not look as pale as it naturally is and people have made comments that my face looks tanned.</li>
            <li> The gel is less thick so gets absorbed to skin quicker</li>
            <li> I let it sit on my skin to absorb for about ten minutes, but unlike other aloe gels/juices I have used, it didn&#x27;t fully absorb and created a strange layer of tan peeling flakes on my face.  </li>
            <li> have since given this product to several people who have had wounds or burns and it has helped all of them with a speedier recovery than other products would allow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only a little bit is needed to coat the entire face.</li>
            <li> The only other product I may try is Aubrey Organics Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;Stop</li>
            <li> The one thing I can comment on that I have seen a few other people comment about it when they&#x27;re mentioning a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; left on there skin that is simply because they&#x27;re using too much and a small tinsy bit goes a Longgggg way</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Prefer the unscented to other similar aloe gels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me though, as long as it does the job of healing my skin!</li>
            <li> I let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
            <li> moisturizers I have used in my life in an attempt to NOT have dry skin?</li>
            <li> Aloe alone makes my skin dry after it dries</li>
            <li> so i add a pinch of emu oil to eliminate the dry look.</li>
            <li> In the winter, I use it for dry skin (Also use lotion).  </li>
            <li> Additionally, it leaves a brown residue when dry.</li>
            <li> (once it gets under the skin it becomes an internal issue, and they recommend these pills that are very toxic to your liver, and completely unnecessary).</li>
            <li> So I went to a natural foods store where I found a few other aloe gels by companies like Now Foods and Lily of The Desert.</li>
            <li> Some people an amazon have also tried sea salt baths, but I would only dip into a salt bath with caution - as it could potentially make your skin problems worse if you&#x27;re sensitive to salt water (as I am).</li>
            <li> I also must say that since i&#x27;ve been using the product my eyebrows, eyelashes, and some other unwanted facial hair grows back a little faster...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this stuff does NOT flake unless you use too much or do multiple layers.</li>
            <li> I use this 2x a day on my face... helps with dry aging skin!  </li>
            <li> In about a half a day, the sores had healed enough to where i felt</li>
            <li> You take care of your business as normal,then you take a white paper towel,tear it in half,and then fold the half sheet two or three times,then apply about a tablespoon of a/v gel to the folded piece of paper towel...</li>
            <li> It formed a shiny seal, giving me confidence that contaminants would be much less likely to get into my skin.</li>
            <li> I think it is less processed than similar products.</li>
            <li> In the shower, I scrub my face with a face exfoliating pad ($2 at the drug store) and a little deep sea mineral soap that I buy in bar form.</li>
            <li> Later when I wash my hands I can tell it is there because it turns a little jelly like again then washes off.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t flake or dry like it use too on other products.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with this, because I only use it for one thing:</li>
            <li> It dries really fast and the smell that is not great disappears before you know it.</li>
            <li> Not only has healing been accelerated, but the scar tissue has a less angry appearance and is fading fast after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I thought when I bought it that it smelled a little acid for aloe, and the brown color was strange.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The new version adds several other questionable ingredients, including something that makes the Gelly smell like a preserved specimen from the biology lab.    </li>
            <li> I use it 9:1 with my non-alcoholic after-shave gel (Nivea), and at other times, with Vitamin E Cream from Loreal.</li>
            <li> I tried a crappy walgreens brand aloe, but it had water added, and other ingredients.     </li>
            <li> Other over-the-counter products did not recommend using them on the face.  </li>
            <li> Beware of other a/v products,because they have ingredients that will make your roids burn worse!.Especially</li>
            <li> See other reviews for that.  </li>
            <li> ] mixed in a small container).</li>
            <li> This product is so versatile I am exploring other uses for it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend a fortune on other products that have preservatives and chemicals.</li>
            <li> It has a stronger smell compared to the other ones.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an aloe vera product that would mix well with other oils for a body lotion.</li>
            <li> I use it alone or mixed with my usual serum/moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the other customer reviews for eczema.</li>
            <li> It absorbs and dries a bit differently than your average lotion, but the slightly sticky effect wears off after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> So I have a scalp scarring problem and my scalp get very, very dry and itches beyond belief!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched amazon and other sites up and down to find a product that will help me minimize chemical exposure.  </li>
            <li> It cut the time to heal roughly in half, and prevented any infection or other issues from cropping up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so he stopped taking the antibiotics and the acne slowly started coming back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly reducing all of my hygiene care products to as close to organic as possible and this one is acceptable for me.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s not cider vinegar, but there is some kind of acid - but either is very bad for Rosacea.</li>
            <li> I still use this product, it has come down in price again…</li>
            <li> , it prevents my skin from getting aggravated if i use something harsh on my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my eczema (but it does not prevent it flare ups from other factors).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other products.</li>
            <li> Less break outs too.</li>
            <li> my face was still slightly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried everything from &#x27;dermatology recommended&#x27; moisturizers to high end EXPENSIVE moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Nope...still a gooey tan mess.  </li>
            <li> B000VK08OC Wedderspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey Active 16</li>
            <li> It feels a little tight as it dries</li>
            <li> I put a pea-sized amount in my hair after a shower to make it less frizzy and messy... works well as a hair product.</li>
            <li> I just put a half dollar size amount in the palm on my hand, add a few drops of oil and &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; it together between my hands.</li>
            <li> I think the product is a bit expensive, but a little bit goes a long way for me using it as a facial moisturizer, so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> While hair is still a bit damp, put a little in your hands and work into hair.</li>
            <li> I happened to have a little sample of the skin gel in my cabinet and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I mix a little bit in my hand with a serum</li>
            <li> It goes on like jelly but in a minuet or two it turns a little sticky for a few seconds</li>
            <li> gel has too much conservatives or artificial vitamins to the point where it&#x27;s acidic and gives me a temporary rash on the skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my face everyday for almost nine months now.</li>
            <li> If the answer is yes, your moisturizer isn&#x27;t doing its job (or you are using way too harsh of a cleanser).  </li>
            <li> And eventually I stopped using the moisturizers (including the heavy cream moisturizer at night)</li>
            <li> I had ordered and then my austrailan lab accidentely wrapped it&#x27;s leash round me while at play &amp; took three months to heal.</li>
            <li> I felt like my skin was getting over dried.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> So i choose don&#x27;t like it, just waste my money.</li>
            <li> When I tell you my face felt tight and right--OMG!  </li>
            <li> (you only need a very small amount to spread a thin layer on your skin) and leaves no visible residue.</li>
            <li> Plus you use so little during application that I will probably not use it up for at least a year.</li>
            <li> What I mean by this is: When you wash your face... does it feel tight?</li>
            <li> Also, the tip constantly clogs and the consistency is weird.</li>
            <li> Over the past year I gradually replaced all the expensive, chemical-laden, brand-name cosmetics with simple and inexpensive organic beauty products.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews</li>
            <li> There was something wrong with the last bottle I received.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that product has recently been \\&quot;improved\\&quot; to the point where I refuse to use it.  </li>
            <li> In a few minutes I could feel my skin is stretching to cover the scar!</li>
            <li> small cuts burns.</li>
            <li> On lots of expensive prescriptions, primarily topical that don&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> Also use on all small cuts scrapes and bites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see what becomes of the area where the dermatologist sliced me</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I should put it on my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a sloppy mess that doesn&#x27;t accomplish anything other than being a sloppy mess.</li>
            <li> A big BOOOO from a dedicated long time customer :(  </li>
            <li> It also worked really well when my bf got a small yet annoying burn on his arm.</li>
            <li> The things that cause hard stool or constipation or a burning bm like spicy chili.  </li>
            <li> But it dries really hard like a mask of translucent paste, or something?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as a shaving cream as well, because it&#x27;s hard to wash it off (it sticks to your skin).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I use this as a moisturizer and always have a hard time finding it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t seen it, it would be hard to believe.</li>
            <li> It is surprisingly hard to find 90+ % aloe anywhere</li>
            <li> However when the product dries you can hardly smell it.</li>
            <li> Even though this is supposed to be made of natural ingredients, it smells really bad, like a man-made chemical.</li>
            <li> I now keep at least a half-bottle on hand at all</li>
            <li> My doctor told me the worst thing to put in your nostrils when your cpap irritates it is a petroleum based product like diaper ointment, vaseline, etc, because it can potentially lead to a fatty form of pneumonia, especially when a cpap is forcing air into the body.</li>
            <li> (my complaint with applying cocoa butter on the face).</li>
            <li> I am trying to go at least 75% or &gt;</li>
            <li> I wish I can delete every negative comment about this product.</li>
            <li> The one negative thing about the Item is the fact that although it is supposed to be unscented it does have a fragrance of seaweed and I am guessing that comes from the seaweed which is one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> PH balanced and delicate on skin, including the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I actually use some on the insides of my nose, because I&#x27;m prone to nosebleeds from dryness and cold weather.  </li>
            <li> It was relatively expensive compare to other brands&#x27;</li>
            <li> no more chemicals!</li>
            <li> I hate the texture, but I feel that way about any high % aloe.</li>
            <li> I also use it for my daughter who has subtle cradle cap and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> and I am serious</li>
            <li> I never rate products based solely on their prices, but this is just ridiculous...</li>
            <li> Seriously I use about 1/2 a pea size amount</li>
            <li> I seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was getting seriously bitten by mosquitos on my legs and ankles and cortizone</li>
            <li> It glides on and doesn&#x27;t leave a tight weird feeling that drug store aloe products do.</li>
            <li> almost but after I applied this gel, my face turned red and it stung so bad.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend if you have bad acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this product.  </li>
            <li> When applied to irritated skin,this product can sting and make the problem or inflamation worse...</li>
            <li> They have been making my face worse.  </li>
            <li> its slightly annoying but not enough to stop me from using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using it \\&quot;raw\\&quot; does leave it a little awkward on your skin, ie, it dries up weird, or becomes flaky.</li>
            <li> It also helps with terrible summer bug bites when no other product does.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots from acne on my face around my jaw line which i hate</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this because it isn&#x27;t loaded with 100 different ingredients.  My wife wasn&#x27;t much of a fan because it has a odd odor.</li>
            <li> I mix with Now almond oil for skin care that is natural and products are not tested on animals.  Also skin has improved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with this product and it&#x27;s for a reasonable price and ALL natural!  It&#x27;s MULTI-functional.  You can put it in your hair and on your skin.  In addition, you can put it on cuts, burns, etc.  I use it as a mini face lift when I get out the shower.  After, I wash my face I use a pea size amount and rub all over my face.  I let it air dry.  When I tell you my face felt tight and right--OMG!  I&#x27;m addicted to this product.  It leaves your face with a glow literally!  I went back and bought two more bottles.  I&#x27;d give this product six stars if I could.  This is a must have in your regimen.  Oh, this item was shipped pretty quickly as well!</li>
            <li> Simply love it! Clean, firm, organic. Your skin will love this. It is definitely comparable to getting a firm face lift, easier &amp; at a very cost efficient price. Enjoy ^_^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordering my second one since I am almost out. My favorite facial skin gel, just a little dab does the trick and the bottle lasted me 6 months!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome for your skin</li>
            <li> I should have done more research, there are way too many additives</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product over a decade ago when it was called \\&quot;Wound Gel\\&quot;  I used it to speed the recovery of a 3rd degree burn that had been excised.  It cut the time to heal roughly in half, and prevented any infection or other issues from cropping up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since given this product to several people who have had wounds or burns and it has helped all of them with a speedier recovery than other products would allow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On several occasions, I have used regular aloe from the drug store, and it does not work nearly as well as the whole-leaf aloe in this product.  I now keep at least a half-bottle on hand at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I use this in lieu of lotion and apply it as soon as I get out of the shower. It has improved my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> I use this 2x a day on my face... helps with dry aging skin!  Great for skin problems of all kinds.  Good stuff, will buy again!</li>
            <li> It says unscented, but it really stinks. I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this on my prime account, so here is her review:    I had read about this exact brand in numerous places online and went to a local health food store to test and buy it. The store employee raved about it, too. It felt nice, but was very expensive. I checked amazon right from my phone in the store (discreetly in a different part of the store). Much better price and free prime shipping.    I have an aloe plant growing, but it isn&#x27;t always convenient to break off an entire leaf. This product is really, really nice. Not sticky at all and quite soothing for all sorts of skin ailments (sunburn, irritated skin, rash, burns, scratches, etc). It also works well as a personal lubricant in this formula. No need to buy the special formula at the higher price per ounce. This brand of aloe vera gel is the most natural available for purchase. The next best thing to breaking off a leaf from a growing plant!</li>
            <li> Started putting this stuff on  my face in college.  Works great on current acne marks and scars.  Also great for sun burns and dry skin.  No alcohol or water so it doesn&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this aloe for me and it is great. I use it before i go out in the sun and i swear it acts as a sunscreen. Of course it is great for after the sun as well. It is a little sticky but that is a sign of pure aloe. I also use it for my daughter who has subtle cradle cap and it works like a charm. I put it on about an hour before i wash her hair and it really seems to help. I believe aloe is such an amazing healing product and i always have this skin gel on hand for anything and everything.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it mainly as a facial moisturizer at night and in the morning. I have sensitive, acne prone skin as an adult female. This is a light moisturizer so it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy or filmy feeling at all on your skin. It gives me the perfect amount of moisture, nice and no oily feel at all. I think the product is a bit expensive, but a little bit goes a long way for me using it as a facial moisturizer, so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 2007 (found it on Amazon only recently and am picking it up from Amazon from now onwards). Works great after shaving, for small scars, and also after you come back indoors from the sun (I live in TX).   For best results, mix it 9:1 ratio with a lotion of your liking. Using it \\&quot;raw\\&quot; does leave it a little awkward on your skin, ie, it dries up weird, or becomes flaky. I use it 9:1 with my non-alcoholic after-shave gel (Nivea), and at other times, with Vitamin E Cream from Loreal. Use whatever ratio works for you and have fun with this product. I hope it never ever goes out of business. (pray)</li>
            <li> I bought this as a last resort for my sores on my nostrils from my cpap nasal pillows. My doctor told me the worst thing to put in your nostrils when your cpap irritates it is a petroleum based product like diaper ointment, vaseline, etc, because it can potentially lead to a fatty form of pneumonia, especially when a cpap is forcing air into the body. I tried a crappy walgreens brand aloe, but it had water added, and other ingredients.     Finally I bought this at a local natural foods store and applied it to the sores about every 30-60 minutes from 1pm until bedtime...this is because it dries up and needs to be re-applied. In about a half a day, the sores had healed enough to where i felt almost no discomfort w/ the cpap. I was very surprised how well it worked. In another 2-3 days i am anticipating my nostrils will be 100% and finally i can sleep without being woken up by pain from the nose pillows.</li>
            <li> This is my second order for this outstanding product, I will continue to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for dealer&#x27;s thoughtful service, Best!</li>
            <li> I thought when I bought it that it smelled a little acid for aloe, and the brown color was strange. But I thought what the heck, it&#x27;s all natural. I&#x27;ve been using aloe gel from the pharmacy for years instead of prescription gel, and have never had any problems until this.  But last week a friend was going through an athlete&#x27;s foot/internal fungus problem, and I talked to her about using apple cider vinegar soaks to rid herself of it (once it gets under the skin it becomes an internal issue, and they recommend these pills that are very toxic to your liver, and completely unnecessary). I kicked that problem with a month of foot baths. My feet turned orange, but it washed off eventually and I was healthy.  Well I should have known that was the smell. Perhaps it&#x27;s not cider vinegar, but there is some kind of acid - but either is very bad for Rosacea. I never would have bought this if I had known. Of course they need to add something to keep it from going bad - I don&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;refrigerate after opening.&amp;#34; Probably there are a lot of people who would prefer vinegar to some sort of artificial preservative. Just not me.  After six months, now I know my face isn&#x27;t just chapped by the winter. It&#x27;s because it is irritated by low doses of acid. Also, the tip constantly clogs and the consistency is weird. Watery with clumps of gel, so you can easily end up with a huge mass of it on your hand even if you are careful. Probably I would not have bought this again, even without the acid problem.</li>
            <li> Over the past year I gradually replaced all the expensive, chemical-laden, brand-name cosmetics with simple and inexpensive organic beauty products. The skin gel was one of the first products that I bought and I am very happy with it. I apply it on my face and entire body as a toner/moisturizer after shower. A little goes a long way. Just a pea-sized drop can cover my face. It leaves a smooth, thin layer on my skin which dries quickly but locks in the moisture and tighten the pores. On top I put on some heavier lotion.     I have combination skin that&#x27;s acne prone. With regular night moisturizers, I often wake up to a layer of oil which makes me look like I just spread butter all over my face. It&#x27;s the skin&#x27;s own instinct to overproduce sebum to compensate loss of moisture. When I use the skin gel as a toner, however, in the morning I would see relaxed, well-moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it helps with myacne and it has helped to fade a lotof acne scaring left over years. I think applying it two times aday give you the optimum results</li>
            <li> Even though this is supposed to be made of natural ingredients, it smells really bad, like a man-made chemical. I don&#x27;t know if this is really what aloe smells like when ground up, but the smell is really pungent. Also, the consistency is more liquidy than other aloe gels, which is not a huge problem, but after it dries, it starts to flake off. That is my biggest problem with it-- the CVS brand that I use does not flake off so I can use it more like a moisturizer, but because of the flaking off I always have to wash my face after using it which kind of defeats the purpose of using it.</li>
            <li> looks like good stuff but hasnt help me heal some scarring i recently had.  Otherwise it seems great for sunburn and insect bites and stuff like that</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews but I had to for this one.&lt;br /&gt;First, i have no allergy to anything almost but after I applied this gel, my face turned red and it stung so bad. No other aloe products I&#x27;ve used gave me this kind of reaction. It stings so bad, I can&#x27;t use this gel at all. Since I&#x27;ve used it, can&#x27;t even return it. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aloe Life Skin Gel for years.  There was something wrong with the last bottle I received.  The texture and color were completely different.  I used it several times and the effectiveness was not the same.  It makes me wonder what was actually in the bottle.  I returned it and got my money back.</li>
            <li> Like S. Morris, I had been using Lily of the Desert Aloe Vera Gelly for many years.  Unfortunately, that product has recently been \\&quot;improved\\&quot; to the point where I refuse to use it.  The original Gelly had only 5 ingredients, all natural except for some carbomer for thickening.  The new version adds several other questionable ingredients, including something that makes the Gelly smell like a preserved specimen from the biology lab.    After searching several health-food stores for an acceptable replacement, I was delighted to find Aloe Life Skin Gel, which smells like a very weak herbal tea and even uses a seaweed derivative for thickening.  As a couple of people have already mentioned in comments attached to S. Morris&#x27;s review, I find that if I use the same amount of this Gel as I was accustomed to using of the Gelly, it&#x27;s far too much!  But now that I know to use considerably less, it works very well for me.    For years, my only skin treatment has consisted of 3 parts aloe vera gel plus 1 part vegetable glycerin.  I use this as my hand lotion, facial moisturizer, cure for dry itchy skin, and healer for dry cracked heels.  When the Gelly changed, I feared that I would be left with nothing.  Thank you, Aloe Life, for coming to the rescue!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve eliminated any and all petrolium based products from my life; from cleaning my house to cleaning and moisturizing my body. This product is one of my favorite things on Earth! In the shower, I scrub my face with a face exfoliating pad ($2 at the drug store) and a little deep sea mineral soap that I buy in bar form. I wash my body and my hair with Dr.Bronners Castille soap and use a small amount of organic, fragrance free conditioner. After the shower, I Put about a tablespoon of this Skin Gel into my palm with a teaspoon on Jojoba oil. Mix it together and dab it around... legs, arms, torso, face. Everywhere! It is Incredible stuff! My skin glows all day and I&#x27;ve received many comments on how good my skin looks since I started doing this! My boyfriend and I both also use it as a hair gel. While hair is still a bit damp, put a little in your hands and work into hair. I scrunch it in and it gives my hair texture while moisturizing it. The wonder product!</li>
            <li> Feels very soothing after shaving and on sunburn.</li>
            <li> ** update **&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this from ToysNGamesEtc. I purchased the last one from this seller and noticed ingredients are different. They sell the one with Sodium Benzoate which you don&#x27;t want to put on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera to treat my eczema skin but I couldn&#x27;t find it in a pharmacy store when I needed to buy a new one. So I went to a natural foods store where I found a few other aloe gels by companies like Now Foods and Lily of The Desert. My \\&quot;organic lover\\&quot; boyfriend took a look at ingredients of all gels they sell and told me to buy Skin Gel because that&#x27;s the only product that has no chemicals. It was relatively expensive compare to other brands&#x27; so I bought the smallest one to try out... OMG this gel is amazing!!! I had a minor scratch on my cheek so I put this gel on. In a few minutes I could feel my skin is stretching to cover the scar! It also works much faster for my eczema than the Fruit of the Earth. The gel is less thick so gets absorbed to skin quicker and it&#x27;s much more spreadable so you just need smaller portion to apply (so it&#x27;s actually a better deal compare to other cheaper gels since this gel lasts much longer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a eczema problem like me and don&#x27;t want to use steroid, I highly recommend to try this gel. I wish I found this gel sooner!</li>
            <li> A small wart had developed on the side of my face right at the edge where my sideburns end.  The wart was beginning to hurt and I constantly nicked it whenever I shaved.    I purchased this after checking out reviews online which recommended aloe vera.  Other over-the-counter products did not recommend using them on the face.  So, after just 3 days of applying the gel over my entire face the wart came off!!  I was amazed.  Now I use the gel after every shave and have even noticed my brown spots going away.  I am hooked and recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> After a surgery, I had quite a bit of bruising.  My body was in a lot of pain from hematomas.  Most people say to use arnica.  I tried it and it had no effect on me.  I happened to have a little sample of the skin gel in my cabinet and decided to give it a try.  Wow!  It immediately felt soothing and cooling, and my very overstimulated skin was able to handle it.  I&#x27;ve used aloe before for burns and scars (and usually use it fresh from my aloe plant), but this was the first time for bruises.  I found this formula to be very effective and it has sped up my healing.  I put a light coating on 2 to 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This aloe gel is bit more expensive than others, but it&#x27;s worth it. Free of clumps of additive junk (no perfumes, no alcohol), you can feel secure putting it on your face, your burns, or anywhere else.   Remember, everything you put on your skin gets soaked up into your body. You may as well be putting it in your mouth!  So, the purer the better.   I use this product daily on my face; it&#x27;s rejuvenating and healing.  &lt;3</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it on my face after a peel or just for extra moisturizing. I also use it in my hair. I mix a little bit in my hand with a serum and it works great as a hair gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that seaweed stuff that&#x27;s used as a thickening agent...As a result this gel cannot be used for all purposes as a/v directly from the leaf.  When applied to irritated skin,this product can sting and make the problem or inflamation worse...I used it as a hemorrhoid topical with mixed results.  If kept refrigerated this a/v product can help sooth an external hemorrhoid condition...You take care of your business as normal,then you take a white paper towel,tear it in half,and then fold the half sheet two or three times,then apply about a tablespoon of a/v gel to the folded piece of paper towel...Then you put the your homemade \\&quot;roid pad\\&quot; between your cheeks.Done...Now just finish up,wash your hands,and slowly sit down,this will secure the roid pad so it doesn&#x27;t slip away on you,lol!  BUT,I would use Mill Creek a/v or a/v directly from the leaf...Beware of other a/v products,because they have ingredients that will make your roids burn worse!.Especially Preparation H!.OUCH!..That over the counter stuff is only good on roids that remain dry and don&#x27;t leak or bleed at all--I don&#x27;t think roids are so well behaved...The long term solution is of course a lifestyle change for the better.You know,the old \\&quot;eating right and exercise\\&quot; spiel...For now eat only easy to digest food,like brothy soups and salads with a simple oil and vinegar dressing...Avoid cheese and bread,milk,spicey stuff,excess salt...The things that cause hard stool or constipation or a burning bm like spicy chili.  And start walking or bike riding.  Seeing a doctor might be a good idea too..Don&#x27;t worry,they can handle it.Being a Doctor is a disgusting job sometimes,that&#x27;s why they get the big bucks!</li>
            <li> This aloe gel is awesome, use it as an aftershave or for a moisturizer base before applying a longer term face care product with sun screen. I just cannot say enough good about this gel, it goes on silky smooth, dries quick and I am serious it literally is like a face lift in a bottle.    My mother bought a bottle after hearing me brag about it and she concurs and she said it makes her make-up go on so much easier and spreads evenly while using less.</li>
            <li> Great for any skin irritation or itch.  Stops itches for me within just minutes.</li>
            <li> EDIT 11/4/15:  I still use this product, it has come down in price again… But as soon as this bottle runs out I will be looking for an organic product without so many negative ingredients.   PRO TIP-- I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with this, because I only use it for one thing: I use this instead of baby wipes when ummm... Using the toilet at times. Just a bit of this + toilet paper works SO much better &amp; is MUCH better for the environment:)  ORIGINAL REVIEW: 1st off, this product rocks... See other reviews for that.  I give 5 stars for the PRODUCT.  I give ONE STAR for all the pricing for this product on Amazon!!  I never rate products based solely on their prices, but this is just ridiculous... I don&#x27;t get it.  I ordered this a year ago on Amazon from BIG FLY SPORTS for $13.28... &amp; one year later the same product, same everything $28 ?!?  It makes zero sense.  If you google this product you can still get 8oz for around $11-13 elsewhere.  I remember the day when practically everything was better priced on Amazon than anywhere else on the web, unfortunately I am finding again &amp; again that that is no longer always the case.  A big BOOOO from a dedicated long time customer :(  Just thought a heads up was in order for anyone looking at this product for the 1st time.</li>
            <li> I think this is great for the skin,  I use it  2 times a day in the morning and at night time. It speeds cell recovery and heals your skin, just dont put t much on your face. To end this review all I have to say is that this product is good for just about any skin problem.</li>
            <li> Aloe Life Skin Gel has really calmed my skin.  I suffer from mild adult acne, and I&#x27;ve found out that the harsh products I used as a teen don&#x27;t cut it anymore.  They have been making my face worse.  This aloe gel has really healed exsisting acne scars and blemishes.  I use it 2x/day (morning and night) after my [[ASIN:B000VK08OC Wedderspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey Active 16+, 17.6-Ounce Jar]] mask.  Aloe contains salicylic acid naturally, so you gain the blemish fighting properties of SA without the drying.  I also use the aloe as a spot treatment (1 Tablespoon Aloe Life Skin Gel and 1 drop [[ASIN:B000ELP5KA Tea Tree Oil, 4 fl. oz.]] mixed in a small container). My skin continues to get better and better as time goes on.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I thought ok I&#x27;m gonna try it. Sooo glad I did! This stuff is great. My skin was becoming somewhat dry and dull. After ONE day of using this I saw a difference. My skin is softer, smoother and brighter! Less break outs too. I&#x27;m very happy. I also used some in my hair it added some much needed shine and softness. My whole family loves it as well :)</li>
            <li> My fiance has to constantly use antibiotics for his acne issues. I told him I&#x27;d rather have him be healthy so he stopped taking the antibiotics and the acne slowly started coming back. I saw this and decided to buy it for him. He uses it several times a day and it does reduce the amount of acne he has. It doesn&#x27;t make him acne free, but it has made a huge difference. By the way he suffers from nodular acne. I would recommend this a try to anyone else who suffers from it.</li>
            <li> I ordered Aloe life skin gel to use as a moisturizer. I have combination skin, and I have tried so many moisturizers over the years, but they would either be too greasy or unable to combat the dry patches on my face. This aloe gel, on the other hand, has worked perfectly so far in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it. It is absorbed/dries almost instantly (you only need a very small amount to spread a thin layer on your skin) and leaves no visible residue. I did not notice any tan coloring on my skin (and I am very fair skinned), or any flaking or peeling, as some other reviewers noted, but those problems could very well be due to applying it too thickly.&lt;br /&gt;It works great under my oil-free, water-based makeup, and I have definitely noticed an improvement in how healthy my skin looks, even after the first use. I will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural emmoliant to feed my skin after summer sun, winter dryness, and to neutralize after microdermabrasion treatments. I found it in this product!! I love it! It&#x27;s a cool long lasting vitamin filled drink for my skin. It glides on and doesn&#x27;t leave a tight weird feeling that drug store aloe products do. Best part is I can wear it under my SPF products and moisturizers and it doesn&#x27;t interfere in anyway. Plus you use so little during application that I will probably not use it up for at least a year. Just kidding.... I will not wait that long to enjoy this products benefits.</li>
            <li> I liked that this appeared natural w/o other dyes or alcohol that typical drug store &amp;#34;aloe&amp;#34; would have. However, it dries with a weird texture. I thought I could use it at night during the summer as a light, natural facial moisturizer. But it dries really hard like a mask of translucent paste, or something? Not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> This is great!  I used it on my dry skin (even without sunburn) and it really helped. This stuff is really sticky, but its the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite aloe gel because it is alcohol free so it doesn&#x27;t sting when it gets into cuts, abrasions, cracked or damaged skin. It&#x27;s 99% certified organic whole leaf aloe vera, and contains vitamins A, C, &amp; E. It also does not have to be refrigerated, which is a convenience factor for me. Most of the ingredients are from vitamins or herbs, the only one that&#x27;s not is potassium sorbate, which is considered a mild preservative and is a naturally occurring organic acid that is used as a mold inhibitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have to go in the frig is important to me because I put it on my son when he&#x27;s asleep. He&#x27;s recovering from eczema, and if the gel is cold, it is more likely to wake him up. The aloe simply soothes the eczema rash and doesn&#x27;t suppress it the way steroids do. I don&#x27;t use steroids on eczema, psoriasis, or any type of dermatitis as that simply suppresses the rash and sends the problem deeper into the body. The skin is on the same meridian as the lungs in Chinese medicine. Many people in the natural health community believe that this explains why 50% of children with eczema will develop asthma. When the condition is suppressed with steroids, it will then manifest in the lungs. Often as the child recovers from asthma, the eczema will reappear before complete healing takes place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:1563636786 PDR for Herbal Medicines, 4th ed. (Physician&#x27;s Desk Reference (Pdr) for Herbal Medicines)]] says a study on aloe and psoriasis showed that 83% the patients that applied the cream topically 3 times a day for 5 consecutive days for 4 weeks had reduced or no psoriasis signs while only 6.6% of the placebo groups did. Those are pretty impressive statistics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course having an aloe plant around is always a natural option too, but this is a nice, convenient size to have around the house.</li>
            <li> This product is so versatile - I use this in place of hair gel, body lotion and for any skin ailments. To use as hair gel, use it straight (no adding needed). It gives your hair a cool shine and it shapes hair nicely without being stiff as a board. To use as body lotion, I used a bit of jojoba oil (as suggested in previous reviews) and it works great! For those who can smell the aloe (and don&#x27;t want to) try using a tiny drop of lavendar essential oil. This stuff goes on smooth, dries quickly and is not greasy. Lastly, if I get sunburn, rash or any type of skin thing I just dab this stuff on and the itch or pain goes away. This product is so versatile I am exploring other uses for it. Make-up Remover? Don&#x27;t spend a fortune on other products that have preservatives and chemicals. Get this stuff and create your own natural moisturizer. I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever. There is no secret as to how amazing aloe vera it. This a genuine organic product that works for everything. I rub down with it twice a week after a hot bath. I also use this on my face daily and after dermarolling. Wonderful product, please sell this forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff as a moisturizer for months and I love it. Now I can save some money and get it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> Used this on a skin graft and it really hurt going on but really protected the graft. The doc didn&#x27;t recommend anything that reduced the pain or helped the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> It works. Cleared up a bit of dermatitis that I had not been able to get rid of for months. Great product.</li>
            <li> i bought it to fade stretch marks and to heal my foot heels.  after a few days my feet heels are almost completely soft again. and marks are fading nicely.  You can see the aloe in the product.  better than store bought.</li>
            <li> The product left a sticky residue and made my skin itch. It was still sticky in the morning when I woke up, and the gel smells bad. After several uses, I saw no improvement in my skin. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly reducing all of my hygiene care products to as close to organic as possible and this one is acceptable for me. I use it as a skin moisturizer, hair conditioner, before/after outdoor activities in the sun, on cuts, insect bites and bruises.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and will continue using for a long long time</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have been using it on my face everyday for almost nine months now. Only a little bit is needed to coat the entire face. This is great to apply any time of day; it does not peel and feels cooling and refreshing. It absorbs very quickly and does not feel sticky or greasy (my complaint with applying cocoa butter on the face).</li>
            <li> The Aloe Life Skin Gel product was received promptly, so thanks for that. The gel is thick but absorbs quickly. It has a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell to it; it seems that no fragrance was added as far as I can tell (and that&#x27;s a good thing for anyone whose skin is sensitive to skin products with fragrance in the formula). I purchased the Aloe Skin Gel for eczema along with Sweet Almond Oil and a couple other items in the hopes that at least one of them would help clear up my skin. The almond oil (made by Now Solutions) seems to be working the best for me - it&#x27;s sold on Amazon and comes in a 16-ounce bottle. I use the almond oil on my hands, arms, shoulders, thighs, legs and feet twice a day. It absorbs quickly because it&#x27;s a light oil and not greasy. I also purchased &amp;#34;Babytime by Episencial Soothing Cream - Organic Eczema and Itchy Skin&amp;#34; (also sold on Amazon) but this product, designed for sensitive baby&#x27;s skin, seems to have fallen into 3rd place for daily use application - and it costs $11 for a small tube, which won&#x27;t last long when using it for nearly full body coverage. The Now Solutions sweet almond oil is also reviewed on Amazon and a couple people said a 16-ounce bottle is a large amount of product, but if you have widespread skin issues, you&#x27;ll be glad you purchased the sweet almond oil in a 16-ounce size. The Aloe life Skin Gel (in an 8 ounce bottle) should last about a month if used liberally twice a day as I&#x27;ve described my use of it above. If you have Eczema, you can save yourself a lot of time by checking out the items I&#x27;ve mentioned, which I purchased to use instead of cortisone cream (expediently prescribed by a dermatologist - what a racket). I also tried Eucerin Skin Calming Daily Moisturizing Creme (14 Ounce Tube) and used this religiously for more than two years, every day. Also Cerave (the body cream and the body lotion). Although both Eucerin and Cerave are dermatologist recommended products, I found that these two products (Cerave and Eucerin) work better after my skin is clear, rather than to clear it up after or during an outbreak. My skin gets really dry in the winter, so I&#x27;ve done a lot of research (really a lot) on how to deal with it. Some additional suggestions include: shower every two days, instead of daily. Wear cotton instead of synthetic fabrics or wool. Don&#x27;t wash your hands with Dial soap or with any soap with fragrance added. Use Basis soap instead (available on amazon in a six pack). Buy a shampoo that&#x27;s formulated for sensitive skin (I purchased Sweet Baby Shampoo, 16 oz., Sulfate Free, No Parabens, Phthalates, Dyes, etc.). It smells like coconut which I like. Use a vaporizer in every room in your house, especially in your bedroom. (And good luck finding one you like - none of the vaporizers on amazon are rated as high as I would like). Whatever you do, don&#x27;t fall into the trap of relying upon cortisone cream. That won&#x27;t solve the problem and you can&#x27;t use it daily for full body coverage. Actually Cortisone creams (I&#x27;ve heard) can make your skin thinner. My current favorite solution is the sweet almond oil. &amp;#34;Babytime by Episencial Soothing Cream - Organic Eczema and Itchy Skin&amp;#34; is worth trying too, but it may or may not work on your skin. Or, if it does work, it might only work on certain parts of your body but not others. Some people an amazon have also tried sea salt baths, but I would only dip into a salt bath with caution - as it could potentially make your skin problems worse if you&#x27;re sensitive to salt water (as I am). If you read the Dead Sea Salts reviews on amazon, just keep in mind that a high percentage of the people who posted reviews were given free samples of the produce in exchange for &amp;#34;an honest review&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve rarely seen products on amazon reviewed in such large numbers in exchange for free samples. I hope all of this helps; even if it helps one person, it will be worth the time I took to write this review!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for post chemical peel skin care, and it works beautifully to calm and moisturize. I use it to moisturize my normal/oily t-zone, breakout prone, 50 year-old skin and it does a great job. It clears up bumps. It&#x27;s cooling and refreshing, but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I absolutely love it. It doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;flowers and berries&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li> Provides relief for many skin issues including sunburn, itching, bug bites, etc. Now we are testing it on new tattoos.</li>
            <li> This is the worst aloe gel I tried compared to:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0016AZE4K Aloe 80 Organics Skin Soothing Aloe Gel, 16 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001ECTZNG NOW Foods - Aloe Soothing Gel, 8 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel has too much conservatives or artificial vitamins to the point where it&#x27;s acidic and gives me a temporary rash on the skin. It has a stronger smell compared to the other ones. Doesn&#x27;t work as a shaving cream as well, because it&#x27;s hard to wash it off (it sticks to your skin).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find the best organic aloe, but ironically Now Foods Aloe Gel has been the best performer even though it&#x27;s not organic. The only other product I may try is Aubrey Organics Aloe.&lt;br /&gt;Stop putting junk additives into organic aloe!</li>
            <li> This successfully moisturizes my skin without being remotely irritating. It absorbs and dries a bit differently than your average lotion, but the slightly sticky effect wears off after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying aloe life skin gel for years this  is a wonderful product and it makes my skin  look and feel clean, it can be use for other stuff to I even put it on cuts, scars and strachmarks and they seem to heal and disappear faster and leave no marks on my skin I wouldn&#x27;t trade this product for nothing in the world I love it</li>
            <li> Based on the ingredients this is a good aloe product but the smell is off putting.  Enough that I warned my family when they asked to use it they might not be pleased with the scent.  It looks about as good as it smells in the bottle but disappears on the skin.  I don&#x27;t need a perfumy smell but one that didn&#x27;t make me go Ugh! would be good.  I drink aloe vera so I know what it smells like and this is a bit too medicinal for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally gush about beauty products but I can say I LOVE this particular Aloe! I have a pretty basic &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; routine and I use this daily. I&#x27;ve tried literally every product under the sun as I used to have horrific acne and now my skin just glows! I now just use a very gentle natural face wash and then this let it sit and fully absorb in then I use a natural sun screen with moisturizer in it and that&#x27;s it. This product works as a toner and moisturizer without stripping or thinning your skin as most toners will do it has even helped to fade all my old acne scars too! But it&#x27;s good for SoOoo Much more than that too! Insect bites small cuts burns. I even use it while stretching my earlobes too. I am ever so thankful that I have found this product! The one thing I can comment on that I have seen a few other people comment about it when they&#x27;re mentioning a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; left on there skin that is simply because they&#x27;re using too much and a small tinsy bit goes a Longgggg way ;) Seriously I use about 1/2 a pea size amount and that&#x27;s enough to completely cover my face neck and collar of my chest. So just remember 1/2 dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> Why is that amazing? Because it is.  Do you have ANY idea how many over-the-counter, beauty department, pharmacy, and &#x27;chemical&#x27;  moisturizers I have used in my life in an attempt to NOT have dry skin? You probably do. :)  And I&#x27;ve tried everything from &#x27;dermatology recommended&#x27; moisturizers to high end EXPENSIVE moisturizers. Some worked, some didn&#x27;t. However, even those that worked best... my face was still slightly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT WITH THIS!! That&#x27;s amazing to me. This is the only product I use on my face, before my makeup. No dryness.... At all!  What I mean by this is: When you wash your face... does it feel tight? If the answer is yes, your moisturizer isn&#x27;t doing its job (or you are using way too harsh of a cleanser).  With this product, I can wash my face with my gentle cleanser and be fine. No tightness, nothing. My skin doesn&#x27;t flake or dry like it use too on other products.  It FEELS healthy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, I do have acne. But that is not caused by external forces. I am currently going on Accutane, because my dermatologist agreed with me that, other than my acne, my skin &#x27;is&#x27; very healthy. And it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months now. At first I used it as a &#x27;primer&#x27;. I put it on after my moisturizer. And only once a day.  Slowly I transferred to using this product more and more. And eventually I stopped using the moisturizers (including the heavy cream moisturizer at night) all together.  I seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution: It IS real aloe vera gel. When you put it on your face, rub it in until you can&#x27;t anymore (without rubbing the skin off your face. Be gentle!). It feels a little tight as it dries but if you rubbed it into your skin, it should be fine after a few minutes. Do not GLOB this on your skin and leave it. It will cause it to peel (it will peel/shed if you dont rub it in all the way, so make sure to do so). Also, as with all other natural products, you may have an allergic reaction to it if you &#x27;glob&#x27; it on.  This happened to be once from Aloe Vera gel direct from the plant (I had a plant at home and squeezed out the gel). I applied it in globs on some irritated skin. In about 5-7 minutes it was burning like all h***.  Follow the directions.... Less is better. (This goes for essential oils too, just fyi).ergic reaction to it if you &#x27;glob&#x27; it on.

            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have used it for years.  My local health food store stopped sellng it, so I was ecstatic to discover I could purchase it on line.  This product is great for so many different things.  I use it on my skin as a moisturizer and for so many other things.  It is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Good stuff ...great for problem skin !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am trying to go at least 75% or &gt; natural these days: hair, skin, food etc. I have not detected any smell like some have reported. My natural hair regimen is Jamaican Pimento Oil and aloe gel. Very simple, I know. Perhaps the JPO eliminates the flakiness. This is a very good buy.</li>
            <li> Have had a severe acne problem for 15 years and have had numerous specialists (dermatologists, food allergists, etc) who can&#x27;t fix the problem. On lots of expensive prescriptions, primarily topical that don&#x27;t work that well. Randomly was given some this to try on a scratch that needed to heal and decided to apply it to acne areas. Can&#x27;t believe what is happening to my skin. Will do follow-up research on this but for now I&#x27;m shopping for this product in bulk.</li>
            <li> The gel seems to help my skin heal, but it is sticky and flakes off. I would rather it was truly just aloe vera and not other ingredients.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product not only as a skin lotion but also as hair gel.  He said it works great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell and the added ingredients.  I was hoping for a more pure form of the gel.</li>
            <li> We love this product..the delivery was very speedy as well....the hubby is a garbage man and every spring through fall the top of his arms itch. Doctors have no idea why. This product stops the itchy right away. He saw i had it in there and decided what the hell hes tried everything else. It works 100% and he only puts it on in the morning. I tried it and it works instantly for bug bites as well</li>
            <li> I use this with oil as an all natural moisturizer. Aloe alone makes my skin dry after it dries so i add a pinch of emu oil to eliminate the dry look.</li>
            <li> I wish I can delete every negative comment about this product. This was definitely God sent! I had a terrible allergic reaction that left my skin scarred from all the scratching. After using it on my entire body I noticed a difference over night 5 days later my body is almost completely healed of the scars what more could I possibly ask for the smell is faint the results are incredible. It tightens my skin and give me a natural glow that I love. This has become one of my top beauty regimen.  ★★★★★</li>
            <li> This is one of the purest Aloe gels that I could find. I had chemo and radiation and it did a number on my skin. This was, hands down, the best product that I used. It was like a miracle cure.</li>
            <li> this gel is wonderful and makes my skin look clearer and younger.  i use it under the aloe life face lotion.  great!</li>
            <li> Used it for a couple of weeks. My skin looks a lot better. It&#x27;s helping lighten scars and prevent blemishes from coming back. Product arrived quickly .</li>
            <li> This is a very good aloe gel. It does not have any added perfume, and has minimal preservatives (citric acid and potassium sorbate, which is not an issue for me personally.) which means it doesn&#x27;t need refrigeration. I rubbed a small amount on my hands and face and found it interesting, it felt very slimy going on, then dried onto skin quickly, did not leave any sticky or slimy residue on my hands or face.</li>
            <li> this is the only aloe lotion my wife will buy, with Dry itchy skin in the winter and this is the only thing that will help.</li>
            <li> I wish this would come up when you type in Aloe Vera Skin Gel but it doesn&#x27;t.  I use this as a moisturizer and always have a hard time finding it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this aloe gel. I use it as a moisturizer nightly over retinol serum or vit.c serum and wake up to glowy skin. Has not caused any breakouts with my super sensitive skin, completly the opposite. It seems to be very healing and quickens the healing  process of skin irritations or cuts on the body. A light moisturizer for all seasons. Going on my 4th bottle already. A must in my medicine cabinet and vanity.</li>
            <li> 3 star only because of smell though it didn&#x27;t for long time . Still want to see if it works on colors patch in my face</li>
            <li> One of the best Aloe I have used.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product at the health food store. I had no idea that it would actually work. Normally I do extensive research before i purchase anything to put on my face.  I have dark spots from acne on my face around my jaw line which i hate and I am currently using an acne gel, however the acne gel is too strong for my chin area and caused a dark spot. Frustration at its highest!! I started using this on Friday 12.12.14 and today is Monday and I see a huge difference in that area as well as my entire face.  I recommend this product. Don&#x27;t let the price scare you, it&#x27;s worth it. I apply it before bed and in the morning, however I do wipe it off after about an hour in the morning so my face won&#x27;t be sticky. I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> I found lots of uses for the gel, I use it on my hair,skin,and as a personal lubricant works lots better than KY gel</li>
            <li> Skin gel makes my face and hands feel so very smooth and soft. I will recommend this to anyone who want a clear soft complexion and YES, I will be ordering this item again and again.</li>
            <li> the best aloe I have ever used but pricey</li>
            <li> compre este gel para usarlo como humectante para la cara por que tengo la piel de la cara grasosa y casi todas las demas cremas me sacan grasa pero este gel me irrita la piel y no tengo una piel sensible.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s good, but I don&#x27;t know how it works yet. It smells like yod... I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched amazon and other sites up and down to find a product that will help me minimize chemical exposure.  The ingredients that you see in the picture are not representative of what you actually get.  Here&#x27;s the list of ingredients that appear on the actual product:  Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Barbadensis Juice Concentrate, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Chamomimlla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Allantoin, Phospholipid, Retinol (Vit. A), Panthenol, Niacinamide, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vit. C), Tocopherol Acetate (Vit E), Gluconolactone, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Benzoate &amp; Potassium Sorbate (food grade preservatives).  NO WATER ADDED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned.  Frankly, I&#x27;d rather they added some water.  Returning it.</li>
            <li> I puchased this product to use as a light moisturizer and healing agent under my makeup for my acne prone skin.  I had been using Lily of the Desert, but I was enticed by the idea of added vitamins in the AloeLife product.  I let it sit on my skin to absorb for about ten minutes, but unlike other aloe gels/juices I have used, it didn&#x27;t fully absorb and created a strange layer of tan peeling flakes on my face.  When I tried to use a cosmetic sponge to put foundation on over top of it, it dissolved into a gooey mess.  I thought maybe this was a fluke occurrence, so I tried again, this time adding moisturizer to see if it made a difference.  Nope...still a gooey tan mess.  I&#x27;m sure that this is an excellent product for burns and wounds (and I will save the 8 oz bottle I purchased for that purpose), but it didn&#x27;t work as a moisturizer for facial skin.  For now, I will go back to using the clear Lily of the Desert 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel.  That product absorbs completely into the skin with no funky layer left over.</li>
            <li> Heals my rashes quickly</li>
            <li> Bought multiple bottles since this is a must have product in our household. I use daily after showering as a moisturizer. We always take it on vacation and use after sun exposure. It is a very pure form of aloe unlike aloe that you find in drug stores and organic. Applies moist. But dries quickly with no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> My favorite Aloe gel. Great for sunburn, winter dry skin, abrasions. My skin type is fair, sensitive and I&#x27;ve had no issues with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Prefer the unscented to other similar aloe gels I&#x27;ve tried. Yes it costs a little more, but I think the cost is worth the results.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I use it as hair gel and it works better than any commercial hair product. I then apply what&#x27;s left on my hands to my face and neck. If you avoid chemical products and are into natural alternatives, this is for you. I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this gel.</li>
            <li> I got this package from Amazon before the scheduled delivery date. I know that fresh Aloevera gel can do wonders if it is taken out of the plant. I was not sure if this product is made of pure aloe vera gel. When I opened the package and actually applied the gel on my skin ( to ged rid of acne scars) I can see that it is GENUINE Aloevera gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it smells bad, I mean not aromatic, this is a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks VitaCost and Amazon. I will write another review, once I get rid of my scars completely :)</li>
            <li> As a cyclist, I occasionally have to deal with falls on road surfaces. Ride long enough and it happens. I used to slather skin injuries with antibacterial ointments such as Neosporin, but I noticed that, while healing was complete, it was slow, and the scars remained bright pink for many months and even years. After a recent slide over asphalt, I decided to wash the deep abrasion thoroughly with sterile saline solution, following that with non-stick mesh and gauze. After a couple of days, when scabbing was evident and the wound was drying a bit, I began applying Aloe LIfe Skin Gel liberally on and around the injury. It formed a shiny seal, giving me confidence that contaminants would be much less likely to get into my skin. I reapplied the gel after every shower and wound cleaning. The results have been nothing less than astonishing to me. Not only has healing been accelerated, but the scar tissue has a less angry appearance and is fading fast after only a few weeks. If I hadn&#x27;t seen it, it would be hard to believe.</li>
            <li> I purchased &amp; then returned this product sold by ToysNGamesEtc because what they are selling/shipping is NOT the product that is advertised on Amazon. Amazon apparently sees this as OK based upon the fact that I made a special effort to bring this concern to an Amazon customer service BEFORE the order was prepared and shipped and they assured me it was the right product as advertised.  Upon receipt, the ingredients was not as advertised.  Not only is this deceptive advertising, but when a customer makes a purchase and it isn&#x27;t the product as it was advertised, it becomes a fraudulent sale.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My husband and I use it daily as a night time skin cream.  This is also great to have on hand for your first aid kit, as Aloe Vera heals sunburns, cuts, abrasions, etc.</li>
            <li> Use the brand only for years. Extraordinary to watch it as it heals a simple cut over 3 days. It also helps with terrible summer bug bites when no other product does.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  Works great!</li>
            <li> It is surprisingly hard to find 90+ % aloe anywhere but this stuff is pretty close to pure and it works for all I use it for. I hate the texture, but I feel that way about any high % aloe. It is worth it for how well it works on sunburn.</li>
            <li> I love love love this gel. I had ordered and then my austrailan lab accidentely wrapped it&#x27;s leash round me while at play &amp; took three months to heal. However I used the gel and it was healing without a scar. Then went off on vacation and forgot it. When I left a scar appeared in the portion I didn&#x27;t treat with this gel. I was amazed. I am home again and apply it daily and will be using on my body now to see if it helps skin. I love this and am  starting to read reviews to make sure I use in every way possible. I did mix very high grade lavender in the gel for my wound.  I will be ordering this forever and for my kids ay college etc.&lt;br /&gt;as they will eventually need this. I am from a family that grows aloe so was surprised aloe in a jar worked so well. Don&#x27;t sit on the fence with this. It&#x27;s a miracle gel. Has a nice application and isn&#x27;t sticky. Really great find for me.</li>
            <li> I am a person in my 50&#x27;s who wanted a product that would help with my fine wrinkles on my face as well as age spots. When I first started using it I felt like my skin was getting over dried. My face even started to peel. However in time I started to notice the fine lines getting smaller and age spots started to fade. I then started using a moisturizer with the gel and that helped with the dryness. Something else that I noticed was my skin did not look as pale as it naturally is and people have made comments that my face looks tanned. Overall I am happy with the product and that a little of the gel goes a long way. The one negative thing about the Item is the fact that although it is supposed to be unscented it does have a fragrance of seaweed and I am guessing that comes from the seaweed which is one of the ingredients. However when the product dries you can hardly smell it.</li>
            <li> This is a great products for hair growth. fast shipment</li>
            <li> the item I received contains Phenoxyethanol, doesn&#x27;t like it is on label</li>
            <li> I was looking for an aloe vera product that would mix well with other oils for a body lotion. This does the trick. I also use it in my hair as well. It goes on easily and mixes well with other products. I am almost out and will purchase again. I think this is a good price for an 8 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> I try to either protect my skin or stay away from the sun, but in the event that I can&#x27;t, this is unburn treatment that I swear by. Whole leaf Aloe makes a huge difference. Highly recommend this product for quicker-than-average healing of sunburns.</li>
            <li> I use Aloe skin gel for moisture in the summer and winter.  In the summer, it works well for bug bites or sun exposure.  In the winter, I use it for dry skin (Also use lotion).  Great on the hands, elbows and face....I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Initially I began but putting this on my face after washing it. I must say that it can&#x27;t be used alone. The product dries (not absorbs) pretty quick but after a minute it feels like my face has a mask on it and it looks like my skin is peeling. I put my regular moisturizer ( which is olive squalene or shea butter) over it and everything was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product on my face and now my body for more than 2 months and I&#x27;m on my second bottle and its really working. My skin heals faster from acne scarring and hyperpigmentation  , it prevents my skin from getting aggravated if i use something harsh on my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my eczema (but it does not prevent it flare ups from other factors). I also must say that since i&#x27;ve been using the product my eyebrows, eyelashes, and some other unwanted facial hair grows back a little faster... its slightly annoying but not enough to stop me from using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other random things about the product... I don&#x27;t refrigerate it and it lasts. It also mixes well with oils and natural moisturizers but if you use it/mix it with lotions that are thin (not creamy and absorb quickly) i find that some of the flaking will still occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product but you have to use it under a compatible moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old with a dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes this gel causes burning sensation on my face but it does work well both on moisturizing and  killing acnes.&lt;br /&gt;If there is other mild products, i will try them.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It goes on like jelly but in a minuet or two it turns a little sticky for a few seconds and then I don&#x27;t even know it was there at all. Later when I wash my hands I can tell it is there because it turns a little jelly like again then washes off. I then need to reapply. Keeps my finger tips from cracking in the winter.</li>
            <li> Not the real deal. It has lots of bad ingredients. Will not buy again. I would recommend : Aloe Farms Aloe Vera Gel Organic, 32-Ounce</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that the ingredients list on the product I received does not match the ingredients list in the pictures (I took a screenshot in case they change it).  I feel like I got a different product than the one I ordered.  I feel misled.</li>
            <li> I have re-ordered this product due to the high quality and reasonable price.  For men, put this on your face after shaving and and showering and your skin will be a smooth a glass...........Not my opinion, just what my girlfiend repeatedly tells me.  It works great and my skin has never looked better!!!</li>
            <li> I have a senstive skin...It stings, doesn&#x27;t get absorbed at all, sits at top of your skin like a plastic, hard transparent flaky mask...feels very sticky when you try to remove it....too bad...good for nothing.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product, I use it when I get out of the shower&lt;br /&gt;it makes my skin fell smooth and soft. it worked wonders on the heels&lt;br /&gt;of my feet. my friends have noticed how smooth my skin feels I let them&lt;br /&gt;try it and they also loved how their skin felt. what can I say it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;great stuff.</li>
            <li> Use on my baby&#x27;s eczema with Vaseline on top. Works like magic. Also use on all small cuts scrapes and bites. Great price for what you get!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a sloppy mess that doesn&#x27;t accomplish anything other than being a sloppy mess. Avoid it. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I use it alone or mixed with my usual serum/moisturizer. Great for oily/combination skin, especially when a normal products can be too heavy.</li>
            <li> This is a good product which I have ordered a number of times before and, as always , it came promptly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing &amp; easy to dispense bottle.  No weird smell and really helps heal.  Give it a try on nails too!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my son&#x27;s sensitive skin and acne, thinking it would be fine because it&#x27;s ALOE.  Which turned out to be VERY wrong! His skin immediately broke out in a terrible rash and turned red! I had to wash it off quickly and give him some allergy medication.I don&#x27;t fault the product, as my son is sensitive to many things.  I  just learned a great lesson to test before putting it on his skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using fresh Certified Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Juice for many many years.  I love that it is organic and as close as you can get to using the natural aloe plant, but in a convenient bottle that you can travel with or keep in the bathroom.  It is truly a hydrating and moisturizing gel and always makes my skin look fresh and youthful.  I wash my face with raw organic honey and jojoba oil and then mix a small dab of the aloe gel with jojoba oil or another of my favorite facial oils and smooth on my face.  The combination is lovely and flattering for my more mature fair skin and it is my daily moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation of face powder because I feel that they age me, but the aloe gel combined with the facial oil gives my skin a more youthful and dewy appearance. It also gives me a some slight sun protection too from what I understand (I have read that aloe and the facial oils that I use have a natural SPF).  Some people commented about the Aloe gel peeling a bit and that can happen if you use too much of it.  I use a lot more of it at night time and slather it on my face  for maximum benefits but use less during the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recently discovered other great use for this aloe very is for anti-itch, cooling off and healing mosquito bites.  I was just in West Africa where it was 90 degrees heat and 90 degrees humidity.  I was getting seriously bitten by mosquitos on my legs and ankles and cortizone seemed to make the bites more hot and itchy - I think because it was so hot during the day.  The one thing that I found that truly gave me relief was this aloe vera gel.  I used fresh aloe vera plants when i could find them and fresh Certified Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Juice gel in addition. Local people were amazed at how quickly my bites healed, that I wasn&#x27;t scratching them and that I had no scarring.  I would say that the bites disappeared within 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend fresh Certified Organic Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Juiceto anyone who wants more hydrated youthful looking skin, who wants to heal blemishes quickly and help prevent scarring, who wants natural beauty care for their skin, and who wants a great anti-itch, cooling and healing topical for mosquito bites.  There are many other uses that I have also heard of e.g to cool and heal sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of a bottle is very reasonable and a large bottle lasts a long time.  I use the smaller size bottles for traveling and refill them from my bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> When I was breaking out really badly, my friend gave me some of this and told me to use it as a spot treatment. I was pretty confused at first because I never though aloe would do anything for acne, but the next day my acne was sooooo much better! I have tried pretty much all the spot treatments, (benzyl peroxide, salicylic acid, ect.) but nothing has worked even close to as well as this does! Plus it doesn&#x27;t burn like most spot treatment, which is great for my sensitive skin. Now I rarely ever get acne! I&#x27;ve also noticed that when I rub some on my t-zone it helps reduce some of the oil (and I have REALLY oily skin). Also, I noticed that Aloe Life Skin Gel works the best out of all the different brands of aloe vera because it is 99% aloe vera (and has vitamins) unlike the drugstore brands. Overall, I&#x27;m so glad I found this product, it has made a HUGE difference in my skin tone!</li>
            <li> This is really a superb product. No alcohol (no stinging), just pure aloe goodness that is remarkably effective to heal damaged skin. A little goes a long way. I put a pea-sized amount in my hair after a shower to make it less frizzy and messy... works well as a hair product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I was searching for a natural. organic aloe and suprisingly had a difficult time. Many would state they were, and then chemicals would be listed on the product label. This Aloe is not only natural but not overly smelly and sticky. Great prodcut, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a natural alternative to reduce acne and oily face, it worsen both. Additionally, it leaves a brown residue when dry.</li>
            <li> love this aloe vera as close to the plant as you can get to, i use this as a eye lash growth,moisturizer,sun damage</li>
            <li> This aloe seems like it&#x27;s right out of the plant and into the bottle. It can be sticky so I sometimes mix it with my lotion and it leaves my skin silky smooth!!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the allantoin in this that makes it so great. I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s amazing on any skin issue I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> In the photos, the ingredients clearly list seaweed thickening agent as the second ingredient. That is the product I wanted. Toysngames sent me one that deceptively has the same bottle but upon further investigation, the ingredients are Aloe followed by glycerin, which is not what I want.</li>
            <li> I like it since it have help my skin to get betters in regards some spots, it take time but it works and the best part is that is mostly natural</li>
            <li> the color is gross and the smell is intolerable....WHAT&#x27;S MORE, it dry out quickly on face.... I really regret buying it, for it doesn&#x27;t help at all and i am thinking about throwing it away</li>
            <li> When the price soared months ago, I tried some products from some other brands, but finally decided to go back to this one.</li>
            <li> i use it more than one month but  there is nothing turn good. So i choose don&#x27;t like it, just waste my money.</li>
            <li> This product works fine and does what it is supposed to do.  It&#x27;s great for rashes, burns, etc.  It has a somewhat thin consistency and is odorless, good product!</li>
            <li> AWESOME is all I have to say!</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this for some razor burns and scars I have from shaving. It works wonderfully! And very soothing on the skin. It does, however, dry my skin out, but I think that is from applying a larger amount. It doesn&#x27;t bother me though, as long as it does the job of healing my skin! It also worked really well when my bf got a small yet annoying burn on his arm. I immediately applied it to his burn, and in a matter of hours he could barely feel the tingles of the burn. I&#x27;d say this is something every household should have!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, you can eat it put on your body ( for cuts bruises etc or body lotion) , hair(shampoo), face ( like an astringent) lubricant ( use your imagination).</li>
            <li> Straight from the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Skin Gel, by Aloe Life, is made from the entire plant using fresh juice and the yellow sap.\\&quot;  Ingredients: 99% certified organic whole leaf aloe vera juice concentrate, seaweed thickening agent, vitamin A, vitamin E, chamomile extract, extract from comfrey, vitamin C, citric acid, potassium sorbate.  NO WATER ADDED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (June 2014):  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years, and now they have CHANGED the ingredients from what I had listed above.  Now they&#x27;ve added glycerin, xanthan gum, and more that I don&#x27;t feel like typing out... just look at the most recent review and someone else has posted all of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I went through this entire bottle not realizing they had added those ingredients.  So it really didn&#x27;t make any difference, to me.  But some people care about ingredients, so I figured I&#x27;d update this review.</li>
            <li> So I have a scalp scarring problem and my scalp get very, very dry and itches beyond belief!! I decided to try aloe since i heard a lot of good thing about its healing properties. So far so good, it lessens the itchiness to a point where it does not bother me as much as it used to. So all in all 5 stars got here within a week looks just like the picture and it came in secure packaging so I did not worry about it spilling everywhere. The product is not a miracle worker but it does help alleviate my dryness.</li>
            <li> I have bad acne and this stuff makes it go away. Ive never had skin so smooth and soft. You do have to be consistent night and day. Regardless how you apply to your skin feels so good. Definitely recommend if you have bad acne. Will clear it up right away.</li>
            <li> this gel is AMAZING! It completely heals and repairs your skin!! I&#x27;m never without it ! it&#x27;s the first I use on family and friends if they hurt themselves.</li>
            <li> This Aloe provides a very pure source of Aloe, but it feels a little sticky.  I am usually for the purest source, but for every day use, I do prefer something which feels smooth instead.</li>
            <li> I love this aloe as I have skin allergies.  Just be warned that it is a liquid and not a gel.</li>
            <li> This gel was exactly what I wanted. Aloe without a bunch of chemical crap in it. I use it as a face moisturizer after showering. I hate putting lotion or anything oily on my face but do need a moisturizer and this fits the bill perfectly. A little goes a long way and this stuff does NOT flake unless you use too much or do multiple layers. I know this because I&#x27;ve reapplied every couple hours on a healing area from removing a mole and this is when you experience flaking... not from one layer of covering your face. It really makes my face feel healthy and tight. It dries really fast and the smell that is not great disappears before you know it. I&#x27;m anxious to see what becomes of the area where the dermatologist sliced me but it&#x27;s too soon right now to say. I&#x27;ll have to report back!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this skin gel. It has replaced my previous moisturizer completely. After using it for just a week, my face redness and dryness has been significantly reduced and I have clearer, healthier looking skin. I had come from using [[ASIN:B001ET78RE Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal Creme , 2-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)]] and [[ASIN:B000PILCJU Avalon Organic Botanicals, Oil-Free Moisturizer, Rejuvenating, Vitamin C, 2 oz]]; however, this product is superior and does not have a ton of random nut and flower oils. Aloe vera just works, and there is no need for anything else. The smell during application does take time to get used to, but it evaporates quickly.  UPDATE 8/15/2015: Please support Subscribe &amp; Save ;)</li>
            <li> Not for face unless at night and then wash off as this stuff will peel, but otherwise this is awesome - best I&#x27;ve found for dry hands and sunburns</li>
            <li> This is the very best Aloe available!!! It is the real deal and even though it cost more, it really costs less because you don&#x27;t need so much so often. It really works. I used more than a dozen and I will not bother now to buy anything else. It is just a waste to buy something else when this product performs so much better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the stuff I buy locally.  It stings my skin.  Unhappy.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST aloe vera gel that I have found.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on other products.</li>
            <li> This product is great for your skin and it helps it look so clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the other customer reviews for eczema. I used it one time and it burned so much I had to wash it off. It may be good for alot of things but it did not work for me and my eczema.</li>
            <li> I use this gel all the time.  It is a wonderful healing, soothing skin gel.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in the unit I received are vastly different than what the product description shows. Instead of &amp;#34;seaweed thickening agent,&amp;#34; my bottle from this company uses &amp;#34;glycerin.&amp;#34; The Vitamin A and E in my bottle are listed much lower in the ingredient list which means there is less of each vitamin in my bottle than the one shown; instead my bottle lists Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, and Phospholipid first... Xanthan Gum is just another a filler like the glycerin. Plus, this line four or five different cosmetic and/or food preservatives compared to the one shown. The bottle shown is from an older product line. I am very unhappy about the false advertising.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for burns and rashes. I cut myself shaving a couple times and this worked like magic in removing the marks afterwards. I&#x27;d say it definitely has some healing properties.</li>
            <li> I have severe chronic hemorrhoids stemming from IBS. Whenever I have a bowel movement, my hemorrhoids (or piles, as the Brittish call them) flare up something fierce. I have found that what works best is mixing this aloe gel with peppermint essential oil on a piece of toilet paper and applying as you would a tucks pad. The aloe draws heat out of the inflamed area and the peppermint cools it -- dual action. I use this when wiping to cool and lubricate and I use 1/4 of a blue automotive paper towel instead of tp to make a pad to &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; all day. Serves sane purpose as a Tucks medicated pad, but isnt toxic and actually works to heal, not just soothe. In fact, were it not for the root cause of IBS still being an issue, Im sure it would be healed already.</li>
            <li> Someone please tell me this product is alcohol free? It smells like alcohol and I&#x27;m not sure I should put it on my face. I do not see positive results yet either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year now, mostly in my hair. I wanted to get away from the commercial hair gels that are loaded with chemicals. I have dry, very curly hair so I add a bit of natural oil...lemon oil for me. I just put a half dollar size amount in the palm on my hand, add a few drops of oil and &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; it together between my hands. Then add to hair. It works great...no more chemicals! Keeps the frizz out and defines the curl. This gel is unscented but the smell of the lemon oil that I add is very refreshing in the morning!</li>
            <li> works well for my psoriasis</li>
            <li> It is an okay product! But my type of skin did not get a good reaction from the ingredients it had.</li>
            <li> I  just love this gel.  PH balanced and delicate on skin, including the scalp.  Will definitely buy more</li>
            <li> This product claims it has pure ingredients, but I have seen no improvement in skin redness using this product.  The flakiness of this product, while indicative of sap present, makes it harder to work with and has to be paired with lotion.</li>
            <li> Easily the best Aloe gel I have found. I think it is less processed than similar products. An unqualified endorsement as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> This aloe vera gel is great my only two complaints are that it smells a bit odd and it flakes like crazy. I suppose this is expected with a more natural version but is still worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those two things aside, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> My sister sent me bottle of this, and I love it! It helps my skin feel smooth, and it helps my dry skin. I started just using it on my face, but have been using it in the shower. A little goes a long way. I am a 58 years old woman, and this works great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this three times a day.  In prevention of acne is my main reason for using this product, and it helps greatly in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the aloe is so pleasant, I love it.  Very natural.  I actually use some on the insides of my nose, because I&#x27;m prone to nosebleeds from dryness and cold weather.  I haven&#x27;t had a nosebleed since doing this, and I used to have one everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the aloe can be a little drying when used alone, so a little moisturizer applied right after is best.  I also rub a little aloe around my necks and smear up from my forehead into my hairline and top of head.  It hardens the hair for styling, and (as they say) helps diminish receding hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using three times a day, one bottle lasts over 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> The photos (and an answered question) in the listing say that the thickener in this gel is &amp;#34;seaweed thickening agent,&amp;#34; but the bottle I received contained glycerin instead. Otherwise, it&#x27;s definitely aloe gel. Good for just about anything, except I wouldn&#x27;t use it on your face or neck, because the glycerin can cause cystic outbreaks if you&#x27;re prone.</li>
            <li> great for so many uses. I add it to my lotions. My daughter adds it to here homemande diaper cloths for her baby.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are non-toxic, non-drying and very helpful. It didn&#x27;t work on my sensitive, picky, facial skin, but I do use it as a hair gel. It also worked great on a hemorrhoid that came and went quickly because I used this gel mixed with a little bit of Tropical Traditions Coconut Oil and it really helped soothe, shrink and heal it. It is good to apply to mosquito bites in the summer and on little cooking burns! I also recommend Aloe Life&#x27;s personal lubricant gel for women; it really works and won&#x27;t irritate your flora or stain the sheets.</li>
            <li> It works, loving this one. it worked for me, I&#x27;d like to say, I saw the result in two days, my scars disappeared and I have my skin back.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and I love it!  Good for minor skin irritations.  Keep it on hand.</li>
    </ol>
