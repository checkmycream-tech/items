            <li>I think it is mostly all hype.</li>
            <li>I sure am glad that I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of 6/13.</li>
            <li>Or, provide the concentrate to create more in this 2 oz format be adding water, distilled or what ever.</li>
            <li>I love all of Chaz Dean products.</li>
            <li>I LOVE WEN HAIR CARE OF EVERYTHING</li>
            <li>I read so many rave reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I instead to purchase more through Amazon soon.</li>
            <li>and I love spraying on face to set makeup.</li>
            <li>I love my WEN cleansing conditioner and six thirteen mousse, but this replenshing treatment does not work on my hair.</li>
            <li>Looks better then when I just washed it.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, but my hair is too fine/thin/limp to use on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I plan to reorder this one when I need more.</li>
            <li>I really love the Wen products.  </li>
            <li>I have used many of the conditioning cleanser &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I will for sure repurchase again and again.  </li>
            <li>Love the price as well and the fact that I can travel with this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect quick replenisher for the arid climate I live in.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and makes my hair a bit shinier, but it&#x27;s almost like a very light weight hair spray to me.</li>
            <li>Most of the other Wen products smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite as impressed as the other wen treatment mists.</li>
            <li>I do miss the wonderful fragrances of the other ones though.  </li>
            <li>I only use WEN (or a good astringent condition when I have budget issues!)</li>
            <li>This is the nice light spray of revival for the curl calming of fly aways that I would use more if it came in more than this little 2 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>With this size it is easy to carry around.  </li>
            <li>This is not the first Wen product I bought on Amazon because the price seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>liked the product very much.</li>
            <li>go longer between washings when I blow-dry and flat iron my hair, and this mist does an excellent job of keeping my hair looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>This mist is fine</li>
            <li>MY PERMED, COLOR TREATED FINE HAIR, PRICE WAS THE&lt;br /&gt;ICING</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend makes hair feel great.</li>
            <li>We both use the Wen Cleansing Conditioners which are fabulous also.</li>
            <li>I had done my hair for church and it looked great when I left.</li>
            <li>I love all Wen products, but 613 is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t believe this product is authentic.</li>
            <li>This product smells good and it is a nice little refresher for the hair</li>
            <li>helps to keep your hydrated and feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on super humid days to keep my hair smooth</li>
            <li>This smells divine like a clean vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for my dry colored treated hair.</li>
            <li>It also is a nice refresher for your skin keeping it hydrated and soft to the touch!  </li>
            <li>This product is great to spray on wet hair before you brush it.  </li>
            <li>My dog loves it when i spray when and brush him, he is so soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing line, and I have used Six Thirteen before (purchased directly from Wen).</li>
            <li>I had been using the Sweet Almond Mint, and was very happy to see that this works at least as well as the SAM does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and the ingredients are amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and feels soft on my skin</li>
            <li>Chaz Deans products have really changed my hairs texture for the better.</li>
            <li>Not bad, I don&#x27;t notice the difference.</li>
            <li>I have used this product along with my other Wen products and it works great..</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the smell when I first smelled it in the bottle, but it smells completely different on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Works great to soften my fine, (weak) curly hair, and helps better define the curl I do have a bit.</li>
            <li>Since it smells so clean &amp; fresh</li>
            <li>I like the way this formula seems to help with the ends of my hair and it looks shinier and more vibrant</li>
            <li>A quick body pick me up, too.</li>
            <li>smells sooo good, Lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li>I originally only bought it because it was discounted in price, but boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love his moisturizing shampoo and deep conditioners, which I&#x27;ve been using for a long while now with great results.</li>
            <li>but I am not crazy about the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This product smells so fresh</li>
            <li>smells good, but doesn&#x27;t hydrate as well as I had expected.</li>
            <li>so it is definitely worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use it more frequently but tend to hoard it.</li>
            <li>I spray it on my hair fresh out of the shower, then once I blow-dry it.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they sold it in a bigger bottle though, but I&#x27;ll continue to buy it regardless.</li>
            <li>it seems too good to be true, it usually is\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>You need not look any further for a refreshing mist for your face or your hair...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff... Needs bigger bottle!</li>
            <li>I use WEN products and this is the first time I tried the 6 13.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE aromatherapy and essential oils, but this smell?</li>
            <li>So glad that I did, especially for the Six Thirteen.</li>
            <li>Gives hair the ultimate healthy feel.</li>
            <li>Had this been a larger size, then I would have given it more stars.  </li>
            <li>I have bought Six Thirteen products before and love them but never have I come across such a strong smell...gave me an instant headache</li>
            <li>I had waited long and hard to try the 6/13 line, reading MANY of the reviews to see really if it is better than the Fig I love and the Pomegranate that was getting raves.</li>
            <li>This product smells really, really good, but does very little for me.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s all I can say positive about it.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and it moisturizes both your face and hair when you hit dry spells.  </li>
            <li>However, I could easily add just one pump of the Six Thirteen Cleanser to 8 oz of water (this bottle is 2 oz) and come up with the same product.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend this product, especially for curly/unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>They are great for using to refresh your style the day after you shampoo (I have long wavy hair thanks to WEN and use it every other day).  </li>
            <li>Not as expected, more like a perfume for the hair.</li>
            <li>It smells like a bit of a manlier version of straight vanilla because of the lemon rosemary.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend and endorse it!</li>
            <li>didnt do much for frizzz</li>
            <li>I like the smell of the  replenishing mist but cannot really see any benefit of using it.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to change my hair much besides adding perfume.</li>
            <li>Was sticky and didn&#x27;t seem to achieve much .</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have anything really to say about</li>
            <li>NOT SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>I use all of Wen products, but I order this 613 replenishing spray because it&#x27;s much cheaper in this size at Amazon.</li>
            <li>SMELL REALLY</li>
            <li>ON THE CAKE, THANKS SOOOOO MUCH HOPE</li>
            <li>Kind of a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>At least it was at a price for trying, but not as good as Wen products.</li>
            <li>I have been using Wen shampoo for the past few months and have been very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it my hair was soft ,silky, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>Its okay for a little &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; like its supposed to be, but doesn&#x27;t really make a difference otherwise.</li>
            <li>I think I would have had better results by spraying my hair with water and a little lavender oil.</li>
            <li>especially the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>For starters, the smell is more like the smell of men&#x27;s cologne and it didn&#x27;t really moisturize my hair, but simply got it wet and had a crunchy after feeling.</li>
            <li>Finally I have found a product that gets rid of static electricity in my hair from the dry winter air.  </li>
            <li>Live and Learn.</li>
            <li>It feels soft and is swingy!  </li>
            <li>It will make your hair soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>My frizzy, curly hair has been transformed into actual real hair that shines and holds a style!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it really shouldn&#x27;t be used daily.  </li>
            <li>So much so that I felt like my skin was rashing seconds later.</li>
            <li>AS I WILL BE LOOKING IN THE NEAR FUTURE!!&lt;br /&gt;DELIVERY</li>
            <li>You know the old saying, \\&quot;if</li>
            <li>Until I discovered that Amazon carries WEN, I had been purchasing from a well-known shopping channel, which is still far cheaper than Chaz Dean&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>wont buy again too expensive to make my hair smell good</li>
            <li>I think this product should be replaced with a larger volume and not at a significantly high cost than the 2 oz one.</li>
            <li>I love the whole wen hair care line, however I found this to be a little to heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and I even use it to clean pets (spray a brush and then brush either dogs or cats and they smell like little animal airfresheners!)</li>
            <li>they are like no other</li>
            <li>I have very fine, long hair, that is uncolored and unprocessed and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>It is very stinky and did nothing to moisturize my very dry hair.</li>
            <li>Perk up day old doo with this terrific smelling hydration spray!</li>
            <li>especially if it doesn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
            <li>It is worth two small stars.  </li>
            <li>It actually makes my hair feel a little stiff, but I love the smell.</li>
            <li>even though I don&#x27;t need much since I use the corresponding cleansing treatment - this has been much less of an issue for me).  </li>
            <li>Just far too much money for such a small amount</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair (from medication I am taking) and this works to give my hair body.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type (thin and fine), but I don&#x27;t get moisturization from this product.</li>
            <li>Literally sucked the moisture right out and made my long wavy hair frizzy, thirsty, and stiff.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this product.  </li>

            <li> It smells great and is very hydrating on my hair.  </li>
            <li> love it, love it, it does what is says.  </li>
            <li> I think it is mostly all hype.</li>
            <li> I sure am glad that I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of 6/13.</li>
            <li> Or, provide the concentrate to create more in this 2 oz format be adding water, distilled or what ever.</li>
            <li> I love all of Chaz Dean products.</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEN HAIR CARE OF EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> I read so many rave reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I instead to purchase more through Amazon soon.</li>
            <li> and I love spraying on face to set makeup.</li>
            <li> I love my WEN cleansing conditioner and six thirteen mousse, but this replenshing treatment does not work on my hair.</li>
            <li> Looks better then when I just washed it.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell, but my hair is too fine/thin/limp to use on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I plan to reorder this one when I need more.</li>
            <li> I really love the Wen products.  </li>
            <li> I have used many of the conditioning cleanser &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I will for sure repurchase again and again.  </li>
            <li> Love the price as well and the fact that I can travel with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect quick replenisher for the arid climate I live in.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and makes my hair a bit shinier, but it&#x27;s almost like a very light weight hair spray to me.</li>
            <li> Most of the other Wen products smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite as impressed as the other wen treatment mists.</li>
            <li> I do miss the wonderful fragrances of the other ones though.  </li>
            <li> I only use WEN (or a good astringent condition when I have budget issues!)</li>
            <li> This is the nice light spray of revival for the curl calming of fly aways that I would use more if it came in more than this little 2 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> With this size it is easy to carry around.  </li>
            <li> This is not the first Wen product I bought on Amazon because the price seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> liked the product very much.</li>
            <li> go longer between washings when I blow-dry and flat iron my hair, and this mist does an excellent job of keeping my hair looking fresh.  </li>
            <li> This mist is fine</li>
            <li> MY PERMED, COLOR TREATED FINE HAIR, PRICE WAS THE&lt;br /&gt;ICING</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend makes hair feel great.</li>
            <li> We both use the Wen Cleansing Conditioners which are fabulous also.</li>
            <li> I had done my hair for church and it looked great when I left.</li>
            <li> I love all Wen products, but 613 is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t believe this product is authentic.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and it is a nice little refresher for the hair</li>
            <li> helps to keep your hydrated and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on super humid days to keep my hair smooth</li>
            <li> This smells divine like a clean vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my dry colored treated hair.</li>
            <li> It also is a nice refresher for your skin keeping it hydrated and soft to the touch!  </li>
            <li> This product is great to spray on wet hair before you brush it.  </li>
            <li> My dog loves it when i spray when and brush him, he is so soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing line, and I have used Six Thirteen before (purchased directly from Wen).</li>
            <li> I had been using the Sweet Almond Mint, and was very happy to see that this works at least as well as the SAM does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and the ingredients are amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and feels soft on my skin</li>
            <li> Chaz Deans products have really changed my hairs texture for the better.</li>
            <li> Not bad, I don&#x27;t notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I have used this product along with my other Wen products and it works great..</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the smell when I first smelled it in the bottle, but it smells completely different on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Works great to soften my fine, (weak) curly hair, and helps better define the curl I do have a bit.</li>
            <li> Since it smells so clean &amp; fresh</li>
            <li> I like the way this formula seems to help with the ends of my hair and it looks shinier and more vibrant</li>
            <li> A quick body pick me up, too.</li>
            <li> smells sooo good, Lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> I originally only bought it because it was discounted in price, but boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love his moisturizing shampoo and deep conditioners, which I&#x27;ve been using for a long while now with great results.</li>
            <li> but I am not crazy about the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This product smells so fresh</li>
            <li> smells good, but doesn&#x27;t hydrate as well as I had expected.</li>
            <li> so it is definitely worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use it more frequently but tend to hoard it.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my hair fresh out of the shower, then once I blow-dry it.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they sold it in a bigger bottle though, but I&#x27;ll continue to buy it regardless.</li>
            <li> it seems too good to be true, it usually is\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> You need not look any further for a refreshing mist for your face or your hair...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... Needs bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> I use WEN products and this is the first time I tried the 6 13.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE aromatherapy and essential oils, but this smell?</li>
            <li> So glad that I did, especially for the Six Thirteen.</li>
            <li> Gives hair the ultimate healthy feel.</li>
            <li> Had this been a larger size, then I would have given it more stars.  </li>
            <li> I have bought Six Thirteen products before and love them but never have I come across such a strong smell...gave me an instant headache</li>
            <li> I had waited long and hard to try the 6/13 line, reading MANY of the reviews to see really if it is better than the Fig I love and the Pomegranate that was getting raves.</li>
            <li> This product smells really, really good, but does very little for me.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s all I can say positive about it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and it moisturizes both your face and hair when you hit dry spells.  </li>
            <li> However, I could easily add just one pump of the Six Thirteen Cleanser to 8 oz of water (this bottle is 2 oz) and come up with the same product.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend this product, especially for curly/unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> They are great for using to refresh your style the day after you shampoo (I have long wavy hair thanks to WEN and use it every other day).  </li>
            <li> Not as expected, more like a perfume for the hair.</li>
            <li> It smells like a bit of a manlier version of straight vanilla because of the lemon rosemary.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend and endorse it!</li>
            <li> didnt do much for frizzz</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the  replenishing mist but cannot really see any benefit of using it.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to change my hair much besides adding perfume.</li>
            <li> Was sticky and didn&#x27;t seem to achieve much .</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have anything really to say about</li>
            <li> NOT SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> I use all of Wen products, but I order this 613 replenishing spray because it&#x27;s much cheaper in this size at Amazon.</li>
            <li> SMELL REALLY</li>
            <li> ON THE CAKE, THANKS SOOOOO MUCH HOPE</li>
            <li> Kind of a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> At least it was at a price for trying, but not as good as Wen products.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen shampoo for the past few months and have been very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it my hair was soft ,silky, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> Its okay for a little &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; like its supposed to be, but doesn&#x27;t really make a difference otherwise.</li>
            <li> I think I would have had better results by spraying my hair with water and a little lavender oil.</li>
            <li> especially the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> For starters, the smell is more like the smell of men&#x27;s cologne and it didn&#x27;t really moisturize my hair, but simply got it wet and had a crunchy after feeling.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found a product that gets rid of static electricity in my hair from the dry winter air.  </li>
            <li> Live and Learn.</li>
            <li> It feels soft and is swingy!  </li>
            <li> It will make your hair soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> My frizzy, curly hair has been transformed into actual real hair that shines and holds a style!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it really shouldn&#x27;t be used daily.  </li>
            <li> So much so that I felt like my skin was rashing seconds later.</li>
            <li> AS I WILL BE LOOKING IN THE NEAR FUTURE!!&lt;br /&gt;DELIVERY</li>
            <li> You know the old saying, \\&quot;if</li>
            <li> Until I discovered that Amazon carries WEN, I had been purchasing from a well-known shopping channel, which is still far cheaper than Chaz Dean&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> wont buy again too expensive to make my hair smell good</li>
            <li> I think this product should be replaced with a larger volume and not at a significantly high cost than the 2 oz one.</li>
            <li> I love the whole wen hair care line, however I found this to be a little to heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and I even use it to clean pets (spray a brush and then brush either dogs or cats and they smell like little animal airfresheners!)</li>
            <li> they are like no other</li>
            <li> I have very fine, long hair, that is uncolored and unprocessed and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> It is very stinky and did nothing to moisturize my very dry hair.</li>
            <li> Perk up day old doo with this terrific smelling hydration spray!</li>
            <li> especially if it doesn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
            <li> It is worth two small stars.  </li>
            <li> It actually makes my hair feel a little stiff, but I love the smell.</li>
            <li> even though I don&#x27;t need much since I use the corresponding cleansing treatment - this has been much less of an issue for me).  </li>
            <li> Just far too much money for such a small amount</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair (from medication I am taking) and this works to give my hair body.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type (thin and fine), but I don&#x27;t get moisturization from this product.</li>
            <li> Literally sucked the moisture right out and made my long wavy hair frizzy, thirsty, and stiff.</li>
            <li> I have wild, naturally curly hair and when I want to tame it</li>
            <li> Very conditioning and no strong aroma.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this really ever made a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> this won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Even helped with minor facial lines.</li>
            <li> This product unlike the other fragrances is a little heavier and makes your hair appear oily if you use too much</li>
            <li> I can spray my wavy hair to tame down the frizzed on hot, humid days.</li>
            <li> Especially when the air is dry, this product gives my hair the moisture it needs!</li>
            <li> Adds plump to flat dry hair.</li>
            <li> Expected this to be larger even though the weight listed.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and covers up smells from smoking and cooking between washes.</li>
            <li> Really like my wen shampoo was wanting to try this product because of WEN, not impressed so far but will keep trying for results!</li>
            <li> a few sprays is all it takes on fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep the hair hydrated from the dry gas heating air in my house</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I use this between cleansing to freshen dry, styled hair.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with dry colored treated hair to try it.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten dry</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Does not live up to expectations from commercials.</li>
            <li> I was expecting so much more from Chaz Dean on this mist but it fell short of my expectations :(</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t be afraid to use this as a quick replenishing spray!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> After using it only a few times I have  already seen a difference in my&lt;br</li>
            <li> The WEN products made my scalp and neck itch and it made my hair coarse, brittle and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money for me</li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I plan on using a little bit of watered down Wen shampoo to try to accomplish the same thing.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.  </li>
            <li> This was pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I use it to add moisture to my hair a day or so after shampooing and or whenever it feels a little dry.</li>
            <li> and I use it for a little extra protection on my long hair when I know I&#x27;m going to be putting it through extra stress such as being in the sun, riding motorcycle or in dry, cold weather that zaps the moisture from your hair.</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend noticed, he asked me if I put hairspray in my hair because it was dry and stiff to the touch.</li>
            <li> I usually wet my hair a little and then spray to refresh my hair in between washes which seems to work.</li>
            <li> but it is NOT worth $20.  </li>
            <li> It does not weigh your hair down or build up on the hair.</li>
            <li> This has helped my hair feel silky without being weighted down, helps take the frizz out of the frizz.</li>
            <li> it adds a little shine and revives the style.  </li>
            <li> Imagine my horror when I looked in the mirror and saw a fuzzy, stiff mess.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> replenishing mist did not add moisture to my hair - it dried it out and made my hair frizzly.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t wash it everyday.</li>
            <li> Even spraying this in my hair and running my fingers through my hair was a hairy-handed mess!</li>
            <li> Get it on sale or an add-on if possible, otherwise it is kinda expensive.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase two at once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this stuff is supposed to smell like</li>
            <li> I can not use Wen products anymore after a while it starts to thin hair and weigh it down</li>
            <li> The price is outrageous and it is no different from other similar hair products.  </li>
            <li> I was to say the least suspicious of the hype for this product.</li>
            <li> That being said, this product arrived without the seal that other treatment mists I purchased from Wen had, and it dried my hair out like crazy.</li>
            <li> The bottle is VERY small.  </li>
            <li> but this is not good.  </li>
            <li> Usually I avoid anything with fragrance because it causes ma bad headaches, but this doesn&#x27;t cause any problem.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Wen products are so expensive ...</li>
            <li> Was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> This product is a  disappointment.</li>
            <li> I even used it a few times and it did nothing!!!!!</li>
            <li> So, I was afraid to use it because anything could have been in there!  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I used it.  </li>
            <li> but it really disappointed me.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> You need not look any further for a refreshing mist for your face or your hair...it is delicious !</li>
            <li> This was pretty useless. I tried it but it didn&#x27;t help anything so I don&#x27;t use it anymore and would send it back if I could.</li>
            <li> I have the 6 13 cleansing conditioner and love it, this stuff is okay but I like the cleansing conditioner a lot.</li>
            <li> I mist this on my face both before and after applying make-up. It is refreshing and soothing and moisturizing. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> THEN I WOULD USE THIS PRODUCT. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.  I LOVE THE SMELL TOO.  THE MORE OFTEN YOU USE IT THE BETTER THE RESULTS,  I WILL NEVER USE SHAMPOO AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep the hair hydrated from the dry gas heating air in my house</li>
            <li> Expected this to be larger even though the weight listed.  Is more a travel size, but the product is great.</li>
            <li> This product smells really, really good, but does very little for me.  Kind of a waste of money.  Its okay for a little &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; like its supposed to be, but doesn&#x27;t really make a difference otherwise.</li>
            <li> Love Wen been using for three yrs now. Great scent. Lemon verbena vanilla bean.</li>
            <li> This mist is fine but I am not crazy about the fragrance.  It almost seems to have a musk smell.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Not the quality I&#x27;ve come to expect from wen. It smells nice but that&#x27;s all I can say positive about it.</li>
            <li> It okay l did not see any different l won&#x27;t bye it again it not work for maybe for some else</li>
            <li> Counterfeit item. Live and Learn.</li>
            <li> I have used this product along with my other Wen products and it works great.. I am already considering buying another bottle so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> The Wen 613 is the top of Chaz Dean&#x27;s line. This one smells really good...use for refreshing your hair between cleansings...helps to keep your hydrated and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Not as expected, more like a perfume for the hair. Leaves the hair dry and brittle. Would not order again</li>
            <li> I love this product - it smells amazing and I use it for a little extra protection on my long hair when I know I&#x27;m going to be putting it through extra stress such as being in the sun, riding motorcycle or in dry, cold weather that zaps the moisture from your hair. I&#x27;ve also used it on super humid days to keep my hair smooth so it doesn&#x27;t frizz (even though I don&#x27;t need much since I use the corresponding cleansing treatment - this has been much less of an issue for me).  It does not weigh your hair down or build up on the hair.</li>
            <li> It is worth two small stars.  The price is outrageous and it is no different from other similar hair products.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I realy don&#x27;t like the smell. Love the chaz products but won&#x27;t order this again. It is like putting smelly water on your hair or skin.</li>
            <li> Well, the bottle arrived with no covering, no plastic wrap, no seal, and NO safety seal whatsover!  So, I was afraid to use it because anything could have been in there!  I even used it a few times and it did nothing!!!!! The seller was unfriendly and not helpful also.</li>
            <li> I like the way this formula seems to help with the ends of my hair and it looks shinier and more vibrant</li>
            <li> I thought these replenishing treatments weren&#x27;t necessary till i started using them.  They are great for using to refresh your style the day after you shampoo (I have long wavy hair thanks to WEN and use it every other day).  It also is a nice refresher for your skin keeping it hydrated and soft to the touch!  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I like Wen products and would definitely buy this again , but in another scent.&lt;br /&gt;I also could use a larger bottle..this won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I love the WEN products but must admit that I am not impressed with this item, I do not see a difference in my hair after using this.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, the way it refreshes and moisterises my skin and hair . It&#x27;s a perfect quick replenisher for the arid climate I live in.</li>
            <li> It refreshes my curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy.  It will make your hair soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> Really like my wen shampoo was wanting to try this product because of WEN, not impressed so far but will keep trying for results!</li>
            <li> Perk up day old doo with this terrific smelling hydration spray! Great &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; price. Adds plump to flat dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love all Wen products, but 613 is my absolute favorite.  It is so moisturizing and it smells so nice!  It smells like a bit of a manlier version of straight vanilla because of the lemon rosemary.  This product is great to spray on wet hair before you brush it.  Also, don&#x27;t be afraid to use this as a quick replenishing spray! It moisturizes, detangles, refreshes and smells great!</li>
            <li> Works great between using wen conditioner and hair looks clean!! I also love the smell its very refreshing! I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on my hair since using wen!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite as impressed as the other wen treatment mists. Just far too much money for such a small amount especially if it doesn&#x27;t wow me. I probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I use WEN products and in so doing I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day. This product smells so fresh and I use it to keep my hair smelling good between washes. It lasts a long time and covers up smells from smoking and cooking between washes.</li>
            <li> This treatment mist is a must! I have wild, naturally curly hair and when I want to tame it a bit wo fully drenching to style, this us my goto! I highly recommend and endorse it!</li>
            <li> Wen products made my hair fall out strand by strand.  I did not like using any Wen product at all and was baffled why it made my hair so breakable.  Even spraying this in my hair and running my fingers through my hair was a hairy-handed mess!</li>
            <li> didnt do much for frizzz</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Keep in my bag for refresher, my kids love too...especially the fresh scent. Would definitely recommend makes hair feel great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This product is nothing like the Wen shampoo/conditioner. It is very stinky and did nothing to moisturize my very dry hair. I plan on using a little bit of watered down Wen shampoo to try to accomplish the same thing.</li>
            <li> Really love the smell but the product makes my hair greasy in a couple of hours though. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair.</li>
            <li> Made me nervous to go to the Wen website, I don&#x27;t like subscriptions I always forget I have them. Amazon is competitively priced; it&#x27;s a good place to try a product. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone disliking this product, not if it comes as intended and is used as intended.</li>
            <li> smells good, but doesn&#x27;t hydrate as well as I had expected. wont buy again too expensive to make my hair smell good</li>
            <li> liked the product very much. I  would reccommend to everyone. it adds  needed moisture to (ETHNIC)  hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very good for price</li>
            <li> Love the scent and it moisturizes both your face and hair when you hit dry spells.  Get it on sale or an add-on if possible, otherwise it is kinda expensive.  But irregardless you will smell FAN-TASTIC!</li>
            <li> I think the thing I like best about this spray is the clean, fresh smell.  But it also does a great job of taming flyaways.</li>
            <li> I use this between cleansing to freshen dry, styled hair.  it adds a little shine and revives the style.  This is a nice product.</li>
            <li> Chaz Dean&#x27;s best. Very conditioning and no strong aroma.</li>
            <li> A++++. Excellent transaction. Would buy from this seller again. Love, love.</li>
            <li> Especially when the air is dry, this product gives my hair the moisture it needs! I would recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after using the Six Thirteen conditioning shampoo. I love, love, love the smell. I use it to add moisture to my hair a day or so after shampooing and or whenever it feels a little dry. I also like to mist it on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... Needs bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> Nice refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the  replenishing mist but cannot really see any benefit of using it.  I want to see results from products.</li>
            <li> I cannot ever say enough about all the WEN products.  I can never thank Chaz enough for making this product come to life.  My hair is the best it has EVER looked and it will stay this way because I will NEVER go back to shampoo!  Way to go Chaz</li>
            <li> Good this product.  Finishing touch.</li>
            <li> Nice spray for face to moisturize before putting on lotions and makeup.  I know, it&#x27;s supposed to be for your hair.  Stage Mom doesn&#x27;t always follow the crowd.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It smells nice and feels soft on my skin but it doesn&#x27;t seem to change my hair much besides adding perfume.</li>
            <li> Where has this stuff been all my life? My frizzy, curly hair has been transformed into actual real hair that shines and holds a style!&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed that I  just ordered the cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the whole wen hair care line, however I found this to be a little to heavy for my hair. Got this at a great price so it is definitely worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I am a Wen \\&quot;girl\\&quot;...my hair is permed and colored...need some extra nourishment during the day.  With this size it is easy to carry around.  I would recommend that you try it.</li>
            <li> I was to say the least suspicious of the hype for this product. After using it only a few times I have  already seen a difference in my&lt;br /&gt;hair that I wouldn&#x27;t have believed was possible.</li>
            <li> Like all WEN  products, this is great!  I love it!  The mist has a wonderful light&lt;br /&gt;smell,  but  it&#x27;s not perfumey.  I&#x27;m allergic to colognes and perfumes, but not to this.&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of aromatherapy fragrances.</li>
            <li> Wen products are so expensive ... and there&#x27;s nothing else like them!</li>
            <li> Anything Wen is amazing. I&#x27;m a guy with 2&amp;#34; hair  and have used his products for 5 years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replenishing mist is what I use in the morning. 5 sprays to my Palm and run it through my scalp. Then I can use my boar brush and a blow dryer and my hair is like brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only cleanse my hair twice a week so this product is crucial to my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this after blow drying and cleansing.</li>
            <li> The size is wonderful for travel and it does just what it says.</li>
            <li> Can not tell any difference after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;Still using and looking for improvement&lt;br /&gt;Came in good time and good shape</li>
            <li> I love Wen products! This product smells awesome! I wish Chaz Dean would make a regular conditioning wash that smells like this. This is not the conditioning wash but he does have the 613 wash but it really shouldn&#x27;t be used daily.  This is a treatment mist. You will want to keep using it because it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I use this as a facial toner as well as a hair care product.</li>
            <li> This smells divine like a clean vanilla smell. It&#x27;s all natural and I even use it to clean pets (spray a brush and then brush either dogs or cats and they smell like little animal airfresheners!) My dog loves it when i spray when and brush him, he is so soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Love love love this. I can spray my wavy hair to tame down the frizzed on hot, humid days. It does not leave a product build-up which is really nice. Since it smells so clean &amp; fresh I&#x27;d use it more frequently but tend to hoard it.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed. Was sticky and didn&#x27;t seem to achieve much . Probably will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair (from medication I am taking) and this works to give my hair body.  I also use the six thirteen mousse with this, which I also like and recommend.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled. I couldn&#x27;t stand to have it on my hair. Most of the other Wen products smell wonderful. Not this one!</li>
            <li> The smell it nice, and it&#x27;s hold your hair good, I don&#x27;t have anything really to say about I can see and feel my hair getting stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes you should try it.</li>
            <li> This product is seriously amazing. I originally only bought it because it was discounted in price, but boy am I glad I did! I spray it on my hair fresh out of the shower, then once I blow-dry it. I also spray it all over my face and body. Very hydrating and pleasant smell! I discovered that it was also said to be anti-aging and this is very true! Even helped with minor facial lines. Truly remarkable product.</li>
            <li> If you use any Chaz products then you know that Six Thirteen is an great addition to being a &amp;#34;Wen Woman&amp;#34;  Product arrived as indicated and delivery was prompt.....Again Amazon and Seller have worked together to supply great products and great service.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I can not use Wen products anymore after a while it starts to thin hair and weigh it down I have moved on to beauty and the bees shampoo and conditioning bars they are like no other this did not leave my hair moisturized but the smell is great.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  It smells great and is very hydrating on my hair.  I use it before I straiten my hair and after.</li>
            <li> I use WEN products and this is the first time I tried the 6 13.  I got both the cleansing conditioner and the treatment mist and I can see visible results.  I do miss the wonderful fragrances of the other ones though.  This one smells like chemicals.</li>
            <li> Ugh! With all of the raving reviews, I thought this would be my IT product...NOT SO MUCH. I LOVE aromatherapy and essential oils, but this smell? I tried to use it but it was too over-powering. So much so that I felt like my skin was rashing seconds later. Nope, never again, to any WEN products.</li>
            <li> I have bought Six Thirteen products before and love them but never have I come across such a strong smell...gave me an instant headache</li>
            <li> I love the smell and its perfect for traveling. Has a nice citrusy and perfumey aroma. Nice to spray on hair.</li>
            <li> love it, love it, it does what is says.  I usually purchase two at once so i dont run out</li>
            <li> I use the WEN products all the time and I think the replenishing treatment sprays are the best product they sell.  Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I can do without this treatment mist.  It actually makes my hair feel a little stiff, but I love the smell. I usually wet my hair a little and then spray to refresh my hair in between washes which seems to work.</li>
            <li> I use all of Wen products, but I order this 613 replenishing spray because it&#x27;s much cheaper in this size at Amazon. I use it and I use it on my dog&#x27;s back and tail. Everyone we meet always remarks on how great he smells. It also keeps his coat moisturized between washings. We both use the Wen Cleansing Conditioners which are fabulous also.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money. This product is a  disappointment. I think it is mostly all hype. I sure am glad that I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of 6/13. But I use it as a spray to keep my hair hydrated. I also spray it on my face very lightly to set makeup.</li>
            <li> This is the nice light spray of revival for the curl calming of fly aways that I would use more if it came in more than this little 2 oz bottle. I think this product should be replaced with a larger volume and not at a significantly high cost than the 2 oz one. Or, provide the concentrate to create more in this 2 oz format be adding water, distilled or what ever.</li>
            <li> Not bad, I don&#x27;t notice the difference. I like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> ok...love this wish it was a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> Like WEN products: I mix this with WEN styling cream.</li>
            <li> SMELL REALLY NICE.FAST SHIPPING THANK YOU.WEN IS A AWESOME PRODUCT.WILL BUY MORE WEN.A+for this product. Should of bought it in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I love all of Chaz Dean products.</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEN HAIR CARE OF EVERYTHING I HAVE NOT FOUND A&lt;br /&gt;ONE THAT I DONT LOVE, AND THIS SIX THIRTEEN IS MARVELOUS&lt;br /&gt;FOR MY PERMED, COLOR TREATED FINE HAIR, PRICE WAS THE&lt;br /&gt;ICING ON THE CAKE, THANKS SOOOOO MUCH HOPE YOU CONTINUE&lt;br /&gt;TO CARRY WEN PRODUCTS AS I WILL BE LOOKING IN THE NEAR FUTURE!!&lt;br /&gt;DELIVERY WAS AMAZING KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!</li>
            <li> The WEN products made my scalp and neck itch and it made my hair coarse, brittle and heavy.  Loved the scent but the rest was not my cup of tea.  Total waste of money for me but I have a friend who uses it and her hair is delightful.  She got my products!</li>
            <li> I read so many rave reviews on this product.  I was so disappointed when I used it.  I did not feel it made my hair silky at all!  I have been using Wen shampoo for the past few months and have been very happy with the results.  Was looking forward to using this product but it really disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Besides  my own hair I use this on my Maltese  dog .It leaves  our hair soft,shinny and smelling great and it is good for a styling  touch up between cleansing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my dry colored treated hair. The first time I used it my hair was soft ,silky, shiny and manageable. The dryness was gone. The smell is good and relaxing. I would recommend this product to anyone with dry colored treated hair to try it. You will be very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I was expecting so much more from Chaz Dean on this mist but it fell short of my expectations :( I love his moisturizing shampoo and deep conditioners, which I&#x27;ve been using for a long while now with great results. However, I can&#x27;t say the same for this mist. For starters, the smell is more like the smell of men&#x27;s cologne and it didn&#x27;t really moisturize my hair, but simply got it wet and had a crunchy after feeling. I think I would have had better results by spraying my hair with water and a little lavender oil.</li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t believe this product is authentic. I have used only Wen products for 1 year now and I know what Wen can do for your hair. It is an amazing line, and I have used Six Thirteen before (purchased directly from Wen). That being said, this product arrived without the seal that other treatment mists I purchased from Wen had, and it dried my hair out like crazy. Literally sucked the moisture right out and made my long wavy hair frizzy, thirsty, and stiff. Even my boyfriend noticed, he asked me if I put hairspray in my hair because it was dry and stiff to the touch. Do yourself and favor and skip the Wen from Amazon! This is not the first Wen product I bought on Amazon because the price seemed too good to be true. You know the old saying, \\&quot;if it seems too good to be true, it usually is\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> a few sprays is all it takes on fine, thin hair. I don&#x27;t see any added shine or luster but I do think there is some protection from the elements and a sense of conditioning. great for a quick spritz.</li>
            <li> Spray on your hair to refresh, shine and make your hair smell amazing! A quick body pick me up, too.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smoothed and softens my hair. It does what it says it does. I instead to purchase more through Amazon soon.</li>
            <li> This product unlike the other fragrances is a little heavier and makes your hair appear oily if you use too much</li>
            <li> This spray is awesome. The smell is intoxicating! Makes you feel like your in a spa. Spruces up your hair and I love spraying on face to set makeup.</li>
            <li> Does not live up to expectations from commercials. This does not work as promised. I love my WEN cleansing conditioner and six thirteen mousse, but this replenshing treatment does not work on my hair.</li>
            <li> I had waited long and hard to try the 6/13 line, reading MANY of the reviews to see really if it is better than the Fig I love and the Pomegranate that was getting raves. After saving some money, I decided to take the plunge and take advantage of the add on. Well, although I like the 6/13 conditioner, this I definitely do not like. I had done my hair for church and it looked great when I left. I spritzed it with this and drove to the service. Imagine my horror when I looked in the mirror and saw a fuzzy, stiff mess. Oh yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replenishing mist did not add moisture to my hair - it dried it out and made my hair frizzly. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Best Wen smell ever !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this stuff is supposed to smell like but this is not good.  It reminds me of Axe body spray..... Yuck.</li>
            <li> Love this! It is expensive but worth every penny. My hair has gotten dry so I can&#x27;t wash it everyday. I spray on and brush hair into place. Looks better then when I just washed it.  Smells great</li>
            <li> Amazing product, it smells great and makes my hair so soft and shiny! Love!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but my hair is too fine/thin/limp to use on my hair.  I do use it on my face and body though to refresh - its like aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> Works great to soften my fine, (weak) curly hair, and helps better define the curl I do have a bit. Helps with the frizz, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it gets humid I spray it on my ends throughout the day to liven up my curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful, clean and fresh. I even spray it on my ends before bed so I can smell it while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Finally I have found a product that gets rid of static electricity in my hair from the dry winter air.  I have very fine, long hair, that is uncolored and unprocessed and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  It feels soft and is swingy!  I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the smell when I first smelled it in the bottle, but it smells completely different on my hair.  It isn&#x27;t an overpowering scent, but quite pleasant and I like it.  Usually I avoid anything with fragrance because it causes ma bad headaches, but this doesn&#x27;t cause any problem.  I plan to reorder this one when I need more.</li>
            <li> It was a good experience but not for me</li>
            <li> I am not sure this really ever made a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Until I discovered that Amazon carries WEN, I had been purchasing from a well-known shopping channel, which is still far cheaper than Chaz Dean&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used shampoo on my hair in about three years. I only use WEN (or a good astringent condition when I have budget issues!) I love the Six Thirteen line, and was so happy to find the Replenishing mist here for such a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go longer between washings when I blow-dry and flat iron my hair, and this mist does an excellent job of keeping my hair looking fresh.  I had been using the Sweet Almond Mint, and was very happy to see that this works at least as well as the SAM does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re a WEN girl and love your beautiful hair, then you have to search Amazon for the deals.  So glad that I did, especially for the Six Thirteen.</li>
            <li> This is for the adventitious hair. Gives hair the ultimate healthy feel. 100% recommended. Chaz Dean ROCKS. Try all his products.</li>
            <li> At least it was at a price for trying, but not as good as Wen products.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type (thin and fine), but I don&#x27;t get moisturization from this product. It smells fantastic and makes my hair a bit shinier, but it&#x27;s almost like a very light weight hair spray to me. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a fan of this one.</li>
            <li> Another WEN product I don&#x27;t like. Made my hair dry. Don&#x27;t recommend this at all! Beware anything WEN! I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I really love the Wen products.  I have used many of the conditioning cleanser &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.  The treatment mist is wonderful for after the shower, and it makes my daughters&#x27; hair so soft and shiny. Strongly recommend this product, especially for curly/unruly hair.  It would be nice if they sold it in a bigger bottle though, but I&#x27;ll continue to buy it regardless.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and it is a nice little refresher for the hair but it is NOT worth $20.  The bottle is VERY small.  Had this been a larger size, then I would have given it more stars.  However, I could easily add just one pump of the Six Thirteen Cleanser to 8 oz of water (this bottle is 2 oz) and come up with the same product.  I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> It helps detangle, and it has a fragrant smell! Chaz Deans products have really changed my hairs texture for the better.</li>
            <li> smells sooo good, Lasts me a long time. Leaves my hair soft and the ingredients are amazing. I will for sure repurchase again and again.  Love the price as well and the fact that I can travel with this.</li>
            <li> This has helped my hair feel silky without being weighted down, helps take the frizz out of the frizz. Try it.</li>
