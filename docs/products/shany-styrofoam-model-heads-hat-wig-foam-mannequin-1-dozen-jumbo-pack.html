            <li>They&#x27;re also good for doing wig perms and settings since you can stick pins into the stand.  </li>
            <li>This is a good site, but as a buyer, you need to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>we do craft fairs and this product has come in great handy.</li>

            <li>AND THESE HEADS CAME IN SO HANDY TO HELP US BUILD OUR FIGURES</li>
            <li>These wig forms are a good value for what you get, but do tip over rather easily.</li>
            <li>I wanted them to display some hats at a fair - they will work fine</li>

            <li>As someone who has a ton of wigs, the low price of all these wigheads is perfect for my use!</li>

            <li>l love them...</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product and service.</li>

            <li>Leave a bunch of foam heads with wigs on them and see the reactions you get :)</li>

            <li>Came in good condition and they work very well.</li>
            <li>easy to pack</li>
            <li>They are sturdy and do not disintegrate easily when pins are pushed in or removed.  </li>
            <li>i would strongly recommend against ordering these.  </li>
            <li>With that said, they really did arrive in a good time, and the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li>The pictures of the products were completly accurate.  </li>
            <li>AND I DO A HUGE HALLOWEEN EXTRAVAGANZA</li>
            <li>These heads come with a hole in the bottom, so you can secure them to a head clamp if you&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>They fit on my wig head</li>
            <li>I  did like the free shipping which is why I ordered them.  </li>
            <li>i finally recieved my mannequin heads i was happy as heck.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>They are very light-weight and store very easily.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about these styrofoam model heads, I hounded the delivery guy every day about them.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t he sweet?</li>
            <li>These are good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of craft shows and was needing to find a good deal with several matching heads to display all my products at my table.  </li>
            <li>its kool no bad things to say.  </li>
            <li>Whoever the seller was (hopefully the name is viewable on the review page), they shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love them and I am sure I will be purchasing more in the near future.</li>
            <li>They are very lightweight and will topple over easily</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Delivery was right on time.</li>
            <li>The order arrived very quickly and the products were even better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;General Amazon advice -I put this on the bottom of all of my reviews, so you&#x27;ll see the same wording more than once.  </li>
            <li>be aware when reading reviews that, unlike eBay, you do -not- have to buy a product to review it.  </li>
            <li>i will be repurchasing more next week..</li>
            <li>We simply put gauzey material over the heads, painted on glue, inserted a cup hook into the top, and tied on monafilament line.  </li>
            <li>They work ok as display items as long as you don&#x27;t have to keep taking the wigs off.</li>
            <li>I have a &amp;#34;hat room&amp;#34; for my large array of hats and wigs which I have collected over the years.</li>
            <li>Also, the delivery was very fast(3 days).</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I paid too much but 6 all at once and delivered to my door step saved me time and hassle.</li>
            <li>The price for the products was very competitive.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise you have no way of knowing if they really used the product.  </li>
            <li>They keep the shape of wigs very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and so they are very reusable.  </li>
            <li>~ heads are better looking than the other one I ordered...  packed tie and not take up too much space..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being able to save both time and money allowed me to focus on other parts of the Tour project without having to second-guess about materials.</li>
            <li>THESE WERE BETTER THEN EXPECTED!  </li>
            <li>They were exactly what I needed to complete my Christmas project.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend getting these.</li>
            <li>These came and were a little different than ones I previously ordered, but work great for my Christmas and halloween dummies I make for the holiday festivities.  </li>
            <li>The order was complete and with no damage (a worry when ordering Styrofoam items).  </li>
            <li>As you can probably guess by the material, these are not heavy</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying them individually in the store.</li>
            <li>I received 6 foam heads that had smashed noses and masculine features.  </li>
            <li>A little smaller than I thought but still worked fine for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Would order again.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>He uses a KWA LM4 full blow back with natural gas and the pellets just stick in the Styrofoam with little to no bounce back.  </li>
            <li>they are also child sized heads, so do not properly display adult items.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for a little over half what I paid elsewhere and the shipping was free!</li>

            <li> I purchased these for a little over half what I paid elsewhere and the shipping was free!</li>
            <li> So far he&#x27;s only decimated 2 heads in a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> I also have long T pins that I stick in them with no problem.</li>
            <li> I also purchased some of the metal portable stands for drying my wigs and for travel, but you could also dry your wigs on these if you don&#x27;t need a portable option.  </li>
            <li> Have bought these girls several times over the past year and will continue to buy if needed in the future.</li>
            <li> yeah, this product does what its meant to, not much else to say.</li>
            <li> check out the seller rating, Amazon will let just about anyone sell here and even seller ratings are not absolute as you do not have to buy from a seller to rate them.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The heads that I expected were the ones pictured in the photo on the listing.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviewers&#x27; experience, my box was well packaged and none of the heads were dented or noses crushed.  </li>

            <li> The order arrived very quickly and the products were even better than I expected.  The order was complete and with no damage (a worry when ordering Styrofoam items).  I would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE a great deal!  I purchased these for a little over half what I paid elsewhere and the shipping was free! I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. It&#x27;s the best deal I could find-------and believe me, I really looked. Also, the delivery was very fast(3 days). These heads come with a hole in the bottom, so you can secure them to a head clamp if you&#x27;d like.  I&#x27;m going to use these to store my wigs on shelves for safe keeping &amp; easy access. My husband is going to screw a section of dowel into a wooden base for each head.  That will keep them from toppling over &amp; will extend the height of each head, to accommodate longer wigs. Isn&#x27;t he sweet? Yes, he is!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product just got into wearing wigs and I priced stands at beauty supplies store and they are expensive so found this bundle for a great price. I have ordered from this seller with other thing and never any problems.</li>
            <li> i would strongly recommend against ordering these.  they arrived with crushed noses, broken necks and various other damages.  they are also child sized heads, so do not properly display adult items.</li>
            <li> price was good ~ heads are better looking than the other one I ordered...  packed tie and not take up too much space..</li>
            <li> I was looking for wig heads for my cosplay and these were a great price.  They came in great shape.  The only thing to note is the head is tilted to the side.  So, if you want to cut your wigs while on these heads you have to take that into account.</li>
            <li> I have a &amp;#34;hat room&amp;#34; for my large array of hats and wigs which I have collected over the years. As I add hats I needed more heads. I found these via search engine and they were the best buy for the quantity I wanted. They were the right size, they have the hole in the bottom for the  peg to hold them in place and the shape is perfect. They arrived in a timely manner and there was no damage to the heads. Now I have an outlet for future purchases without having to go searching. Thanks.</li>
            <li> As someone who has a ton of wigs, the low price of all these wigheads is perfect for my use! For any cosplayer or just someone who likes wigs, this is just what is needed! Or for anyone who needs a bunch of heads for evil prank, these are good for that too. Anyway yeah, this product does what its meant to, not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I tried different heads in the past that haven&#x27;t worked out.  I was very happy when I placed the heads on my shelf and they didn&#x27;t topple over.  The wigs and hats sat perfectly and I&#x27;ll probably be buying more from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Used for a forensic anatomy project..worked perfect with clay like material. Students loved the project and wanted to do another...success</li>
            <li> They were exactly as I expected and packed well!  The perfect size to display my hand made hats and headbands!</li>
            <li> they are perfect for my crafting project. I am making planters by hollowing them out and painting them to look like stone.</li>
            <li> These came and were a little different than ones I previously ordered, but work great for my Christmas and halloween dummies I make for the holiday festivities.  Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my many personalities. A wig for each day of the week requires proper storage. These are good enough for me. They fit on my wig head stand perfictly si I can cut, color and style my girls to my hearts desire. I also have long T pins that I stick in them with no problem. I paid too much but 6 all at once and delivered to my door step saved me time and hassle.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased from begining of the purchase.  The price for the products was very competitive.  The pictures of the products were completly accurate.  The shipping was quick and the products arrived in perfect condition.  I intend to use these heads for floating ghostly figures for halloween and I am very happy I found exactly what I was looking for at a very good price.</li>
            <li> Hi.  As you can probably guess by the material, these are not heavy but they are good for storage.  They&#x27;re also good for doing wig perms and settings since you can stick pins into the stand.  Whoever the seller was (hopefully the name is viewable on the review page), they shipped quickly.  I also purchased some of the metal portable stands for drying my wigs and for travel, but you could also dry your wigs on these if you don&#x27;t need a portable option.  All in all, I&#x27;d give it a solid 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Amazon advice -I put this on the bottom of all of my reviews, so you&#x27;ll see the same wording more than once.  This is a good site, but as a buyer, you need to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;1. check out the seller rating, Amazon will let just about anyone sell here and even seller ratings are not absolute as you do not have to buy from a seller to rate them.&lt;br /&gt;2. be aware when reading reviews that, unlike eBay, you do -not- have to buy a product to review it.  Look for reviews that say \\&quot;Amazon verified purchase\\&quot;.  Otherwise you have no way of knowing if they really used the product.  Fake reviews are very common in categories like weight loss pills and supplements.&lt;br /&gt;3. Check shipping.  It is not upfront like eBay and Amazon does not have rules against excessive shipping.  I recently saw a product listed for 99 cents and $9.50 shipping.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about these styrofoam model heads, I hounded the delivery guy every day about them. With that said, they really did arrive in a good time, and the price was fantastic. The product was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Came in good condition and they work very well. They keep the shape of wigs very well.</li>
            <li> company should pkg these six heads in a bigger box so the noses don&#x27;t get dented!  They are ok for what we need them for so we will not be returing...but if they were to be a display piece only 3 out of 6 would work.</li>
            <li> As a crocheter - I love to make accessories!  I do a lot of craft shows and was needing to find a good deal with several matching heads to display all my products at my table.  These model heads worked great!  They shipped fairly quickly and were the perfect size to display my finished products to my clients!</li>
            <li> I ordered these to hold my wig collection and they are great. They are very light-weight and store very easily.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying them individually in the store. They are the perfect size for holding wigs, and they are Styrofoam, which allows pins to hold the wigs in place. I do wish the neck bases were wider, as they like to topple over while working with them, but they stay in place when I am all set up. Fast shipping. Happy customer. I recommend this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I received them in a timely manner.  I wanted them to display some hats at a fair - they will work fine but the styrofoam is  scarred.  You get what you pay for.  I  did like the free shipping which is why I ordered them.  If I had to pay for shipping I coulod have gotten them at the beauty supply shop.</li>
            <li> This 6 pack of foam heads was an excellent choice for 3 reasons: great value for the package, arrived exactly when listed, and were perfect for my Haunted Tour project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to save both time and money allowed me to focus on other parts of the Tour project without having to second-guess about materials.</li>
            <li> i finally recieved my mannequin heads i was happy as heck. i no my wigs where to to get out the bags and boxes.. i will be repurchasing more next week.. thank you for the heads l love them...</li>
            <li> The heads that I expected were the ones pictured in the photo on the listing.  However, I did not get them.  I received 6 foam heads that had smashed noses and masculine features.  I had ordered these specifically for the female faces.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this order. I was responded to in a timely manner, Had wonderful service, and the product was what they said it be. The quality of the heads were perfect. Delivery was right on time. I will order from Amazon again. Thanks for the great product and service.</li>
            <li> Excellent just what I needed and wanted.  Might be buying more depending on how many more costumes I need to have.</li>
            <li> This was my second time purchasing the Styrofoam Model Heads...I use them to display my crochet items, such as Hats, Headbands with matching scraves and neckwraps. I love them and I am sure I will be purchasing more in the near future. Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Used these for Halloween masks attached to costumes. A little smaller than I thought but still worked fine for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Would order again.</li>
            <li> it made great storage for my wigs and i made faces for them all and names. its kool no bad things to say.  great buy</li>
            <li> we do craft fairs and this product has come in great handy. they are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;not easy to pack but they are perfect for what we display.</li>
            <li> Great for my wig collection. And even more awesome to freak people out with. Leave a bunch of foam heads with wigs on them and see the reactions you get :)</li>
            <li> Used these for Halloween decorations. They were the HIT of my decorations. Highly recommend getting these. Shipping was slow, so if you have the option, upgrade</li>
            <li> Hey these are great to put your latex masks on to store for Halloween.  Not that costly and they keep them from cracking.  Store them inside.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my order of SHANY Styrofoam Model Heads.  They were exactly what I needed to complete my Christmas project.  I was making angels and needed heads.  Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for all my hats I got!! I can show them off to my family and friends &amp; who ever comes over!!!.</li>
            <li> OMG!!  THESE WERE BETTER THEN EXPECTED!  MY FRIENDS AND I DO A HUGE HALLOWEEN EXTRAVAGANZA EVERY YEAR ( ABOUT 200 PPL ) AND THESE HEADS CAME IN SO HANDY TO HELP US BUILD OUR FIGURES THAT WE PLACE AROUND THE PROPERTY!!  I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPIER WITH MY PURCHASE!!</li>
            <li> The foam heads do what they are designed to do.  They are sturdy and do not disintegrate easily when pins are pushed in or removed.  Price point and quality are good.</li>
            <li> Items arrived in a timely fashion- My daughter loved getting them and having a &#x27;place&#x27; to show off, and photogragh her wearable Cosplay accessories!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband to shoot at in the house with his airsoft gun.  They are perfect!  He uses a KWA LM4 full blow back with natural gas and the pellets just stick in the Styrofoam with little to no bounce back.  He spray paints the head before he shoots it and so they are very reusable.  So far he&#x27;s only decimated 2 heads in a little over a month.  Great for this re-purposed application!</li>
            <li> Bought these as a gift for a friend who makes masks and headbands.  She loved them!  I went to her house the next day and she had already put all of them to use.  Unlike some of the other reviewers&#x27; experience, my box was well packaged and none of the heads were dented or noses crushed.  A really good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> These wig forms are a good value for what you get, but do tip over rather easily. They work ok as display items as long as you don&#x27;t have to keep taking the wigs off. They are very lightweight and will topple over easily and if they are lined up watch out - you will have the domino effect going with all of them tipping over!</li>
            <li> We used these to make ghosts for Halloween.  We simply put gauzey material over the heads, painted on glue, inserted a cup hook into the top, and tied on monafilament line.  Great ghosts for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> for my wigs.  Have bought these girls several times over the past year and will continue to buy if needed in the future.</li>
