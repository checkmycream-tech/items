    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Skin feels smoother than satin. I put it on from neck to toes, daily.  Love. Great product, packaging, and service</li>
            <li> As expected. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> I ordered this almond oil &amp; Dr. Adorable&#x27;s jojoba oil and love them both! I use. Them for. My skin and hair and they&#x27;re wonderful - light, delicate, yet rich in moisturizers? And how cute is the name Dr. adorable? (Kinda makes me feel adorable too!)</li>
            <li> the highest quality almond oil one can buy ! I have rebought this four times .  Mixes well with essential oil and jojoba oil to create a just right body oil !  Or raw , its great for intense moisturizer or a massage oil . And its shipped crazy I get it in about 2-3 days.  The best wish I was selling it myself.</li>
            <li> Almond oil does wonders for your skin and this bottle is just perfect as contains A LOT of oil for the price you pay. I like that its pure and very gentle on the skin. You can tell this is real and natural as it instantly soaks into your skin leaving it soft for a long time. The bottle last a long time too. I will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is almond oil. It really stink not pure or organic oil. I know how almond oil taste and smell like. I need to take it the lab and test it.</li>
            <li> I find that this can be used as a gentle skin exfoliate. I use sweet almond oil as an eye-makeup and sometimes, overall make-up remover. And I have to say, it&#x27;s very effective. I put a little bit of oil on a cotton swab or tissue and rub it where I want to remove make up, esp cream/glitter eyeshadow, heavy foundations and gel eyeliners. I also notices that it seems to be breaking down the pigmentation of the dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> When I received the package it was dripping with oil. I never even opened the package. Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly to use for my under eye dark circles. I applied it around my eyes every night before I go to bed and have been using it for a couple of months. I haven&#x27;t really notice much of a difference. :\ Well, I didn&#x27;t get a lot of sleep during the school days (usually around 4-6 hours). I&#x27;ve read many articles where sweet almond oil are suppose to help on getting rid of dark circles. Now that it&#x27;s the summer and I get my full sleep, I will try using it again to see if it works. I am guessing it&#x27;s more effective if you get your full sleep everyday. Also, it&#x27;s a really big bottle too and I&#x27;ve use the oil as far as to the top of the sticker line. The pros I can say right now are that it makes my skin soft and glow in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t has much of a scent and my skin never broke out. I think I&#x27;ll try to make a scrub out of it to use up the bottle more quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used it just for once and have to give up. It is hard to be absorbed. Maybe I have expected too much.</li>
            <li> This oil is light but just what my skin needs. I love it!</li>
            <li> Good product for its price.  Gets rid of your ashy skin.</li>
            <li> I get the fact that it&#x27;s organic. But this product claims to be almond oil. It doesn&#x27;t smell like it, it doesn&#x27;t taste like it. I think itz just oil.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my 5 year old son has been recently diagnosed with eczema. I didn&#x27;t want to use the stereoid cream every time he had a flare up. Even the dermatologist that prescribed it for us said it can&#x27;t be used on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Sweet Almond Oil on him every night and after every bath. No more flare ups, and now only calm skin. Yay!!!</li>
            <li> I thought the oil would have a sweet smell to it, hence the name.  Otherwise I like the product and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is very good Sweet Almond Oil and it makes my dry skin feel and look wonderful, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It worked well I had made my own shampoo using this oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this almond oil to use as a carrier oil in aromatherapy. It has no odor and is good for a carrier oil and also moisturizes my skin  when used with essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it at night a face moisturizer.  It is very effective as a moisturizer on my face, and reduced the dark circles under my eyes. I tried to use it as a pulling oil,  but it made my face too oily,  If you have dry skin this should should be very helpful.  It is tasteless when used as a pulling oil.</li>
            <li> This Sweet Almond Oil is pure heaven as a massage oil!  It glides on so smoothly and leaves my skin feeling so very nice!  I add my own essential oils for an added pleasurable, relaxing experience.  Will buy again and would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this almond oil! This product moisturizes well and not oily at all. Helps with my daughters eczema. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> very pure i love this will buy again</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had ordered and great quality oil.</li>
            <li> We use this as carrier oil for essential oils and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I use this for everything. Love it. Massage, moisture, hair, face. I even scent it with essential oils; makes a good medium.</li>
            <li> Not organic. It gave me and my kids a rash!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  Only wish it was offered with Prime Free Shipping. I&#x27;m using it for homemade body scrubs and other essential oils usages.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of this type of oil. I use for making my own lip balms and face creams.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the real deal or not.</li>
            <li> Came full to the top, no scent, great product.  Nice pop-top cap makes it easy to dispense, which is appreciated.</li>
            <li> First time I ordered oil had leaked all over the inside of the package. It seemed to be good oil and I reordered because I wanted organic ordered 3 and only received 1. They did send the other out after I complained but clearly can&#x27;t count. Dont think I will be ordering again after 2 times of my order being messed up</li>
            <li> After having gone all natural with cosmetic products, my wife started using this as a facial moisturizer. She loves using it as a base for her all natural 100% Pure sunscreen lotion. Great product but I wish it had the prime free shipping option.</li>
            <li> Love it! I make massage blend with lavender essential oil for my baby and he really enjoys being massaged with it at night after bath. It&#x27;s odorless and glides well without being overly greasy. Took care of his eczema in no time!</li>
            <li> It has no scent.  I was  surprised at how light this oil is and how easily it was absorbed.  I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> Okay for what it is.  Oil is oil...</li>
            <li> No complaint. Nice oil especially for massage. When I go for massage I take this oil with me nice in many places they use soy oil and this oil is not food for male since contains estrogen like substances.</li>
            <li> This oil is excellent for it&#x27;s medicinal properties as well as the service etc. from this vendor.  I have read this works for under eye circles and I have noticed it has helped a lot in a short amount of time.  It&#x27;s also great for acne (if you can believe it) but believe it.  I have acne prone skin.  People are afraid of oils for the skin, but it&#x27;s some of the best stuff you can use on your face.  I swear by it and it&#x27;s a lot more affordable than some of the other garbage (chemicals) that people are using on their skin for quadruple the money.  I HIGHLY recommend.  Do a google search about Sweet Almond oil, you will be amazed.  It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
