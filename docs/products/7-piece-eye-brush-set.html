            <li>They are doing amazing jobs on their faces, specially on their eyelids.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the quality of these brushes are pretty good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good quality.  </li>
            <li>My makeup goes on much smoother and blends nicely!  </li>
            <li>The classic shader and the blending brush are my favorite and are amazing!</li>

            <li>The shadows go on perfectly and smoothly, there&#x27;s no extra splotches of eye shadows.</li>
            <li>They are very soft &amp; feels great to the touch.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and do a great job of applying product.</li>
            <li>Very soft, no shedding and they work great.</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes at a great price.  </li>
            <li>great packaging and very soft.</li>
            <li>Great quality and very soft.</li>
            <li>Amazing set of brushes for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>They are worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li>The first set that arrived had slipped in the packaging (I highly suggest better packaging for these brushes!!!)</li>
            <li>so I always have some clean ones!</li>
            <li>These brushes are great quality, very soft, blend seamlessly, and I have experienced no shedding.</li>
            <li>Very good quality products, need to buy the facial brushes from them too...</li>
            <li>You can go to Macy&#x27;s and spend 10 times the money for a similar set or save a bunch and get a very good set.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>The brush helps me to keep the shading deepest at the crease and becoming lighter towards the brow.</li>
            <li>They work great in blending the makeup into the skin and compared with my old brushes ( no name brand )</li>
            <li>and, so far, they have handled cleaning great.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been storing them in it, and they are so soft and seem like great quality.</li>
            <li>Wow these are great...</li>
            <li>Great so far.</li>
            <li>Great quality, really soft bristles, no shedding</li>
            <li>Ridiculously soft, all great sizes and shapes.</li>
            <li>They even threw in a free brush just for ordering :)</li>
            <li>These are soft and work great.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it much but feels like a good brush when used.</li>
            <li>I was researching EVERYWHERE for a good set of eye make up brushes and these really stood out to me.</li>
            <li>They are good quality and they are shipped in a make up brush holder which I really like.</li>
            <li>I also loved these so much</li>
            <li>Good quality brushes, sent fast.</li>
            <li>one great way that you can test a good brush is that if it does not collapse when pressed down upon on the tip-</li>
            <li>What I noticed right away is how nicely they are made, there is no shedding</li>
            <li>The standard shader in particular is nicely absorbent, but not overly so, so it&#x27;s perfect for foiling on pigments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love love love these brushes so far and am forever grateful for the amazing price.</li>
            <li>Very nice and soft brushes ..</li>
            <li>The brushes all have very soft bristles and are nice and full/fluffy!</li>
            <li>Excellent value for the money spent!</li>
            <li>The blending brush, the detailed pencil and the angled detailed brush are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; application goes on the way I want.</li>
            <li>and they came very quickly</li>
            <li>Easy to use and</li>
            <li>All were great brushes, Sonia, MAC and Makeup Geek being some of the top favs of mine currently.</li>
            <li>Wash easily.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are sturdy with easy application for the eye shadows.</li>
            <li>Has a stand up case for easy grabbing.</li>
            <li>They grab pigment easily and deposit it where it needs to go.</li>
            <li>Going to buy some more so that I don&#x27;t have to clean the brushes so often.</li>
            <li>I received the eye brushes very quick.</li>
            <li>Love them as much as I do the Lamora Kabuki set which I also own.</li>
            <li>the brushes had a strong chemical odor which will not go away.</li>
            <li>Came as expected - time wise and appearance wise ...</li>
            <li>and they have held strong.</li>
            <li>All I care about is that they arrived securely packaged and in perfect shape, which they did (frankly, I&#x27;d rather have the money go into the brushes and not for fancy fluff).</li>
            <li>The brush seems strong and well made.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are good quality at a decent price.</li>
            <li>And it is nice too that they are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so nice to be able to buy them as their own set without the larger face brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes are great,  I like the soft feel,  and they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>There are no labels on the brushes, which one is for what, but I&#x27;m pretty experienced with makeup tools, so that doesn&#x27;t really affect me.</li>
            <li>No need to spend hundreds for name brands when these do the job just fine.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fine for blending and detailing.</li>
            <li>they work just fine.</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed with these brushes,  especially the crease brush.  </li>
            <li>Excellent brushes I would buy them again in a hot second</li>
            <li>Fantastic for the price, and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and are also comfortable to handle.  </li>
            <li>I cut my application time in half as they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good brushes very soft to the skin, I washed them they didn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>Very soft but give good control.  </li>
            <li>Super soft and awesome to use my new favorite brushes</li>
            <li>fast delivery and love the product thank you!</li>
            <li>Super soft and a great price.</li>
            <li>All of the brushes have a great shape to them and are SO super soft on my eyes.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best brush in the kit IMO and the most useful.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m happy with the less than impressive packaging if it keeps the prices low.</li>
            <li>After a little research, I set my mind to buy this set, and that was a great choise!</li>
            <li>Love this product and received it exactly when I was told that it would arrive!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and would highly suggest these brushes, for the price &amp; quality (cheaper than Mac brushes)</li>
            <li>I received these brushes VERY quickly and was not disappointed by the quality.</li>
            <li>having the right tools for the job is very important.</li>
            <li>I am a huge advocate for eye brushes, and say your eye shadow all depends on the brushes you use.</li>
            <li>I thought they were going to be cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>how well they apply a smooth, even coat of shadow.</li>
            <li>These brushes are fabulous.</li>
            <li>The store provided us with a really nice brush set to use and a couple of the brushes really did make all of the difference when detailing and blending.</li>
            <li>The company of this product is also fantastic.</li>
            <li>I replied by replying to the actual email, then they emailed me back thanking me for my responseand letting me know that they are happy that I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>my eye makeup again goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>If you are a beginner and don&#x27;t use brushes regularly, these would be a great choice.</li>
            <li>These eye makeup brushes are fabulous and I use all 7 of them for my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>A great purchase especially for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These seven brushes should take care of your makeup needs, and I hope you will enjoy them if you purchase them.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic brush set.</li>
            <li>Great brushed.</li>
            <li>These brushes are absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great brushes at an affordable price with next day shipping.</li>
            <li>I do wish that the eye brush set also came with a carrying case as I can&#x27;t fit them all in the case I received with the face brush</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic...</li>
            <li>The angles on the brushes are precise.  </li>
            <li>This is because the brushes are not as dense and the handles feel a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>Application is smooth and the brush hold product well.  </li>
            <li>these are not cheap brushes made of very great quality.</li>
            <li>It did and I washed it the next day and its great.</li>
            <li>I enjoy doing my eye makeup and</li>
            <li>The price is cheap, but not the quality.</li>
            <li>however it still provides that precise application when I need it.  </li>
            <li>the variety of brushes is great because i only have to use these to do my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>The bristles are comfortable.</li>
            <li>so I can get precise placement.</li>
            <li>The set of eye brushes is the same (great) quality as the Kabuki Brush Set.</li>
            <li>The brushes are great especially for the price.</li>
            <li>All around fantastic set.</li>
            <li>The ferrules are securely attached to the handle.</li>
            <li>says if you leave a review on Amazon then you will &amp;#34;recieve free products like this eye brush set.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Great feel to the brushes and the different sizes are great for shadowing and creating different looks.</li>
            <li>look cheap and there is a sizeable gap where the handle fits into the ferrule and the box they come in looks cheap.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great eye brush set.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Soft but still have good grip for putting on eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>The seller was very caring and made every effort to be sure that I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>These are soft and good quality.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful these brushes are.</li>
            <li>I just bought these because they had good reviews and the price was right to add to my arsenal of makeup brushes when I have large group makeover parties.  </li>
            <li>They came a day early and were so soft and in perfect condition!</li>
            <li>So far so good......</li>
            <li>I did not see many that were, but these are clearly labeled on the wood handles, which is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>My two daughters and my girlfriend are absolutely delighted with the quality and soft and light feeling of all the brushes of the set.</li>
            <li>Good quality brushes, soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li>The detailed pencil does not look like it would paint a detail, but it is capable of painting a surprisingly fine line, for example, It will easily paint eyeliner more easily than a pointed pencil.</li>
            <li>They apply just the right amount of shadow and love the blending brush.</li>
            <li>Picks up the right amount of makeup and they do a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>These brushes worked perfectly and was able to apply my eyeliner and eye shallow with ease.</li>
            <li>but fortunately they return to the original shape.</li>
            <li>It turns out that I was right and all the other great reviews don&#x27;t lie!</li>
            <li>(I use high end eyeshadow, such as lorac) and also come in a cylinder case; I was very impressed!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and glad I saved my money.</li>
            <li>Bonus: super fast shipping &amp; such great service!</li>
            <li>I love my new brushes!!!</li>
            <li>I love it very much.</li>
            <li>I own a ton of brushes from really high end to drug store variety</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and dense and the handles are nicely shaped and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I looked into buying Sigma or Mac brushes &amp; although the quality of those is prob better, I&#x27;m not paying for two or three brushes what this whole set cost me!</li>
            <li>Received these brushes super quick, within a week of ordering them!</li>
            <li>This is the first set of brushes I have bought from this company and I will definately be buying more.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think she was familiar with this brand.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth your money!</li>

            <li>, I am going to order another set, I love them so much!</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>I am more interested in quality than quantity, so the items that I use that are subjected to &amp;#34;daily wear and tear&amp;#34; must &amp;#34;stand the test of time&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Love this product so much that I bought two!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and arrived FAST!!  </li>
            <li>They had a bit of a strong smell that took two washes to get rid of, but overall pretty happy with them.</li>
            <li>I needed new eye brushes and these were an amazing price.</li>
            <li>SOOOOO VERY pleasantly surprised at how much I love these brushes!</li>
            <li>The quality is pretty good and they actually look and feel much better than my MAC and CHANEL brushes.</li>
            <li>There is a special use for every one of them</li>
            <li>I just received my brush set and it came right on time!</li>
            <li>The application to my eye shadows using these brushes were right on point!..</li>
            <li>how long were they going to take to arrive, surprisingly they were delivered quickly!</li>
            <li>I ordered these and was super excited when my package came in just two days.</li>
            <li>They sent another brush set in a hard cardboard cylinder, and the brushes are great!</li>
            <li>Super excited about these vegan cruelty-free brushes.</li>
            <li>I love the classic shader, the angled shader, and the blending brush!</li>
            <li>They are super soft and pick up and leave even the most under-pigmented shadows on your eyes!</li>
            <li>These brushes are definitely towards higher end quality and the price point is great.</li>
            <li>This set was a good variety of the different types of eye makeup brushes a person could have.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised at how nice they are for the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks Lamora Beauty, I will be looking for more of your products.</li>
            <li>They are soft and blend nicely.  </li>
            <li>If you need a set of good eye brushes get these and thanke later</li>
            <li>Finally found affordable brushes with good quality.</li>
            <li>Great brush set, all the essentials you need for eyes, soft and useful, and very afforable</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter who is interested in becoming a make up artist.</li>
            <li>and I can only say good things about them.</li>
            <li>Of course I ended up loving all of the brushes, but I like how the pencil brush is so soft in application</li>
            <li>If this is true, I don&#x27;t believe it is the brush.</li>
            <li>They are really soft and nice.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving them.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Lamora products and the customer service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be stocking up on more very soon.</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend these brushes to anyone in need of a good variety in eye brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with these brushes as much as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li>Not bad for $20 at all.</li>
            <li>The Lamora 7-brush eye makeup set is a very nice one, and provides a complete set of brushes for the needs of anyone who is particular about their makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, Ladies these brushes are the&lt;br /&gt;bussiness, Very well made these brushs soft, I Love them for the price they are so worth the price and more!</li>
            <li>They make is easy to apply makeup to look more professional.</li>
            <li>I have their flat top kabuki and loved it so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, these do not smell, which is a huge issue for me, so right off the bat, I was relieved about that.</li>
            <li>Fabulous all the product goes right where it has to go and it doesn&#x27;t stay on the brushes.</li>
            <li>So far so good, the real test is when I clean it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes for anyone looking for some high quality, good, makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li>I decided to do my own make up for the wedding of my best friend and since my brushes were old and not a good quality to begin with,  </li>
            <li>Brushes are very well made and are good quality, sturdy and soft.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and really are good quality.</li>
            <li>The brushes are quality and the delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li>I find that they actually get better after a thorough washing - the bristles are softer and glides better over the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a loyal fan of the MAC brush #217, and</li>
            <li>Quick Shipping.</li>
            <li>The seller got in contact with me again and they were super helpful.</li>
            <li>Really pleased that each one is clearly labeled and there is a detailed description on box to tell you what each one is for.</li>
            <li>Quick Shipping</li>
            <li>I purchased my set and it arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li>They are also very easy to wash and so far no shedding.</li>
            <li>Then I noticed how nice it was to have them securely separated in their box, instead of all loose in a cheap plastic bag and getting bent out of shape.</li>
            <li>I have a range of brushes, from the very, very pricey, to some cheap drug store brushes.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set to anyone who is looking for a quality set of brushes, that will more than get the job done.</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be able to afford high quality makeup brushes until discovering Lamora.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described very fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described very fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>This was a very nice set and will consider buying other brushes from this brand.</li>
            <li>Fabulous brushes for a very inexpensive price !</li>
            <li>The brush set came quickly and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast also!!</li>
            <li>Secondly, these brushes really are amazing!</li>
            <li>They pick up the product very well and easy to blend out the product with these brushes.  </li>
            <li>These also apply the product easily and as the user wants.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely glad that I got this set, because I&#x27;m usually leery of really good deals for brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered some different brush sets (looking for a good deal as my budget is very tight) and out of all of them, these are by far the best quality and value I have found!</li>
            <li>so much when doing eyemakeup!!</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy more products from Lamora Beauty!</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Firstly, IRT some of these reviews, who cares about the dang packaging!</li>
            <li>I needed a cheap alternative to eye brushes as I am new to eye makeup and these brushes fit the bill.</li>
            <li>having a new set of brushes I must say I was missing out on a wonderful thing.</li>
            <li>Very soft, easy to clean</li>
            <li>Overall, these brushes are amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>The set came packaged in a heavy cardboard tube which makes it great for travel.</li>
            <li>The leather pouch and leather holder are much nicer in person, they don&#x27;t look like a cheap freebie.</li>
            <li>They also come in an attractive round case.  </li>
            <li>Deff worth the money.</li>
            <li>well worth what I paid for them....</li>
            <li>This is actually the first time I have ever written a review; it&#x27;s the first time I have ever been impressed enough to bother writing one.  </li>
            <li>My wife loved this brush set, everything arrived as she expected.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The ones in this set are dense (so you have better control) and yet still soft to the touch</li>
            <li>Totally worth the purchase</li>
            <li>Love is soft and have variety of brushes.</li>
            <li>Then I found this set which has a nice selection at a quality that can&#x27;t be beat, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I would have liked some sort of brush roll or something to store them in, but that&#x27;s hardly necessary and it might also keep the cost</li>
            <li>It is soft and comfortable!</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>I LOVE them and have worked wonderfully so far.</li>
            <li>Def worth the price</li>
            <li>Yes these brushes are worth it.</li>
            <li>and she is having a lot of fun learning how to use them.  </li>
            <li>All others I own are just way to big.</li>
            <li>Bought these brushes for eyeliner application and while they are pretty good for the money, the bristles don&#x27;t come to a clean, sharp end</li>
            <li>The brushes are of high quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Brushes seem to work pretty well but blender needs to be a little fuller since that and crease are super important!!!  </li>
            <li>Quality seems at par with most other brushes that sell for much more $$$.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and were very affordable!</li>
            <li>Received these yesterday they fairly  quick, the package they came in is very plan !</li>
            <li>it came in a very nice brush carry round box.  </li>
            <li>They are versatile- good for concealer and other makeup products.</li>
            <li>The bristles in these brushes are just right and do not throw the powder all over your face,like cheaper quality brushes do.</li>
            <li>The seller sent out a replacement set right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used sigma brushes and these are right up there.</li>
            <li>even cheaper right out of package like ELF or  </li>
            <li>, I put them right into my makeup kit.</li>
            <li>They came right on time.</li>
            <li>So far love this purchase ;)&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was looking for potential substitutes that would give me the same beautiful blending effect.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Very soft, easy application.</li>
            <li>i like it its high Quality and Cheap</li>
            <li>Mine arrived in a black cardboard tube individually wrapped so they were all in perfect condition!</li>
            <li>They work amazingly, super soft and apply eyeshadow evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is actually much softer than my Sigma blending brush and it does a better job blending on my very sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>The small shader works great, and creates the type line that I like.  </li>
            <li>The variety is excellent and I was honestly a little surprised at the high quality since the price was so affordable.</li>
            <li>I alsolike that they&#x27;re soft and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great set especially for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This brushes are amazing!!!!!!!They are so soft and easy to you.</li>
            <li>The bigger brushes are great, but the smaller three brushes came bent, and that wouldn&#x27;t wash out.</li>
            <li>They are soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Little to no shedding and wonderful packaging makes these brushes a must-have whether you&#x27;re a seasoned makeup artist or just starting out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like them very much</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft, and super blendable.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package I was so pleased to see how well made the brushes are and the handles are steady with perfectly soft bristils..</li>
            <li>Very soft and worth the money!</li>
            <li>It blended colors beautifully from several different palettes, both high end and lower end,  with almost no fall out.  </li>
            <li>and I will rate it higher.</li>
            <li>I have tried many low cost eye brushes and they did not cut it.  </li>
            <li>they allow my shadows to go on pretty well also.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the packaging, these brushes are of great quality and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but these brushes helped so much!</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, exactly what it says in the description.</li>
            <li>(this is my second set-I&#x27;m so cheap)!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really done any research on Lamora brushes but this set is definitely worth the $23.00.</li>
            <li>but I washed them first thing</li>
            <li>I bought them based on the user reviews which I find pretty reliable.</li>
            <li>Used them this morning for the first time and immediately ordered another set.</li>
            <li>which was a plus ;) also packaging was perfect with each individual brush secured in plastic protection and contained in a cylinder holder, unlike past reviewers.</li>
            <li>I like them so much that I bought a set for a friend, and she seems to like them too!</li>
            <li>I bought several as gifts for people &amp; they all love them.</li>
            <li>Great seller, arrived fast and as described, but they are smaller than my regular eye brushes which I was looking to replace.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for in an eye brush set.  </li>
            <li>even still this is pretty minor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had them for a week &amp; washed them before first use.</li>
            <li>Really helps improve your technique if you know what brush to use !</li>
            <li>I washed them before my first use  </li>
            <li>There are well made and I have enjoyed experimenting with them, I only wish they had come with a cheat sheet as to what each brush is specifically used for.</li>
            <li>Love these especially the blending brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it five starts because the value per price is exactly that - five stars.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Sure, the packaging is basic, but I don&#x27;t need fancy looking wrapping that I&#x27;m just going to toss.</li>
            <li>I may just have to buy another set of these, but I hope Lamora comes out with more of these smaller type brushes.</li>
            <li>Shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li>Exactly as promised....</li>
            <li>and once you register you will get I think 10% off your first purchase and the site automatically directs you to Amazon for purchasing.</li>
            <li>and I am kind of rough on my brushes.  </li>
            <li>Each brush is packed appropriately with the proper amount of bristles, and they hold their shape.  </li>
            <li>my favorite shadows are from Too Faced and Urban Decay Naked2 palette.  </li>
            <li>The wide assortment provides all the sizes anyone would need to apply any kind of powder.</li>
            <li>My first time trying them</li>
            <li>I only wish that it came with a cute carrying case, or bag like the 10 piece set does.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with costumer service and I will definitely purchase from this seller again</li>
            <li>They pick up and deposit color pretty well.</li>
            <li>No shedding after the first wash.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more from seller.  </li>
            <li>I totally recommend for all makeup junkies!  :)</li>
            <li>Much better than Amazons customer service (which is actually terrible)&lt;br /&gt;The box the brushes came in</li>
            <li>Not nearly as difficult to get the look I want.</li>
            <li>Love them, I am fairly new to the use of professional grade make up and brushes, but trying these brushes made me a believer in quality.</li>
            <li>Pleased completely and Lamora Beauty is my new go to products....</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft!!</li>
            <li>They are soft, easy to use, and very sleek.</li>
            <li>I wanted enough that I could just grab another clean brush while changing colors or blending, without having to take time to clean brushes between use.</li>
            <li>The brushes are easy to use and clear information on which brush to use for the desired look is provided and very helpful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m inspired by these brushes to be more creative with my eyeshadow, and I have a feeling that these brushes will last me for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the coastal scents set as my first brush set (fantastic set too) and have had Several high end brushes since then and Lamora is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>The fluffy brush is so soft and works great</li>
            <li>Great set of soft brushes for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought brushes from Urban Decay and Lancôme, as well as more affordable brands like Real Technique, E.L.F., and Eco Tools.</li>
            <li>I feel like the smaller brushes are all very similar but still good quality.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them,you get your money worth.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and no fall out!</li>
            <li>They make my eye looks very blended as well as they pick up and deposit color pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush set (ever, with any brand), so I guess I don&#x27;t have much of a comparison point.  </li>
            <li>- I have no complaints about them - they are gentle to my very hyper sensitive skin and seem to distribute the color smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>This brush is a goto on pretty much every YouTube makeup tutorial I&#x27;ve watched.</li>
            <li>I own Sigma, Sephora, mac, mineral fusion and other more expensive brushes, but I must say that I am very pleased with my Lamora brushes.</li>
            <li>The handles of the brushes are smooth (more of a matte finish than shiny, which is lovely) and long so I can hold on to it further back</li>
            <li>However, I have a small collection of Mac brushes which are superior in quality.</li>
            <li>Loved these brushes so much I bought the same ones for my teenage sister</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and work very well; definitely interested in exploring all their products.</li>
            <li>These brushes can be used for multitasking like highlighting on high cheekbones, top of your lip, inner corner of the eye</li>
            <li>Bristles stay in the collar, apply make-up easily and accurately (bristles stay tight together)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reviews have been nothing less than amazing from what I have read, and there weren&#x27;t anything under a 3 star review</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the quality of the brushes for such a low price.</li>
            <li>The brissels are super soft and pick up pigment.</li>
            <li>Just got them, and they&#x27;re super soft.</li>
            <li>The hairs are soft but dense, pick up and distribute product adequately.</li>
            <li>but once I finally got the suds completely out they dried nicely and I had no trouble with the hairs falling out so far I&#x27;m really happy with them.</li>
            <li>Will certainly buy from them again.</li>
            <li>I bought them based on the positive customer reviews, as well as the reasonable price, and the brushes have performed wayyy beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that each brush is labeled with its specific purpose (with more detail on the packaging), which creates a lot of opportunities for experimenting with new looks.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tested them out yet but judging from the super soft bristles I know they&#x27;ll pick up pigments well.</li>
            <li>(I don’t know if people wanted a case?), but, as someone who works in marketing, I know that simple packing saves the consumer money so fine with me.</li>
            <li>These brushes are fine for beginners, or a person with a mid level skill set like myself.</li>
            <li>Will definitely recommend these and likely purchase more from this brand soon!</li>
            <li>They have quickly become my favorite brushes along with my much more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>It picks up just the right amount of product on the brush, when applying your eye shadow; The brushes are labeled, so it&#x27;s very helpful, for a starter kit for new up &amp; coming makeup artist or non makeup artist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these pretty much non stop while playing with new makeup I received for Christmas (these were also a gift!)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for - the right number of brushes in the right shapes for numerous eye styles.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend them to anyone wanting a little luxury at a great price.</li>
            <li>My review isn&#x27;t going to hold much water bc</li>
            <li>The one Sephora brush cost about the price of the this whole set</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They pick up product very well.</li>
            <li>so I am very picky about quality.</li>
            <li>The bristles hold on to product very well.</li>
            <li>so I really like the finish look on my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting the sigma brushes everyone&#x27;s been talking about yet thanks to these ones.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes really exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Got here fast</li>
            <li>The firmer bristles help me create straight lines so much easier than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li>pick up colors really well, I haven&#x27;t noticed much fallout.</li>
            <li>I also have noticed that the pigments transfer from the brush to the skin really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a replacement for my very worn eye brush shaders</li>
            <li>I will be buying a set for me very soon.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the descriptions considering I&#x27;m still learning how to use them all.</li>
            <li>These brushes came in a really sturdy looking package.</li>
            <li>She has been using them and  really likes them.</li>
            <li>, I thought that was neat and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I used to have a set of cheap brushes and after i got this one i can definitely tell the difference!</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>Really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>I also needed brushes that didn&#x27;t take over my whole eyelid.</li>
            <li>They are very well made and work really well for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Very versatile - I won&#x27;t necessarily use every brush as directed/intended but can totally see using every one of them for my own purpose, the way I want to.</li>
            <li>They apply my eyeshadow very well over my oily aging lids.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with these because of the price point.</li>
            <li>The blender brushes work very well as well.  </li>
            <li>I really reccomend these.</li>
            <li>Actually better than I expected, too.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have already stained the tips with pigment powders but they blend and apply eye color really well.</li>
            <li>though, it really doesn&#x27;t splay out, so that blending is effortless.  </li>
            <li>The items arrived on a very timely manner as it was stated on my order and the items were as described by the seller.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>; effect was so much easier with these brushes.</li>
            <li>Really like the assortment.</li>
            <li>This set of brushes is fantastic, especially for beginners!</li>
            <li>A friend recommended I buy a very pricey set of eye brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already recommended them to my girlfriends who are really into makeup.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think I would get the brushes that I wanted in this set.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much because I had never heard about this brand before.</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>It was very well spent money. :-)</li>
            <li>I own a lot of different brands of makeup brushes such as Sephora, Sigma, Mac &amp; some lower end drug store brands.</li>
            <li>I know that you want to use a good base regardless; however, I found that if I use my Mac brush with an inexpensive eyeshadow I can get a good color payoff.</li>
            <li>each one of these brushes can be used for so many different things, your basic essentials are right here with this brush set.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy though not tough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the flat top kabuki and the round kabuki for about 8 months now, and I love them,</li>
            <li>The brushes pick up just the right amount of pigment, and are soft on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I got my set the other day and love it.</li>
            <li>THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IS</li>
            <li>The hair is high quality and the brushes work very well for applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend over other more well known brand names that are twice+ the price.</li>
            <li>I have not had them long enough to comment on their durability, but so far am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I expect to use and enjoy them for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Find them to be better than the more expensive real hair brushes I invested in years ago.</li>
            <li>; If they are true to their word I will definitely continue to purchase their products.</li>
            <li>They are also very well made with none of the handles being loose or wonky; they handle beautifully; the ferrules are really well done and none of the brush hairs shed, even after being washed and test tugged.</li>
            <li>Not sure if anyone else experienced the same but when I opened the cute little canister they came in...they had a funky smell.</li>
            <li>Some said they worked fine out of the packaging, others said they needed to be wet in order to use..which doesnt really make sense, but i digress.  </li>
            <li>Just received my new Nars make up order today!</li>
            <li>Very firm and nice brush.</li>
            <li>Being new to the whole makeup thing</li>
            <li>They are sturdy and the handles are matte black which I love.</li>
            <li>I started to look for another brand of brushes that is less pricey and was glad to purchase LAMORA eye brush set and also another set of face brushes.</li>
            <li>I want to be able to use clean brushes every time without having to wash them each night because I only had a few.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the angled shading brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles on the blender brush is not as soft and fluffy as I would liked them to be</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once since I&#x27;ve gotten in, but I think these will help me become more of a regular eyeshadow user!</li>
            <li>and I ordered it mainly because of the pencil brush.  </li>
            <li>Decent pricing</li>
            <li>These brushes are far better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>While both sets are definitely soft--which says A LOT about the quality of these brushes from lamora--I find these brushes to do a better job at getting the job done with countless eye looks.  </li>
            <li>I find myself reaching for these over my more expensive brushes most days.</li>
            <li>Very soft, blend my eyeshadows very well.</li>
            <li>Brushes are very soft and pick up product very well.</li>
            <li>Great for someone who is starting out with using brushes and is not sure of what they need or want in their collection!</li>
            <li>but really like them so far!</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting them.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really high quality.</li>
            <li>They can give the high quality brushes a run for the money.</li>
            <li>highly recomend this set to everyone.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>However, the brush itself is so soft, and picks up more product that my other &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brushes do.</li>
            <li>After a week or two she simply exclaimed: &amp;#34;I love my new brushes.&amp;#34; Apparently they are soft and the makeup flows off them in a way that she likes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the small and large shader brushes.</li>
            <li>These are too wide to fit in my brush kit and the ferrules separated from the handles almost immediately.</li>
            <li>They are soft &amp; gentle on the eyes, comes with a protective tube to keep them in and the precision of these brushes are on point.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and pick up the shadows very well.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and hold their shape very well.</li>
            <li>They are soft and blend very well.</li>
            <li>Brushes work very well for me being a non professional.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, nice wide selection of different brushes to learn.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t get over how soft these brushes are and the whole set is pretty much everything you meed to create different eye make up looks.</li>
            <li>I am usually an avid Bare Minerals brush user</li>
            <li>Purchased this set a few weeks ago and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>Very soft and high quality.</li>
            <li>Plus they have a really nice simple sleek look with the black handles.</li>
            <li>Super soft &amp; actually makes applying my eye makeup easier!</li>
            <li>At long last, I&#x27;ve finally found a set of brushes I love that I can afford -- Imagine that!  </li>
            <li>Love the pencil brush; blending brush is soft; shaders have bristles firm enough to pick up the product and lay it down nicely.</li>
            <li>The little tube is so nice in helping keep them separated, for each individual face.</li>
            <li>They help you achieve a more professional look with little effort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tough to find great quality smaller brushes that I can afford</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using make up brushes.</li>
            <li>I decided to by a new ones.</li>
            <li>Mines have the smell of new.</li>
            <li>my  new  favorites  </li>
            <li>I found one thing pleasantly surprising, I&#x27;m able to use some of these brushes with a few of my Bare Minerals products (ex: dark bisque loose powder) and they performed well!</li>
            <li>They are very soft and pick up product well.</li>
            <li>This brushes are VERY SOFT, they dont scratch your face up.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and durable.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>They feel sturdy in your hand and the hair is very soft.</li>
            <li>It is very complete for creating whatever eye look you may want.</li>
            <li>They are very soft.</li>
            <li>Brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very very soft and pack make up to perfection.</li>
            <li>Brushes are very soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristles falling out after washing and using.</li>
            <li>Very soft and hold color well.</li>
            <li>This eye brush set has high quality and the brush part is soft.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes are good and the only one I don&#x27;t really use is the small angle.</li>
            <li>and I still love them just as much as I did then, if not more!  </li>
            <li>That being said, these are REALLY soft!</li>
            <li>I usually spend a fortune on makeup brushes and replace them faster than most people.  </li>
            <li>What an unexpected surprise these brushes have turned out to be!</li>
            <li>Brushes are really soft!</li>
            <li>These brushes are SO soft!</li>
            <li>Soft makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li>I usually do not do reviews.  </li>
            <li>Soft and blend to perfection!</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft!</li>
            <li>I really love the specific fiber they used and would like it used in other shapes.</li>
            <li>It would be better if the brushes came with a small case.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft, pick up eyeshadow well, and blend like a dream!  </li>
            <li>This is the first pencil brush that actually works for me.</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised!  </li>
            <li>Definitely comparable to higher end brushes I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>The first set was for me, then I got a set for my sister in law last Christmas, and now I am using this set for traveling.</li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t shed, they&#x27;re soft, and oh my gosh do they blend and pack on color!</li>
            <li>The only thing I haven&#x27;t done yet is clean them (they&#x27;ve only been used 3x)</li>
            <li>Most of them are very firm bristled.  </li>
            <li>As I do not do full makeup every day, its more difficult to find a reason to spend the time learning.  </li>
            <li>They are indeed very soft when they need to, the precision ones are soft yet sturdy, the way it should be.</li>
            <li>They are very soft &amp; so far I havent had any fallout while applying my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70 years old and never had a brand new complete set of eye makeup brushes</li>
            <li>the bristle is not that soft and has a strong chemical smell(which can be removed after a few washes) please improve it</li>
            <li>This is a nice set of brushes, but I&#x27;m still not convinced what makes these any better than less expensive ones.</li>
            <li>The brushes came in bad packaging, but they feel like a very good quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent brush set although not in the same league with higher end brushes such as mac, sigma and zoeva.</li>
            <li>bristles are soft and didn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised to this product.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I was surprised by how soft the bristles are, yet</li>
            <li>Brush set came 2 days earlier and very well packed.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are really soft which means they won&#x27;t be hurting my eyelids.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and the brushes have so far given me the eye look that I desire.</li>
            <li>Soft</li>
            <li>No shedding so far &amp; really soft.</li>
            <li>They are soft, don&#x27;t shed and well made.</li>
            <li>The bristles are amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>These are so soft and has variety features of eye brushes.</li>
            <li>the brushes have soft bristles but provide the stiffness needed for precision.</li>
            <li>As far as the eye brushes go...</li>
            <li>I now have weithers the old ones are being replace or some</li>
            <li>I think they compare well to my MAC brush set that is so old now.  </li>
            <li>soo soft.</li>
            <li>I switched to synthetic year ago and have been looking for a brush that compares to natural.  </li>
            <li>My collection is now complete.</li>
            <li>Thus far the 2 brushes that I have used  </li>
            <li>The synthetic brushes are soft to the touch but hold their shape as well as any I&#x27;ve used by MAC or Sephora.</li>
            <li>Go directly to Lamora website</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and they don&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find my brushes indivually packed in plastic and in a storage tube.</li>
            <li>They are soft and well made.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and blend product so evenly.  </li>
            <li>so much so, that I ordered a second set for my sister!</li>
            <li>I was surprised how inexpensive these professional makeup brushes turned out to be.  </li>
            <li>I am not a make-up artist, but I like durable, soft, dense, and shed-free brushes and these &amp;#34;fit the bill&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The brushes that need to be soft are soft; others that need to be stiffer are stiffer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely MINDBLOWN.</li>
            <li>They are soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I bought these as a gift for a young lady just getting into makeup.  </li>
            <li>Dense and soft.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few of the brushes and they are sturdy and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I contacted lamora directly and got an immediate response.</li>
            <li>Really soft.  </li>
            <li>They are soft inn</li>
            <li>I was really pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I actually like my fluffy brush from this set better than my Sigma.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish was included was a more fluffy brush for softening edges a bit.  </li>
            <li>What I really needed are good eye makeup brushes that are soft and won&#x27;t irritate my crazy sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I mean no mess to clean up, soft and they apply very well.</li>
            <li>On the small size which is fine for some of my uses (and space saving).  </li>
            <li>These 7 piece set are pretty much enough for creating different eye</li>
            <li>They come in their own little black barrel case.  </li>
            <li>High quality and low price</li>
            <li>High quality brushed at an affordable price.  </li>
            <li>They are not only soft but they don&#x27;t shed!!</li>
            <li>They are light in weight (which usually I don&#x27;t like) but they feel like quality brushes.</li>
            <li>I wish I had found these before buying many other brushes of other brands!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for new brushes and when came across these my only issue I was thinking was  </li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend to a friend or anyone in need of a new replacement eye brush set.</li>
            <li>I have used makeup for years but only recently discovered how much difference a brush makes.</li>
            <li>I ordered them because I really just needed another fluffy shader, and maybe another pencil brush, just as backups, and this whole set is cheaper than two from Sigma or MAC.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft but not too soft that they don&#x27;t apply the eyeshadow properly.</li>
            <li>Not only are they extremely soft, they are also well-made and seem to be high quality (especially for the price).</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t use the smallest one but other than that, the bristles are soft and blends my new &#x27;Urban Decay- Naked2&#x27; eyeshadows very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like how all brushes have a little description on them (for what they are mainly used).</li>
            <li>The blending brushes work really well while the regular shadow brushes are kind of stiff to the point that it&#x27;s hard for them to pick up eye shadow.</li>
            <li>Overall, every single brush is soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>The small shader and the precise shader are smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>i have used them multiple times and so far i haven&#x27;t seen any issues in regards to their construction.  </li>
            <li>(I tend to be heavy handed and when my hand is too far up I really lay it on) and the brush itself is extremely soft, holds product well</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed (&amp; this will apply to all synthetic brushes) is that they dont pick up eyeshadow as well as natural fibre brushes</li>
            <li>they are really soft and well put together would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and helps me blend (just getting into it last year)!</li>
            <li>I exchanged multiple emails with one of their customer service reps, and she was prompt and answered every question completely.  </li>
            <li>These were a gift for a friend, for whom desperately needed a good set.</li>
            <li>and most were poor quality.</li>
            <li>They are as nice as any expensive brush I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>and a few of them have become her favorites right away.</li>
            <li>They shipped the missing brush right out for me without question.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using these brushes long, but they&#x27;re very soft, work well at applying &amp; blending.</li>
            <li>I pulled them and no loose bristles.</li>
            <li>Plus the brush sets come in these cute little round brush case.</li>
            <li>blending brush is 3/4 inch long, round and fluffy and nice for blending.</li>
            <li>I have brushes that were more expensive and these outshine them by far.</li>
            <li>They are soft on my eyes and not scratchy like a ten dollar blender brush I bought recently.</li>
            <li>These are now the only eye brushes I would recommend, especially for the budget conscious.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brand of brushes to anyone who was in the market for new brushes on a limited budget.</li>
            <li>I was really interested on buying the Stigma brushes but was a little hesitant because of the price.</li>
            <li>I usually only use MAC or bare minerals brushes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles don&#x27;t feel stiff and brittle, like some of the higher end brushes feel.</li>
            <li>and I feel they are comparable to the other high cost brush sets.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t come loose.  </li>

            <li> The blender brush is great for blending out the pigments leaving a smoked out effect.</li>

            <li> AND it had great reviews.</li>

            <li> Packaging could have been better though.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the best thing about the packaging is that the brushes are named on the back of the box and it explains what each brush is for.</li>
            <li> I love the blending brush.</li>
            <li> and i love them.</li>

            <li> This was definitely one of my best deal of purchases here on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> Love,</li>
            <li> The bristles are as described and work nicely to grab shadows, and the stem length is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Fabulous brushes!  </li>
            <li> Looked locally for an angled liner brush and found the perfect one here.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how in love I am with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Even at $18.75 (price of the brushes today), I got them for free!</li>
            <li> not kidding when I say these are the best brushes I have ever used, and the only brushes I will ever truly need!</li>

            <li> love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Some eye shadows have more pigment than others.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these brushes.</li>
            <li> The blending brush from this set does an even better job as well-it&#x27;s my most favorite brush from this set.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering to place an order for more to send as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of them.</li>

            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;brushes are very nice, useful sizes, and I really enjoy them.</li>
            <li> Stellar all around!!!</li>

            <li> Great set of brushes at a decent price.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a great texture and feel sort high end.  </li>
            <li> They are doing amazing jobs on their faces, specially on their eyelids.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the quality of these brushes are pretty good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good quality.  </li>
            <li> My makeup goes on much smoother and blends nicely!  </li>
            <li> The classic shader and the blending brush are my favorite and are amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this brushes great brushes and so soft they look and feel like sigma brushes without the prize</li>
            <li> Love these brushes easy for beginners you use</li>
            <li> I received them quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> The shadows go on perfectly and smoothly, there&#x27;s no extra splotches of eye shadows.</li>
            <li> They are very soft &amp; feels great to the touch.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and do a great job of applying product.</li>
            <li> Very soft, no shedding and they work great.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes at a great price.  </li>
            <li> great packaging and very soft.</li>
            <li> Great quality and very soft.</li>
            <li> Amazing set of brushes for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> They are worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li> The first set that arrived had slipped in the packaging (I highly suggest better packaging for these brushes!!!)</li>
            <li> so I always have some clean ones!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality, very soft, blend seamlessly, and I have experienced no shedding.</li>
            <li> Very good quality products, need to buy the facial brushes from them too...</li>
            <li> You can go to Macy&#x27;s and spend 10 times the money for a similar set or save a bunch and get a very good set.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> The brush helps me to keep the shading deepest at the crease and becoming lighter towards the brow.</li>
            <li> They work great in blending the makeup into the skin and compared with my old brushes ( no name brand )</li>
            <li> and, so far, they have handled cleaning great.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been storing them in it, and they are so soft and seem like great quality.</li>
            <li> Wow these are great...</li>
            <li> Great so far.</li>
            <li> Great quality, really soft bristles, no shedding</li>
            <li> Ridiculously soft, all great sizes and shapes.</li>
            <li> They even threw in a free brush just for ordering :)</li>
            <li> These are soft and work great.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much but feels like a good brush when used.</li>
            <li> I was researching EVERYWHERE for a good set of eye make up brushes and these really stood out to me.</li>
            <li> They are good quality and they are shipped in a make up brush holder which I really like.</li>
            <li> I also loved these so much</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes, sent fast.</li>
            <li> one great way that you can test a good brush is that if it does not collapse when pressed down upon on the tip-</li>
            <li> What I noticed right away is how nicely they are made, there is no shedding</li>
            <li> The standard shader in particular is nicely absorbent, but not overly so, so it&#x27;s perfect for foiling on pigments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love love love these brushes so far and am forever grateful for the amazing price.</li>
            <li> Very nice and soft brushes ..</li>
            <li> The brushes all have very soft bristles and are nice and full/fluffy!</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money spent!</li>
            <li> The blending brush, the detailed pencil and the angled detailed brush are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; application goes on the way I want.</li>
            <li> and they came very quickly</li>
            <li> Easy to use and</li>
            <li> All were great brushes, Sonia, MAC and Makeup Geek being some of the top favs of mine currently.</li>
            <li> Wash easily.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are sturdy with easy application for the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Has a stand up case for easy grabbing.</li>
            <li> They grab pigment easily and deposit it where it needs to go.</li>
            <li> Going to buy some more so that I don&#x27;t have to clean the brushes so often.</li>
            <li> I received the eye brushes very quick.</li>
            <li> Love them as much as I do the Lamora Kabuki set which I also own.</li>
            <li> the brushes had a strong chemical odor which will not go away.</li>
            <li> Came as expected - time wise and appearance wise ...</li>
            <li> and they have held strong.</li>
            <li> All I care about is that they arrived securely packaged and in perfect shape, which they did (frankly, I&#x27;d rather have the money go into the brushes and not for fancy fluff).</li>
            <li> The brush seems strong and well made.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are good quality at a decent price.</li>
            <li> And it is nice too that they are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so nice to be able to buy them as their own set without the larger face brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great,  I like the soft feel,  and they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> There are no labels on the brushes, which one is for what, but I&#x27;m pretty experienced with makeup tools, so that doesn&#x27;t really affect me.</li>
            <li> No need to spend hundreds for name brands when these do the job just fine.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fine for blending and detailing.</li>
            <li> they work just fine.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed with these brushes,  especially the crease brush.  </li>
            <li> Excellent brushes I would buy them again in a hot second</li>
            <li> Fantastic for the price, and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and are also comfortable to handle.  </li>
            <li> I cut my application time in half as they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good brushes very soft to the skin, I washed them they didn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Very soft but give good control.  </li>
            <li> Super soft and awesome to use my new favorite brushes</li>
            <li> fast delivery and love the product thank you!</li>
            <li> Super soft and a great price.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes have a great shape to them and are SO super soft on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best brush in the kit IMO and the most useful.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m happy with the less than impressive packaging if it keeps the prices low.</li>
            <li> After a little research, I set my mind to buy this set, and that was a great choise!</li>
            <li> Love this product and received it exactly when I was told that it would arrive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied and would highly suggest these brushes, for the price &amp; quality (cheaper than Mac brushes)</li>
            <li> I received these brushes VERY quickly and was not disappointed by the quality.</li>
            <li> having the right tools for the job is very important.</li>
            <li> I am a huge advocate for eye brushes, and say your eye shadow all depends on the brushes you use.</li>
            <li> I thought they were going to be cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> how well they apply a smooth, even coat of shadow.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fabulous.</li>
            <li> The store provided us with a really nice brush set to use and a couple of the brushes really did make all of the difference when detailing and blending.</li>
            <li> The company of this product is also fantastic.</li>
            <li> I replied by replying to the actual email, then they emailed me back thanking me for my responseand letting me know that they are happy that I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> my eye makeup again goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> If you are a beginner and don&#x27;t use brushes regularly, these would be a great choice.</li>
            <li> These eye makeup brushes are fabulous and I use all 7 of them for my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> A great purchase especially for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These seven brushes should take care of your makeup needs, and I hope you will enjoy them if you purchase them.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brush set.</li>
            <li> Great brushed.</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great brushes at an affordable price with next day shipping.</li>
            <li> I do wish that the eye brush set also came with a carrying case as I can&#x27;t fit them all in the case I received with the face brush</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic...</li>
            <li> The angles on the brushes are precise.  </li>
            <li> This is because the brushes are not as dense and the handles feel a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> Application is smooth and the brush hold product well.  </li>
            <li> these are not cheap brushes made of very great quality.</li>
            <li> It did and I washed it the next day and its great.</li>
            <li> I enjoy doing my eye makeup and</li>
            <li> The price is cheap, but not the quality.</li>
            <li> however it still provides that precise application when I need it.  </li>
            <li> the variety of brushes is great because i only have to use these to do my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The bristles are comfortable.</li>
            <li> so I can get precise placement.</li>
            <li> The set of eye brushes is the same (great) quality as the Kabuki Brush Set.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great especially for the price.</li>
            <li> All around fantastic set.</li>
            <li> The ferrules are securely attached to the handle.</li>
            <li> says if you leave a review on Amazon then you will &amp;#34;recieve free products like this eye brush set.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Great feel to the brushes and the different sizes are great for shadowing and creating different looks.</li>
            <li> look cheap and there is a sizeable gap where the handle fits into the ferrule and the box they come in looks cheap.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great eye brush set.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Soft but still have good grip for putting on eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The seller was very caring and made every effort to be sure that I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These are soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful these brushes are.</li>
            <li> I just bought these because they had good reviews and the price was right to add to my arsenal of makeup brushes when I have large group makeover parties.  </li>
            <li> They came a day early and were so soft and in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> So far so good......</li>
            <li> I did not see many that were, but these are clearly labeled on the wood handles, which is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> My two daughters and my girlfriend are absolutely delighted with the quality and soft and light feeling of all the brushes of the set.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes, soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li> The detailed pencil does not look like it would paint a detail, but it is capable of painting a surprisingly fine line, for example, It will easily paint eyeliner more easily than a pointed pencil.</li>
            <li> They apply just the right amount of shadow and love the blending brush.</li>
            <li> Picks up the right amount of makeup and they do a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> These brushes worked perfectly and was able to apply my eyeliner and eye shallow with ease.</li>
            <li> but fortunately they return to the original shape.</li>
            <li> It turns out that I was right and all the other great reviews don&#x27;t lie!</li>
            <li> (I use high end eyeshadow, such as lorac) and also come in a cylinder case; I was very impressed!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and glad I saved my money.</li>
            <li> Bonus: super fast shipping &amp; such great service!</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes!!!</li>
            <li> I love it very much.</li>
            <li> I own a ton of brushes from really high end to drug store variety</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and dense and the handles are nicely shaped and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I looked into buying Sigma or Mac brushes &amp; although the quality of those is prob better, I&#x27;m not paying for two or three brushes what this whole set cost me!</li>
            <li> Received these brushes super quick, within a week of ordering them!</li>
            <li> This is the first set of brushes I have bought from this company and I will definately be buying more.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think she was familiar with this brand.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> I got so excited that I couldn&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described.very satisfied.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL:</li>
            <li> , I am going to order another set, I love them so much!</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> I am more interested in quality than quantity, so the items that I use that are subjected to &amp;#34;daily wear and tear&amp;#34; must &amp;#34;stand the test of time&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much that I bought two!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and arrived FAST!!  </li>
            <li> They had a bit of a strong smell that took two washes to get rid of, but overall pretty happy with them.</li>
            <li> I needed new eye brushes and these were an amazing price.</li>
            <li> SOOOOO VERY pleasantly surprised at how much I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> The quality is pretty good and they actually look and feel much better than my MAC and CHANEL brushes.</li>
            <li> There is a special use for every one of them</li>
            <li> I just received my brush set and it came right on time!</li>
            <li> The application to my eye shadows using these brushes were right on point!..</li>
            <li> how long were they going to take to arrive, surprisingly they were delivered quickly!</li>
            <li> I ordered these and was super excited when my package came in just two days.</li>
            <li> They sent another brush set in a hard cardboard cylinder, and the brushes are great!</li>
            <li> Super excited about these vegan cruelty-free brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the classic shader, the angled shader, and the blending brush!</li>
            <li> They are super soft and pick up and leave even the most under-pigmented shadows on your eyes!</li>
            <li> These brushes are definitely towards higher end quality and the price point is great.</li>
            <li> This set was a good variety of the different types of eye makeup brushes a person could have.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised at how nice they are for the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks Lamora Beauty, I will be looking for more of your products.</li>
            <li> They are soft and blend nicely.  </li>
            <li> If you need a set of good eye brushes get these and thanke later</li>
            <li> Finally found affordable brushes with good quality.</li>
            <li> Great brush set, all the essentials you need for eyes, soft and useful, and very afforable</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter who is interested in becoming a make up artist.</li>
            <li> and I can only say good things about them.</li>
            <li> Of course I ended up loving all of the brushes, but I like how the pencil brush is so soft in application</li>
            <li> If this is true, I don&#x27;t believe it is the brush.</li>
            <li> They are really soft and nice.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Lamora products and the customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be stocking up on more very soon.</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend these brushes to anyone in need of a good variety in eye brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with these brushes as much as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li> Not bad for $20 at all.</li>
            <li> The Lamora 7-brush eye makeup set is a very nice one, and provides a complete set of brushes for the needs of anyone who is particular about their makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , Ladies these brushes are the&lt;br /&gt;bussiness, Very well made these brushs soft, I Love them for the price they are so worth the price and more!</li>
            <li> They make is easy to apply makeup to look more professional.</li>
            <li> I have their flat top kabuki and loved it so much</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, these do not smell, which is a huge issue for me, so right off the bat, I was relieved about that.</li>
            <li> Fabulous all the product goes right where it has to go and it doesn&#x27;t stay on the brushes.</li>
            <li> So far so good, the real test is when I clean it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes for anyone looking for some high quality, good, makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li> I decided to do my own make up for the wedding of my best friend and since my brushes were old and not a good quality to begin with,  </li>
            <li> Brushes are very well made and are good quality, sturdy and soft.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and really are good quality.</li>
            <li> The brushes are quality and the delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li> I find that they actually get better after a thorough washing - the bristles are softer and glides better over the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a loyal fan of the MAC brush #217, and</li>
            <li> Quick Shipping.</li>
            <li> The seller got in contact with me again and they were super helpful.</li>
            <li> Really pleased that each one is clearly labeled and there is a detailed description on box to tell you what each one is for.</li>
            <li> Quick Shipping</li>
            <li> I purchased my set and it arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li> They are also very easy to wash and so far no shedding.</li>
            <li> Then I noticed how nice it was to have them securely separated in their box, instead of all loose in a cheap plastic bag and getting bent out of shape.</li>
            <li> I have a range of brushes, from the very, very pricey, to some cheap drug store brushes.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this set to anyone who is looking for a quality set of brushes, that will more than get the job done.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be able to afford high quality makeup brushes until discovering Lamora.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described very fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described very fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This was a very nice set and will consider buying other brushes from this brand.</li>
            <li> Fabulous brushes for a very inexpensive price !</li>
            <li> The brush set came quickly and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast also!!</li>
            <li> Secondly, these brushes really are amazing!</li>
            <li> They pick up the product very well and easy to blend out the product with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> These also apply the product easily and as the user wants.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely glad that I got this set, because I&#x27;m usually leery of really good deals for brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered some different brush sets (looking for a good deal as my budget is very tight) and out of all of them, these are by far the best quality and value I have found!</li>
            <li> so much when doing eyemakeup!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy more products from Lamora Beauty!</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Firstly, IRT some of these reviews, who cares about the dang packaging!</li>
            <li> I needed a cheap alternative to eye brushes as I am new to eye makeup and these brushes fit the bill.</li>
            <li> having a new set of brushes I must say I was missing out on a wonderful thing.</li>
            <li> Very soft, easy to clean</li>
            <li> Overall, these brushes are amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> The set came packaged in a heavy cardboard tube which makes it great for travel.</li>
            <li> The leather pouch and leather holder are much nicer in person, they don&#x27;t look like a cheap freebie.</li>
            <li> They also come in an attractive round case.  </li>
            <li> Deff worth the money.</li>
            <li> well worth what I paid for them....</li>
            <li> This is actually the first time I have ever written a review; it&#x27;s the first time I have ever been impressed enough to bother writing one.  </li>
            <li> My wife loved this brush set, everything arrived as she expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The ones in this set are dense (so you have better control) and yet still soft to the touch</li>
            <li> Totally worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Love is soft and have variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> Then I found this set which has a nice selection at a quality that can&#x27;t be beat, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I would have liked some sort of brush roll or something to store them in, but that&#x27;s hardly necessary and it might also keep the cost</li>
            <li> It is soft and comfortable!</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> I LOVE them and have worked wonderfully so far.</li>
            <li> Def worth the price</li>
            <li> Yes these brushes are worth it.</li>
            <li> and she is having a lot of fun learning how to use them.  </li>
            <li> All others I own are just way to big.</li>
            <li> Bought these brushes for eyeliner application and while they are pretty good for the money, the bristles don&#x27;t come to a clean, sharp end</li>
            <li> The brushes are of high quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Brushes seem to work pretty well but blender needs to be a little fuller since that and crease are super important!!!  </li>
            <li> Quality seems at par with most other brushes that sell for much more $$$.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and were very affordable!</li>
            <li> Received these yesterday they fairly  quick, the package they came in is very plan !</li>
            <li> it came in a very nice brush carry round box.  </li>
            <li> They are versatile- good for concealer and other makeup products.</li>
            <li> The bristles in these brushes are just right and do not throw the powder all over your face,like cheaper quality brushes do.</li>
            <li> The seller sent out a replacement set right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sigma brushes and these are right up there.</li>
            <li> even cheaper right out of package like ELF or  </li>
            <li> , I put them right into my makeup kit.</li>
            <li> They came right on time.</li>
            <li> So far love this purchase ;)&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was looking for potential substitutes that would give me the same beautiful blending effect.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Very soft, easy application.</li>
            <li> i like it its high Quality and Cheap</li>
            <li> Mine arrived in a black cardboard tube individually wrapped so they were all in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> They work amazingly, super soft and apply eyeshadow evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> It is actually much softer than my Sigma blending brush and it does a better job blending on my very sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> The small shader works great, and creates the type line that I like.  </li>
            <li> The variety is excellent and I was honestly a little surprised at the high quality since the price was so affordable.</li>
            <li> I alsolike that they&#x27;re soft and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great set especially for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This brushes are amazing!!!!!!!They are so soft and easy to you.</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes are great, but the smaller three brushes came bent, and that wouldn&#x27;t wash out.</li>
            <li> They are soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Little to no shedding and wonderful packaging makes these brushes a must-have whether you&#x27;re a seasoned makeup artist or just starting out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like them very much</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft, and super blendable.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I was so pleased to see how well made the brushes are and the handles are steady with perfectly soft bristils..</li>
            <li> Very soft and worth the money!</li>
            <li> It blended colors beautifully from several different palettes, both high end and lower end,  with almost no fall out.  </li>
            <li> and I will rate it higher.</li>
            <li> I have tried many low cost eye brushes and they did not cut it.  </li>
            <li> they allow my shadows to go on pretty well also.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the packaging, these brushes are of great quality and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but these brushes helped so much!</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, exactly what it says in the description.</li>
            <li> (this is my second set-I&#x27;m so cheap)!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really done any research on Lamora brushes but this set is definitely worth the $23.00.</li>
            <li> but I washed them first thing</li>
            <li> I bought them based on the user reviews which I find pretty reliable.</li>
            <li> Used them this morning for the first time and immediately ordered another set.</li>
            <li> which was a plus ;) also packaging was perfect with each individual brush secured in plastic protection and contained in a cylinder holder, unlike past reviewers.</li>
            <li> I like them so much that I bought a set for a friend, and she seems to like them too!</li>
            <li> I bought several as gifts for people &amp; they all love them.</li>
            <li> Great seller, arrived fast and as described, but they are smaller than my regular eye brushes which I was looking to replace.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for in an eye brush set.  </li>
            <li> even still this is pretty minor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had them for a week &amp; washed them before first use.</li>
            <li> Really helps improve your technique if you know what brush to use !</li>
            <li> I washed them before my first use  </li>
            <li> There are well made and I have enjoyed experimenting with them, I only wish they had come with a cheat sheet as to what each brush is specifically used for.</li>
            <li> Love these especially the blending brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it five starts because the value per price is exactly that - five stars.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Sure, the packaging is basic, but I don&#x27;t need fancy looking wrapping that I&#x27;m just going to toss.</li>
            <li> I may just have to buy another set of these, but I hope Lamora comes out with more of these smaller type brushes.</li>
            <li> Shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised....</li>
            <li> and once you register you will get I think 10% off your first purchase and the site automatically directs you to Amazon for purchasing.</li>
            <li> and I am kind of rough on my brushes.  </li>
            <li> Each brush is packed appropriately with the proper amount of bristles, and they hold their shape.  </li>
            <li> my favorite shadows are from Too Faced and Urban Decay Naked2 palette.  </li>
            <li> The wide assortment provides all the sizes anyone would need to apply any kind of powder.</li>
            <li> My first time trying them</li>
            <li> I only wish that it came with a cute carrying case, or bag like the 10 piece set does.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with costumer service and I will definitely purchase from this seller again</li>
            <li> They pick up and deposit color pretty well.</li>
            <li> No shedding after the first wash.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more from seller.  </li>
            <li> I totally recommend for all makeup junkies!  :)</li>
            <li> Much better than Amazons customer service (which is actually terrible)&lt;br /&gt;The box the brushes came in</li>
            <li> Not nearly as difficult to get the look I want.</li>
            <li> Love them, I am fairly new to the use of professional grade make up and brushes, but trying these brushes made me a believer in quality.</li>
            <li> Pleased completely and Lamora Beauty is my new go to products....</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft!!</li>
            <li> They are soft, easy to use, and very sleek.</li>
            <li> I wanted enough that I could just grab another clean brush while changing colors or blending, without having to take time to clean brushes between use.</li>
            <li> The brushes are easy to use and clear information on which brush to use for the desired look is provided and very helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m inspired by these brushes to be more creative with my eyeshadow, and I have a feeling that these brushes will last me for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the coastal scents set as my first brush set (fantastic set too) and have had Several high end brushes since then and Lamora is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> The fluffy brush is so soft and works great</li>
            <li> Great set of soft brushes for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought brushes from Urban Decay and Lancôme, as well as more affordable brands like Real Technique, E.L.F., and Eco Tools.</li>
            <li> I feel like the smaller brushes are all very similar but still good quality.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them,you get your money worth.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and no fall out!</li>
            <li> They make my eye looks very blended as well as they pick up and deposit color pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush set (ever, with any brand), so I guess I don&#x27;t have much of a comparison point.  </li>
            <li> - I have no complaints about them - they are gentle to my very hyper sensitive skin and seem to distribute the color smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> This brush is a goto on pretty much every YouTube makeup tutorial I&#x27;ve watched.</li>
            <li> I own Sigma, Sephora, mac, mineral fusion and other more expensive brushes, but I must say that I am very pleased with my Lamora brushes.</li>
            <li> The handles of the brushes are smooth (more of a matte finish than shiny, which is lovely) and long so I can hold on to it further back</li>
            <li> However, I have a small collection of Mac brushes which are superior in quality.</li>
            <li> Loved these brushes so much I bought the same ones for my teenage sister</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and work very well; definitely interested in exploring all their products.</li>
            <li> These brushes can be used for multitasking like highlighting on high cheekbones, top of your lip, inner corner of the eye</li>
            <li> Bristles stay in the collar, apply make-up easily and accurately (bristles stay tight together)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reviews have been nothing less than amazing from what I have read, and there weren&#x27;t anything under a 3 star review</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality of the brushes for such a low price.</li>
            <li> The brissels are super soft and pick up pigment.</li>
            <li> Just got them, and they&#x27;re super soft.</li>
            <li> The hairs are soft but dense, pick up and distribute product adequately.</li>
            <li> but once I finally got the suds completely out they dried nicely and I had no trouble with the hairs falling out so far I&#x27;m really happy with them.</li>
            <li> Will certainly buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I bought them based on the positive customer reviews, as well as the reasonable price, and the brushes have performed wayyy beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that each brush is labeled with its specific purpose (with more detail on the packaging), which creates a lot of opportunities for experimenting with new looks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tested them out yet but judging from the super soft bristles I know they&#x27;ll pick up pigments well.</li>
            <li> (I don’t know if people wanted a case?), but, as someone who works in marketing, I know that simple packing saves the consumer money so fine with me.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fine for beginners, or a person with a mid level skill set like myself.</li>
            <li> Will definitely recommend these and likely purchase more from this brand soon!</li>
            <li> They have quickly become my favorite brushes along with my much more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> It picks up just the right amount of product on the brush, when applying your eye shadow; The brushes are labeled, so it&#x27;s very helpful, for a starter kit for new up &amp; coming makeup artist or non makeup artist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pretty much non stop while playing with new makeup I received for Christmas (these were also a gift!)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for - the right number of brushes in the right shapes for numerous eye styles.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend them to anyone wanting a little luxury at a great price.</li>
            <li> My review isn&#x27;t going to hold much water bc</li>
            <li> The one Sephora brush cost about the price of the this whole set</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> They pick up product very well.</li>
            <li> so I am very picky about quality.</li>
            <li> The bristles hold on to product very well.</li>
            <li> so I really like the finish look on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting the sigma brushes everyone&#x27;s been talking about yet thanks to these ones.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes really exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Got here fast</li>
            <li> The firmer bristles help me create straight lines so much easier than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> pick up colors really well, I haven&#x27;t noticed much fallout.</li>
            <li> I also have noticed that the pigments transfer from the brush to the skin really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a replacement for my very worn eye brush shaders</li>
            <li> I will be buying a set for me very soon.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the descriptions considering I&#x27;m still learning how to use them all.</li>
            <li> These brushes came in a really sturdy looking package.</li>
            <li> She has been using them and  really likes them.</li>
            <li> , I thought that was neat and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I used to have a set of cheap brushes and after i got this one i can definitely tell the difference!</li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> Really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> I also needed brushes that didn&#x27;t take over my whole eyelid.</li>
            <li> They are very well made and work really well for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Very versatile - I won&#x27;t necessarily use every brush as directed/intended but can totally see using every one of them for my own purpose, the way I want to.</li>
            <li> They apply my eyeshadow very well over my oily aging lids.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with these because of the price point.</li>
            <li> The blender brushes work very well as well.  </li>
            <li> I really reccomend these.</li>
            <li> Actually better than I expected, too.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have already stained the tips with pigment powders but they blend and apply eye color really well.</li>
            <li> though, it really doesn&#x27;t splay out, so that blending is effortless.  </li>
            <li> The items arrived on a very timely manner as it was stated on my order and the items were as described by the seller.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> ; effect was so much easier with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Really like the assortment.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes is fantastic, especially for beginners!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended I buy a very pricey set of eye brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already recommended them to my girlfriends who are really into makeup.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I would get the brushes that I wanted in this set.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much because I had never heard about this brand before.</li>
            <li> They work very well.</li>
            <li> It was very well spent money. :-)</li>
            <li> I own a lot of different brands of makeup brushes such as Sephora, Sigma, Mac &amp; some lower end drug store brands.</li>
            <li> I know that you want to use a good base regardless; however, I found that if I use my Mac brush with an inexpensive eyeshadow I can get a good color payoff.</li>
            <li> each one of these brushes can be used for so many different things, your basic essentials are right here with this brush set.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy though not tough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the flat top kabuki and the round kabuki for about 8 months now, and I love them,</li>
            <li> The brushes pick up just the right amount of pigment, and are soft on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I got my set the other day and love it.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IS</li>
            <li> The hair is high quality and the brushes work very well for applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend over other more well known brand names that are twice+ the price.</li>
            <li> I have not had them long enough to comment on their durability, but so far am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I expect to use and enjoy them for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Find them to be better than the more expensive real hair brushes I invested in years ago.</li>
            <li> ; If they are true to their word I will definitely continue to purchase their products.</li>
            <li> They are also very well made with none of the handles being loose or wonky; they handle beautifully; the ferrules are really well done and none of the brush hairs shed, even after being washed and test tugged.</li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone else experienced the same but when I opened the cute little canister they came in...they had a funky smell.</li>
            <li> Some said they worked fine out of the packaging, others said they needed to be wet in order to use..which doesnt really make sense, but i digress.  </li>
            <li> Just received my new Nars make up order today!</li>
            <li> Very firm and nice brush.</li>
            <li> Being new to the whole makeup thing</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and the handles are matte black which I love.</li>
            <li> I started to look for another brand of brushes that is less pricey and was glad to purchase LAMORA eye brush set and also another set of face brushes.</li>
            <li> I want to be able to use clean brushes every time without having to wash them each night because I only had a few.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the angled shading brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the blender brush is not as soft and fluffy as I would liked them to be</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once since I&#x27;ve gotten in, but I think these will help me become more of a regular eyeshadow user!</li>
            <li> and I ordered it mainly because of the pencil brush.  </li>
            <li> Decent pricing</li>
            <li> These brushes are far better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> While both sets are definitely soft--which says A LOT about the quality of these brushes from lamora--I find these brushes to do a better job at getting the job done with countless eye looks.  </li>
            <li> I find myself reaching for these over my more expensive brushes most days.</li>
            <li> Very soft, blend my eyeshadows very well.</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft and pick up product very well.</li>
            <li> Great for someone who is starting out with using brushes and is not sure of what they need or want in their collection!</li>
            <li> but really like them so far!</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really high quality.</li>
            <li> They can give the high quality brushes a run for the money.</li>
            <li> highly recomend this set to everyone.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> However, the brush itself is so soft, and picks up more product that my other &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brushes do.</li>
            <li> After a week or two she simply exclaimed: &amp;#34;I love my new brushes.&amp;#34; Apparently they are soft and the makeup flows off them in a way that she likes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the small and large shader brushes.</li>
            <li> These are too wide to fit in my brush kit and the ferrules separated from the handles almost immediately.</li>
            <li> They are soft &amp; gentle on the eyes, comes with a protective tube to keep them in and the precision of these brushes are on point.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and pick up the shadows very well.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and hold their shape very well.</li>
            <li> They are soft and blend very well.</li>
            <li> Brushes work very well for me being a non professional.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, nice wide selection of different brushes to learn.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t get over how soft these brushes are and the whole set is pretty much everything you meed to create different eye make up looks.</li>
            <li> I am usually an avid Bare Minerals brush user</li>
            <li> Purchased this set a few weeks ago and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> Very soft and high quality.</li>
            <li> Plus they have a really nice simple sleek look with the black handles.</li>
            <li> Super soft &amp; actually makes applying my eye makeup easier!</li>
            <li> At long last, I&#x27;ve finally found a set of brushes I love that I can afford -- Imagine that!  </li>
            <li> Love the pencil brush; blending brush is soft; shaders have bristles firm enough to pick up the product and lay it down nicely.</li>
            <li> The little tube is so nice in helping keep them separated, for each individual face.</li>
            <li> They help you achieve a more professional look with little effort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to find great quality smaller brushes that I can afford</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using make up brushes.</li>
            <li> I decided to by a new ones.</li>
            <li> Mines have the smell of new.</li>
            <li> my  new  favorites  </li>
            <li> I found one thing pleasantly surprising, I&#x27;m able to use some of these brushes with a few of my Bare Minerals products (ex: dark bisque loose powder) and they performed well!</li>
            <li> They are very soft and pick up product well.</li>

            <li> They are very soft.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are good and the only one I don&#x27;t really use is the small angle.</li>
            <li> and I still love them just as much as I did then, if not more!  </li>
            <li> That being said, these are REALLY soft!</li>
            <li> I usually spend a fortune on makeup brushes and replace them faster than most people.  </li>
            <li> What an unexpected surprise these brushes have turned out to be!</li>
            <li> Brushes are really soft!</li>
            <li> These brushes are SO soft!</li>
            <li> Soft makeup brushes!</li>

            <li> They are incredibly soft, pick up eyeshadow well, and blend like a dream!  </li>
            <li> This is the first pencil brush that actually works for me.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised!  </li>
            <li> Definitely comparable to higher end brushes I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> The first set was for me, then I got a set for my sister in law last Christmas, and now I am using this set for traveling.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t shed, they&#x27;re soft, and oh my gosh do they blend and pack on color!</li>
            <li> The only thing I haven&#x27;t done yet is clean them (they&#x27;ve only been used 3x)</li>
            <li> Most of them are very firm bristled.  </li>
            <li> As I do not do full makeup every day, its more difficult to find a reason to spend the time learning.  </li>
            <li> They are indeed very soft when they need to, the precision ones are soft yet sturdy, the way it should be.</li>
            <li> They are very soft &amp; so far I havent had any fallout while applying my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 years old and never had a brand new complete set of eye makeup brushes</li>
            <li> the bristle is not that soft and has a strong chemical smell(which can be removed after a few washes) please improve it</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of brushes, but I&#x27;m still not convinced what makes these any better than less expensive ones.</li>
            <li> The brushes came in bad packaging, but they feel like a very good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent brush set although not in the same league with higher end brushes such as mac, sigma and zoeva.</li>
            <li> bristles are soft and didn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and do not shed.</li>

            <li> I now have weithers the old ones are being replace or some</li>
            <li> I think they compare well to my MAC brush set that is so old now.  </li>

            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of the brushes and they are sturdy and smooth.</li>

            <li> Really soft.  </li>
            <li> They are soft inn</li>
            <li> I was really pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I actually like my fluffy brush from this set better than my Sigma.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was included was a more fluffy brush for softening edges a bit.  </li>
            <li> What I really needed are good eye makeup brushes that are soft and won&#x27;t irritate my crazy sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I mean no mess to clean up, soft and they apply very well.</li>
            <li> On the small size which is fine for some of my uses (and space saving).  </li>
            <li> These 7 piece set are pretty much enough for creating different eye</li>
            <li> They come in their own little black barrel case.  </li>
            <li> High quality and low price</li>
            <li> High quality brushed at an affordable price.  </li>
            <li> They are not only soft but they don&#x27;t shed!!</li>
            <li> They are light in weight (which usually I don&#x27;t like) but they feel like quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found these before buying many other brushes of other brands!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new brushes and when came across these my only issue I was thinking was  </li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend to a friend or anyone in need of a new replacement eye brush set.</li>
            <li> I have used makeup for years but only recently discovered how much difference a brush makes.</li>
            <li> I ordered them because I really just needed another fluffy shader, and maybe another pencil brush, just as backups, and this whole set is cheaper than two from Sigma or MAC.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft but not too soft that they don&#x27;t apply the eyeshadow properly.</li>
            <li> Not only are they extremely soft, they are also well-made and seem to be high quality (especially for the price).</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use the smallest one but other than that, the bristles are soft and blends my new &#x27;Urban Decay- Naked2&#x27; eyeshadows very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like how all brushes have a little description on them (for what they are mainly used).</li>
            <li> The blending brushes work really well while the regular shadow brushes are kind of stiff to the point that it&#x27;s hard for them to pick up eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Overall, every single brush is soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> The small shader and the precise shader are smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> i have used them multiple times and so far i haven&#x27;t seen any issues in regards to their construction.  </li>
            <li> (I tend to be heavy handed and when my hand is too far up I really lay it on) and the brush itself is extremely soft, holds product well</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed (&amp; this will apply to all synthetic brushes) is that they dont pick up eyeshadow as well as natural fibre brushes</li>
            <li> they are really soft and well put together would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and helps me blend (just getting into it last year)!</li>
            <li> I exchanged multiple emails with one of their customer service reps, and she was prompt and answered every question completely.  </li>
            <li> These were a gift for a friend, for whom desperately needed a good set.</li>
            <li> and most were poor quality.</li>
            <li> They are as nice as any expensive brush I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> and a few of them have become her favorites right away.</li>
            <li> They shipped the missing brush right out for me without question.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using these brushes long, but they&#x27;re very soft, work well at applying &amp; blending.</li>
            <li> I pulled them and no loose bristles.</li>
            <li> Plus the brush sets come in these cute little round brush case.</li>
            <li> blending brush is 3/4 inch long, round and fluffy and nice for blending.</li>
            <li> I have brushes that were more expensive and these outshine them by far.</li>
            <li> They are soft on my eyes and not scratchy like a ten dollar blender brush I bought recently.</li>
            <li> These are now the only eye brushes I would recommend, especially for the budget conscious.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brand of brushes to anyone who was in the market for new brushes on a limited budget.</li>
            <li> I was really interested on buying the Stigma brushes but was a little hesitant because of the price.</li>
            <li> I usually only use MAC or bare minerals brushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles don&#x27;t feel stiff and brittle, like some of the higher end brushes feel.</li>
            <li> and I feel they are comparable to the other high cost brush sets.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t come loose.  </li>
            <li> (OMG so fluffy and soft!!!)</li>
            <li> Although the shipping time was fantastic, EVERY brush minus the small shader came with crushed bristles.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them long enough to talk about how they&#x27;ll hold up or wash up</li>
            <li> I hope they hold up for a long time as I plan to use them daily!</li>
            <li> They are rather long and big.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sigma brushes for a long time,  but they are finally giving out and after a lot of research and hours of reading reviews I decided to try these.  </li>
            <li> Soft enough for use around  eyes, but stiff enough for use with shadows or liner.</li>
            <li> They are so soft but still firm enough to blend product evenly.</li>
            <li> I do like the three larger blending/shadow brushes, so it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste.</li>
            <li> A few reviews that I read stated that some brushes were too soft and did not pick up enough product.</li>
            <li> If I use these brushes I will not get the color payoff I want without a really good base and extra layering.</li>
            <li> But, I have used it a few times (still learning) since I rec&#x27;d them, and I can say they are very soft and glide across the eye effortlessly/smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fluffy soft, that I can just massage my eyes without makeup!  </li>
            <li> Buy these brushes on Amazon, they&#x27;re more expensive on other websites.</li>
            <li> In particular I was looking for an all-over brush, a blending brush, a crease brush and this small brush that we used for smudging.</li>
            <li> The next two brushes down are the classic shader and the angled shader, and these brushes are also fluffy but flatter and pick up a lot of powder.</li>
            <li> They are comparable and significantly less expensive than the other brushes that I own and if you are about quality, I would recommend Lamora.</li>
            <li> Readjusting is not that bad, because the brushes are really nice for the price.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 star strictly because of the packaging, which may sound weird....</li>
            <li> I am not a professional, and don&#x27;t wear make up that often.  </li>
            <li> (middle aged).</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;My bushes arrived earlier than expected</li>
            <li> The reviews seemed so strange</li>
            <li> They are also about 3/4 inch long through the bristles.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft like cashmere, im sooo looking forward to using the brushes,all the brushes I was missing in my collection</li>
            <li> I like the length of the brushes as well not too long and bulky.  </li>
            <li> I recently had pink eye and had to replace everything.</li>
            <li> So far I have washed them and used them for a few days.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, brushes too small to apply makeup in a meaningful way.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use these brushes with inexpensive eye shadows you HAVE to use a good base.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a big help in applying eye shadow wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> They pick up the shadow well, as long as they are totally dry.</li>
            <li> This brush set is extremely versatile and contains every brush one could possibly need for every makeup need.  </li>
            <li> I ordered them because I wanted a second set of brushes to have while I wash my other ones</li>
            <li> These are synthetic unlike all of my other brushes that are actual hair.</li>
            <li> My only critique is that I would prefer the angles detailer to be a little thinner for lining upper lashes.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m so glad I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Customer service goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I use several of these everyday and will use a few of the others when I need a more dramatic look for evenings.  </li>
            <li> I have been slow in posting this review; as I have only used a couple of  the brushes thus far</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend $30 for a single brush and took a chance on this set based on reviews.</li>
            <li> They are not as full as the Sigma brushes but then again, they are not as expensive.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use that word loosely ........</li>
            <li> Finally the angled detailer is a very flat brush and also rather stiff.</li>
            <li> I have other brushes from other brands and they aren&#x27;t as soft and fluffy as these are.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and they said that they would ship me new small brushes, but they never did!</li>
            <li> Even when I tap the brushes to get access pigments off, I have only seen little amounts of dusts fall from the head.</li>
            <li> They are flat and somewhat stiffer than the previous two, with rounded tips.</li>
            <li> Soft delicate brushes!!!!help</li>
            <li> My favorites are the fluffy bending brush and the angled blending brush, would definitely repurchase those separately to have as extras.</li>
            <li> Wide variety of brush tips  </li>
            <li> They arrived sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> Also a plus, they shipped faster than expected.</li>
            <li> My favorites are the shaders - they come in three sizes, the smallest I use to pick up wet shadow to line under my eye</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different eye looks and the fluffy brush</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are nicely soft but not as thick as I need for quality application.</li>
            <li> I have only used them for dry powder eyeshadows and pigments, but I&#x27;m not sure these would do well with wet eyeshadow brands.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m also a single mother of three so like price breaks when I see something quality for less.</li>
            <li> I have worn makeup everyday after they were delivered just to have an excuse to use them.</li>
            <li> This would (1) protect the brushes and (2) eliminate eye shadow powder residue from spreading on other items in a cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> Got rid of other brushes and use these exclusively.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to compromise and use the other eye brushes I have.</li>
            <li> And there is absolutely NO WAY to beat the price vs quality comparison!  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Maybe you could include a small Lamanated card to keep with the same descriptions?that</li>
            <li> so I especially appreciate the small detail shader and the pencil brush.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft, apply makeup in a breeze, and the only brushes I&#x27;ll ever need to buy (sorry MAC and Sigma).</li>
            <li> I knew exactly what shapes I wanted and so far, with every purchase, I had been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bad quality, in person they look kinda cheap.</li>
            <li> Now they upgraded to fancy packaging and the fullness of the brushes and quality have went down</li>
            <li> they are almost identical, down to the thickness, application of products, softness of the bristles, and lack if shedding.</li>
            <li> Now I need to save up to buy their other sets; I am hooked on Lamora!</li>
            <li> These compare to the IT cosmetics brushes I have,but are not even half the price.</li>
            <li> Although the packaging does have a slight paint like smell-</li>
            <li> these brushes were slightly softer - but for this price, I cant complain&lt;br /&gt;planning to stock another set, just in case</li>
            <li> blending brush in this set is shaped almost identical to the MAC one, however it&#x27;s a bit less</li>
            <li> Of course I washed them and I attempted to reshape them but no luck except slightly with the blending brush.</li>
            <li> I have  set that costs half of what I paid for these, and they work identically.</li>
            <li> They rival any high end, expensive brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are tightly packed into the handles, and there was virtually no shedding at all, during unpacking, using, or washing.  </li>
            <li> I have less waste as these brushes pack the color where I need it and do not drop it off the brush before I get it to my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for a little over a week now and haven&#x27;t had any shedding.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure what the other complaints were about.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the metal is a little flimsy and feels weak, which is the only reason why I gave this a four star rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what other people would use this brush for, but I will use it for painting makeup on my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was a little concerned.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy these little gems</li>
            <li> So 17 brushes for $75 is roughly $5/brush!!!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult to get clear defined lines using eye liner.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> They are soft and they get the job done, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brushes.</li>
            <li> there are a few I haven&#x27;t even tried yet.</li>
            <li> They did smell off immediately out of the package but that was gone within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I read quite a few reviews before purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> and I also purchased quite a few and some went as gifts.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on others just get these.</li>
            <li> , I have always had trouble applying cake eyeliner, that is until I ordered and tried these brushes, they don&#x27;t shed and they wash well</li>
            <li> The ends of the stock are definitely not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> U reach for them everyday.</li>
            <li> This is just my humble opinion on these brushes.</li>
            <li> Definitely not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; feeling at all,  although the box they come in makes them look like they will be poor quality.</li>
            <li> But none of the brushes in this set will go to waste.</li>
            <li> My order was missing a brush</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Brushes were a little stiff considering you can get softer brushes  </li>
            <li> They come in a plain box that you would probably throw away</li>
            <li> Why waste money on expensive brushes when you get the same quality for less price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had my last very expensive brush set for well over a decade and was reluctant to not buy the same, but gave these a try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m adding to my collection because these brushes are so similar to the Sigma and Morphe brushes with the less expensive price tag.</li>
            <li> When washing there is no color transfer and very little if any brush shedding.</li>
            <li> I thought my only option was buying an expensive brand until I discovered Lamora.</li>
            <li> When I first opened my package I was soooooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually just use a beauty blender and fan brush on my face</li>
            <li> I recently took an eye make-up class at Sephora and, of course, I immediately became obsessed with my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed, go ahead and buy them ;)</li>
            <li> I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was just my luck getting this</li>
            <li> I have bought MAC face and eye brushes in the past and I threw all the face brushes out when I got the Lamora ones</li>
            <li> Well, I noticed there were not many eye-brush-only sets to be found</li>
            <li> I know there is a liner brush, but if you use the small shader it creates a softer line.  </li>
            <li> I have small eyes</li>
            <li> small tapered brush is very firm and have not found any use for it yet</li>
            <li> I am not very talented when it comes to doing fancy things with makeup</li>
            <li> when i tried using the blending brush, I got a hard time blending with it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too thick to use for gel liner</li>
            <li> As a middle-aged woman the crease seems to wander (if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> These are dupes for some of the more expensive brushes Ive seen and used - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I have a ton of brushes from M.A.C. and Sigma and Lamora brushes hold up just as well if not better!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping that doesn&#x27;t have a negative impact on their amazingness!</li>
            <li> the delicate eye area, but get the job done!</li>
            <li> 1 thing is that even the smallest amount of soap/oil is very hard to get out.</li>
            <li> use them everyday!!!</li>
            <li> Tired of over-paying just for the &amp;#34;brand/name&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I hate when dense brushes (like the liner brush) have coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I washed them and have not experienced any shedding.</li>
            <li> Seriously get these!</li>
            <li> With the price &amp; the quality of Lamora Beauty Brushes, you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately all of the sets that I looked at were around $50</li>
            <li> Not really impressed.</li>
            <li> However they do come with a weird smell which you can just wash off.</li>
            <li> so it is basically useless.</li>
            <li> I wish my camera would focus enough to see how terrible they&#x27;re shaped.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I promise you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> With that price how can you go wrong!</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> Some people say they smell bad.</li>
            <li> and I was shocked that all of them passed this test.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in hate with them either.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about them, but they worked wonders on the pigments!</li>
            <li> Before I leave a review, brushes I have used before includes MAC, Makeup Geek, SOHO (the worst I have tried), e.l.f., and Sonia Kashuk, some Stila, some Sephora brands, and misc</li>
            <li> Gave the products to my 10 yr. - Very disappointing!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great brush set at a great price. Really glad I bought these! Instantly became my go to brush set!</li>
            <li> the quality is not as good as Lamora&#x27;s kabuki brushes. the bristle is not that soft and has a strong chemical smell(which can be removed after a few washes) please improve it and I will rate it higher. thank you~</li>
            <li> Bad quality, in person they look kinda cheap.</li>
            <li> Have only had these brushes for a week or so but I&#x27;ve used them every day and have been loving them!  Very soft, easy to clean and they haven&#x27;t lost any bristles that I have noticed.  My favorites are the fluffy bending brush and the angled blending brush, would definitely repurchase those separately to have as extras. Would highly recommend over other more well known brand names that are twice+ the price.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this set- a good variety of brushes, the bristles don&#x27;t fall out and they work well. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love love love these brushes so far and am forever grateful for the amazing price. I will be repurchasing in the future no doubt!</li>
            <li> Brushes are wonderful for cream eye shadows and eyeliners. Also excellent for powders. Love them as much as I do the Lamora Kabuki set which I also own. Find them to be better than the more expensive real hair brushes I invested in years ago. Shapes are perfect.</li>
            <li> They are great - very high quality!</li>
            <li> My review isn&#x27;t going to hold much water bc I&#x27;m new to using make up brushes. That being said, these are REALLY soft! I looked into buying Sigma or Mac brushes &amp; although the quality of those is prob better, I&#x27;m not paying for two or three brushes what this whole set cost me! I bought the set of 10 &amp; set of 7. So 17 brushes for $75 is roughly $5/brush!!! I&#x27;ll gladly buy Lamora brushes again!</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I am not a professional, and don&#x27;t wear make up that often.  I was looking for a quality set to practice putting on makeup for my nights out.  This set was a good variety of the different types of eye makeup brushes a person could have.  The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t come loose.  They pick up the make up nicely.  I recently went on a trip and accidentily forgot to pack these brushes along, so I stopped by Sephora to buy just one brush to get me through the trip.  The one Sephora brush cost about the price of the this whole set and it just didn&#x27;t seem to perform as well as the Lamora brushes.  This was a very nice set and will consider buying other brushes from this brand.</li>
            <li> Perfect and delivered on time!</li>
            <li> Very good brushes for detailed eye looks. I love them.</li>
            <li> I just received and tested my 7 piece eye brush set by Lamora and let me just say I am SO impressed. I have tried many low cost eye brushes and they did not cut it.  I thought my only option was buying an expensive brand until I discovered Lamora. They are so soft but still firm enough to blend product evenly. Buy these brushes you will love them!!</li>
            <li> these brushes are a good deal for the cost.  i have used them multiple times and so far i haven&#x27;t seen any issues in regards to their construction.  they allow my shadows to go on pretty well also.  i&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my shadow brushes. I use them daily and they are holding up well</li>
            <li> Great set of affordable brushes! They blended out my eyeshadow like a dream. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These were a gift for a friend, for whom desperately needed a good set.</li>
            <li> Wide variety of brush tips  I probably won&#x27;t use the smallest one but other than that, the bristles are soft and blends my new &#x27;Urban Decay- Naked2&#x27; eyeshadows very well.  I use a semi-small one as an eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> They pick up product very well. I alsolike that they&#x27;re soft and easy to maneuver. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> When I first opened my package I was soooooo disappointed. I thought they were going to be cheap brushes. The packaging looks like something they would have at the dollar store. Don&#x27;t be fooled! The packaging may not be the best in the world but the brushed are great! The blending brush, the detailed pencil and the angled detailed brush are my favorite. They are sturdy and the handles are matte black which I love. Overall this is a great set especially for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. I read another user say they had a chemical smell but mine didn&#x27;t smell like anything. I also checked to see if  here was any shedding and there was none. I also like that each brush is labeled what it&#x27;s used for... Great starter set. I gave this a 4 star strictly because of the packaging, which may sound weird....but packaging makes a difference! Received these brushes super quick, within a week of ordering them!</li>
            <li> These eye brushes are amazing!  They arrived sooner than expected.  I usually spend a fortune on makeup brushes and replace them faster than most people.  I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of brushes and am really impressed with this set.  The bristles are a great texture and feel sort high end.  I strongly recommend these brushes to anyone looking for a great eye set.</li>
            <li> I love mY brushes, they are great. Thank you</li>
            <li> What an unexpected surprise these brushes have turned out to be! I have a range of brushes, from the very, very pricey, to some cheap drug store brushes.  These Lamora brushes are some of the best that I have used, and they are so, so affordable.  They don&#x27;t pull on my eyelids at all, and hold product wonderfully.  I would highly recommend this set to anyone who is looking for a quality set of brushes, that will more than get the job done.</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely wonderful. They are very soft and pick up product well. I have worn makeup everyday after they were delivered just to have an excuse to use them. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the packaging, these brushes are of great quality and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Loved this brush set. They are very soft &amp; feels great to the touch. Easy to use &amp; application goes on the way I want.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use these brushes. Just received my new Nars make up order today! The brushes arrived in two days. And I can tell they are quality brushes. I&#x27;m a cosmetologist so I am very picky about quality. But I&#x27;m also a single mother of three so like price breaks when I see something quality for less. I will update my review in a week on how well they withstood a bath and application. Very excited to use them!</li>
            <li> Brushes are really soft!</li>
            <li> I washed them as soon as I opened them as instructed and they still shed!</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome! I do not need to say anything else!!!!! Try them...You will not regret it! ;)</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter for Winter Guard.  She loves them!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really great brushes! I am not very talented when it comes to doing fancy things with makeup but these brushes helped so much!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, like another writer, I was concerned about packaging, but they are great brushes.</li>
            <li> These compare to the IT cosmetics brushes I have,but are not even half the price.The bristles in these brushes are just right and do not throw the powder all over your face,like cheaper quality brushes do. This is the first set of brushes I have bought from this company and I will definately be buying more.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, just love em!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes. I am a satisfied customer. The brushes are soft, no shedding, &amp; the makeup application are delightful. Altogether, it allows me to be playful &amp; execute the looks I want to achieve. With the price &amp; the quality of Lamora Beauty Brushes, you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, the quality is great.  Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best for me.... I really love them..,,</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these brushes! Super soft and a great price. We will definitely purchase from Lamora again!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye brush set I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It has the perfect selection of brushes for an unbeatable price. I am a huge advocate for eye brushes, and say your eye shadow all depends on the brushes you use. I will be recommending this brush set to all of my friends!</li>
            <li> SOOOOO VERY pleasantly surprised at how much I love these brushes! Great price and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> They are great! I particularly like the angled shading brush. As a middle-aged woman the crease seems to wander (if you know what I mean. LOL) The brush helps me to keep the shading deepest at the crease and becoming lighter towards the brow. I have not had them long enough to comment on their durability, but so far am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Great brushes sos soft and easy to use loved it</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, exactly what it says in the description. Gave as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it. Perfect for day to day. The brushes are soft, nice wide selection of different brushes to learn.</li>
            <li> Great value and the blending crease brush is perfect.  Great for someone who is starting out with using brushes and is not sure of what they need or want in their collection!</li>
            <li> Good product for the price!  I just received these so I am still trying them out but so far so good.  I&#x27;m going to order a couple more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Great product. Applies make-up very easily with precision.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes! Comparable to my famous name brushes. Very pleased with my purchase and would recommend them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just what I needed. I usually just use a beauty blender and fan brush on my face so I didn&#x27;t want to buy a set of brushes just to end up not using most of them. These brushes are great because they&#x27;re all intended to be used on eyes. They do smell a bit so I recommend washing them and airing them out before using.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are soft, easy to use, and very sleek. The bristles hold on to product very well. This is a perfect all around brush set that anyone can use. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The first set that arrived had slipped in the packaging (I highly suggest better packaging for these brushes!!!) and some of the brush tips had been creased. The seller sent out a replacement set right away. My daughter LOVES the quality of these brushes (she has used everything from Mac to Sephora to Elf to....) and a few of them have become her favorites right away. For synthetic brushes, these are top-notch. Excellent value for the money spent!</li>
            <li> This brushes are VERY SOFT, they dont scratch your face up. They blend any type of makeup well. The only con is, they&#x27;re shorter than regular brushes, but longer than travel size brushes. Readjusting is not that bad, because the brushes are really nice for the price. No shedding after washing and they&#x27;re durable! A makeup lover&#x27;s dream!  3/7/15 Update: Buy these brushes on Amazon, they&#x27;re more expensive on other websites. Hopefully, you&#x27;re a prime member because you will have them in 2 days (this is my second set-I&#x27;m so cheap)! LOL</li>
            <li> This brush set is extremely versatile and contains every brush one could possibly need for every makeup need.  Well made and nicely shaped.</li>
            <li> For how much these brushes are I am very pleased with the outcome! Soft but still have good grip for putting on eyeshadow. I haven&#x27;t really done any research on Lamora brushes but this set is definitely worth the $23.00.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are nicely soft but not as thick as I need for quality application.</li>
            <li> Very good brushes very soft definitely a good sigma dupe</li>
            <li> Great product, my make up looks even better using these brushes by Lamora!</li>
            <li> These brushes are SO soft! I&#x27;m in love ! I can&#x27;t believe they were so inexpensive- they&#x27;re just as nice, if not nicer!!, than my Mac brushes!</li>
            <li> These are great, so soft, perfect lenght, very easy to maintain, I am getting another set.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for almost a year now! No fall out what so ever! They blend perfect and are very soft! Of course if your a makeup artist your going to want Alittle more dense to your brush but these are great to soften the edges and really great for the price!</li>
            <li> bristles are soft and didn&#x27;t smell. great brushes!</li>
            <li> fast delivery and love the product thank you!</li>
            <li> I am vey pleased with this lovely set of eye makeup brushes.  I especially appreciate that each brush is labeled with its function.  The seller was very caring and made every effort to be sure that I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was really interested on buying the Stigma brushes but was a little hesitant because of the price. I started to look for another brand of brushes that is less pricey and was glad to purchase LAMORA eye brush set and also another set of face brushes. They work great in blending the makeup into the skin and compared with my old brushes ( no name brand ) so I really like the finish look on my face ( flawless, smooth, well blended ). Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and glad I saved my money.</li>
            <li> Soft delicate brushes!!!!help so much when doing eyemakeup!!</li>
            <li> Been playing around with these brushes and I love them. They&#x27;re super soft, and super blendable. Don&#x27;t let the cheap packaging fool you! These brushes are awesome for the price!</li>
            <li> Bought these brushes for eyeliner application and while they are pretty good for the money, the bristles don&#x27;t come to a clean, sharp end so it&#x27;s difficult to get clear defined lines using eye liner. Otherwise, they are fairly good brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no makeup artist, but I&#x27;ve had different makeup brushes over time. I decided to take a risk with these ones based on the good reviews. They are indeed very soft when they need to, the precision ones are soft yet sturdy, the way it should be. They pick up eyeshadow well (I use high end eyeshadow, such as lorac) and also come in a cylinder case; I was very impressed! I&#x27;ll update this review should anything change with use and washes. I&#x27;m not getting the sigma brushes everyone&#x27;s been talking about yet thanks to these ones. I recommend them!</li>
            <li> I just wrote a review for the 10 piece face brush set (which I love) and I just wanted to say that these brushes are every bit as good. I ordered them because I wanted a second set of brushes to have while I wash my other ones and now I just want to use these ALL the time!! They are very soft and do a great job of applying product. And the price can&#x27;t be beat! They had a bit of a chemical scent when I got them but I washed them first thing and it went away. I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my girlfriend (middle aged). She&#x27;s quite good at makeup and has what she needs but does spend some time between her house and mine. She needed stuff at my house so I started buying some things to make it easier for her. When I gave her these brushes she didn&#x27;t appear to be at all enthusiastic about them. She likes a good brush and I don&#x27;t think she was familiar with this brand. After a week or two she simply exclaimed: &amp;#34;I love my new brushes.&amp;#34; Apparently they are soft and the makeup flows off them in a way that she likes. I bought them based on the user reviews which I find pretty reliable. If my makeup expert likes them then I am happy to pass the news along.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. They are so soft and do not shed. They pick up the perfect amount of product. The blending brush is one of the best blending brushes I have used.  I highly recommend getting them.</li>
            <li> They are great. I use them everyday</li>
            <li> I am really surprised to this product. it&#x27;s really high quality.</li>
            <li> Awsome brushes, and great price, I have Mac and Sephora these work great so glad I found them</li>
            <li> Good brushes very soft to the skin, I washed them they didn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Deff worth the money. I ordered these and was super excited when my package came in just two days. Although the packaging does have a slight paint like smell- the rushes themselves are amazing quality. They look great and are sturdy- no sheading. I bought the 7 piece eye set and also the 11 piece brush set- very happy with both</li>
            <li> I received these brushes VERY quickly and was not disappointed by the quality. You won&#x27;t be either!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome customer service, as well. Will definitely recommend this brand to others.</li>
            <li> These eye brush set is perfect! Very easy to use and of great quality. Don&#x27;t think twice and try it. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth your money! Great set of soft brushes for everyday use. They arrived quickly and were very affordable! I&#x27;m always looking for new brushes and when came across these my only issue I was thinking was  how long were they going to take to arrive, surprisingly they were delivered quickly! Very soft and worth the money!</li>
            <li> I like the brushes very much -- I have nothing brilliant or witty to say - they work like they are supposed to and I am well satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. They are light in weight (which usually I don&#x27;t like) but they feel like quality brushes. I am happy with this purchase and will look forward to seeing what else Lamora Beauty has in store!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for eye makeup !</li>
            <li> I have used makeup for years but only recently discovered how much difference a brush makes. And boy, do these brushes deliver bang for the buck! Don&#x27;t hesitate. Buy these brushes. I promise you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Very soft, easy application.</li>
            <li> The brushes really exceeded my expectations. The quality is pretty good and they actually look and feel much better than my MAC and CHANEL brushes. This store is now bookmarked under my favorites!</li>
            <li> I have to say, I was surprised by how soft the bristles are, yet how well they apply a smooth, even coat of shadow. The standard shader in particular is nicely absorbent, but not overly so, so it&#x27;s perfect for foiling on pigments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So often with makeup brushes you get what you pay for, and as cheap as this set is, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything spectacular. But I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised, and impressed!</li>
            <li> they are much better than I thought they would be....well worth what I paid for them....and they came very quickly</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are so soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this set they are a great set for a good price.I had to travel and left my brush set and purchased these on Amazon.Got here fast and they even followed up to see how satisfied you were with the product.It applies the makeup lovely and hasn&#x27;t shed from what I can see.Great value.</li>
            <li> Came to me quick and in great condition.  The firmer bristles help me create straight lines so much easier than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  Followed by the softer blending brush makes me very happy with the way my makeup turns out.  The different levels of firmness are absolutely perfect, I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love these brushes!!  I washed them before use and there was no fall out.  The bristles are very soft and durable.  Easy to use and each one of these brushes can be used for so many different things, your basic essentials are right here with this brush set.  They pick up the product very well and easy to blend out the product with these brushes.  I highly recommend these brushes for anyone looking for some high quality, good, makeup brushes.  I also received my order very fast and Lamora was great by sending a follow up email.  I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> My wife loves them..might need to order some more.</li>
            <li> Quality brushes at an affordable price, nicely formed and blend well.  These also apply the product easily and as the user wants.  These are just as good as brushes for 3 times the cost.  These wash nicely.</li>
            <li> These brush set are amazing! For the price it is super duper good. They can give the high quality brushes a run for the money. I abolutely love them. And also I would like to do a giveaway of these brushes on my youtube channel beautybytashh. These 7 piece set are pretty much enough for creating different eye make up looks.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fabulous. Used them this morning for the first time and immediately ordered another set. I have brushes that were more expensive and these outshine them by far. They apply just the right amount of shadow and love the blending brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!! Great quality. Wonderful blending and picks up color great. I love them.</li>
            <li> So I bought this set back in mid-November and wanted to expand on my collection of brushes. Reviews have been nothing less than amazing from what I have read, and there weren&#x27;t anything under a 3 star review so I purchased them. Before I leave a review, brushes I have used before includes MAC, Makeup Geek, SOHO (the worst I have tried), e.l.f., and Sonia Kashuk, some Stila, some Sephora brands, and misc I can&#x27;t think off the top of my head. All were great brushes, Sonia, MAC and Makeup Geek being some of the top favs of mine currently. Here is my review on these Lamora brushes:&lt;br /&gt;They pick up colors really well, I haven&#x27;t noticed much fallout. Even when I tap the brushes to get access pigments off, I have only seen little amounts of dusts fall from the head. The blender brush is great for blending out the pigments leaving a smoked out effect. I also have noticed that the pigments transfer from the brush to the skin really well. There hasn&#x27;t been a lot of leftover shadow clinging onto the bristles when I wash them. The bristles on the blender brush is not as soft and fluffy as I would liked them to be but they are still effective. The flatter brushes are amazing. They are dense and can hold a lot of pigments, they are great at smudging out the gel liner without tugging on the lids but that also depends on the gel liner you are using. There is one brush I honestly don&#x27;t know what to use with it, it&#x27;s too thick to use for gel liner and it&#x27;s too pointy to use to smudge and pick up colors to place on the lid...I tried using it for brows too but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me...maybe concealer? Eh. Overall, these brushes are amazing for the price. I do recommend adding some of Lamora&#x27;s brushes to your collection. Packaging could have been better though. It&#x27;s been couple of weeks, and after washing, I have not seen it shed. If you do not want to spend the money for MAC or IT (OMG so fluffy and soft!!!) brushes, these brushes are the way to go.</li>
            <li> This is a solid brush set! I recently took an eye make-up class at Sephora and, of course, I immediately became obsessed with my eye makeup. The store provided us with a really nice brush set to use and a couple of the brushes really did make all of the difference when detailing and blending. Unfortunately all of the sets that I looked at were around $50 and I just didn’t want to drop that kind of money yet. In particular I was looking for an all-over brush, a blending brush, a crease brush and this small brush that we used for smudging. Almost none of the sets that I looked at included all of these together (and brushes are about $20/brush when purchasing individually). I was so happy when I found this brush set with everything I needed AND it had great reviews. I saw some people mentioned the packaging wasn’t impressive, but the packaging was my favorite part! They come in a plain box that you would probably throw away (I don’t know if people wanted a case?), but, as someone who works in marketing, I know that simple packing saves the consumer money so fine with me. Anyway, the best thing about the packaging is that the brushes are named on the back of the box and it explains what each brush is for. Remember, I am an eye makeup student so this meant the world to me, AND the brush names are also on the brush itself. I cut the explanations out of the box and I keep it with my eye makeup. The handles of the brushes are smooth (more of a matte finish than shiny, which is lovely) and long so I can hold on to it further back (I tend to be heavy handed and when my hand is too far up I really lay it on) and the brush itself is extremely soft, holds product well and, so far, they have handled cleaning great. The company of this product is also fantastic. They emailed me the day before I got my brushes asking if I received them and, if so, if I was happy with my purchase. I replied by replying to the actual email, then they emailed me back thanking me for my responseand letting me know that they are happy that I am happy with the product. I will be buying others for gifts. Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes! Very soft and high quality. I&#x27;ve used sigma brushes and these are right up there. I love the blending brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes used to be top notch! In a simple package you would think they weren&#x27;t about that life. Now they upgraded to fancy packaging and the fullness of the brushes and quality have went down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my lamora brush set.  I&#x27;d been looking for a replacement for my very worn eye brush shaders yet all brushes either had no body or were like bristles.  Now that I found lamora eye brushes my eye makeup again goes on smoothly.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> just received today and i love them. bought as  a gift to my daughter. I will be buying a set for me very soon. great quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Great set. I decided to do my own make up for the wedding of my best friend and since my brushes were old and not a good quality to begin with,  I decided to by a new ones. After a little research, I set my mind to buy this set, and that was a great choise! Brush set came 2 days earlier and very well packed. I really like how all brushes have a little description on them (for what they are mainly used). Brushes are very well made and are good quality, sturdy and soft. My make up looked great.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomend this set to everyone. It was very well spent money. :-)</li>
            <li> Catches and applies cosmetic well. Attractive and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> These brushes are comparable to much more expensive brushes for a fraction of the cost. Buy them up before they go up!</li>
            <li> Really nice brushes for the money.  Would buy again.  Update:  I bought a second set.</li>
            <li> So far a great set of brushes!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, not just because of the price. They are not as full as the Sigma brushes but then again, they are not as expensive. They are super soft and really are good quality. I also have the kabuki set and my impression was just the same.</li>
            <li> Very nice!  Looked at dozens of choices, kept coming back to these!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality of the brushes for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes.  I am very satisfied and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I just received my brush set and it came right on time! The set comes in a box that has descriptions of each of the brushes on the back. I really appreciate the descriptions considering I&#x27;m still learning how to use them all. Also, each of the brushes is labeled which is great! The brushes themselves are really soft which means they won&#x27;t be hurting my eyelids. Plus they have a really nice simple sleek look with the black handles.</li>
            <li> great quality and even better price!! I wish I would have bought them sooner!</li>
            <li> Just received my brush set and I love them all. Very soft, blend my eyeshadows very well. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for better quality. Buy them, you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> Very nice quality brush set...the answer to what I needed.</li>
            <li> Great!!!! Why waste money on expensive brushes when you get the same quality for less price.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes! I just realised that I switched entirely to using this set and gave up using my some more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Love them! As good as or better than my Sigma or MAC brushes!</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE these brushes. I&#x27;ve had them for a little over a week now and haven&#x27;t had any shedding. They are super soft and pick up and leave even the most under-pigmented shadows on your eyes! I might buy another set so I always have some clean ones!</li>
            <li> These are too wide to fit in my brush kit and the ferrules separated from the handles almost immediately. Bad quality.</li>
            <li> Some hairs were bent upon arrival</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my new brush set.  The brushes are quality and the delivery was quick.  Would order from them again.</li>
            <li> Very firm and nice brush. it does the job.</li>
            <li> Its just ok. Doesn&#x27;t give good coverage. Not really impressed.</li>
            <li> The brushes came in bad packaging, but they feel like a very good quality. I haven&#x27;t had any hairs coming off and I like how they have a brush for basically everything for your eye makeup. I have only used them for dry powder eyeshadows and pigments, but I&#x27;m not sure these would do well with wet eyeshadow brands. There are no labels on the brushes, which one is for what, but I&#x27;m pretty experienced with makeup tools, so that doesn&#x27;t really affect me. Overall, these are great!</li>
            <li> The Eye Brushes are a very nice quality.  I think they would make nice gifts for my granddaughers.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes.  Great value!</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes at a decent price. Not sure if anyone else experienced the same but when I opened the cute little canister they came in...they had a funky smell. Maybe because they are synthetic. Anyway I washed them as anyone should before the 1st use. 1 thing is that even the smallest amount of soap/oil is very hard to get out. I had to keep going back to rinse them because the hairs held on to the soap suds ALOT. The more expensive brushes I have from Sephora dont do that but once I finally got the suds completely out they dried nicely and I had no trouble with the hairs falling out so far I&#x27;m really happy with them.</li>
            <li> I love my Lamora makeup eye brush kit!!! This is by far the best eye brush set I have ever owned! They are soft &amp; gentle on the eyes, comes with a protective tube to keep them in and the precision of these brushes are on point. I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more items from this company. Thank you!</li>
            <li> comparable to the MAC brushes !</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;My bushes arrived earlier than expected which was a plus ;) also packaging was perfect with each individual brush secured in plastic protection and contained in a cylinder holder, unlike past reviewers. I have not used the brushes yet but I have washed them for prep to use and they seem sturdy. So far love this purchase ;)&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the brushes had a strong chemical odor which will not go away. I want to return them. They smell toxic.</li>
            <li> I love my brush set. As soon as I open the package up I got so excited that I couldn&#x27;t wait to use them. I will definitely give them 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fine for beginners, or a person with a mid level skill set like myself. However, I have a small collection of Mac brushes which are superior in quality. If you&#x27;re going to use these brushes with inexpensive eye shadows you HAVE to use a good base. I know that you want to use a good base regardless; however, I found that if I use my Mac brush with an inexpensive eyeshadow I can get a good color payoff. If I use these brushes I will not get the color payoff I want without a really good base and extra layering. I found one thing pleasantly surprising, I&#x27;m able to use some of these brushes with a few of my Bare Minerals products (ex: dark bisque loose powder) and they performed well!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, no shedding, I&#x27;ve washed and used these for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using these brushes long, but they&#x27;re very soft, work well at applying &amp; blending. They haven&#x27;t shed at all and seem sturdy. I like them so much that I bought a set for a friend, and she seems to like them too!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes to use in my kit, and was extremely satisfied. They are comparable to Morphe or Sigma in quality. I also loved the packaging. The little tube is so nice in helping keep them separated, for each individual face.</li>
            <li> it was just what I need&lt;br /&gt;great quality ~ almost like the ones I got from Sephora&lt;br /&gt;except these brushes were slightly softer - but for this price, I cant complain&lt;br /&gt;planning to stock another set, just in case I lose them (like I always do)</li>
            <li> Just as described! Soft bristles &amp; good quality brushes, can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes!</li>
            <li> reminds of sedona lace brushes good price good condition</li>
            <li> i like it its high Quality and Cheap</li>
            <li> This is a great set of brushes. I find that they actually get better after a thorough washing - the bristles are softer and glides better over the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I was able to pick some of these brushes up separately - would love to have a couple more blending brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes.  Very soft but give good control.  I bought several as gifts for people &amp; they all love them.</li>
            <li> My wife says they are really nice and uses them each time she puts her makeup on.</li>
            <li> Very soft, no shedding and they work great.</li>
            <li> THE BRUSHES ARE NICE I LOVE THEM, AS A FREELANCE MAKEUP ARTIST THEY GET THE JOB DONE!!</li>
            <li> Quality seems at par with most other brushes that sell for much more $$$. The set came packaged in a heavy cardboard tube which makes it great for travel. Each brush IS lighter and shorter than my MAC brushes but still performed well.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush for a great price</li>
            <li> The brush set came quickly and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I love the brushes. They work great and delivery was fast. Will certainly buy from them again.</li>
            <li> High quality and low price what is there not to like</li>
            <li> I have been searching for eye shadow brushes for a while now and decided to take a chance on these, I&#x27;m sure glad I did because I love them! The brushes are made very well and they apply makeup perfectly. If you are a beginner and don&#x27;t use brushes regularly, these would be a great choice. Each brush is labeled so you know what to use them for. Also a plus, they shipped faster than expected. I would definitely buy more products from Lamora Beauty!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! My eye shadows goes on smoothly with these brushes and the angled brushes works great for the brows and as a eyeliner brush</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes. Brushes DO matter!</li>
            <li> These eye brushes are good quality for the price. I use them everyday. They apply shadows perfectly and they haven&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li> Really nice brush set, comes in a nice tube so brushes are protected and I&#x27;ve been storing them in it, and they are so soft and seem like great quality. Haven&#x27;t used them long enough to talk about how they&#x27;ll hold up or wash up but really like them so far!</li>
            <li> awesome brushes, precise application..a must have for makeup lovers!!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price</li>
            <li> Brushes are well-made, and the size and selection is excellent.  Very useful as I try to become more adept at applying make-up.</li>
            <li> Super soft and awesome to use my new favorite brushes</li>
            <li> I could never justify spending twenty dollars for one brush so for the price Of these brushes I am extremely happy with this purchase! It&#x27;s affordable and the brushes have so far given me the eye look that I desire.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much but feels like a good brush when used.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for an awesome price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought makeup brushes before but these seem to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes! And at a great price. Love!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!..The application to my eye shadows using these brushes were right on point!..Great price..great quality. .I would recommend these to everyone!</li>
            <li> These are soft and good quality. I am a makeup artist and use these in my kit. I do a lot of bridal party makeup so I have to wash brushes between clients. A lot of brushes will shed when washing regularly. These have held up very nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent, affordable substitute for Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> Nice variety of brushes.  High quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 years old and never had a brand new complete set of eye makeup brushes so I thought it was time I treated myself.  These eye makeup brushes are fabulous and I use all 7 of them for my eye makeup. There is a special use for every one of them and like I said I use them all.&lt;br /&gt;Never having a new set of brushes I must say I was missing out on a wonderful thing. The shadows go on perfectly and smoothly, there&#x27;s no extra splotches of eye shadows. The detail brushes and angled brush for brows and under the eye are just perfect. I really can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful these brushes are. I would definitely recommend them to everyone. I just happened to get mine on sale so that was even better. I know I will always by more of Lamora beauty products especially if they are as wonderful as these eye shadow brushes. As you can see I am totally enthralled with these brushes and hope anyone looking for eye makeup brushes will give these a try. They are absolutely magnificent&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Lamora for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Great buy!!! The brushes are not flimsy at all they work great.  My favorite is the blending brush.</li>
            <li> These are really very nice brushes! Very soft and flexible. The reviews seemed so strange I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the packaging or not, not that it would have mattered to me, but I thought the packaging was cute and functional. So I&#x27;m not sure what the other complaints were about. I took a couple of photos. I think that the selection is great!</li>
            <li> Great brush set! The hair is high quality and the brushes work very well for applying eyeshadow. I love the variety of shape and sizes, there is a brush for everything. Fast delivery and great customer service from the seller. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The brushes were delivered promptly and were as advertised. There was a brush for every task of applying eye makeup</li>
            <li> These brushes were super cheap and on top of that these brushes did just as good as a job as my Sigma and MAC brushes! They came in great packaging, no weird smell like one review said. And they came within my 2 day prime shipping. Definitely have to try these brushes.</li>
            <li> So in love with this set! my favorite brushes were the blending brush and the angled shader. They were so soft and they pick up the perfect amount of pigmentation!</li>
            <li> some of the brushes are of substance but some are floppy and of no use.</li>
            <li> Amazing set of brushes for a very reasonable price! Fast shipping, great customer service!</li>
            <li> I gave as a gift and she stated she loved them!</li>
            <li> Soft and they do the trick. Work well for the price.</li>
            <li> Best set ever every girl need.</li>
            <li> This brush set by Lamora is perfect for travel.  I do have a couple of favorites for my home use though.  Every brush is top quality.  On the small size which is fine for some of my uses (and space saving).  They come in their own little black barrel case.  For the price, it is cardboard.  You are paying for nice quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this brush set, Very good quality!!</li>
            <li> These brushes came in a really sturdy looking package. I actually plan on keeping the brushes in it. All of the brushes have a great shape to them and are SO super soft on my eyes. They great brushes they hold up well and I dont see any lose hairs or anything. I hope they hold up for a long time as I plan to use them daily!</li>
            <li> These brushes worked perfectly and was able to apply my eyeliner and eye shallow with ease. Would recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> this was purchased as a gift for my niece.  She has been using them and  really likes them. The packing the brushes arrived in was really cute and can be used as storage.. I would purchase from this vendor again...</li>
            <li> These brushes are so great! I was researching EVERYWHERE for a good set of eye make up brushes and these really stood out to me. The classic shader and the blending brush are my favorite and are amazing! My eye make up comes out flawless with these brushes and I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing the 10pc set to try out their kabuki brushes. Seriously get these! They beat Sigma &amp; MAC brushes any day, can&#x27;t beat the price either!!</li>
            <li> I love this set of brushes. They are soft and they get the job done, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brushes. I highly recommend them,you get your money worth.</li>
            <li> I love love love these eye makeup brushes. They are so soft and pick up the shadows very well. They help you achieve a more professional look with little effort. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with these. I&#x27;m thinking about getting the face brushes next. These are a great quality set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes!!! Amazing quality...can&#x27;t believe the price.</li>
            <li> Great seller, arrived fast and as described, but they are smaller than my regular eye brushes which I was looking to replace. Very soft and feel wonderful on the eye.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a very nice quality.  I expect to use and enjoy them for a long time.  would  definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Soft makeup brushes! Amazing quality for the price! Perfect size!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so nice. I have other brushes from other brands and they aren&#x27;t as soft and fluffy as these are. I hope they do well with washing</li>
            <li> I. Love these brushes😊</li>
            <li> These are terrific brushes! They&#x27;re soft and hold their shape very well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush set, packed so they stay separate.  Exactly what I was looking for in an eye brush set.  Better than that their customer service is superior.  This is actually the first time I have ever written a review; it&#x27;s the first time I have ever been impressed enough to bother writing one.  The brushes are great!  This is a company you want to order from; they are great!</li>
            <li> My wife loved this brush set, everything arrived as she expected.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes at a great price.  I would buy from this company again</li>
            <li> Great brushes for a great price. So glad I decided to get these!</li>
            <li> Great brush set! I am surprised at how nice they are for the price. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, go ahead and buy them ;)</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft! I am so pleased with them and will be ordering the face brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great value!  I use them everyday! The set is so big,  there are a few I haven&#x27;t even tried yet.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and GREAT seller! They communicated with me immediately after the order, and again to make sure it was received and I was happy with it. Great job!</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5-stars, because the price simply is unbeatable for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a loyal fan of the MAC brush #217, and I was looking for potential substitutes that would give me the same beautiful blending effect.&lt;br /&gt;The blending brush in this set is shaped almost identical to the MAC one, however it&#x27;s a bit less firm.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite picky with my brushes, and even still this is pretty minor.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the quality of these brushes are pretty good and I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I bought another set for my mother to try.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! I usually do not do reviews.  However, I love these.  I am SO happy I bought them.  I usually only use MAC or bare minerals brushes.  These compare to MAC!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described.very satisfied. I loved it..... Would recommend.  Brushes are of excellent quality</li>
            <li> I just wanted additional eyeshadow brushes. These are synthetic unlike all of my other brushes that are actual hair. Wow these are great...so soft and blend wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Great quality synthetic brushes, they apply and blend make up very well.  Will purchase more.  Also appreciate the great customer service email just to thank me for my order and let me know they are there to help in case there are problems with my order, which there were not.</li>
            <li> Great so far. I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet but they are nice. I have had them for a week &amp; washed them before first use. No shedding so far &amp; really soft. I would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this brush set, I&#x27;ve been looking for a eye brush set for a while and have purchase high end dept. store eye brushes and I would have to say that I&#x27;m more satisfied with these. I also like the packing it came in which was a tube like box, I thought that was neat and shipping was fast. Thanks Lamora Beauty, I will be looking for more of your products.</li>
            <li> brushes are great.  highly recommend.  i have tried many brushes and these are very good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Love them! They are soft and perfect for my eye shadow application.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, I can&#x27;t say enough about these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the metal is a little flimsy and feels weak, which is the only reason why I gave this a four star rating. However, the brush itself is so soft, and picks up more product that my other &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brushes do. I&#x27;ve only used it once since I&#x27;ve gotten in, but I think these will help me become more of a regular eyeshadow user!</li>
            <li> Excellent set for the pro MUA like myself or a total novice.... Excellent buy! A+</li>
            <li> Great brushes..........</li>
            <li> Great price for the quality of brush. Brushes are labeled to take the guesswork out of which brush to use when &amp; where . Really helps improve your technique if you know what brush to use ! Definitely recommend these to a friend ... Heck ... Christmas will be here before you know it ... I may have some gift ideas already !</li>
            <li> They are soft, don&#x27;t shed and well made. A great purchase especially for the price. Also, having them labelled is great if you&#x27;re just learning like I am.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described very fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described very fast shipping!! These brushes are great! They make my eye looks very blended as well as they pick up and deposit color pretty well. I will be purchasing another set in the future.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I purchased another set of similar brushes prior to purchasing this set. Love this set better. Came in a convenient and cute makeup brush cup. The bristles are amazingly soft. You don&#x27;t need to add a lot of product to the brushes- they do the job without wasting product. They are versatile- good for concealer and other makeup products. Their customer service is very friendly, courteous &amp; helpful.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for! A brush for each technique I needed! Great packaging as well - would make a lovely gift!</li>
            <li> I love them. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:1531faf6bed577c75b73d38fdab1fac]] The Lamora 7-brush eye makeup set is a very nice one, and provides a complete set of brushes for the needs of anyone who is particular about their makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blending brush is 3/4 inch long, round and fluffy and nice for blending. It is the biggest brush. The next two brushes down are the classic shader and the angled shader, and these brushes are also fluffy but flatter and pick up a lot of powder. They are also about 3/4 inch long through the bristles. The small shader and the precise shader are smaller brushes. They are flat and somewhat stiffer than the previous two, with rounded tips. The detailed pencil does not look like it would paint a detail, but it is capable of painting a surprisingly fine line, for example, It will easily paint eyeliner more easily than a pointed pencil. Finally the angled detailer is a very flat brush and also rather stiff. I&#x27;m not sure what other people would use this brush for, but I will use it for painting makeup on my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These seven brushes should take care of your makeup needs, and I hope you will enjoy them if you purchase them.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations! This is a fantastic brush set.</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived on time and in good condition. Very nice product. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> These are good make up brushes. Most of them are very firm bristled.  They are good quality and they are shipped in a make up brush holder which I really like.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase and considering purchasing more for gifts.  As a mua I can definitely feel the quality of the bristle texture and density, length and weight of the handles, etc.  I just bought these because they had good reviews and the price was right to add to my arsenal of makeup brushes when I have large group makeover parties.  Glad I won&#x27;t be having to spend an arm and a leg for quality brushes for my clients.</li>
            <li> Very good quality products, need to buy the facial brushes from them too... Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Came as expected - time wise and appearance wise ...they were a gift for my sister in law so I can&#x27;t speak to their quality otherwise</li>
            <li> quality brushes !  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great brushed. I absolutely love the small and large shader brushes. Would purchase again. I have a lot of Mac and sigma brushes and these are comparable</li>
            <li> The best, most attentive customer service. Awesome brushes! A+++</li>
            <li> Love these. Affordable and excellent quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the Lamora eye makeup brush set. They are quality brushes. I will definitely purchase from Lamora again. In fact, I plan on purchasing my next set of Lamora soon.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they work perfectly and apply my makeup flawlessly!</li>
            <li> Sizes are very nice. Came well packed.  They did smell off immediately out of the package but that was gone within a few hours.  Would consider buying these as a gift for a friend because they are similar in quality to brushes I have purchased that are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Quick Shipping. Great Item! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> The fluffy brush is so soft and works great&lt;br /&gt;A small tapered brush is very firm and have not found any use for it yet&lt;br /&gt;All in all good purchase.</li>
            <li> I read quite a few reviews before purchasing this product.  Some said they worked fine out of the packaging, others said they needed to be wet in order to use..which doesnt really make sense, but i digress.  Either way, either option doesnt work for me</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes in the price point.  Would buy more.</li>
            <li> Awesome product - very happy with the quality and selection of brushes.</li>
            <li> I love all of these brushes.  I use several of these everyday and will use a few of the others when I need a more dramatic look for evenings.  I definitely would recommend these brushes, they hold the makeup so shadow doesn&#x27;t end up on my face.  They feel sturdy in your hand and the hair is very soft.</li>
            <li> I loved the brushes and they arrived on time!</li>
            <li> They are rather long and big.</li>
            <li> Really happy with these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Hello! I received my Lamora brush set over the weekend and I was thrilled. I&#x27;m loving them. Great product a must for your makeup tool collection. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great brush set for the price!</li>
            <li> Love them ! Great product for the price, no shedding, super cute . Wash before you use them.</li>
            <li> So far so good, the real test is when I clean it.</li>
            <li> So impressed with these brushes!! They are super soft and no fall out! With that price how can you go wrong! Step aside MAC!!!</li>
            <li> Good brushes for price. Soft enough for use around  eyes, but stiff enough for use with shadows or liner.</li>
            <li> This review is from 4 sets I used and I also purchased quite a few and some went as gifts. Brushes were a little stiff considering you can get softer brushes  even cheaper right out of package like ELF or  Wet n Wild.  Brushes seem to work pretty well but blender needs to be a little fuller since that and crease are super important!!!  Maybe I&#x27;ll use longer and gather feedback from the gift sets I gave away and update at a later date.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes, they work well and met my expectations. Good price, good value. Recommend!</li>
            <li> I got the 5 piece kabuki set with the leather holder and the 5 piece precision set with leather pouch. Love these brushes! They rival any high end, expensive brush. I&#x27;ve had the flat top kabuki and the round kabuki for about 8 months now, and I love them, so when I came across a great coupon code on one of my YouTube subscriptions, i jumped at the chance to get both sets for a very good price. The bristles are soft and dense and the handles are nicely shaped and easy to hold. The leather pouch and leather holder are much nicer in person, they don&#x27;t look like a cheap freebie.</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely fantastic. I bought them based on the positive customer reviews, as well as the reasonable price, and the brushes have performed wayyy beyond my expectations. I&#x27;ve been using the brushes for about three weeks now, and washed them a couple times, and there has been no fallout. I&#x27;m inspired by these brushes to be more creative with my eyeshadow, and I have a feeling that these brushes will last me for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the quality of these brushes. I used to have a set of cheap brushes and after i got this one i can definitely tell the difference! This set is the best i ever had so far in this price range.</li>
            <li> Good Brushes for the price. Probably my go to brushes since I got them!</li>
            <li> These brushes were great! They came a day early and were so soft and in perfect condition! Love them!</li>
            <li> This brush set came perfectly wrapped.  In good condition.  I washed them before my first use  I was very skeptical about them, but they worked wonders on the pigments! Blending with them were even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> WOWWW!! These brushes are super soft!! Shipping was super fast also!! However they do come with a weird smell which you can just wash off. But overall these brushes are soo good !!</li>
            <li> Great brushes at an affordable price with next day shipping. Great deal!</li>
            <li> For the price the brushes are good, good starter. Eyeshadow went on well</li>
            <li> These are so soft and has variety features of eye brushes. These are MUST have. Every dollar woth pay for and collection to makeup brushes. Don&#x27;t waste money on others just get these.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes.  I have face and eye sets and love them.  They are affordable and I keep them in my suitcase so I don&#x27;t have to take my daily brushes with me every time I travel.</li>
            <li> I do wear make-up on a daily basis but have only every used one brush to apply my eye shadow. I purchased these brushes as I attempt to do my own wedding make up. There are well made and I have enjoyed experimenting with them, I only wish they had come with a cheat sheet as to what each brush is specifically used for.</li>
            <li> I really like this set. It is very complete for creating whatever eye look you may want. the brushes have soft bristles but provide the stiffness needed for precision. Each brush is labeled on the handle so you know the intended use. I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> So far so good......😉</li>
            <li> Could not be happier with this brush set! The variety is excellent and I was honestly a little surprised at the high quality since the price was so affordable. Will definitely recommend these and likely purchase more from this brand soon!</li>
            <li> I love love love my lamora brushes! I needed a cheap alternative to eye brushes as I am new to eye makeup and these brushes fit the bill. They are soft on my eyes and not scratchy like a ten dollar blender brush I bought recently.</li>
            <li> Great quality, really soft bristles, no shedding</li>
            <li> Love these especially the blending brush.</li>
            <li> Really like these brushes. They hold eye shadow well. Very good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> IdaBee74 - I recently purchase this set and I am extremely happy with the product! I think the quality of the brushes for the price is amazing. The brushes are super soft and work very well; definitely interested in exploring all their products. Tired of over-paying just for the &amp;#34;brand/name&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Will buy more of this brand!</li>
            <li> This is my first brush set (ever, with any brand), so I guess I don&#x27;t have much of a comparison point.  But, I have used it a few times (still learning) since I rec&#x27;d them, and I can say they are very soft and glide across the eye effortlessly/smoothly.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with cleaning them or bristles falling out.  Plan to move onto the bigger brushes in the future..</li>
            <li> Although the shipping time was fantastic, EVERY brush minus the small shader came with crushed bristles. I noticed it the second I opened the shipping box. All the bristles are bent from the manufacturer packaging so it is basically useless. Of course I washed them and I attempted to reshape them but no luck except slightly with the blending brush. I am not sure if it was just my luck getting this but I will not repurchase to find out. I wish my camera would focus enough to see how terrible they&#x27;re shaped.</li>
            <li> Great brushes!  Perfect for all eye makeup application.</li>
            <li> Lamora&#x27;s eye brush set is fantastic! One of the best sets I&#x27;ve ever used for synthetic brushes; very good quality, soft to the touch especially the blending brush. It picks up just the right amount of product on the brush, when applying your eye shadow; The brushes are labeled, so it&#x27;s very helpful, for a starter kit for new up &amp; coming makeup artist or non makeup artist. I can just go on &amp; on, how good this product is. I&#x27;m very satisfied and would highly suggest these brushes, for the price &amp; quality (cheaper than Mac brushes) you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have the Lamora face brushes too which I also reviewed with a 5 star.  I bought those about a year ago and I still love them just as much as I did then, if not more!  As far as the eye brushes go...I absolutely LOVE these brushes too and I recommend Lamora brushes to anyone who even mentions makeup brushes to me.  I have bought MAC face and eye brushes in the past and I threw all the face brushes out when I got the Lamora ones and I just threw out all the MAC eye brushes I had when I got this set!  I do wish that the eye brush set also came with a carrying case as I can&#x27;t fit them all in the case I received with the face brush set but I suppose I don&#x27;t need to take ALL my makeup brushes every time I go somewhere.  All in all I am perfectly in love with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. I highly recommend these brushes. They are soft and blend very well. The product arrived very fast and the brushes arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft like cashmere, im sooo looking forward to using the brushes,all the brushes I was missing in my collection I now have weithers the old ones are being replace or some I just didnt have just yet. This product is fantastic...love love love</li>
            <li> This brushes are amazing!!!!!!!They are so soft and easy to you. I would love to get the the makeup up brush set for Christmas, already have it on my wish list. I still can&#x27;t get over how soft these brushes are and the whole set is pretty much everything you meed to create different eye make up looks.</li>
            <li> This came very quickly and the brushes are very nice.  I think they compare well to my MAC brush set that is so old now.  I will use this company again.</li>
            <li> Very good brushes for the price.  No hair residue on your face.  The angles on the brushes are precise.  I love the fact that they are labeled what their recommended usage is.  Love these brushes, will buy more!!</li>
            <li> EDIT: The seller got in contact with me again and they were super helpful. They sent another brush set in a hard cardboard cylinder, and the brushes are great! The fact that these guys reach out and try to help unsatisfied customers makes me incredibly happy. The smaller brushes are good and the only one I don&#x27;t really use is the small angle. Incredibly good set for the money. Awesome blending brushes!!!  ORIGINAL: The bigger brushes are great, but the smaller three brushes came bent, and that wouldn&#x27;t wash out. I contacted the seller and they said that they would ship me new small brushes, but they never did! I do like the three larger blending/shadow brushes, so it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes. Soft and blend to perfection! Love them!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mother. She liked them.</li>
            <li> I have their flat top kabuki and loved it so much I knew I wanted more from them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got these brushes yesterday...on a Sunday! I used them this morning and oh my...they&#x27;re soo soft. They have quickly become my favorite brushes along with my much more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Would have received a 5-star rating if brushes were enclosed in a holder/case. This would (1) protect the brushes and (2) eliminate eye shadow powder residue from spreading on other items in a cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I haven&#x27;t really tested them out yet but judging from the super soft bristles I know they&#x27;ll pick up pigments well. It&#x27;s a decent brush set although not in the same league with higher end brushes such as mac, sigma and zoeva. This is because the brushes are not as dense and the handles feel a bit cheap. I recommend them to people who are just getting into make up brushes :)</li>
            <li> Surprisingly amazing, I honestly did not expect these brushes to perform as well as they did. I mean no mess to clean up, soft and they apply very well. Bravo to Lamora Beauty, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> These brushes make applying high-end eyeshadow and drugstore eyeshadows a snap, I have always had trouble applying cake eyeliner, that is until I ordered and tried these brushes, they don&#x27;t shed and they wash well, I am going to order another set, I love them so much!</li>
            <li> I have been a makeup artist for twenty years and I love these brushes! I switched to synthetic year ago and have been looking for a brush that compares to natural.  I found them and at a great price.  They are soft and blend nicely.  Application is smooth and the brush hold product well.  Love them!</li>
            <li> I got my set the other day and love it. It&#x27;s such a quality product. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $30 for a single brush and took a chance on this set based on reviews. Definitely worth it. Brushes are very soft and pick up product very well.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Bristles are soft! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with these brushes. I don&#x27;t wear makeup often so I wanted inexpensive but quality brushes that were versatile. I also needed brushes that didn&#x27;t take over my whole eyelid. These brushes definitely fit the bill!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes easy for beginners you use</li>
            <li> Very nice and soft brushes .. I like them very much</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!!!!! No need to spend 200$ on brushes from sephora. The eye brush set was everything I needed and wanted. The brissels are super soft and pick up pigment. The ends of the stock are definitely not cheaply made. The results come out amazing, I was thrilled. I definitely would recommend to a friend or anyone in need of a new replacement eye brush set.</li>
            <li> Soft and Great Quality!</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful soft they&#x27;re just beautiful they blend like a dream I got them today to and their customer service is amazing great great company. The brush blend so good these are not cheap brushes made of very great quality. I will be buying more. If you need a set of good eye brushes get these and thanke later</li>
            <li> Very good set of make-up brushes.  You can go to Macy&#x27;s and spend 10 times the money for a similar set or save a bunch and get a very good set.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using for 3 months before writing this review.  Bristles stay in the collar, apply make-up easily and accurately (bristles stay tight together)&lt;br /&gt;and have been lasting well.</li>
            <li> Great Product will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes. Got rid of other brushes and use these exclusively. Finally found affordable brushes with good quality.</li>
            <li> The brushes all have very soft bristles and are nice and full/fluffy! They are very easy to work with and the case that they come in is very compact and good for traveling.</li>
            <li> The perfect set of brushes for the eyes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Lamora eye brush set. They are very well made and work really well for the price I paid. I have already washed, used, and washed them again and they have held strong. Really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Really pleased that each one is clearly labeled and there is a detailed description on box to tell you what each one is for.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price.  Love the storage tube they came in.</li>
            <li> There are lots of expensive and better brushes and brush sets out there. I&#x27;m giving it five starts because the value per price is exactly that - five stars. I hate when dense brushes (like the liner brush) have coarse hair. The ones in this set are dense (so you have better control) and yet still soft to the touch (so your lids don&#x27;t suffer). Very versatile - I won&#x27;t necessarily use every brush as directed/intended but can totally see using every one of them for my own purpose, the way I want to.</li>
            <li> Bought this set for my daughter and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Great quality!!! Great for starters and pros!</li>
            <li> Great eye brushes.  It&#x27;s all you need to make that perfect look.  Love this company and their products.  I have there face brushes and they are awesome.  My collection is now complete.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes, very well made. Great quality!</li>
            <li> I love my brushes! Worth the purchase! !!!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the purchase</li>
            <li> I love this Eye brush set! They work so much better than my Chanel brushes. They compliment the Kabuki set nicely!</li>
            <li> Love is soft and have variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> I have been slow in posting this review; as I have only used a couple of  the brushes thus far and I apologize to the seller; as they have sent me emails requesting that I please take the time to post my review.  Thus far the 2 brushes that I have used  - I have no complaints about them - they are gentle to my very hyper sensitive skin and seem to distribute the color smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Received these yesterday they fairly  quick, the package they came in is very plan !, Ladies these brushes are the&lt;br /&gt;bussiness, Very well made these brushs soft, I Love them for the price they are so worth the price and more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with these brushes.  They are very soft. They apply my eyeshadow very well over my oily aging lids.  I washed them and have not experienced any shedding. Considering their price they have preformed better than my Clinique brushes which cost way more. These brushes come with tips and are great for the beginner that doesn&#x27;t know the uses for each brush. The vendor actually emailed me thanking me for my purchase and to contact them with any concerns... which I like a lot. The package was delivered as promised.  I highly recommended them.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!, very nice set and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  Couldn&#x27;t be more happy!!</li>
            <li> I have received the eye brush set and I am very impressed with the product. I pulled them and no loose bristles. I am pleased!</li>
            <li> They sent me an email about it would have a smell but that it would go away in 2 days. It did and I washed it the next day and its great. great packaging and very soft. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love my brushes!  They&#x27;re exactly what I was looking for. Brushes are very soft. No shedding.  I&#x27;ve already washed them twice since I purchased them. They&#x27;re great brushes.  No need to spend hundreds for name brands when these do the job just fine.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really good quality for the price, and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase but I am SO happy I did. These are awesome brushes! No need to go to Sephora or Mac and spend any more. Buy them; you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with these because of the price point. I received them quickly and nicely packaged. The box of brushes look very cheap, until you take the brushes out and feel them. They&#x27;re amazing brushes from the price. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! They pick up the shadow well, as long as they are totally dry. I love them!</li>
            <li> I love these brush set! They&#x27;re amazing, soft, perfect for blending and build the product!</li>
            <li> I have ordered some different brush sets (looking for a good deal as my budget is very tight) and out of all of them, these are by far the best quality and value I have found! What I really needed are good eye makeup brushes that are soft and won&#x27;t irritate my crazy sensitive skin. I wanted enough that I could just grab another clean brush while changing colors or blending, without having to take time to clean brushes between use. I want to be able to use clean brushes every time without having to wash them each night because I only had a few. Well, I noticed there were not many eye-brush-only sets to be found and most were poor quality. Then I found this set which has a nice selection at a quality that can&#x27;t be beat, especially for the price. They look, feel and perform like top of the line brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, these do not smell, which is a huge issue for me, so right off the bat, I was relieved about that. Then I noticed how nice it was to have them securely separated in their box, instead of all loose in a cheap plastic bag and getting bent out of shape. Sure, the packaging is basic, but I don&#x27;t need fancy looking wrapping that I&#x27;m just going to toss. All I care about is that they arrived securely packaged and in perfect shape, which they did (frankly, I&#x27;d rather have the money go into the brushes and not for fancy fluff). I would have liked some sort of brush roll or something to store them in, but that&#x27;s hardly necessary and it might also keep the cost down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While looking for brushes to buy, I noticed many people asked if brushes in a set came labeled with their intended use. I did not see many that were, but these are clearly labeled on the wood handles, which is a nice touch. They are also very well made with none of the handles being loose or wonky; they handle beautifully; the ferrules are really well done and none of the brush hairs shed, even after being washed and test tugged. And speaking of the hairs...they&#x27;re wonderfully soft, densely packed, perfectly shaped and wash up well. In fact, these have now spoiled me and I don&#x27;t want to compromise and use the other eye brushes I have. I may just have to buy another set of these, but I hope Lamora comes out with more of these smaller type brushes. I really love the specific fiber they used and would like it used in other shapes. It&#x27;s tough to find great quality smaller brushes that I can afford and it&#x27;s so nice to be able to buy them as their own set without the larger face brushes. These are now the only eye brushes I would recommend, especially for the budget conscious. I never thought I&#x27;d be able to afford high quality makeup brushes until discovering Lamora. Now I need to save up to buy their other sets; I am hooked on Lamora!</li>
            <li> softer than I had anticipated. great set!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this brushes great brushes and so soft they look and feel like sigma brushes without the prize and they don&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> Fabulous brushes!! Great quality!!</li>
            <li> Great brush set, all the essentials you need for eyes, soft and useful, and very afforable</li>
            <li> love these brushes .... they are comparable to the Sigma brushes goes to show you  no need to spend an exorbitant amount on makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> At long last, I&#x27;ve finally found a set of brushes I love that I can afford -- Imagine that!  The synthetic brushes are soft to the touch but hold their shape as well as any I&#x27;ve used by MAC or Sephora. I also appreciate that each brush is labeled with its specific purpose (with more detail on the packaging), which creates a lot of opportunities for experimenting with new looks. 100% recommended!</li>
            <li> I love my brushes and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> I just got my brushes and they are awesome!!! Shipping was so fast! The brushes are so soft and perfect for eye makeup! They look amazing too!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised....use them everyday!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased the Lamora Kabuki brush set and have loved each brush. When washing there is no color transfer and very little if any brush shedding. I have several of the eye brushes already, but I do not have this set. I&#x27;m adding to my collection because these brushes are so similar to the Sigma and Morphe brushes with the less expensive price tag. I would recommend this brand of brushes to anyone who was in the market for new brushes on a limited budget. Go directly to Lamora website and once you register you will get I think 10% off your first purchase and the site automatically directs you to Amazon for purchasing. Plus the brush sets come in these cute little round brush case. I have zero CONS at this time</li>
            <li> Fantastic brushes!  I&#x27;ve replaced all my MAC brushes with Lamora Eye Brush set and their Kabuki Brush set.  The brushes are soft and they don&#x27;t shed.  I would definitely recommend Lamora&#x27;s Brush sets.</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful,  I have been using them about two weeks and there is a big difference over my prior brushes.  I enjoy doing my eye makeup and the brushes in this set are easy to use, help me place the shadows perfectly!  What I noticed right away is how nicely they are made, there is no shedding and I am kind of rough on my brushes.  Each brush is packed appropriately with the proper amount of bristles, and they hold their shape.  I have found my eye shadow is easier to do with these brushes - they work great with my products my favorite shadows are from Too Faced and Urban Decay Naked2 palette.  I have less waste as these brushes pack the color where I need it and do not drop it off the brush before I get it to my eyelids.  My favorites are the shaders - they come in three sizes, the smallest I use to pick up wet shadow to line under my eye which is kind of my trademark look.  The small shader works great, and creates the type line that I like.  I know there is a liner brush, but if you use the small shader it creates a softer line.  The blender brushes work very well as well.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes in nice packaging, but I don&#x27;t use it, I put them right into my makeup kit. I like the length of the brushes as well not too long and bulky.  They are great for working with an up close makeup mirror as your eyes age and need to work closer!!</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes in the mail today and they&#x27;re AMAZING. Ridiculously soft, all great sizes and shapes. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase! These remind me of Sigma brushes or some of the It Cosmetic brushes! Mine arrived in a black cardboard tube individually wrapped so they were all in perfect condition! If you need eye brushes purchase these because you won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
            <li> Fabulous all the product goes right where it has to go and it doesn&#x27;t stay on the brushes.</li>
            <li> These eye makeup brushes are a steal!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price or the quality of this set.  I am usually an avid Bare Minerals brush user but I find myself reaching for this set over those.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type that has been watching makeup tutorials for years and never thought I looked good with eyeshadow. The problem was my brushes! And these make the application beautiful every time! I really reccomend these.</li>
            <li> I have not used all of the brushes, but those I have used are really great.  Will find time to learn how to use the rest of them.  As I do not do full makeup every day, its more difficult to find a reason to spend the time learning.  But the brushes are really good, and I do like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;brushes are very nice, useful sizes, and I really enjoy them. Actually better than I expected, too.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wowzers! These are great! Snatch these up!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter who is interested in becoming a make up artist. I was very impressed with the quality of these brushes and feel that she will have them for many  years.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful really well made don&#x27;t shed and I have no problem picking up a ton of product I&#x27;ve found that I like most  them better than my  M.A.C. brushes</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Very good selection of brushes with regard to size and shape. Sturdy though not tough. No shedding of fibers. Wash easily.  Recommend without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price! Loving my results with them!</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes. I read a review regarding the packaging and I was a little concerned. I was pleasantly surprised to find my brushes indivually packed in plastic and in a storage tube. Very nice. I&#x27;m very happy with the brushes.  They are soft and well made. The price is cheap, but not the quality. The customer service is also great.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best set of brushes I own! I have been using them for almost a month and I can only say good things about them. Brushes are easy to handle and are leveled with their uses which makes it perfect for beginners. You can achieve any look using this set. The bristles are very very soft and pack make up to perfection. They are also very easy to wash and so far no shedding. This set is a great addition to my Lamora 10 pieces face brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! This was definitely one of my best deal of purchases here on Amazon!  These brushes are so soft and blend product so evenly.  I have been trying to build up my brush collection and I ordered it mainly because of the pencil brush.  Of course I ended up loving all of the brushes, but I like how the pencil brush is so soft in application however it still provides that precise application when I need it.  Very good find, so much so, that I ordered a second set for my sister!</li>
            <li> Love, that&#x27;s all I can say!!! These brushes are wonderful! Each brush is written on and tells you specially what it is for!!! I love that, and the price!! I would definitely buy these again!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are a big help in applying eye shadow wet or dry.  The wide assortment provides all the sizes anyone would need to apply any kind of powder.</li>
            <li> My two daughters and my girlfriend are absolutely delighted with the quality and soft and light feeling of all the brushes of the set. They are doing amazing jobs on their faces, specially on their eyelids. They look like pro brushes and they say they&#x27;ll recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality. I&#x27;ve bought brushes from Urban Decay and Lancôme, as well as more affordable brands like Real Technique, E.L.F., and Eco Tools. These brushes are definitely towards higher end quality and the price point is great. The bristles are as described and work nicely to grab shadows, and the stem length is comfortable. I would purchase again if needed.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in excellent condition exactly as described.  Good quality.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Firstly, IRT some of these reviews, who cares about the dang packaging! That has no bearing on the quality of the brushes.  Secondly, these brushes really are amazing! I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different eye looks and the fluffy brush is my absolute FAVORITE!!! This brush is a goto on pretty much every YouTube makeup tutorial I&#x27;ve watched. Hands down, the best brush in the kit IMO and the most useful. Overall, every single brush is soft and gentle on the skin. And there is absolutely NO WAY to beat the price vs quality comparison!  Definitely a must buy for any level of makeup user. These are dupes for some of the more expensive brushes Ive seen and used - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  Also, no chemical or smells detected upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Fabulous brushes!  Easy to use and arrived FAST!!  I have used others, and these by far are superior!!</li>
            <li> Perfect find.  Looked locally for an angled liner brush and found the perfect one here.</li>
            <li> My first time trying them and i absolutely enjoyed them! They came right on time. The bristles are sturdy with easy application for the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how in love I am with these brushes. They&#x27;re soft, apply makeup in a breeze, and the only brushes I&#x27;ll ever need to buy (sorry MAC and Sigma). Little to no shedding and wonderful packaging makes these brushes a must-have whether you&#x27;re a seasoned makeup artist or just starting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles don&#x27;t feel stiff and brittle, like some of the higher end brushes feel. And as I said before, makeup application is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely suggest going to lamorabeauty.com, and signing up for their VIP Discount program. Even at $18.75 (price of the brushes today), I got them for free! I was so excited, I bought Lamora&#x27;s 10-piece brush set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not kidding when I say these are the best brushes I have ever used, and the only brushes I will ever truly need!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good these are. I ordered them because I really just needed another fluffy shader, and maybe another pencil brush, just as backups, and this whole set is cheaper than two from Sigma or MAC. These are BETTER than Sigma and MAC! I&#x27;m stunned. I&#x27;m so, so glad I took a chance and ordered a brand I didn&#x27;t recognize, because these are amazing. I actually like my fluffy brush from this set better than my Sigma. I also loved these so much I ordered the big Kabuki set that comes in the travel case - just got those today, and am again amazed by the quality and softness. I don&#x27;t know if the prices are going to increase on these, but TRUST ME - GET THEM NOW before they do!</li>
            <li> Yes,  recommend these affordable brushes.  Completely happy with them.</li>
            <li> Great quality and value!!</li>
            <li> Super excited about these vegan cruelty-free brushes. Brushes are very soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristles falling out after washing and using. Comparable to high-priced brushes in quality and durability.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this brush set, it was a good bought. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very good brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes superb price...you won&#x27;t regret getting them!!!</li>
            <li> the brushes did not looked as compact and luscious as it does in the pictures. when i tried using the blending brush, I got a hard time blending with it. the thickness of the brushes from ELF are better in comparison.</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful. The quality is wonderful and the set has everything I need. They couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time. I recently had pink eye and had to replace everything.</li>
            <li> Gift for my niece.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> Not bad brushes for the price - perfectly serviceable, wash well and haven&#x27;t had fallout issues. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed (&amp; this will apply to all synthetic brushes) is that they dont pick up eyeshadow as well as natural fibre brushes esp. when packing on the lid. They&#x27;re fine for blending and detailing.</li>
            <li> love these brushes. the variety of brushes is great because i only have to use these to do my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Purchased this set a few weeks ago and I absolutely love them. They are soft and work great! Definitely recommend them!!</li>
            <li> Received these brushes and they are great they are really soft and well put together would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!! They glide easily on your eyelid and apply the makeup wonderfully. I love them!!</li>
            <li> It is soft and comfortable! Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this set of brushes !</li>
            <li> Softest brushes ever!!!!  Blends beautifully and effortlessly</li>
            <li> Great brushes my wife loves them</li>
            <li> Awesome Quality!  I was surprised how inexpensive these professional makeup brushes turned out to be.  There are a perfect brush for each application, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat reserved about the quality of these brushes when I ordered them...BUT they are really really nice brushes!  I love the tapered blending brush the best.  It is actually much softer than my Sigma blending brush and it does a better job blending on my very sensitive eyes.  FIVE STARS for a good set of brushes!</li>
            <li> I am more interested in quality than quantity, so the items that I use that are subjected to &amp;#34;daily wear and tear&amp;#34; must &amp;#34;stand the test of time&amp;#34;. I am not a make-up artist, but I like durable, soft, dense, and shed-free brushes and these &amp;#34;fit the bill&amp;#34;. I own Sigma, Sephora, mac, mineral fusion and other more expensive brushes, but I must say that I am very pleased with my Lamora brushes. They are comparable and significantly less expensive than the other brushes that I own and if you are about quality, I would recommend Lamora.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of brushes as a gift (she loved them!), and i also own 2 of the 10 piece face sets. These brushes are great quality, very soft, blend seamlessly, and I have experienced no shedding. I only wish that it came with a cute carrying case, or bag like the 10 piece set does.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! And it is nice too that they are very reasonably priced. They are as nice as any expensive brush I&#x27;ve seen. I read a lot of reviews to help make my decision and believe I made the best choice for me. I am an artist, so having the right tools for the job is very important. The brushes that need to be soft are soft; others that need to be stiffer are stiffer. A few reviews that I read stated that some brushes were too soft and did not pick up enough product. If this is true, I don&#x27;t believe it is the brush. I would suggest looking at the product. Some eye shadows have more pigment than others.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and helps me blend (just getting into it last year)! The shipping was fast! This brush set should be a staple  in anyone&#x27;s makeup tools, especially if you are a beginner. I have a ton of brushes from M.A.C. and Sigma and Lamora brushes hold up just as well if not better! Love them!!!</li>
            <li> The best buy on brushes anywhere! Has a stand up case for easy grabbing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful set! Decent pricing</li>
            <li> Brushes seem to be made well. So far I have washed them and used them for a few days. I have already stained the tips with pigment powders but they blend and apply eye color really well.</li>
            <li> High quality brushed at an affordable price.  They also come in an attractive round case.  I bought one for myself and another as a gift for my niece.&lt;br /&gt;Received a discount for buying two.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these brushes. The tips are perfect for application and blending and the handle is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice set of brushes for the price. They are a good length, and they have a nice weight. The bristles are comfortable. They grab pigment easily and deposit it where it needs to go. I love the classic shader, the angled shader, and the blending brush! I use those daily.&lt;br /&gt; My only critique is that I would prefer the angles detailer to be a little thinner for lining upper lashes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are far better than I expected for the price. I have experienced no shedding at all, and they hold/blend powder well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. Not only are they extremely soft, they are also well-made and seem to be high quality (especially for the price). The hairs don&#x27;t fall out and they pick up eyeshadow pigment PERFECTLY. Application is smooth and flawless. I would definitely recommend, especially if you don&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg on makeup brushes. I love this brand!!</li>
            <li> They are soft and easy to use. Excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice Product! Worth the price</li>
            <li> I have had these for a couple of weeks now and have used them several times. I LOVE them and have worked wonderfully so far. The only thing I haven&#x27;t done yet is clean them (they&#x27;ve only been used 3x) so I&#x27;m hoping that doesn&#x27;t have a negative impact on their amazingness! (I also purchased the face set &amp; they&#x27;re also amazing.)</li>
            <li> Great brushes! Very soft and hold color well.</li>
            <li> These are REALLY great. U reach for them everyday.</li>
            <li> Great set. Seems like good quality. The angled shader brush is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely MINDBLOWN. I have a set of IT Cosmetics&#x27; traveling eye brush set, but these brushes definitely blew it out of the water. While both sets are definitely soft--which says A LOT about the quality of these brushes from lamora--I find these brushes to do a better job at getting the job done with countless eye looks.  The blending brush from this set does an even better job as well-it&#x27;s my most favorite brush from this set.  It&#x27;s so fluffy soft, that I can just massage my eyes without makeup!  Other than that though, it really doesn&#x27;t splay out, so that blending is effortless.  I&#x27;m definitely glad that I got this set, because I&#x27;m usually leery of really good deals for brushes.  This set totally doesn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes! They are soft and sturdy. Every brush works beautifully and feels high quality but the blending brush in this set is my favorite.  These may be the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  What an excellent product for the price!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for cream/liquid products! I like using it to apply cream contour so I can get precise placement.Def worth the price</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are awesome!! They make is easy to apply makeup to look more professional.</li>
            <li> The set of eye brushes is the same (great) quality as the Kabuki Brush Set. The brushes are easy to use and clear information on which brush to use for the desired look is provided and very helpful. I&#x27;m considering to place an order for more to send as gifts.</li>
            <li> The brushes are of high quality and easy to use. It would be better if the brushes came with a small case.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of them. Picks up the right amount of makeup and they do a fantastic job! I&#x27;m so very happy with the brushes. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> They are really soft and nice. So far I&#x27;m loving them. I&#x27;m very glad the box came with a description of what brush works best for what. Maybe you could include a small Lamanated card to keep with the same descriptions?that would rock</li>
            <li> I love them ! Especially how it blends eyeshadows to the crease omg looooove :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best . I have sigma brushes. &amp; I just have to say that  i like more the Lamora Brushes!! Some people say they smell bad. Mines have the smell of new.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly great quality!  I&#x27;d had my last very expensive brush set for well over a decade and was reluctant to not buy the same, but gave these a try and I LOVE them!  Would definitely recommend them to anyone wanting a little luxury at a great price.</li>
            <li> Just got them, and they&#x27;re super soft. I love that they&#x27;re labeled with names instead of numbers. Can&#x27;t wait to use them and update my review!  UPDATE: They work amazingly, super soft and apply eyeshadow evenly and smoothly. No fallout and blends really good</li>
            <li> Feedback on Eye Brush Set: These are great eye brushes and holds the eye shadows very good. Great quality and very soft. I am not a make-up artist, but I like durable, soft, dense, and shed-free brushes and these are perfect. Great Price, too and I feel they are comparable to the other high cost brush sets.  I would recommend Lamora Eye Brush Set.  Feedback on the Seller: The items arrived on a very timely manner as it was stated on my order and the items were as described by the seller. I am really pleased with costumer service and I will definitely purchase from this seller again</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. I though they were going to be low quality. Good quality for the price they work just fine. Shipping was fast. I received mine in 3 days.</li>
            <li> Received the brushes in a timely manner.  Love the quality of these brushes.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Yes these brushes are worth it. I&#x27;ve uploaded a Youtube video on it. THIS IS NOT Sponsored video. This is just my humble opinion on these brushes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;rPZqaJwyi48</li>
            <li> these are great. I love the blending and pencil brush a lot</li>
            <li> Love  these  brushes  has  every  brush  you  need  for  your  eyes  these  are  going  to  be  my  new  favorites  very  good  quality  I  will  be  buying  more  from  this  brand  my  favorite  brushes  for  eyes</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for a young lady just getting into makeup.  She was thrilled.  They appear to be of good quality and she is having a lot of fun learning how to use them.  It is especially helpful that they are labeled and the box came with some information on how to use each one.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Great set for the price. Blends so nicely- one great way that you can test a good brush is that if it does not collapse when pressed down upon on the tip- and I was shocked that all of them passed this test. I&#x27;m so happy to say these were a GREAT find for eye brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great! Not bad for $20 at all.</li>
            <li> I love it very much. This eye brush set has high quality and the brush part is soft.  Its very easy to put eye shadow on my eye lids. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Im super impressed with these brushes. Dense and soft. They pick up and deposit color pretty well. They had a bit of a strong smell that took two washes to get rid of, but overall pretty happy with them.</li>
            <li> I just got these brushes today and am so impressed!  I figured they would be good based on the great reviews, but they are fantastic!  They are incredibly soft, pick up eyeshadow well, and blend like a dream!  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with them.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price. Cleaned well</li>
            <li> Good brushes need to learn how to use</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed with these brushes,  especially the crease brush.  It blended colors beautifully from several different palettes, both high end and lower end,  with almost no fall out.  The angled brush was perfect with gel liner and made it very easy to get that perfect cat eye look with no crooked lines. I&#x27;ve used Sigma brushes for a long time,  but they are finally giving out and after a lot of research and hours of reading reviews I decided to try these.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The only thing I wish was included was a more fluffy brush for softening edges a bit.  These brushes all have fairly dense bristles. Very good quality and feel good in the hand. They are a good weight and easy to control for detailing.  Definitely not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; feeling at all,  although the box they come in makes them look like they will be poor quality. When I saw the box I thought I was stuck with inferior brushes,  so I&#x27;m so glad I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Brushes work very well for me being a non professional. Great price!</li>
            <li> Love this set. Most eye sets come with brushes that I&#x27;ll never use. But none of the brushes in this set will go to waste. And I&#x27;m happy with the less than impressive packaging if it keeps the prices low. Love the pencil brush; blending brush is soft; shaders have bristles firm enough to pick up the product and lay it down nicely. All around fantastic set.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes! Good quality and getting the &amp;#34;smokey eye&amp;#34; effect was so much easier with these brushes. Application was very smooth!</li>
            <li> Excellent and I don&#x27;t use that word loosely ........it came in a very nice brush carry round box.  The brush seems strong and well made.  I would recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much that I bought two! Great eye make up brushes!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!  I own a ton of brushes from really high end to drug store variety and I can attest that these perform as well as the more expensive ones I have.  Well made, sturdy and good weight.  No shedding after a week of use.  No shedding after the first wash.  Will definitely buy more from seller.  Seller keeps in contact with you to make sure everything meets your expectations.  Solid seller and solid product.  I totally recommend for all makeup junkies!  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m posting a picture of my Sigma brushes side by side with these Lamora brushes- they are almost identical, down to the thickness, application of products, softness of the bristles, and lack if shedding. THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IS I PAID $96.00 MORE FOR THE SIGMA BRUSHES!  Save your money and buy these little gems</li>
            <li> Well made, very good price.  Delivered on time.  Would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I am not that great at putting on make-up, so I got this kit to start me off.  It&#x27;s pretty good quality.  I&#x27;ve used a few of the brushes and they are sturdy and smooth.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice. The bristles remind me of my IT Cosmetics brushes. The ferrules are securely attached to the handle. I have not had any shedding upon washing and use. There is a very nice variety of brushes as well. I have small eyes so I especially appreciate the small detail shader and the pencil brush. This is the first pencil brush that actually works for me. All others I own are just way to big. I wish I had found these before buying many other brushes of other brands! I really love this set and was amazed at the price.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet, but I can&#x27;t imagine that the others won&#x27;t be just as nice.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes, soft and sturdy. They don&#x27;t come with a case though.</li>
            <li> My daughter almost passed out when these brushes arrived. She loves them!</li>
            <li> I love this product! The packaging is standard. The synthetic brushes are good quality and the price can&#x27;t be beat! I would recommend this product to anyone with a makeup hobby or if you&#x27;re just looking for some good brushes.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes and they clean up easily! Great value for money!!!</li>
            <li> I just starting using these brushes as a youtube blogger recommended them. I love the blending brush! you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;m getting these for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are absolutely awesome!  The quality is comparable to MAC or Sigma brushes, at a fraction of the price.  The bristles are tightly packed into the handles, and there was virtually no shedding at all, during unpacking, using, or washing.  The brushes pick up just the right amount of pigment, and are soft on my skin.  The brushes are comfortable to hold, and they blend makeup beautifully.  I purchased this set along with the kabuki brush set, and I think I have every brush I could possible need.  No complaints here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the off chance that you have an issue with your purchase, Lamora customer service is PHENOMENAL!  I exchanged multiple emails with one of their customer service reps, and she was prompt and answered every question completely.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Lamora products and the customer service. Stellar all around!!!</li>
            <li> the brushes are okay for being so inexpensive. They are very soft. The brow brush should be stiffer and the littlest brush is best for concealer. The rest I use for blending. My order was missing a brush and I contacted lamora directly and got an immediate response. They shipped the missing brush right out for me without question. Much better than Amazons customer service (which is actually terrible)&lt;br /&gt;The box the brushes came in says if you leave a review on Amazon then you will &amp;#34;recieve free products like this eye brush set.&amp;#34; If they are true to their word I will definitely continue to purchase their products. Customer service goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love them. Quick Shipping</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes I would buy them again in a hot second</li>
            <li> Nice brush set.  Applies beautifully.  Great for the price!</li>
            <li> Great feel to the brushes and the different sizes are great for shadowing and creating different looks. Good value.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of brushes, but I&#x27;m still not convinced what makes these any better than less expensive ones. I have  set that costs half of what I paid for these, and they work identically. (Also, be forewarned: The vendor who sells these on Amazon sent me 5 (!) emails to remind me to leave a review for its product, which feels like borderline harassment.)</li>
            <li> They came very quickly and are of excellent quality!</li>
            <li> Wonderful deal! Good brushes as they have not shedded. Really like the assortment.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for the price, and delivered very quickly. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, brushes too small to apply makeup in a meaningful way. Gave the products to my 10 yr. - Very disappointing!!!</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised!  Great quality  brushes  and a great price!</li>
            <li> Love this product and received it exactly when I was told that it would arrive!</li>
            <li> I own a lot of different brands of makeup brushes such as Sephora, Sigma, Mac &amp; some lower end drug store brands. These Lamora brushes,  in my opinion,  are actually really good.  They are worth the price for sure! The only negatives I found were the ferrules (the metal part of the brush) look cheap and there is a sizeable gap where the handle fits into the ferrule and the box they come in looks cheap.  The hairs are soft but dense, pick up and distribute product adequately. I feel like the smaller brushes are all very similar but still good quality.  If you&#x27;re looking to add an eye makeup brush set to your collection,  or a starter or travel brush set I would definatly recommend these. Ive washed them 3 times using my sigma brush mat &amp; the has been no fallout.</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes last week.  Being new to the whole makeup thing I figured getting this would be a great set for my eyes because of the pice and the great reviews it has. It turns out that I was right and all the other great reviews don&#x27;t lie! This set of brushes is fantastic, especially for beginners!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this eye brushes set,  Amazing for the price  !!!</li>
            <li> I ordered and received these brushes on the same day (ordered at 7am on August 5, 2015 and received around 4:30pm). Love that!!!  These brushes are amazing! Definitely comparable to higher end brushes I&#x27;ve had.  Definitely wash them well, they smell a bit like chemicals but they apply makeup flawlessly. No hair loss. Really soft.  They even threw in a free brush just for ordering :)</li>
            <li> Great brushes for a good price!</li>
            <li> The brushes are of good quality and work well for eye shadow.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great,  I like the soft feel,  and they are easy to clean. I am a satisfyied  customer.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this versatile brush set. Comes in a convenient sturdy case.</li>
            <li> These are some of my favorite brushes - and I have a TON of brushes! These are soft and work great. I find myself reaching for these over my more expensive brushes most days. LOVE them!  This is my third set. The first set was for me, then I got a set for my sister in law last Christmas, and now I am using this set for traveling. I love these!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! So glad I picked them up.</li>
            <li> Love them, I am fairly new to the use of professional grade make up and brushes, but trying these brushes made me a believer in quality. These brushes are good quality at a decent price. They are soft inn the delicate eye area, but get the job done!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very nice and a great price.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended I buy a very pricey set of eye brushes. Instead, I found these on sale on Amazon and decided to give them a try because of the awesome price.  I&#x27;m in love with them!  The blending brush is particularly great but I use them all.  I&#x27;ve already recommended them to my girlfriends who are really into makeup.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect. The bristles don&#x27;t shed, they&#x27;re soft, and oh my gosh do they blend and pack on color! I&#x27;ve been using these pretty much non stop while playing with new makeup I received for Christmas (these were also a gift!) and I&#x27;m thrilled. I&#x27;ll probably be stocking up on more very soon.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying these brushes.  They are easy to use and are also comfortable to handle.  Had to split them with my best friend as she liked the texture so much....what could I say!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have the foundation brush as well now need to have a blush and finishing brush</li>
            <li> I purchased my set and it arrived so quickly. I was really pleasantly surprised. When I opened the package I was so pleased to see how well made the brushes are and the handles are steady with perfectly soft bristils.. They blend beautifully and smoothly. Im looking to purchase the face brushes next. Pleased completely and Lamora Beauty is my new go to products.... I recommend them to everyone...😊</li>
            <li> Loved these brushes so much I bought the same ones for my teenage sister</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Impressed by how well brushes are made and, especially, the fact that no animal product is used.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great value.</li>
            <li> The brushes are well designed and the quality vs the price its Ok. The packaging need to be improve in order to protect during the travel the ends but fortunately they return to the original shape. i Will continue to use for my  final opinion.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes to create the perfect eyes!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They are not only soft but they don&#x27;t shed!! I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> This is such a great eye brush set. Super soft &amp; actually makes applying my eye makeup easier! I like be that each brush says its name on the side &amp; on the back of the box it lets you know how to use each brush! I am very pleased with my order. Bonus: super fast shipping &amp; such great service! You will receive emails asking how you like the the brushes. They are great at keeping in touch &amp; responding with help. Will order again &amp; recommend to a friend! Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect, i loved this brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice brush set!!! And the price is excellent for what you get!!</li>
            <li> These Are Fantastic!  My makeup goes on much smoother and blends nicely!  Thank you</li>
            <li> I do my makeup on a daily basis. I needed new eye brushes and these were an amazing price. The brushes are soft but not too soft that they don&#x27;t apply the eyeshadow properly. They wash up nicely and do not shed. Definitely would recommend these brushes to anyone in need of a good variety in eye brushes.</li>
            <li> Lamora makes fantastic makeup brushes! I bought the coastal scents set as my first brush set (fantastic set too) and have had Several high end brushes since then and Lamora is by far my favorite. I have the face brushes too. I am so happy with this set!</li>
            <li> The blending brushes work really well while the regular shadow brushes are kind of stiff to the point that it&#x27;s hard for them to pick up eye shadow. I&#x27;m not in love with these brushes as much as I thought I would be. Kind of bummed. I&#x27;m not in hate with them either. I&#x27;m just kinda. Meh.</li>
            <li> Fabulous brushes for a very inexpensive price ! I finally have the eye brushes I wanted. Great purchase !</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for - the right number of brushes in the right shapes for numerous eye styles.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I would get the brushes that I wanted in this set. I knew exactly what shapes I wanted and so far, with every purchase, I had been disappointed. Not with this set! I love it. I cut my application time in half as they work perfectly. Not nearly as difficult to get the look I want. Going to buy some more so that I don&#x27;t have to clean the brushes so often.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.....I didn&#x27;t expect much because I had never heard about this brand before. All my brushes are sigma but I decided to give this a try...I love love love this set, I wish they had a bigger brush selection because its an excellent brand!</li>
            <li> I received the eye brushes very quick. They are great quality and I love them.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes, sent fast. Eyelids happy.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome. They are very soft &amp; so far I havent had any fallout while applying my eyeshadow. The price is great for the quality. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes. I use them all the time. They work very well. I would recommend them to a friend.</li>
            <li> I was looking for eye makeup brushes to do a smokyeye look. These brushes can be used for multitasking like highlighting on high cheekbones, top of your lip, inner corner of the eye etc..I was able to find a purpose for each brush in the set. Very good quality brushes. This set is a great addition to my makeup routine. I love them!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
