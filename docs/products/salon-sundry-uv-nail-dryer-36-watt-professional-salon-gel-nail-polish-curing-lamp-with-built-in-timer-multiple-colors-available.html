            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>But  it still works great.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>

            <li>had a blown fuse when received, after replacing it works great</li>
            <li>and it is a great price.</li>
            <li>very nice lamp.</li>
            <li>Turned out nice!</li>
            <li>If your looking for an upscale light it may not be your best bet.</li>
            <li>My wife loved it.</li>
            <li>and my light still works great!</li>
            <li>And can&#x27;t beat the price for as good as it is.</li>
            <li>Must be fairly durable, as there was no packing material or padding in the shupping container, and the bulbs all work</li>
            <li>So I bought this knowing that without the fan it would do its job just as good.</li>
            <li>but it works out just as good.</li>
            <li>is good for the price</li>
            <li>It also works great for my daughters and wife when they do their nails :)</li>

            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>This nail dryer is huge and works great.</li>
            <li>I use this nail dryer every 2-3 weeks to do my own gel nails.</li>
            <li>I own this</li>
            <li>Everything was in perfect shape and ready to use.</li>
            <li>I love doing my own nails</li>
            <li>That very good and price is ok that  work good make the nails dry and good for the gel nails</li>
            <li>Best light for the price if you fix phones haha.</li>
            <li>Shipping was great and the product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>It works but it is very cheap.</li>
            <li>This one seems to work for my daughter and myself and we are both satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came with all the lights in side and working, both the inside and out side were in great condition and working straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>Was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Making sure you take care of your customers</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>it is really good price, worth it.</li>
            <li>But I thought okay it might have happened during the shipping, oh well.</li>
            <li>I recommend going into your favorite nail salon and asking them if they have any dryers for sale - some will sell theirs to you.</li>
            <li>Cute, affordable, compact, lightweight, serves the purpose for now.</li>
            <li>2 min then apply gel top coat</li>
            <li>Also, You can fit the Samsung Note 3 in it!</li>
            <li>Works great and cures gel polishes fast üëç</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>and it was much better quality</li>
            <li>But they need to package it better when I got mine</li>
            <li>And I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that you can take out the bottom.</li>
            <li>This is a great UV nail dryer and at a great price , i purchased one at a beauty supply for 3 times the cost , found this one online and immediately returned the other..</li>
            <li>Ok so I bought this light to do my nails at home</li>
            <li>It works great as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I love that I can set the light to turn off automatically at either 2 or 3 minutes or choose to leave it on indefinitely.</li>
            <li>Works really good and is really convenient.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and not too bulky .  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m thankful that this dries the nails so quickly!</li>
            <li>The bulbs wouldn&#x27;t fit in the sockets, and though there was power going in to the unit (I know because the fuse sparked inside it), it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Turned out pretty good for my first time.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied, my nails were dried quick and looked great at the end.</li>
            <li>Does one full hand at a time easily.  </li>
            <li>She text me on my cell phone to tell me that the Salon Sundry is stellar!!</li>
            <li>I love love love that I can do my nails at home now &amp; have the same manicure that I would get at a salon for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>After it is done soak a cotton ball with alcohol and clean off nail to remove any sticky residue.</li>
            <li>i got this for my mother because she loves to do her nails and this was great for her to dry her nails quickly</li>
            <li>To me it gets just as warm as the professional grade UV lamps.  </li>
            <li>i got this lamp very short time and have good quality.love</li>
            <li>This light is powerful &amp; cures my nails in no time.</li>
            <li>Other than the timer it works great</li>
            <li>It shipped really quickly .</li>
            <li>Shipped And arrivEd Quickly</li>
            <li>Luckily my hand wasn&#x27;t in there.</li>
            <li>She used it tonight and her nails dried beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I love my new salon lamp.</li>
            <li>Paid for itself after first use!</li>
            <li>and I used it for a few months and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Worth the price plus some.</li>
            <li>Worth the time and investment though.</li>
            <li>so I like it and its useful.</li>
            <li>so why buy a larger one unless you own a salon?  </li>
            <li>Ours worked right out of the box, no issues in cleanliness or functionality.  </li>
            <li>This is the right size and the right price.  </li>
            <li>The lights seem to be new and working on my nails fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very professional and will save me a lot of money because now I can do my own nails and dry them quickly!</li>
            <li>Price was very reasonable</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I just cured my first set of gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li>you can put close to the light and direct the air inside it</li>
            <li>needs is what matters, thanks alot!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not what I was expecting at all.</li>
            <li>Shipped ready for use!</li>
            <li>Feels like its to hot in one spot.</li>
            <li>it has a big crack on the top.</li>
            <li>But the lights were a bit hot until when it turns off there</li>
            <li>, so it gets Very Hot after a few layers of polish and it is also very easy to accidentally burn your hand on the lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i got this lamp and one bulb was working the other bulb didnt even fit in the maschine its really a cheap s</li>
            <li>When I first got it I was very upset because it didn&#x27;t work at all,  after talking to them</li>
            <li>It is okay, it takes longer for nails to dry than I think it should.</li>
            <li>you keep your and very still and have a little fan of your own</li>
            <li>Works great but a little on the big side.</li>
            <li>First off, I open it to see a crack right on the bottom of the dryer!</li>
            <li>I ordered this UV light for my personal home use.  </li>
            <li>The customer service department was very prompt with responding to my concerns and will be sending me a replacement.  </li>
            <li>It even came with extra light bulbs .  </li>
            <li>Even comes with 4 extra light balbs</li>
            <li>(very close clearance though)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very disrespectful.</li>
            <li>My entire phone can fit in here at once to cure the LOCA glue.</li>
            <li>For traditional purposes, you can fit all your fingers in here at once with no need to scrunch or distort them.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping /</li>
            <li>and I have to say I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Bulb burns out fast.</li>
            <li>Instead this product is delivered in a generic brown cardboard box which tips you off right away that there is something not quite right with this product.</li>
            <li>The other one works ok.</li>
            <li>Love this light only thing is sometimes it burns my nails a little.</li>
            <li>but this particular one had a defect.  </li>
            <li>My only advice is to use UV gel nail products so you&#x27;ll have the quick results you&#x27;re expecting.  </li>
            <li>Saw this product at a decent price</li>
            <li>it is not professional product, the reflexive film is gleamless, therefore I think it¬¥s not so effective as it should be, and you have to dry your nails a little bit longer, but It does it job, and for that price its really OK.</li>
            <li>Although I would like to give it a full 5 stars it just wasn&#x27;t like &#x27;fast cooling&#x27; as I had expected.</li>
            <li>The unit leaves enough room to fit my entire hand as well.</li>
            <li>This is the only gel lamp I&#x27;ve tried and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>so far too:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They look professionally done.</li>
            <li>And then I left it on for over 10 minutes straight while I was talking talking on the phone</li>
            <li>The built in timer is just right for curing this glue and it takes up minimal space!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why a few people are complaining that it doesn&#x27;t work, maybe not following the right procedure.</li>
            <li>Ultimately I bought a new one because it does work</li>
            <li>That is the only way to explain the spots of hardened clear mass on places on this product as well as the tray being glued shut too!</li>
            <li>Super cool color and not the average white one you usually see.</li>
            <li>Too bad the price was great.</li>
            <li>Nearly a year later</li>
            <li>I mean the kind of streaking that you get when you let your teenager clean the windows, except worse!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, sleek little unit that I use in my lab for photobleaching frozen  tissue sections - the wattage is right, and I can put multiple slides on the tray instead of having to awkwardly reach into it.  </li>
            <li>I actually originally got her a larger more professional nail dryer, and she hated it.  </li>

            <li> After it is done soak a cotton ball with alcohol and clean off nail to remove any sticky residue.</li>
            <li> i got this for my mother because she loves to do her nails and this was great for her to dry her nails quickly</li>
            <li> To me it gets just as warm as the professional grade UV lamps.  </li>
            <li> i got this lamp very short time and have good quality.love</li>
            <li> This light is powerful &amp; cures my nails in no time.</li>
            <li> Other than the timer it works great</li>
            <li> It shipped really quickly .</li>
            <li> Shipped And arrivEd Quickly</li>
            <li> Luckily my hand wasn&#x27;t in there.</li>
            <li> She used it tonight and her nails dried beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I love my new salon lamp.</li>
            <li> Paid for itself after first use!</li>
            <li> and I used it for a few months and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Worth the price plus some.</li>
            <li> Worth the time and investment though.</li>
            <li> so I like it and its useful.</li>
            <li> so why buy a larger one unless you own a salon?  </li>
            <li> Ours worked right out of the box, no issues in cleanliness or functionality.  </li>
            <li> This is the right size and the right price.  </li>
            <li> The lights seem to be new and working on my nails fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very professional and will save me a lot of money because now I can do my own nails and dry them quickly!</li>
            <li> Price was very reasonable</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I just cured my first set of gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li> you can put close to the light and direct the air inside it</li>
            <li> needs is what matters, thanks alot!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not what I was expecting at all.</li>
            <li> Shipped ready for use!</li>
            <li> Feels like its to hot in one spot.</li>
            <li> it has a big crack on the top.</li>
            <li> But the lights were a bit hot until when it turns off there</li>
            <li> , so it gets Very Hot after a few layers of polish and it is also very easy to accidentally burn your hand on the lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i got this lamp and one bulb was working the other bulb didnt even fit in the maschine its really a cheap s</li>
            <li> When I first got it I was very upset because it didn&#x27;t work at all,  after talking to them</li>
            <li> It is okay, it takes longer for nails to dry than I think it should.</li>
            <li> you keep your and very still and have a little fan of your own</li>
            <li> Works great but a little on the big side.</li>
            <li> First off, I open it to see a crack right on the bottom of the dryer!</li>
            <li> I ordered this UV light for my personal home use.  </li>
            <li> The customer service department was very prompt with responding to my concerns and will be sending me a replacement.  </li>
            <li> It even came with extra light bulbs .  </li>
            <li> Even comes with 4 extra light balbs</li>
            <li> (very close clearance though)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disrespectful.</li>
            <li> My entire phone can fit in here at once to cure the LOCA glue.</li>
            <li> For traditional purposes, you can fit all your fingers in here at once with no need to scrunch or distort them.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping /</li>
            <li> and I have to say I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Bulb burns out fast.</li>
            <li> Instead this product is delivered in a generic brown cardboard box which tips you off right away that there is something not quite right with this product.</li>
            <li> The other one works ok.</li>
            <li> Love this light only thing is sometimes it burns my nails a little.</li>
            <li> but this particular one had a defect.  </li>
            <li> My only advice is to use UV gel nail products so you&#x27;ll have the quick results you&#x27;re expecting.  </li>
            <li> Saw this product at a decent price</li>
            <li> it is not professional product, the reflexive film is gleamless, therefore I think it¬¥s not so effective as it should be, and you have to dry your nails a little bit longer, but It does it job, and for that price its really OK.</li>
            <li> Although I would like to give it a full 5 stars it just wasn&#x27;t like &#x27;fast cooling&#x27; as I had expected.</li>
            <li> The unit leaves enough room to fit my entire hand as well.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel lamp I&#x27;ve tried and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> so far too:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They look professionally done.</li>
            <li> And then I left it on for over 10 minutes straight while I was talking talking on the phone</li>
            <li> The built in timer is just right for curing this glue and it takes up minimal space!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why a few people are complaining that it doesn&#x27;t work, maybe not following the right procedure.</li>
            <li> Ultimately I bought a new one because it does work</li>
            <li> That is the only way to explain the spots of hardened clear mass on places on this product as well as the tray being glued shut too!</li>
            <li> Super cool color and not the average white one you usually see.</li>
            <li> Too bad the price was great.</li>
            <li> Nearly a year later</li>
            <li> I mean the kind of streaking that you get when you let your teenager clean the windows, except worse!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, sleek little unit that I use in my lab for photobleaching frozen  tissue sections - the wattage is right, and I can put multiple slides on the tray instead of having to awkwardly reach into it.  </li>
            <li> I actually originally got her a larger more professional nail dryer, and she hated it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> , I have only used it a few times so far</li>
            <li> Guessing i just took a chance because of the price was great but turns out it was a waste.... :(</li>
            <li> (I know I am clumsy and very unlucky).</li>
            <li> Expected to receive four extra lamp bulbs.</li>
            <li> My clients don&#x27;t like to sit too long after they have their nails done</li>
            <li> I think it was the bulbs that overheated so beware not to leave it on for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> It is obvious to me that this product has or was previously being used for the same purpose for which I purchased it: to repair glass screen using the UV/LOCA Glue.</li>
            <li> A Long, Long Time!</li>
            <li> The larger one would do two at a time, but from what I understand, you don&#x27;t have enough time to apply a coat to all 10 fingers and get them under the lamps before you mess it up...</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that the metal lining it is cheap and flimsy, but actually it&#x27;s not that bad, as you can push it back into shape.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might have a fan or something in it for a nail dry option.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry the polish the way I thought it would.</li>
            <li> However, it is not &#x27;new&#x27; as advertised or as I believe it to be.</li>
            <li> The bulbs came loose in the packaging with empty bulb boxes.  </li>
            <li> I wanted it to be a little smaller.</li>
            <li> Even though I read to Many bad reviews I gave a try</li>
            <li> Instead, I received four empty lamb bulb boxes.</li>
            <li> but when I received it and opened the box I had four empty boxes of 9 watt UV bulbs inside.</li>
            <li> One of the bulb sockets was not attached to the lamp properly with missing hardware.  </li>
            <li> Probably my fault for not reading carefully,  but for some reason I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to cure the gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> So while I am not necessarily happy with feeling as if I received a product that did not have clear advertising, I am stuck with a product that has very expensive light bulbs which I believe are burning the last hours of life out of them now.</li>
            <li> I hope I am wrong, but from the look of the product and the other signs, I know I am right.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical the machine wouldn&#x27;t get the job done</li>
            <li> never have had a problem with other</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed was very excited waiting for my uv lamp</li>
            <li> only bad things about it is that unlike some of the higher end</li>
            <li> She uses a UV gel base and top coat but</li>
            <li> Now she takes less time to do her nails.</li>
            <li> Then a couple of days later I notice that after being outside of the box the product has begun to look dull and dusty, and then I notice streaks all over the product.</li>
            <li> Came with lights installed and the six little boxes they came in.</li>
            <li> but i do have to wait  a little longer</li>
            <li> There was a little rubber foot missing.  </li>
            <li> When you place it on &amp;#34;continuous&amp;#34; its still shuts off after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 and both worked for couple of days then they both stopped one after the other, poorly made.</li>
            <li> It looks as if it is made out of recycled plastic,  which is why it has a dull appearance.</li>
            <li> However, they sent an immediate refund when I complained.</li>
            <li> cures the gel  nicely no air bubbles, and its lightweight.</li>
            <li> Hoping It Would Help My Weak Nails Grow Out</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed, the box had some scratches and had crac on back side...</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> I have used it to replace 2 broken screens on my Samsung Galaxy S4.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> At A Salon Or For An Expensive Name Brand Uv Lamp.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the UV lamp doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> I cured 2 min base, 3 min each coat of polish, and 2 min base, and also followed other gel mani instructions.  </li>
            <li> : Gel base coat (Optional)&lt;br /&gt;2:</li>

            <li> Great dryer for the price!</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Had purchased a cheaper model from a different vendor and it did not work. However, they sent an immediate refund when I complained. This one seems to work for my daughter and myself and we are both satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I just cured my first set of gel nail polish.  Turned out pretty good for my first time.  You need to cure according to package directions for your polish.  I cured 2 min base, 3 min each coat of polish, and 2 min base, and also followed other gel mani instructions.  Turned out nice!</li>
            <li> Works great! I use it to cure UV GLUE on LCD screens on cell phones. Cannot complain one bit. Paid for itself after first use!</li>
            <li> The bulbs wouldn&#x27;t fit in the sockets, and though there was power going in to the unit (I know because the fuse sparked inside it), it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  Had to return it.</li>
            <li> Ok so I bought this light to do my nails at home so I can save money and not have to go get them done all the time, I have only used it a few times so far but this I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with all the lights in side and working, both the inside and out side were in great condition and working straight out of the box. The lights seem to be new and working on my nails fine so far too:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad things about it is that unlike some of the higher end UV nail lights this one does not have a built in fan or a layer of glass between where you put you hands in and where the lights are, so it gets Very Hot after a few layers of polish and it is also very easy to accidentally burn your hand on the lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you keep your and very still and have a little fan of your own you can put close to the light and direct the air inside it then it would work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if your looking for something cheaper (was around $20) to just get the job done yourself then this will work great! If your looking for an upscale light it may not be your best bet.</li>
            <li> It was just what I ordered for a gift.  Was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our daughter for Christmas. She text me on my cell phone to tell me that the Salon Sundry is stellar!! She loves it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this UV light for my personal home use.  It works great for me and my daughters.  To me it gets just as warm as the professional grade UV lamps.  It looks as if it is made out of recycled plastic,  which is why it has a dull appearance. Worth the price plus some.</li>
            <li> Great product I&#x27;ve bought one before,  but this particular one had a defect.  The customer service department was very prompt with responding to my concerns and will be sending me a replacement.  Making sure you take care of your customers needs is what matters, thanks alot!</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these and one came to me not working. When you place it on &amp;#34;continuous&amp;#34; its still shuts off after a few minutes. The other one works ok.</li>
            <li> it is not professional product, the reflexive film is gleamless, therefore I think it¬¥s not so effective as it should be, and you have to dry your nails a little bit longer, but It does it job, and for that price its really OK.</li>
            <li> Okay. So I received this product on time, the packaging worked for me. However, it is not &#x27;new&#x27; as advertised or as I believe it to be. It came preassembled &#x3D; the lights are already installed. I know for a fact that the retail product does not come with the lights already installed. Instead this product is delivered in a generic brown cardboard box which tips you off right away that there is something not quite right with this product. Then a couple of days later I notice that after being outside of the box the product has begun to look dull and dusty, and then I notice streaks all over the product. When I say streaks I mean the kind of streaking that you get when you let your teenager clean the windows, except worse! It is obvious to me that this product has or was previously being used for the same purpose for which I purchased it: to repair glass screen using the UV/LOCA Glue. That is the only way to explain the spots of hardened clear mass on places on this product as well as the tray being glued shut too! So while I am not necessarily happy with feeling as if I received a product that did not have clear advertising, I am stuck with a product that has very expensive light bulbs which I believe are burning the last hours of life out of them now. I hope I am wrong, but from the look of the product and the other signs, I know I am right.</li>
            <li> Just like the one they use at the salons.  It even came with extra light bulbs .  Easy to use and not too bulky .  Price was very reasonable</li>
            <li> very nice lamp. it is really good price, worth it. i got this lamp very short time and have good quality.love it</li>
            <li> My wife loves this! She used it tonight and her nails dried beautifully.  They look professionally done. My only advice is to use UV gel nail products so you&#x27;ll have the quick results you&#x27;re expecting.  She uses a UV gel base and top coat but the colored nail polish she used was a gel polish that wasn&#x27;t UV based so the drying/curing time took longer. Worth the time and investment though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big DIY person - so when it came to doing gel nails at home, I was all for it! Saw this product at a decent price so I had to go ahead and go for it. Unfortunately not what I was expecting at all. First off, I open it to see a crack right on the bottom of the dryer! But I thought okay it might have happened during the shipping, oh well. Then I go to turn it on and the two of the four bulbs don&#x27;t even work! What&#x27;s the point of that? Not happy at all. I recommend going into your favorite nail salon and asking them if they have any dryers for sale - some will sell theirs to you.</li>
            <li> I thought it might have a fan or something in it for a nail dry option. Also the lights aren&#x27;t that powerful it takes at least 3 mins to set per coat.</li>
            <li> Had to return it a day after receiving...never turned on and I was not offered a replacement! Dont waste your time</li>
            <li> Expected to receive four extra lamp bulbs. Instead, I received four empty lamb bulb boxes.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use and very light!</li>
            <li> Cute, affordable, compact, lightweight, serves the purpose for now. Handle with care and it shall last, drop it several times and after that I don&#x27;t know. Seen in a shop before, had to cure for over three minutes but I think that&#x27;s because it was beat up and for mass public usage. I bought for the price. Will be upgrading later tho. Some people don&#x27;t like waiting! Came with lights installed and the six little boxes they came in. Shipped ready for use!</li>
            <li> My wife loved it. Now she takes less time to do her nails.</li>
            <li> Works really good and is really convenient.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical the machine wouldn&#x27;t get the job done but I was wrong. I am very satisfied, my nails were dried quick and looked great at the end.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel lamp I&#x27;ve tried and so far I really like it. It works great as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 and both worked for couple of days then they both stopped one after the other, poorly made. Too bad the price was great.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry the polish the way I thought it would. Repackaging unit and sending it back for a refund this week</li>
            <li> It says 36 watt UV but when I received it and opened the box I had four empty boxes of 9 watt UV bulbs inside. So now I have only 9 watt bulbs. Not happy.</li>
            <li> I use this nail dryer every 2-3 weeks to do my own gel nails. it works perfectly and I have my do it at home manicure which saves me time and money by not having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> That very good and price is ok that  work good make the nails dry and good for the gel nails</li>
            <li> works great... just like the one at the salon.  Saving lots of money!!!  Even comes with 4 extra light balbs</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to cure the gel nail polish. Guessing i just took a chance because of the price was great but turns out it was a waste.... :(</li>
            <li> This is a great UV nail dryer and at a great price , i purchased one at a beauty supply for 3 times the cost , found this one online and immediately returned the other..</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully! My clients don&#x27;t like to sit too long after they have their nails done so I&#x27;m thankful that this dries the nails so quickly! Yay!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why a few people are complaining that it doesn&#x27;t work, maybe not following the right procedure. I own this and it works perfect with all the gel nail polishes I have. This is what I do.&lt;br /&gt;1: Gel base coat (Optional)&lt;br /&gt;2: Cure in UV dryer 1-2 min&lt;br /&gt;3: 1 coat of gel polish cure in UV dryer 1-2 min&lt;br /&gt;4: Another coat if necessary cure again 2 min then apply gel top coat&lt;br /&gt;5: Place back in dryer for 3 min. After it is done soak a cotton ball with alcohol and clean off nail to remove any sticky residue.</li>
            <li> great buy, I just wish it had a fan.</li>
            <li> I use this machine to cure the LOCA Glue adhesive in my smartphone repair shop. It works great for this! The built in timer is just right for curing this glue and it takes up minimal space! Also, You can fit the Samsung Note 3 in it! (very close clearance though)</li>
            <li> Love this light only thing is sometimes it burns my nails a little. Feels like its to hot in one spot. But works great.</li>
            <li> Great Price and Product!</li>
            <li> Works great and cures gel polishes fast üëç</li>
            <li> burns my fingers.....would not buy again</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed was very excited waiting for my uv lamp and when arrives it doesn&#x27;t work at all! Even though I read to Many bad reviews I gave a try and now I regret this purchase. I need my money back! You should try this items before sending them to the customers .. It&#x27;s very disrespectful.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to be a little smaller.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely been used, scratched and dented. 3/4 lights went out within 3 minutes of use and started smoking after 5. What the hell?!? If the rest of the stock is like mine, DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> i got this lamp and one bulb was working the other bulb didnt even fit in the maschine its really a cheap s*** lamp</li>
            <li> works great but i do have to wait  a little longer</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! it is great for home manicures! especially if you buy gel poilshes. very impressed! a great product</li>
            <li> This nail dryer is huge and works great. I have used it to replace 2 broken screens on my Samsung Galaxy S4. (I know I am clumsy and very unlucky). My entire phone can fit in here at once to cure the LOCA glue. It is great. For traditional purposes, you can fit all your fingers in here at once with no need to scrunch or distort them. I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s ability to cure UV nail polish, but if you are applying LOCA glue to your nails it will cure the heck out of it.</li>
            <li> Works great at a great price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, sleek little unit that I use in my lab for photobleaching frozen  tissue sections - the wattage is right, and I can put multiple slides on the tray instead of having to awkwardly reach into it.  My only criticism is that the metal lining it is cheap and flimsy, but actually it&#x27;s not that bad, as you can push it back into shape.  I&#x27;d give 4.5 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping / Great item! Very happy!</li>
            <li> When I open the box there is no protection and one of bulb was left from machine. however its work okay. so I like it and its useful.</li>
            <li> Super cool color and not the average white one you usually see. Everything was in perfect shape and ready to use. The results are great!</li>
            <li> There was a little rubber foot missing.  The bulbs came loose in the packaging with empty bulb boxes.  One of the bulb sockets was not attached to the lamp properly with missing hardware.  I have bought something similar before for myself as this was a gift and it was much better quality</li>
            <li> Best light for the price if you fix phones haha.</li>
            <li> Works great but a little on the big side.</li>
            <li> Love it ! It shipped really quickly . Thank you !</li>
            <li> I love love love that I can do my nails at home now &amp; have the same manicure that I would get at a salon for a fraction of the price. This light is powerful &amp; cures my nails in no time. It has 2 settings for 2 or 3 minutes &amp; auto shuts off when done.</li>
            <li> as advertised.  worked great</li>
            <li> I got this to cure the UV glue for fixing the glass on a smartphone.  It works great for that.  It also works great for my daughters and wife when they do their nails :)</li>
            <li> My wife uses it ever two weeks and is very happy with it.  It keeps her occupied while I am occupied with my PS3.  Ours worked right out of the box, no issues in cleanliness or functionality.  I actually originally got her a larger more professional nail dryer, and she hated it.  This is the right size and the right price.  Does one full hand at a time easily.  The larger one would do two at a time, but from what I understand, you don&#x27;t have enough time to apply a coat to all 10 fingers and get them under the lamps before you mess it up...so why buy a larger one unless you own a salon?  Amazon is great for returns.  If you have an issue, send it back and get another one.</li>
            <li> Works great. But they need to package it better when I got mine it has a big crack on the top. But  it still works great.  And I love it.</li>
            <li> This bought this as a replacement lamp and I have to say I am very dissapointed. It works but it is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Nearly a year later and my light still works great! I love that I can set the light to turn off automatically at either 2 or 3 minutes or choose to leave it on indefinitely. The unit leaves enough room to fit my entire hand as well. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> When I first got it I was very upset because it didn&#x27;t work at all,  after talking to them I discovered that the wires on the start button had disconnected after reconnecting them it worked. Now I&#x27;ve discovered that the timer doesn&#x27;t work, I figure it might be the wires again but I haven&#x27;t checked yet. Other than the timer it works great I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to keep taking it apart to fix it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love the fact that you can take out the bottom. Makes it easier to do toes! And can&#x27;t beat the price for as good as it is.</li>
            <li> I Wanted To Try Gel Polish Hoping It Would Help My Weak Nails Grow Out But Couldn&#x27;t Spend A Fortune At A Salon Or For An Expensive Name Brand Uv Lamp. This Was An Affordable Alternative. It  Shipped And arrivEd Quickly and Did A Great Job On My Nails. Hopefully It Will Last A Long, Long Time!</li>
            <li> works great! I love doing my own nails and I wanted to 2 lights so I could do it faster.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this at all! My house just almost went up in flames and lets just say now I have one hand done.. I will not be buying another &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; lamp again</li>
            <li> had a blown fuse when received, after replacing it works great</li>
            <li> Works fine. Was fully assembled in the box. Must be fairly durable, as there was no packing material or padding in the shupping container, and the bulbs all work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a fan. Probably my fault for not reading carefully,  but for some reason I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, seems to be perfect.</li>
            <li> Plugged both in used 1 time each and stopped working;  I did modify the partition at the bottom (made it lower) but should not have affected electronics.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great and the product was exactly as described.  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> So I bought this knowing that without the fan it would do its job just as good. It did But the lights were a bit hot until when it turns off theres this cooling sensation. Although I would like to give it a full 5 stars it just wasn&#x27;t like &#x27;fast cooling&#x27; as I had expected. but it works out just as good. I like this product, it works well, cures the gel  nicely no air bubbles, and its lightweight.</li>
            <li> Worked wonderful with my IBD Soak Off Gel Kit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the UV lamp doesn&#x27;t work... I am so disappointed, the box had some scratches and had crac on back side...&lt;br /&gt;No stars have to be submitted but site requires...</li>
            <li> i got this for my mother because she loves to do her nails and this was great for her to dry her nails quickly</li>
            <li> i love this nail dryer!!!! never have had a problem with other i bought years ago so i have a pair now</li>
            <li> ‚Ä¢Includes 4 long-life CFL UV bulbs for total 36-watt drying power but they don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;The UV bulbs don&#x27;t work so I haven&#x27;t used the dryer</li>
            <li> I bought one of these and I used it for a few months and it worked great. And then I left it on for over 10 minutes straight while I was talking talking on the phone and it blew up. Luckily my hand wasn&#x27;t in there. I think it was the bulbs that overheated so beware not to leave it on for long periods of time. Ultimately I bought a new one because it does work and it is a great price.</li>
            <li> is good for the price</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last that long. Bulb burns out fast.</li>
            <li> I love my new salon lamp. It&#x27;s very professional and will save me a lot of money because now I can do my own nails and dry them quickly!</li>
            <li> It is okay, it takes longer for nails to dry than I think it should.</li>
