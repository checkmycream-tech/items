            <li>Great refinish</li>
            <li>Her lashes looked great and lasted all day.</li>
            <li>and I have great looking lashes.</li>
            <li>Great, just great product.</li>
            <li>I will give kudos to the seller though for timeliness and great packaging.  </li>
            <li>This product is great&#x27;</li>
            <li>It looks amazing!</li>
            <li>That being said, it gives my minuscule lashes GORGEOUS length and volume and washes off with ease.  </li>
            <li>Not as good of a product as I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>My every day mascara is just a good at lengthening and thickening.</li>
            <li>It makes your lashes look so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure any woman has experienced</li>
            <li>It was almost worth it though, because the length is awesome.</li>
            <li>I just added two more to my cart!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>Love this system!</li>
            <li>I freakin LOVE this mascara!</li>
            <li>Adorable packaging!</li>
            <li>Well I tried it and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I tried many times, the fibers go everywhere on your lid, under and in your eye!</li>
            <li>Better off with mascara!</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly and in great condition.</li>
            <li>When done correctly, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Lmao</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?  LOVE!</li>
            <li>Its ok....not as amazing as some reviews I&#x27;ve read but its not horrible.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with the duo.  </li>
            <li>Want to get more and some for gifts.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my eyelashes look, but the fibers did end up in my eyes throughout the day, which caused some irritation.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Last minute bridemaids gift and they absolutely loved it!!!!</li>
            <li>I will buy more of this.  </li>
            <li>you will love it</li>
            <li>But, this review is about this product, and THIS product has rescued my eye lash disaster so much more than I would have ever imagined.</li>
            <li>You can recoat and build up for even more length and coverage by re-mascara-ing and then re-fibering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try again tomorrow and see if my skills get any better</li>
            <li>Really really pleased with this and will get it again.  </li>
            <li>but I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Not an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t expect anything better for the price.</li>
            <li>pretty good.</li>
            <li>:)  This stuff is not clumpy, is easy to put on, lasts all day and is easy to take off.  </li>
            <li>So, summing up: Best $$ spent on a beauty product in years.</li>
            <li>..length and easy to come off..</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and easy to take off.  </li>
            <li>But easily washes off.</li>
            <li>The application was easy.</li>
            <li>easy to apply and make lashes fuller.</li>
            <li>leave fine fibers on your face</li>
            <li>This stuff is super!</li>
            <li>Huge difference</li>
            <li>I was really sleepy this morning and was kind of in a rush to get to work</li>
            <li>But really all you need to know and do is apply a nice coat of mascara (included) and then quickly twist the wand with fibers on the tips of lashes.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t laugh until you cry!  </li>
            <li>I was really excited about the purchase of this Relian Eyelash Extension kit.</li>
            <li>the small one is fibers to be added after the gel, I was impressed with what it did.  </li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money you pay!  </li>
            <li>I personally think it comes out better when you apply your own mascara first.  </li>
            <li>Follow quickly with fibers 5.</li>
            <li>so you need to work quickly.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does give length, which I give credit for, but nothing more than my normal mascara for 3x the effort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare when a product really is even better than described--this product is exactly that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I love this 2step mascara that thickens and adds amazing length that appear  natural, compared to other methods.</li>
            <li>I reviewed this previously and it wasn&#x27;t so good</li>
            <li>you use the mascara gel first, then add on some fibers, then reapply the mascara gel.</li>
            <li>I watched a how-to video on youtube first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to place another order!</li>
            <li>It does what it says for the most part, I did not look like I had falsies on, but it definitely gave them added length.</li>
            <li>Now the instructions are in Chinese so for best results, apply your regular mascara first, followed by the gel (long tube) and finish with</li>
            <li>I have the most straight, short lashes</li>
            <li>Once I figured it out, the large tube is gel that goes on first and</li>
            <li>Also, very buildable which I appreciate in any mascara.</li>
            <li>Essentially two tubes of cheap runny mascara.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to work as much at putting a layer on and coating the fibers.  </li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>The seller sent it in a timely fashion, and the product was packed very well.</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>but I do not know how to apply them very well.</li>
            <li>Fibers work with other mascara but have used better</li>
            <li>Works better than all other fiber eyelash extensions &amp; I&#x27;ve tried any &amp; all I could buy.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t go back to regular mascAra any more..</li>
            <li>A decent mascara works just as well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want thick lushes lashes everyday so this product is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Washing it off is a pain, and the fibers kept getting in my eyes and stuck under my eyelid making them super red and irritated.</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes long, thick and sexy:)</li>
            <li>My expectations, for the price, just may have been too high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple of others, and the cheap one works, but not as well and the more expensive one is good, but not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>It will flake a little as you are putting it on so be sure to do it before foundation.</li>
            <li>I just did my first application and it was simple and fast...</li>
            <li>I now have a new mascara and it takes a lot to make me change.  </li>
            <li>You first use the long tube, which is a gel-type primer--equivalent to mascara, but it dries fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>The series of photos with Chinese lettering next to them showing magical lash growing is just bs ... cheap Chinese cr@p not worth the box</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I have used several fiber products in the past, and they have worked well for me, but they were dependent on what kind of mascara you choose.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much wrecked my already sparse lashes with some extensions that damaged (both missing lashes and greatly shorter lashes were the aftereffects of lousy extension job).</li>
            <li>I have noticed that as I age, my lashes have thinned considerably -- thus why I did the disasterous extensions....</li>
            <li>not to mention, I did not notice much of a difference over my daily mascara...  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see spending that much for mascara,  especially because I wasn&#x27;t 100% convinced I would like it.</li>
            <li>This product is half the price and works just as good, if not better!</li>
            <li>Lol wow these are so bad.</li>
            <li>Otherwise no other complaints.</li>
            <li>I have tried other expensive brands of fiber lashes and this is a great product for the lower cost.</li>
            <li>but now I can use this product and have the full lash look with no discomfort and very little time expended.</li>
            <li>No more messing with glue and false eyelashes,  a couple of coats of this mascara and your lashes look amazing!  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried them, the fibers were falling off and were on my cheeks in a few hours.</li>

            <li> I use this mascara only one time, It&#x27;s too dry.</li>
            <li> probably spent three minutes total</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take me long to get a handle on, of course i read all the reviews and knew what to avoic.  </li>
            <li> Apply mascara and let dry 3.</li>
            <li> Apply gel (don&#x27;t let dry) 4.</li>
            <li> Tubes were actually empty.  </li>
            <li> and the two tubes were EMPTY...</li>
            <li> Then apply the transplanting gel and while its still wet apply the fibers.</li>
            <li> It truly does what it says and is a lot cheaper than other brands.  </li>
            <li> the fiber (small tube) Work only one eye at a time.</li>
            <li> While applying gel or mascara after fibers is on lashes, while still a little wet use the the applicator brush to comb out any clumps.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle or money</li>
            <li> If the price comes down substantially on this, I would try it again.</li>
            <li> I just felt both products were very dry or either they dried out, not sure which</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to put this mascara on first, then wipe off access fibers from your face, then apply your base then a coat of your regular mascara.</li>
            <li> , the little fibers come off in your eyes..</li>
            <li> Gel dried out added murine still didn&#x27;t apply correctly.</li>
            <li> The gel and fiber tube were totally dried up.</li>
            <li> Was almost all dried up.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a few rival brands and this is my fave.  </li>
            <li> Messy, doesn&#x27;t work and gets in your eyes and on your face.  </li>
            <li> I just threw it away after a few uses</li>
            <li> I would just recommend that you put a few visine eyedrops into the gel mascara to keep it lubricated as time goes on.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday...</li>
            <li> It does what it says I have bought a few of these and gave them as gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve contemplated getting false eyelashes for a while and after getting price quotes from $150-225 for initial set up with up to $45 monthly maintenance, I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> I will never use plain mascara again.</li>
            <li> I think I will try another, less expensive brand next time for comparision&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li> Gel was dried out, no directions; mascara irritated my eyes!</li>
            <li> If you like having a dramatic look and long thick lashes</li>
            <li> so I suggest you go slow.  </li>
            <li> No more eyelash extensions or falsies for me!</li>
            <li> I tried hard to use it three times, and just couldn&#x27;t get over how irritating it was to my eyes...</li>
            <li> Not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> Wanted to give zero stars but forced to put one to post review!</li>
            <li> Honestly, Fake eyelashes are less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Annoyed that my money was wasted!!!</li>
            <li> but there was a white base formula and the fiber extensions.</li>
            <li> I was getting to where I used fake eye lashes everyday and they were getting expensive and irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself leaves your eyelashes clumpy, and the fibers make it even worse.</li>
            <li> I tried false eyelashes and the glue drove my eyes and eyelids</li>
            <li> My lashes were longer, but not incredibly longer.</li>
            <li> Mine has a black base mascara and the fiber extensions.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> I used it for my wedding instead of fake eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for about a week because I wanted to have the look of fake lashes</li>
            <li> This looks like I have false eyelashes on!</li>
            <li> The mascara was disappointing.</li>
            <li> It made ugly clumps out of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>
            <li> nuts...seemed to film up my eyes, made them itch terribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I found this product when searching for a more expensive brand and decided to give it a try.  I am quite pleased with the duo.  I have used several fiber products in the past, and they have worked well for me, but they were dependent on what kind of mascara you choose.  Having the gel act the same as a mascara would allows the luxury of not having to try various mascaras.  The removal is also simple, like a tubing mascara.  I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> leave fine fibers on your face</li>
            <li> Huge difference I did only one eye and I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Oh I wanted this to work.  Gel dried out added murine still didn&#x27;t apply correctly. Fibers work with other mascara but have used better</li>
            <li> pretty good. not clumpy</li>
            <li> Horrible.  The gel and fiber tube were totally dried up. Tubes were actually empty.  Scammers.</li>
            <li> I like how it extends my lashes but it becomes flakey and pieces of the fibers fall onto my face. I applied the gel again after applying the fibers and this helped a bit.</li>
            <li> My friends kept asking me did i have falsies on...Lmao these are great!</li>
            <li> Want to get more and some for gifts.</li>
            <li> No instructions included.  Was almost all dried up.</li>
            <li> I received this product today 5/11/15 and the two tubes were EMPTY...USED...I want a refund!!!</li>
            <li> Stunk.  Does not work.  Booooo</li>
            <li> Ive tried a few rival brands and this is my fave.  The only thing is that its not water resistant so don&#x27;t laugh until you cry!  That being said, it gives my minuscule lashes GORGEOUS length and volume and washes off with ease.  Also, very buildable which I appreciate in any mascara.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all. I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product. I have the most straight, short lashes I&#x27;m sure any woman has experienced and I thought this would be a miracle mascara like it says. It does give length, which I give credit for, but nothing more than my normal mascara for 3x the effort. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> fibers don&#x27;t stay on.... they end up under your eyes or on your face.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my eyelashes look, but the fibers did end up in my eyes throughout the day, which caused some irritation. It was almost worth it though, because the length is awesome.</li>
            <li> Not as good of a product as I was hoping for.  My every day mascara is just a good at lengthening and thickening.</li>
            <li> Love it...can&#x27;t go back to regular mascAra any more..I&#x27;m hooked..Great refinish..length and easy to come off..I&#x27;m hooked!!!</li>
            <li> The mascara was disappointing. A friend of mine bought the fiber mascara set but there was a white base formula and the fiber extensions. Her lashes looked great and lasted all day. Mine has a black base mascara and the fiber extensions. The first time I tried them, the fibers were falling off and were on my cheeks in a few hours. The second time I tried them, they got into my eye and stuck to my contacts. Also, the instructions are in what appears to be Chinese. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> No instructions. Essentially two tubes of cheap runny mascara. The series of photos with Chinese lettering next to them showing magical lash growing is just bs ... cheap Chinese cr@p not worth the box it came in.</li>
            <li> If you like having a dramatic look and long thick lashes this is the mascara for you. It makes your lashes look so good. I just added two more to my cart!</li>
            <li> When done correctly, this product is amazing. No more eyelash extensions or falsies for me! The steps I use to apply product:1. Curl eyelashes 2. Apply mascara and let dry 3. Apply gel (don&#x27;t let dry) 4. Follow quickly with fibers 5. Apply gel again 6. At this point you can either do another coat of application. 7. Last step app1y mascara (not too necessary..sometimes I don&#x27;t if I&#x27;m in a hurry). Hint* While applying gel or mascara after fibers is on lashes, while still a little wet use the the applicator brush to comb out any clumps.</li>
            <li> Last minute bridemaids gift and they absolutely loved it!!!!</li>
            <li> These have become a life saver for me! I was getting to where I used fake eye lashes everyday and they were getting expensive and irritating my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now an I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments! Try these out, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly and in great condition. I have tried other expensive brands of fiber lashes and this is a great product for the lower cost. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because a more expensive brand has thicker gel. I didn&#x27;t have to work as much at putting a layer on and coating the fibers.  But again, excellent deal!</li>
            <li> I will buy more of this.  I have tried a couple of others, and the cheap one works, but not as well and the more expensive one is good, but not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Messy, doesn&#x27;t work and gets in your eyes and on your face.  Yuck</li>
            <li> This works really well. I used it for my wedding instead of fake eye lashes. It will flake a little as you are putting it on so be sure to do it before foundation. It does fill out the eye lashes wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara!!! you will love it</li>
            <li> Whoa. This stuff is super! I pretty much wrecked my already sparse lashes with some extensions that damaged (both missing lashes and greatly shorter lashes were the aftereffects of lousy extension job). I tried false eyelashes and the glue drove my eyes and eyelids nuts...seemed to film up my eyes, made them itch terribly. But, this review is about this product, and THIS product has rescued my eye lash disaster so much more than I would have ever imagined. It&#x27;s rare when a product really is even better than described--this product is exactly that. I just did my first application and it was simple and fast...probably spent three minutes total and I have great looking lashes. No fibers are falling off, no smearing...just...again. WOW! No itching or irritation either! I had read several how to do segments online -- that was helpful because I don&#x27;t see any English directions on the product. But really all you need to know and do is apply a nice coat of mascara (included) and then quickly twist the wand with fibers on the tips of lashes. You can recoat and build up for even more length and coverage by re-mascara-ing and then re-fibering. So, summing up: Best $$ spent on a beauty product in years. I have noticed that as I age, my lashes have thinned considerably -- thus why I did the disasterous extensions....but now I can use this product and have the full lash look with no discomfort and very little time expended. Great, just great product.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I will be buying over and over again!</li>
            <li> I tried hard to use it three times, and just couldn&#x27;t get over how irritating it was to my eyes... not to mention, I did not notice much of a difference over my daily mascara...  I ended up tossing it to resist future temptation/ confusion...  bummed.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about the purchase of this Relian Eyelash Extension kit. The seller sent it in a timely fashion, and the product was packed very well. However, my one big gripe was this--the instructions were in Chinese!  My apologies, but I can only read English and French. I&#x27;m not proficient in Asian languages. I had to do some sleuthing and found an instructional tutorial on the internet.  You first use the long tube, which is a gel-type primer--equivalent to mascara, but it dries fast so you need to work quickly. Immediately following you apply the fibers.  I&#x27;ve read some less-than-stellar reviews about the &amp;#34;messiness&amp;#34; and fibers falling.  I did not have that issue at all--and I applied this at 6:00AM in the morning and it stayed on till I took it off in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;Now l&#x27;ll get to the actual product and how it extends the lashes. It does the job--but there is no &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; factor. My expectations, for the price, just may have been too high. My lashes were longer, but not incredibly longer. A decent mascara works just as well.  If the price comes down substantially on this, I would try it again. I think I will try another, less expensive brand next time for comparision&#x27;s sake. Honestly, Fake eyelashes are less expensive.  I will give kudos to the seller though for timeliness and great packaging.  Thank you for reading and I hope this review has helped a bit.</li>
            <li> well....granted I was really sleepy this morning and was kind of in a rush to get to work, I was moderately impressed with this product. I had to open the instructions on Amazon to use it because its in Chinese (I think). Its ok....not as amazing as some reviews I&#x27;ve read but its not horrible. I&#x27;ll try again tomorrow and see if my skills get any better</li>
            <li> Yikes!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This comes with instructions that are written in Chinese! Literally... Not ENGLISH!&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the little fibers come off in your eyes..&lt;br /&gt;Skip it.. Not worth the hassle or money</li>
            <li> I use this mascara only one time, It&#x27;s too dry.</li>
            <li> Information and directions are all in Chinese.  Had to go to the website to get directions in english.  I reviewed this previously and it wasn&#x27;t so good but I&#x27;ve since changed my mind. Once I figured it out, the large tube is gel that goes on first and the small one is fibers to be added after the gel, I was impressed with what it did.  I&#x27;ve contemplated getting false eyelashes for a while and after getting price quotes from $150-225 for initial set up with up to $45 monthly maintenance, I decided to try this.  I don&#x27;t want thick lushes lashes everyday so this product is perfect.  I use it only when I go out for the evening.  Easy to apply and easy to take off.  The fibers can fall off while applying and irritate your eyes so I suggest you go slow.  Otherwise no other complaints.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing product. It made ugly clumps out of my lashes. I just threw it away after a few uses</li>
            <li> Works better than all other fiber eyelash extensions &amp; I&#x27;ve tried any &amp; all I could buy. I would just recommend that you put a few visine eyedrops into the gel mascara to keep it lubricated as time goes on. Once the gel mascara dries up it&#x27;s a little harder to get your lashes as long as when you first use this product.</li>
            <li> Really really pleased with this and will get it again.  Didn&#x27;t take me long to get a handle on, of course i read all the reviews and knew what to avoic.  I use it everyday...</li>
            <li> Love this system! Makes my lashes long, thick and sexy:)</li>
            <li> This product is great&#x27; you use the mascara gel first, then add on some fibers, then reapply the mascara gel. The fibers adhere onto the gel and dramatically increases your eyelash length. I will never use plain mascara again. This looks like I have false eyelashes on!</li>
            <li> I freakin LOVE this mascara! I personally think it comes out better when you apply your own mascara first.  Then apply the transplanting gel and while its still wet apply the fibers. Then finish with another coat of the transplanting gel. It looks amazing! And it doesnt flake off. But easily washes off. I watched a how-to video on youtube first.  But this stuff is so great! I love it and highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Danielle</li>
            <li> Worthless product!! Gel was dried out, no directions; mascara irritated my eyes! Annoyed that my money was wasted!!! Wanted to give zero stars but forced to put one to post review!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!!  Works wonderfully.  I now have a new mascara and it takes a lot to make me change.  :)  This stuff is not clumpy, is easy to put on, lasts all day and is easy to take off.  What more can you ask for?  LOVE!</li>
            <li> I have not used the more expensive brand to know how it compares but I love this product. The application was easy. No clumps. I wear it all day and I didn&#x27;t notice any fibers flaking off.  My lashes were dramatically longer. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Adorable packaging! Product was sleek in design, great amount and exceeds the description with amazing results!!!!! I love this 2step mascara that thickens and adds amazing length that appear  natural, compared to other methods. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! It truly does what it says and is a lot cheaper than other brands.  My suggestion is to put this mascara on first, then wipe off access fibers from your face, then apply your base then a coat of your regular mascara.</li>
            <li> The items are not clearly marked as to how to use, the only instructions are in Chinese.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. easy to apply and make lashes fuller. It&#x27;s long lasting and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Love the product. It does what it says I have bought a few of these and gave them as gifts. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my girlfriend tried to sell the younique fiber mascara to me for $30. I couldn&#x27;t see spending that much for mascara,  especially because I wasn&#x27;t 100% convinced I would like it. Well I tried it and LOVE it! This product is half the price and works just as good, if not better! No more messing with glue and false eyelashes,  a couple of coats of this mascara and your lashes look amazing!  Now the instructions are in Chinese so for best results, apply your regular mascara first, followed by the gel (long tube) and finish with the fiber (small tube) Work only one eye at a time. I do two coats like this and it lasts all day. Shipping is fast. This product is well worth the money you pay!  I&#x27;m getting ready to place another order!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for about a week because I wanted to have the look of fake lashes but I do not know how to apply them very well. It does what it says for the most part, I did not look like I had falsies on, but it definitely gave them added length. I just felt both products were very dry or either they dried out, not sure which but I wound up returning. Will try again, perhaps from a different brand or seller.</li>
            <li> Lol wow these are so bad. The mascara itself leaves your eyelashes clumpy, and the fibers make it even worse. This stuff is awful. Washing it off is a pain, and the fibers kept getting in my eyes and stuck under my eyelid making them super red and irritated. Not an enjoyable experience. But I didn&#x27;t expect anything better for the price.</li>
            <li> Garbage! I tried many times, the fibers go everywhere on your lid, under and in your eye! Better off with mascara! i tried all application methods and suggested tips. Not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> Fibers fall all over the face in your eyes nothing like the younique, always buy younique</li>
