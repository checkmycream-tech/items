            <li>I have been suffering from PMS for many years.</li>
            <li>I am sleeping more soundly and am not quite as nervous or jittery.</li>
            <li>This is a supplement to keep your hormones strong.</li>
            <li>The price is a bit high, but the supplements are good.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give any revelations or huge testaments to it though.</li>
            <li>I would not feel comfortable not taking it, as my blood work indicated that my hormones needed to be balanced and Myomin for estrogen dominance</li>
            <li>My hormones are balanced and my cycle is regulated and light.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff... noticed a difference right away</li>
            <li>Have gotten pregnant everytime</li>

            <li>Pricey, but really worth it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great natural way to help balance female hormones.</li>
            <li>Instead I took this natural product along with CHI&#x27;S ENTERPRISE PROSTA-CHI (each: 3 caps/3 x day).  </li>
            <li>but it is well worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>does exactly what they advertise</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>Still had cramps the first two days.  </li>
            <li>The hot flashes were gone.</li>
            <li>I have other symptoms that were relieved by just two weeks of using Myomin as well, but too much to post here in detail; however, the softening of my uterus and cervix, and pain eradication during my menstrual cycle was the most significant feature that I can appreciate.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I noticed that as my fibroids worsened and began to cause discomfort,  my uterus and cervix had a certain stiffness/hardness to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I get the odd hot flash, but not that many, but I try not to eat food that produces hot flashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY supplement I have found that stops my hot flashes &amp; keeps my headaches manageable!!  </li>
            <li>less is more.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to women.</li>
            <li>I had a high PSA test and the doctor prescribed a biopsy.  </li>
            <li>but it did, I had a normal cycle of three days.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it has helped me in many ways without spending on doctors or dangerous testosterone gels or creams or shots.</li>
            <li>Still can&#x27;t drink: 2 glasses of wine and the hot flashed invite themself back to the party!&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>I had been taking CDG Estrodim for close to 6 months and although it helped for a while, the last 3 months I was having very heaving cycles.  </li>
            <li>and I have a sensitive system.  </li>
            <li>I have had no reaction from the myomin and so far no return of the cancer.</li>
            <li>Also many Chinese herbs have heavy metals</li>
            <li>After 6 months, my PSA levels dropped back to normal.  </li>
            <li>It came on time and was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not bleeding as much and the big clots that I used to get were much smaller.</li>

            <li> Hard to tell which are working and those not being a success.  </li>
            <li> It may have helped with some of my hot flashes (getting rid of them), but it will be hard to tell unless I stop using it &amp; gauge.</li>
            <li> Plan to continue for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any results — positive or negative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep taking it for as long as I&#x27;m going thru</li>
            <li> Went back to 2 (7 days) then down to 1 (remaining days before last cycle).  </li>
            <li> This product works to manage symptoms caused by fibroids, however I had to take an average of 9 pills a day for several months.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks of using Myomin, my uterus and cervix softened; and for the first time in many years, I had a menstrual cycle for which I did not need to use a pain-reliever for the nasty cramping, swelling and inflammation</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money (especially since it&#x27;s overpriced anyway) for me.</li>
            <li> Heavy bleeding and pain in back and pelvic area.</li>
            <li> but I felt it hit a plateau in that the cycles were heavy for the last three months.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Taking this along with other supplements.  </li>
            <li> Timing of symptoms less predictable and harder to handle.</li>
            <li> so I expected at least a little bit of relief by the end.</li>
            <li> When the manopause started things got even worse; I &amp;#34;fell off my regular hormonal waive&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Considering this an expensive price for Chinese herbs which is usually the cheapest holistic product on the market for all holistic products, it never helped me at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to review until I finished at least one bottle.</li>
            <li> The product did stop heavy cycles but it did not balance my hormones and I have not gone to the doctor yet to see if my fibroids actually decreased.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable relief!</li>
            <li> Was having terrible hot flashes and a friend told me about Myomin.</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks of this I started to get terrible hot flashes.</li>
            <li> I decreased Myomin to 1 tab twice a day.</li>
            <li> the drug was giving me such violent leg cramps that I stopped taking it.  </li>
            <li> I can tell the difference any time I fail to take it for some reason.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> I usually suffer miserably with for 4 days.  </li>
            <li> Bad symptoms returned.</li>
            <li> Had forgotten how bad that was!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! Thank you.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have any life changing results from this product.</li>
            <li> Myomin saved me from debilitating joint stiffness. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. Donna Gates was the one who suggested it.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by it. This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> does exactly what they advertise</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Helps to balance hormones as it says. Have gotten pregnant everytime I have taken this coincided with trying, wonderful if you are a PCOS sufferer!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it has helped immensely with menopausal symptoms.  I highly recommend it to women.</li>
            <li> Because I am estrogen dominant, my doctor prescribed Myomin to take in conjunction with the DHEA and thyroid support supplements that  take.  I would not feel comfortable not taking it, as my blood work indicated that my hormones needed to be balanced and Myomin for estrogen dominance is a great tool in helping in that area.  This product has also helped combat night sweats and in regulating my body&#x27;s thermostat in general.  I can tell the difference any time I fail to take it for some reason.</li>
            <li> What a surprise you must try guys, you&#x27;ll figure out why....</li>
            <li> I just gave a 3 because I have no way of knowing if it&#x27;s doing anything yet. I&#x27;m just hoping it will!</li>
            <li> I took this for 3 -4 months as per my doctor and it did not reduce the size of the fibroids. Also many Chinese herbs have heavy metals so I would be cautious.</li>
            <li> I took the entire bottle of this stuff hoping it would help excess estrogen related symptoms. I realize that hormones take time but it&#x27;s 120 capsules so I expected at least a little bit of relief by the end. I didn&#x27;t have any results — positive or negative. It was a waste of money (especially since it&#x27;s overpriced anyway) for me.</li>
            <li> I do feel better when taking myomin so it must be doing the job. Plan to continue for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> Over the years I noticed that as my fibroids worsened and began to cause discomfort,  my uterus and cervix had a certain stiffness/hardness to the touch.  After two weeks of using Myomin, my uterus and cervix softened; and for the first time in many years, I had a menstrual cycle for which I did not need to use a pain-reliever for the nasty cramping, swelling and inflammation I usually suffer miserably with for 4 days.  I have other symptoms that were relieved by just two weeks of using Myomin as well, but too much to post here in detail; however, the softening of my uterus and cervix, and pain eradication during my menstrual cycle was the most significant feature that I can appreciate.  If I could, I&#x27;d give this herbal blend a 10-star rating.  Pricey, but really worth it.  One bottle lasts 20 days, if taken as suggested.</li>
            <li> This is helping with my uterus fibroid. I just started taking it for 2 weeks and already I see the difference. I&#x27;m not bleeding as much and the big clots that I used to get were much smaller. I&#x27;m going to keep taking it for as long as I&#x27;m going thru estrogen dominance perimenopausal stage.</li>
            <li> Taking this along with other supplements.  Hard to tell which are working and those not being a success.  Been on in for a number of months.</li>
            <li> This product works to manage symptoms caused by fibroids, however I had to take an average of 9 pills a day for several months.  The product did stop heavy cycles but it did not balance my hormones and I have not gone to the doctor yet to see if my fibroids actually decreased.  I did however start taking Vitex and it works great.  I have stopped taking Myomin and only take Vitex.  My hormones are balanced and my cycle is regulated and light.</li>
            <li> It is amazing. I feel the difference between this and the hormones that doctor prescribes me.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after 4 months eventhough I tought it was helping me w fibroids and endometriosis. But had hyves, so needed to figure out what was causing that. Well it wasn&#x27;t the myomin!! So going to start ASAP again, while I was off. Bad symptoms returned. Heavy bleeding and pain in back and pelvic area. So e myomin that all had disappeared. Had forgotten how bad that was!</li>
            <li> This is a great natural way to help balance female hormones. It has helped me with hot flashes and other pre-menopause symptoms. I have a  friend who has taken them for uterine fibroids and it has helped to shrink them. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> been using it fro a while was prescriped by my doctor,</li>
            <li> This really works! I took for about 2 1/2 weeks before the start of my cycle and it made a big difference.  I had been taking CDG Estrodim for close to 6 months and although it helped for a while, the last 3 months I was having very heaving cycles.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would help but it did, I had a normal cycle of three days.  Still had cramps the first two days.  I was diagnosed with ovarian cysts back in Oct. &#x27;13 so I knew I had to take supplements because I don&#x27;t want surgery.  The CDG Estrodim helped with the pelvic pain but I felt it hit a plateau in that the cycles were heavy for the last three months.  Caution: less is more.  The label states to take only 2 a day and I had to play with the dosage.  I went up to four a day but became nauseous (2 days).  Went back to 2 (7 days) then down to 1 (remaining days before last cycle).  The second month I&#x27;ve waited 7 days (this is supposed to be lowest time of Estrogen production) after cycle to begin taking them and will be taking only one a day.  I also always take it with food. For the price and dosage it&#x27;s great.  No digestive problems and I have a sensitive system.  CDG Estrodim was great with no side affects but pricey since I was taking 4 a day.</li>
            <li> I had a high PSA test and the doctor prescribed a biopsy.  Instead I took this natural product along with CHI&#x27;S ENTERPRISE PROSTA-CHI (each: 3 caps/3 x day).  After 6 months, my PSA levels dropped back to normal.  VERY pleased!!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my naturopath for estrogen domenance.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. This is a supplement to keep your hormones strong.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... noticed a difference right away</li>
            <li> The product seems to work. I can&#x27;t give any revelations or huge testaments to it though.</li>
            <li> Was having terrible hot flashes and a friend told me about Myomin. I tried it and was amazed how well it worked. My hot flashes have subsided tremendously and I can now go about my day without feeling embarassed! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> recommended by our naturopath.  Excellent product</li>
            <li> Great supplement; fair price</li>
            <li> It came on time and was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY supplement I have found that stops my hot flashes &amp; keeps my headaches manageable!!  I take 5 per day.</li>
            <li> Considering this an expensive price for Chinese herbs which is usually the cheapest holistic product on the market for all holistic products, it never helped me at all. I didn&#x27;t want to review until I finished at least one bottle. I&#x27;ve just started on my 3rd &amp; it hasn&#x27;t helped me with my libido issues. It may have helped with some of my hot flashes (getting rid of them), but it will be hard to tell unless I stop using it &amp; gauge. I get the odd hot flash, but not that many, but I try not to eat food that produces hot flashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Good results, will order again. I am sleeping more soundly and am not quite as nervous or jittery. In all a good product.</li>
            <li> These are great quality.  The price is a bit high, but the supplements are good.</li>
            <li> Going through menapause at an early age and the hot flashes with weight gain is not fun. This though works so good at the appetite control and flashes. It does take a while to get working but it is well worth it in the end. This is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Used a bottle and this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from PMS for many years. When the manopause started things got even worse; I &amp;#34;fell off my regular hormonal waive&amp;#34;. Timing of symptoms less predictable and harder to handle. In desperation, I wondered into local health food store and was advised to buy Myomin and maca powder. Unbelievable relief! I just wish I found it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;I started to take 2 tabs twice a day, and 1tsp. of maca daily. After about 3 weeks of this I started to get terrible hot flashes. I decreased Myomin to 1 tab twice a day. Also eliminated all caffeine and alkohol from my diet. The hot flashes were gone. Now I increase Myomin dose only if needed. Still can&#x27;t drink: 2 glasses of wine and the hot flashed invite themself back to the party!&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product it has helped me in many ways without spending on doctors or dangerous testosterone gels or creams or shots.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my Naturopathic Doctor.  My blood test numbers have improved so I will continue to take it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a naturopath to replace tamoxifen which i was taking following breast cancer surgery and radiation.  the drug was giving me such violent leg cramps that I stopped taking it.  I have had no reaction from the myomin and so far no return of the cancer.</li>
            <li> I notice a huge difference when I take this!!!!!</li>
    </ol>
