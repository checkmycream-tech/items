            <li> Item arrived in what looked like an old package or as if someone had opened it before.</li>
            <li> SPICY(peppery but not overwhelming) yet smooth and somewhat &amp;#34;smokey&amp;#34; and *slightly* citrus-y (though buried)</li>
            <li> I picture an old man trying to hunt down younger women when I smell this.</li>
            <li> It has a similarity in fragrance to Issey Miyake nuit d&#x27;issey yet its distinctive because it has a somewhat &amp;#34;dated old man cologne&amp;#34; smell to it (slight &amp;#34;Grey Flannel&amp;#34; scent is involved).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The real deal, stays as a faint fragrance after the clothes have been through a wash, no need for reapplying through the day or dabbing on too much.</li>

            <li> absolutely NO alcohol smell (NOT DILUTED)</li>
            <li> The smell lasts for 4-5 hrs (sprayed like 3-4 small puffs around chest, mid section, and</li>
            <li> but as this **dries down</li>
            <li> I would give this no stars if that was an option,wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product again.</li>
            <li> would order it again not strong</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very impressed with the smell.Very mild scent that last longer than expected.The price was very deceiving for the type of scent.I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good perfume. ..take too long time for received it</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the cologne, took a chance on it and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Very nice fine perfume. Use it daily. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller, good product, was exactly what I ordered, arrived on schedule with no problems and works perfectly, thanks</li>
            <li> It honestly is a strong scent,it smells kinda cheap.I don&#x27;t mean to offend the seller,but it honestly does not smell good.I picture an old man trying to hunt down younger women when I smell this.It is too strong for my taste.I would give this no stars if that was an option,wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product again.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying MY experience on Amazon with colognes/fragrances have been almost a gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been numerous times in which I had received imitation/knock off colognes,but this in this instance I am pleased to say this is 100% AUTHENTIC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO this cologne is for the 30 and over crowd. It has a similarity in fragrance to Issey Miyake nuit d&#x27;issey yet its distinctive because it has a somewhat &amp;#34;dated old man cologne&amp;#34; smell to it (slight &amp;#34;Grey Flannel&amp;#34; scent is involved).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY SPICY(peppery but not overwhelming) yet smooth and somewhat &amp;#34;smokey&amp;#34; and *slightly* citrus-y (though buried) absolutely NO alcohol smell (NOT DILUTED) but as this **dries down** it smells very nice (though NOT for everyone OR imo younger men)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say you MIGHT be able to pull this off in the summer but NOT in the day time. I would recommend wearing this as its name suggest in the *night time* but could be warn in the day time in the fall or winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In end if you do NOT like mature scents which arent sporty stay away from it but IF YOU DO I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in what looked like an old package or as if someone had opened it before.</li>
            <li> good for daily use or presents.</li>
            <li> BEFORE I BOUGHT NIGHT TIME . I SPRAYED SOME ON THEN ASKED WOMEN IN THE STORE WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF THIS SMELL!!!! ALL  SAID THE SAME... THAT IT WAS A VERY LIGHT AND PLEASE&#x27;N  NOT TO MUSKY JUST RIGHT FOR A MAN... GUY&#x27;S YOU SHOULD ALWAYS ASK A WOMAN FIRST BEFORE YOU BUY AFTER ALL THERE THE ONE&#x27;S THAT HAVE TO SMELL YOU ALL NIGHT ..</li>
            <li> AZZARO is probably my favorite mens cologne ...the smell is heavenly</li>
            <li> Literally reminds me of my childhood and the scent of my grandmother&#x27;s perfume. I&#x27;m fairly certain this is a knock off...</li>
            <li> Nice manly scent.  Very reasonable compared to that which I can buy locally.  Doesn&#x27;t have that certain smell that the cheaper brands and knock offs use.  NICE.</li>
            <li> Good price, great smell.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>

            <li> Pretty Nice!  Better saying,  perfect.</li>
            <li> The real deal, stays as a faint fragrance after the clothes have been through a wash, no need for reapplying through the day or dabbing on too much. Plus got it cheaper than the store price</li>
            <li> IF A MAN WANTS TO SMELL GOOD, HE NEEDS TO WEAR THIS!!!!! HE WILL MAKE A LASTING IMPRESSION!!!!</li>
            <li> Smell too Stronq!! use with caution. The smell lasts for 4-5 hrs (sprayed like 3-4 small puffs around chest, mid section, and lower back).If you want to feel good and smell great I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have to use it a couple of times again and see how it holds up. I have been having smelling issues recently for it is possible I am not getting the full throttle o it. I know that Azzaro is one of my favorite ones and this one does not shine away.</li>
            <li> excellent service and escellent product</li>
            <li> I love this spray, hours later i still smell the scent.</li>
