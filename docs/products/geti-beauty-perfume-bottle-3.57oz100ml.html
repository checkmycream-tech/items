            <li>am buying 5 more!!</li>
            <li>Very nice looking and the atomizer works well.</li>
            <li>a good price with great service.</li>
            <li>easy to fill, does not leak very happy</li>
            <li>Easy to fill and perfect size.</li>
            <li>Good to have around incase</li>
            <li>Good replacement sprayer.</li>
            <li>Another good thing about it is the pipette that was included ( did not use the funnel).</li>
            <li>The bottle is of good quality.  </li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Looks good on my dresser.</li>
            <li>They work beautifully, producing a very fine mist.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product - it came with a funnel to fill it and the bottle sprays just the right amount of perfume.</li>
            <li>First of all, the packaging was excellent!</li>
            <li>Great quality and great value, I would certainly recommend this atomizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very attractive bottle in my wife&#x27;s words, and very functional in mine.  </li>
            <li>Although I received the item promptly and it was nicely packaged, the spray pump has since stopped working.</li>
            <li>It misted the perfume nicely.  </li>
            <li>I had to make my own funnel.</li>
            <li>Fitted my hand nicely.</li>
            <li>And it looks nice too.</li>
            <li>but I love how it disburses a nice mist of water.</li>
            <li>No leaking and easy to use!</li>
            <li>As this cologne is on the spendy side there was no way I was going to splash it on after my morning shower, so I went looking on Amazon for an appropriate dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bottle was simply lovely.</li>
            <li>In reality it is more graceful and elegant than the picture shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the quality of the perfume bottle</li>
            <li>i use this as a sprayer for my SK2 miracle water; it is so much more convenient that pouring the liquid onto my hand and then patting it onto my face; now i just spray onto my face and then pat it on; save me from wasting the water when i sometimes have spills</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d knocked over a favorite fragrance, and found that the cap had cracked, meaning the spritzer would no longer works.</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with this perfume bottle.  </li>
            <li>Simple and great quality!</li>
            <li>I accidentally knocked my wife&#x27;s bottle and it fell on the floor and the top popped off.  </li>
            <li>It works better than the cologne makers atomizer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really pleased with with purchase.</li>
            <li>It will fit into your cosmetic case so easy!</li>
            <li>Processing was very quick and enjoyed doing business with this company.</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived in a timely fashion and was happy to see that it was classy and elegant in appearance.</li>
            <li>I would buy more if it would be available.</li>
            <li>Not much to say about this product except it was just as advertised and perfect for my needs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid, easy to pour liquid into, and very good quality.</li>
            <li>Made transferring from the cracked bottle to this one easy.</li>
            <li>Fine spray bottle.</li>
            <li>just the right size and a lovely fine mist.</li>
            <li>I have dropped it a time or two and it did not break, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Although the seller was great and sent the product packaged very carefully, the item itself is very cheap for what it is being sold for.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy unless you are willing to take the risk!!</li>
            <li>It delivers a very strong mist, which is perfect for the less intense body sprays or splashes but would probably apply way too much of a true perfume.</li>
            <li>It was just what my Daughter wanted, she had it on her wish list and was so thrilled when she opened it on Christmas morning Thanks for making her Christmas special</li>
            <li>It came nicely bubble wrapped and wrapped in tissue paper that made it suitable as a present.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fill the bottle with the fragrance in case you bought a large size of your favorite parfume.</li>
            <li>silver tone top is quite attractive and fits tightly on the atomizer.</li>
            <li>I was upset to not be able to use it until I found these great little bottles.</li>
            <li>I had a perfume bottle sprayer break on a 3/4 full perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>but it is very sturdy, the glass being thicker and more substantial than is indicated.</li>
            <li>It has a spray top which dispenses the perfume very well.</li>
            <li>I recommend this piece, as I said so far it is showing itself to be very sturdy, a nice way to end a hand, and  extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>The bottle and atomizer seem to be constructed very well, and it came with a nice funnel and extraction dropper, but too much cologne is sprayed.</li>
            <li>I suppose this is fine if you like to be very odiferous, but personally, I thought that one squirt from the original bottle was fine, not four!</li>
            <li>Worth the cost, and then some.</li>
            <li>I am really bummed too because it seemed like the perfect solution when my perfume&#x27;s original bottle was broken.</li>
            <li>It seems to be about four times as much as would come out of the original cologne bottle that I needed to replace.</li>
            <li>The atomizer is very well made, nice looking and sprays just like a regular perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>Cap feels a little cheap but overall great quality.  </li>
            <li>and now the top is constantly stuck.</li>
            <li>I received as a gift a larger bottle of my favorite cologne than I am accustomed to, and to my dismay this larger bottle did not come with an atomizer top.</li>
            <li>It came carefully bubble wrapped and packed in it&#x27;s own box inside a heavier shipping box.</li>
            <li>I found this dispenser on on Amazon and and please just say it seems to be very sturdy!</li>
            <li>and she was able to transfer her cologne to this bottle and could use the very last drop rather than having to dab it on.</li>
            <li>thanks to the manufacturers and sellers!</li>
            <li>I have owned this product for a couple of months now and it has not failed me yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s larger than most and sleeker.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I will use my 4711 cologne daily now that I can mist it.</li>
            <li>the bottle is exactly what I had in mind when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>And to my sweet surprise it came with a tiny plastic funnel enabling me to transfer all that precious golden liquid from the original cologne bottle to the atomizer bottle without spilling a single</li>
            <li>Each atomizer (complete with its own funnel and plastic dropper) arrived wrapped in Bubble Wrap as well as Pastel colored Tissue Paper, all inside a simple whilte box.</li>
            <li>Makes a very uniform and consistent mist.  </li>
            <li>Expect to just get the perfume bottle, but got a nice little funnel and eyedropper as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>I always felt the &amp;#34;splash method&amp;#34; of applying after shave was wasteful and sometimes I would get too much on.  </li>
            <li>I received this product fast and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li>.... sprays very generously.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this bottle to replace my broken one and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>Works real well with the bottle</li>
            <li>It really saved the day for me.  </li>
            <li>Heavy feel and nice quality glass.  </li>
            <li>I had a perfume I love to wear but the top was broken.</li>
            <li>The atomizer itself dispenses a healthy spray, not too much, not too little.</li>
            <li>I recently dropped a bottle of my favorite perfume, putting a big crack in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Due to the 3 + oz of perfume, I had to put in the bottle, the little funnel didn&#x27;t help me much, but a make shift funnel made out of wax paper and tape made it super easy to transfer the contents from the old bottle to this new one quite easily.  </li>
            <li>I had ordered the \\&quot;Empty Refillable 3.57 Ounce 100 Ml Glass Perfume Bottle With Silver Tone Spray Atomizer Pump\\&quot; and the \\&quot;1 oz Empty Refillable Circle Glass Perfume Bottle Atomizer\\&quot; and am complete thrilled both!</li>
            <li>I got this bottle as a replacement for some high end perfume that was on the bargain counter.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this bottle.</li>
            <li>My perfume bottle dropped and made a little hole on the top</li>
            <li>It also holds a significant amount of perfume which was especially useful since her broken spray bottle had about 3/4 left in it.  </li>
            <li>All in all, these are truly elegant little bottles!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone trying to turn a liquid into a fine mist with a little bit of style and reassurance.</li>
            <li>Thus far, the bottle has served its purpose, but if the atomizer is as cheap as it looks, I don&#x27;t think this will last long.</li>
            <li>The amount of spray is a bit more than my previous bottle, but I just hold it further away from me.</li>
            <li>Hopefully your perfume is made from pure organic essential oil and not toxic synthetics.</li>
            <li>I was surprised because they are plastic</li>
            <li>This atomizer is right sized and the siphon tube is long enough to get all the liquid out of the container.  </li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>The bottle it came in was far too big.</li>
            <li>Well this is a useful heavy duty bottle for this purpose.</li>
            <li>When I have time, I will sit down with my broken bottles in the new ones and make an afternoon of transferring one of my favorite fragrances to its new home.</li>
            <li>broke my first cut glass atomizer was really hard to find a new one like it</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that the tiny funnel is too small to actually do any good.</li>

            <li> I am really bummed too because it seemed like the perfect solution when my perfume&#x27;s original bottle was broken.</li>
            <li> It seems to be about four times as much as would come out of the original cologne bottle that I needed to replace.</li>
            <li> The atomizer is very well made, nice looking and sprays just like a regular perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> Cap feels a little cheap but overall great quality.  </li>
            <li> and now the top is constantly stuck.</li>
            <li> I received as a gift a larger bottle of my favorite cologne than I am accustomed to, and to my dismay this larger bottle did not come with an atomizer top.</li>
            <li> It came carefully bubble wrapped and packed in it&#x27;s own box inside a heavier shipping box.</li>
            <li> I found this dispenser on on Amazon and and please just say it seems to be very sturdy!</li>
            <li> and she was able to transfer her cologne to this bottle and could use the very last drop rather than having to dab it on.</li>
            <li> thanks to the manufacturers and sellers!</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for a couple of months now and it has not failed me yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s larger than most and sleeker.  </li>
            <li> I am sure I will use my 4711 cologne daily now that I can mist it.</li>
            <li> the bottle is exactly what I had in mind when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> And to my sweet surprise it came with a tiny plastic funnel enabling me to transfer all that precious golden liquid from the original cologne bottle to the atomizer bottle without spilling a single</li>
            <li> Each atomizer (complete with its own funnel and plastic dropper) arrived wrapped in Bubble Wrap as well as Pastel colored Tissue Paper, all inside a simple whilte box.</li>
            <li> Makes a very uniform and consistent mist.  </li>
            <li> Expect to just get the perfume bottle, but got a nice little funnel and eyedropper as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li> I always felt the &amp;#34;splash method&amp;#34; of applying after shave was wasteful and sometimes I would get too much on.  </li>
            <li> I received this product fast and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> .... sprays very generously.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this bottle to replace my broken one and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> Works real well with the bottle</li>
            <li> It really saved the day for me.  </li>
            <li> Heavy feel and nice quality glass.  </li>
            <li> I had a perfume I love to wear but the top was broken.</li>
            <li> The atomizer itself dispenses a healthy spray, not too much, not too little.</li>
            <li> I recently dropped a bottle of my favorite perfume, putting a big crack in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Due to the 3 + oz of perfume, I had to put in the bottle, the little funnel didn&#x27;t help me much, but a make shift funnel made out of wax paper and tape made it super easy to transfer the contents from the old bottle to this new one quite easily.  </li>
            <li> I had ordered the \\&quot;Empty Refillable 3.57 Ounce 100 Ml Glass Perfume Bottle With Silver Tone Spray Atomizer Pump\\&quot; and the \\&quot;1 oz Empty Refillable Circle Glass Perfume Bottle Atomizer\\&quot; and am complete thrilled both!</li>
            <li> I got this bottle as a replacement for some high end perfume that was on the bargain counter.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this bottle.</li>
            <li> My perfume bottle dropped and made a little hole on the top</li>
            <li> It also holds a significant amount of perfume which was especially useful since her broken spray bottle had about 3/4 left in it.  </li>
            <li> All in all, these are truly elegant little bottles!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone trying to turn a liquid into a fine mist with a little bit of style and reassurance.</li>
            <li> Thus far, the bottle has served its purpose, but if the atomizer is as cheap as it looks, I don&#x27;t think this will last long.</li>
            <li> The amount of spray is a bit more than my previous bottle, but I just hold it further away from me.</li>
            <li> Hopefully your perfume is made from pure organic essential oil and not toxic synthetics.</li>
            <li> I was surprised because they are plastic</li>
            <li> This atomizer is right sized and the siphon tube is long enough to get all the liquid out of the container.  </li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> The bottle it came in was far too big.</li>
            <li> Well this is a useful heavy duty bottle for this purpose.</li>
            <li> When I have time, I will sit down with my broken bottles in the new ones and make an afternoon of transferring one of my favorite fragrances to its new home.</li>
            <li> broke my first cut glass atomizer was really hard to find a new one like it</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the tiny funnel is too small to actually do any good.</li>
            <li> The next day I tried to use it again and the spray tip was pressing down normally</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive nose, so my only other comment is that one spray on this new one, equals about 2 of the old small broken sprayer from my wife&#x27;s original bottle.</li>
            <li> Simple, clean, without any irritating details.</li>
            <li> Only issue is the pick up line inside the bottle only goes about half way or so down leaving that much product in the bottle that cannot be sprayed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no luck.  </li>
            <li> I got a perfume deal and a minimal cost dispenser that can be used again.</li>
            <li> favorite perfume comes in a very f*****-up bottle - the atomizer bulb leaks awfully</li>
            <li> I have any other problems with perfume bottles.</li>
            <li> but I wonder why the picture shown here is other items which are sticks.</li>
            <li> I do not know how it works with other liquids</li>
            <li> Does spray a bit thicker than the average sprayer.</li>
            <li> It also came with a little funnel.  </li>
            <li> perfume into this bottle using the enclosed little funnel.  </li>
            <li> It arrived well packed in a snug little box inside another box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Went and looked at a few stores and couldn&#x27;t find one</li>
            <li> I immediately tested each atomizer, using plain water.  </li>
            <li> The sprayer on an expensive bottle of my wife&#x27;s perfume broke and I looked in all the major dept stores and beauty supply stores trying to find a perfume atomizer replacement.  </li>
            <li> Bottle is heavy duty and resistent to breaking-- funnel was helpful!</li>
            <li> I did NOT drop the bottle, press the spray tip down hard, or anything!</li>
            <li> Being a tall slender bottle I was afraid it would not be heavy enough to stand by itself</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s now too late to return it.</li>
            <li> This is no cheap junk but a heavy duty item for your expensive fragrance.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the sprayer quit working after a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> I kept the product because I needed it for a broken cologne that I was holding together with packing tape.</li>
            <li> I was persuaded to buy this product from other reviews, but sadly my bottle turned out to be defective :(</li>
            <li> I have no clue what is wrong with it.</li>
            <li> It was an expensive bottle of perfume.  </li>
            <li> So my expensive perfume is just sitting there in a bottle that I can&#x27;t use!</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> been looking all over for something like this because i hate using splash bottles.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Yup. Used it for about a month and now the top is constantly stuck. Feels as if everything just rusted over and stiffened up. Tried washing the pieces and putting it back together, but it just won&#x27;t spray anymore.</li>
            <li> I had a perfume bottle sprayer break on a 3/4 full perfume bottle. I was upset to not be able to use it until I found these great little bottles. They work perfectly! Good to have around incase I have any other problems with perfume bottles.</li>
            <li> I received as a gift a larger bottle of my favorite cologne than I am accustomed to, and to my dismay this larger bottle did not come with an atomizer top. As this cologne is on the spendy side there was no way I was going to splash it on after my morning shower, so I went looking on Amazon for an appropriate dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle was simply lovely. Being a tall slender bottle I was afraid it would not be heavy enough to stand by itself but it is very sturdy, the glass being thicker and more substantial than is indicated. In reality it is more graceful and elegant than the picture shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast.  It came carefully bubble wrapped and packed in it&#x27;s own box inside a heavier shipping box. And to my sweet surprise it came with a tiny plastic funnel enabling me to transfer all that precious golden liquid from the original cologne bottle to the atomizer bottle without spilling a single drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The silver tone top is quite attractive and fits tightly on the atomizer. The atomizer itself dispenses a healthy spray, not too much, not too little. All things considered, this purchase was simply perfect.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent replacement perfume bottle. The atomizer works perfectly, and the 3.5oz bottle holds a lot of volume. Good replacement sprayer.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for a trip I was taking.  They work great.  I was surprised because they are plastic and I thought they might leak...but they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I had bought a perfume and didn&#x27;t realize that it didn&#x27;t come in a spray bottle so I ordered this one and it works great!</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I expected! Great quality and great value, I would certainly recommend this atomizer. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I just received this today and I am very happy with this product. The shape of the bottle is great. Simple, clean, without any irritating details. It will fit into your cosmetic case so easy! Another good thing about it is the pipette that was included ( did not use the funnel). Easy to fill the bottle with the fragrance in case you bought a large size of your favorite parfume. I would buy more if it would be available.</li>
            <li> The sprayer on an expensive bottle of my wife&#x27;s perfume broke and I looked in all the major dept stores and beauty supply stores trying to find a perfume atomizer replacement.  Absolutely no luck.  Found this on Amazon and my prayers were answered.  It&#x27;s a very attractive bottle in my wife&#x27;s words, and very functional in mine.  It also holds a significant amount of perfume which was especially useful since her broken spray bottle had about 3/4 left in it.  (3+ oz.)  It came nicely bubble wrapped and wrapped in tissue paper that made it suitable as a present.  It also came with a little funnel.  Due to the 3 + oz of perfume, I had to put in the bottle, the little funnel didn&#x27;t help me much, but a make shift funnel made out of wax paper and tape made it super easy to transfer the contents from the old bottle to this new one quite easily.  I have a sensitive nose, so my only other comment is that one spray on this new one, equals about 2 of the old small broken sprayer from my wife&#x27;s original bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the perfume bottle but I wonder why the picture shown here is other items which are sticks.</li>
            <li> i use this as a sprayer for my SK2 miracle water; it is so much more convenient that pouring the liquid onto my hand and then patting it onto my face; now i just spray onto my face and then pat it on; save me from wasting the water when i sometimes have spills</li>
            <li> This spray bottle works great!  I use it for after shave which only comes from the store in non-spray containers such as Skin Bracer.  I always felt the &amp;#34;splash method&amp;#34; of applying after shave was wasteful and sometimes I would get too much on.  Using this spray bottle I get the perfect amount every time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this bottle for a year now.  I make my own perfume and this bottle has been perfect for my needs.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  I travel with it and it has not leaked. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Makes a very uniform and consistent mist.  Heavy feel and nice quality glass.  Cap feels a little cheap but overall great quality.  Really happy with the purchase. I have dropped it a time or two and it did not break, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I received this product fast and it was packaged well. Once I poured my perfume in it, the item worked perfectly for one day. The next day I tried to use it again and the spray tip was pressing down normally but nothing would come out. I did NOT drop the bottle, press the spray tip down hard, or anything! I have no clue what is wrong with it. So my expensive perfume is just sitting there in a bottle that I can&#x27;t use! I was persuaded to buy this product from other reviews, but sadly my bottle turned out to be defective :( Don&#x27;t buy unless you are willing to take the risk!!</li>
            <li> easy to fill, does not leak very happy</li>
            <li> I broke my aqua di gio bottle, and this worked out as a great replacement.... sprays very generously.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and sturdy! I&#x27;d knocked over a favorite fragrance, and found that the cap had cracked, meaning the spritzer would no longer works. I found this dispenser on on Amazon and and please just say it seems to be very sturdy! When I have time, I will sit down with my broken bottles in the new ones and make an afternoon of transferring one of my favorite fragrances to its new home. I recommend this piece, as I said so far it is showing itself to be very sturdy, a nice way to end a hand, and  extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> My sister loves this - her cologne bottle stopped spraying and she was able to transfer her cologne to this bottle and could use the very last drop rather than having to dab it on.</li>
            <li> What a treat to find a glass atomizer.  And, it works!  I have been using this with water. I do not know how it works with other liquids but I love how it disburses a nice mist of water.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product - it came with a funnel to fill it and the bottle sprays just the right amount of perfume.</li>
            <li> I got this bottle as a replacement for some high end perfume that was on the bargain counter.  I got a perfume deal and a minimal cost dispenser that can be used again.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this product except it was just as advertised and perfect for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I use them to put essential oil hydrosols in. But perfume will work to. Hopefully your perfume is made from pure organic essential oil and not toxic synthetics.</li>
            <li> Although I received the item promptly and it was nicely packaged, the spray pump has since stopped working. I am really bummed too because it seemed like the perfect solution when my perfume&#x27;s original bottle was broken.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with this perfume bottle.  It misted the perfume nicely.  The bottle is of good quality.  Unfortunately the sprayer quit working after a little over a month.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to get it to work.  Nothing.  Of course it&#x27;s now too late to return it.</li>
            <li> Do you know how some of your colognes or perfumes don&#x27;t come in spray bottles? Yet you wish you could put them in one? Well this is a useful heavy duty bottle for this purpose. This is no cheap junk but a heavy duty item for your expensive fragrance. I use it all the time and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I needed something to place my perfume in since I broke the spout on my perfume bottle.  It has worked out perfectly,</li>
            <li> Simple and great quality! No leaking and easy to use! Great buy!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite perfume comes in a very f*****-up bottle - the atomizer bulb leaks awfully (it&#x27;s an elixir from Dior) - THIS saved my perfume and now I don&#x27;t have to give it up!&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks to the manufacturers and sellers! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for a couple of months now and it has not failed me yet. I use it for my own blend of aftershave and it has worked flawlessly. I would highly recommend this product to anyone trying to turn a liquid into a fine mist with a little bit of style and reassurance.</li>
            <li> This is a great spray bottle for mouthwash.  It&#x27;s larger than most and sleeker.  It works very well.  It&#x27;s solid, easy to pour liquid into, and very good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a perfume bottle that stopped working. This works perfectly and fits nicely in my built-in wall cabinet. The height of the bottle is about the same as my Biore face astringent. The amount of spray is a bit more than my previous bottle, but I just hold it further away from me. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Used with miniature funnels to save wasting cologne in non-&lt;br /&gt;spray containers  Just what the dr ordered.  Good product&lt;br /&gt;at a good price with great service.</li>
            <li> I had a perfume I love to wear but the top was broken. I ordered this bottle to replace my broken one and it&#x27;s been great. The only complaint is that the tiny funnel is too small to actually do any good. I had to make my own funnel. I highly recommend this bottle. Very nice looking and the atomizer works well.</li>
            <li> This perfume bottle works great! I accidentally knocked my wife&#x27;s bottle and it fell on the floor and the top popped off.  It was an expensive bottle of perfume.  Went and looked at a few stores and couldn&#x27;t find one so I looked on Amazon.  It works perfect!</li>
            <li> Needed something to carry perfume in my overnight bag. The bottle it came in was far too big. This slim atomizer is just perfect.</li>
            <li> Great sprayer.Easy to fill and perfect size.Buy the cheeper splash on cologne and save money over spray bottle colgne.Definetly recommend.</li>
            <li> been looking all over for something like this because i hate using splash bottles. It does deliver a lot of product per spray but that is perfect for aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying 5 more!!</li>
            <li> I had ordered the \\&quot;Empty Refillable 3.57 Ounce 100 Ml Glass Perfume Bottle With Silver Tone Spray Atomizer Pump\\&quot; and the \\&quot;1 oz Empty Refillable Circle Glass Perfume Bottle Atomizer\\&quot; and am complete thrilled both! First of all, the packaging was excellent! Each atomizer (complete with its own funnel and plastic dropper) arrived wrapped in Bubble Wrap as well as Pastel colored Tissue Paper, all inside a simple whilte box. Since I had ordered both from the same merchant, both of these arrived in the same mailing box which also contained \\&quot;air baggies\\&quot; to further custion the glass bottles.  I immediately tested each atomizer, using plain water.  They work beautifully, producing a very fine mist.  All in all, these are truly elegant little bottles!</li>
            <li> I recently dropped a bottle of my favorite perfume, putting a big crack in the bottle. This worked great for transferring the perfume so I could still use it.</li>
            <li> Fitted my hand nicely. Been looking for a bottle like this for sometime Easier to fill, Bought the funnel kit also. Works real well with the bottle</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived in a timely fashion and was happy to see that it was classy and elegant in appearance. But after using it only 3 or 4 times the sprayer malfunctioned and will not work at all. What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> The bottle and atomizer seem to be constructed very well, and it came with a nice funnel and extraction dropper, but too much cologne is sprayed. It seems to be about four times as much as would come out of the original cologne bottle that I needed to replace. I suppose this is fine if you like to be very odiferous, but personally, I thought that one squirt from the original bottle was fine, not four!</li>
            <li> Fine spray bottle. Does spray a bit thicker than the average sprayer. Only issue is the pick up line inside the bottle only goes about half way or so down leaving that much product in the bottle that cannot be sprayed.</li>
            <li> It delivers a very strong mist, which is perfect for the less intense body sprays or splashes but would probably apply way too much of a true perfume.</li>
            <li> My perfume bottle dropped and made a little hole on the top and so I transferred my wonderful &amp;#34;Lauren Style&amp;#34; perfume into this bottle using the enclosed little funnel.  It really saved the day for me.  It has a spray top which dispenses the perfume very well.</li>
            <li> broke my first cut glass atomizer was really hard to find a new one like it this is the perfect size</li>
            <li> It was just what my Daughter wanted, she had it on her wish list and was so thrilled when she opened it on Christmas morning Thanks for making her Christmas special&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Rosenberry</li>
            <li> Although the seller was great and sent the product packaged very carefully, the item itself is very cheap for what it is being sold for. I kept the product because I needed it for a broken cologne that I was holding together with packing tape. Thus far, the bottle has served its purpose, but if the atomizer is as cheap as it looks, I don&#x27;t think this will last long. Will update in a month or so once I see if its lasted.</li>
            <li> just the right size and a lovely fine mist.Looks good on my dresser. I am sure I will use my 4711 cologne daily now that I can mist it.</li>
            <li> Expect to just get the perfume bottle, but got a nice little funnel and eyedropper as well. Made transferring from the cracked bottle to this one easy.</li>
            <li> This atomizer is right sized and the siphon tube is long enough to get all the liquid out of the container.  It works better than the cologne makers atomizer.  Worth the cost, and then some.</li>
            <li> Bottle is heavy duty and resistent to breaking-- funnel was helpful! The size was perfect for the amount of perfume I needed to store.</li>
            <li> I intended to use the bottle for Ganga water, instead of perfume. And it works beautifully for that purpose. It sprays beautifully. It arrived well packed in a snug little box inside another box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really pleased with with purchase. And it looks nice too.</li>
            <li> the bottle is exactly what I had in mind when I ordered it. Great purchase and at a very good price.</li>
            <li> The atomizer is very well made, nice looking and sprays just like a regular perfume bottle. Processing was very quick and enjoyed doing business with this company.</li>
