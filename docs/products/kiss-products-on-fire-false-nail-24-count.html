            <li>In just moments I have a gorgeous &amp;#34;manicure&amp;#34; that would have taken a lengthy visit to the nail salon.</li>
            <li>The nails looked good but wouldn&#x27;t stay on, kept dropping off.</li>
            <li>but theses were really good</li>
            <li>perfect quick, no waiting &amp;#34;nail polish&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li>I love that!</li>
            <li>So if you buy them, make sure you use nail glue as well!</li>
            <li>In a matter of minutes I had a full set of beautifully manicured nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>polishing my own nails.  </li>
            <li>Nice color nails.</li>
            <li>the sticker nails, all sorts of valiant efforts to get great looking nails that lasted - these are the first thing that has worked amazingly!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love these stick on nails</li>
            <li>I am sure I would need to soak them in water for a while or use some acetone or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>But overall, awesome nails!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>I think the nails themselves look fabulous!</li>
            <li>The more popped off during laundry.</li>
            <li>(I was pretty good),</li>
            <li>More easy to maintain then gel.  </li>
            <li>The nails stay on great, but I&#x27;ve been known to push them a bit too far and lose maybe 2-3 nails over 3-7 days time.  </li>
            <li>but the thumbs fit better</li>
            <li>Easy to put on</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They were not as easy to remove as the package says.  </li>
            <li>Generally, though, this line of nails  stay on, look great, and feel fine.</li>
            <li>Even if they all fall off tomorrow, I am extremely happy with the product and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>also looks cheap</li>
            <li>They were great stayed on 3 week and finally I had to take them off as my nails had grown out.</li>
            <li>As above this is a great alternative to costly salon visits.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to select the right size ahead of time and start with your pinkie, thumb being lasti.</li>
            <li>These are so easy to apply and they look like a fresh manicure for days.  </li>
            <li>I know I am doing something right!  </li>
            <li>It has been one full week</li>
            <li>It is as if I went to the salon and had a full set of acrylic nails put</li>
            <li>I love them so, so much.  </li>
            <li>I love all the different sizes they came in, and they come in a cute bottle that resembles nail polish.</li>
            <li>They look great, keep their shine &amp; come with sturdy adhesive right on the underside of the nail that lasts well over a week if you follow the directions for application &amp; are careful with them.  </li>
            <li>After drenching the edges with pure acetone nail polish remover, they were not lifting up easily.  </li>
            <li>I used nail polish remover to make certain all of my nails were free from any straggling polish.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;On Fire&amp;#34; are the most natural looking.</li>
            <li>I can wear these easily applied press-on nails adequately for one week and if necessary, they&#x27;ll hold on about 10 days.</li>
            <li>I only give them 3 stars, because i got regular nil glue, and they stayed on just fine and look nice.</li>
            <li>It never fails me.</li>
            <li>Didnt last more than 24 hours..</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li>2: after about 5-6 days they tend to wear down on the corners into a more rounded shape instead of their original square.</li>
            <li>I love how these look on my fingers, however the adhesive on the back doesn&#x27;t seem to stick very well to my nails.  </li>
            <li>and you are ready to go!The</li>
            <li>I love all colors and types of this fake nail.&lt;br /&gt;I used to try and do my own gel nails</li>
            <li>After that I can do everything I normally do even scrubbing my scalp in the shower!</li>
            <li>I wear rubber gloves to clean or wash dishes &amp; don&#x27;t open any pop-top cans with them.  </li>
            <li>I use these for a couple of times, my nails have grown out long enough and strong enough to be able to support a manicure.  </li>
            <li>Great fake nails that almost look real.</li>
            <li>In my mind it was just a quick temporary solution - and I purchased two sets figuring one set would only stay on for three or four days tops.  </li>
            <li>The nails I received only fit the fingers of my five year old sister.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these, can&#x27;t see myself ever going to the salon again or even</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and takes very little time to put on.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had mine on for 10 days now doing normal things.</li>
            <li>They look very natural.</li>
            <li>I have issues with mineral balancing and my nails constantly vacillate between breaking right down at the quick and peeling off in layers.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>normally keep my natural nails grown out and manicured at all times, but suddenly all of my nails started cracking and peeling on me which caused me to mess with them more than I should have</li>
            <li>have an active job, so this lets me have good looking nails for an event, and I can take them off when I need to have short nails for surgery or active</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only removing mine because my real nails have grown away from the cuticle.</li>
            <li>They also seem to protect my natural nails.</li>
            <li>Boy am I surprised how well these are adhering.  </li>
            <li>(I probably should give my natural nails a break soon, though.)  </li>
            <li>I used the cleansing pad directly before applying, but they just didn&#x27;t seem to want to stick.  </li>
            <li>they actually stay on really well.</li>
            <li>I want to Love them but the only issue I have is the thumb sizes on the short length are insanely short... if they fixed the thumb then I would totally give them 4.5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe that these nails are still on after a full week (I&#x27;m on Day 8 now) and not one feels loose or is starting to lift</li>
            <li>I started with my pinky on my right (dominant) hand and removed the clear protective layer by the tab that hangs down below the bottom of the nail to reveal the adhesive already applied to the nail.  </li>
            <li>Also, they are big enough to cover my rather large nail beds.  </li>
            <li>and finally I ended up with nails bitten down to the quick.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend if you are looking for a nearly instant, simple, professional-looking manicure.</li>
            <li>1: the clear portion of the French nails shows the dimples from the backing you remove off the adhesive.</li>
            <li>Accordingly, I picked two packs of these up and thought that I will use these for a week or two while I let my natural nail grow a bit (until I have something I can actually file and shape).  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and they are already falling off in less than one day.</li>
            <li>If I lose the nail completely, I can apply a new one and file it down to match the old.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>along the natural shape of my nails and the edges &amp;#34;floated&amp;#34; above the end of my nails that disappeared under my cuticle instead of lying flat.  </li>

            <li> Then I used a cotton pad with alcohol to wipe down my natural nails and remove any oils (the package comes with a towelette you can use for prep, but I did not use it).  </li>
            <li> These do minimal damage after wearing set after set constantly for several months.</li>
            <li> Then I sleep with them and am careful with water the next day.</li>
            <li> but they were to long</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like on the short length the thumb is just a bit bitter then</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper too and lasts just as long!</li>
            <li> few key points -</li>
            <li> i had press on nails before and they only lasted a few days ...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone who has issues with weak and brittle nails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stick well but look really nice for a few hours :(</li>
            <li> I have problems biting my cuticles, and fake nails really help me, cause they get in the way of chewing!</li>
            <li> I usually buy these french manicure sets and then after a few days paint them with my polishes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping they would at least last me a week.</li>
            <li> I lined it up and pressed with my thumb on the center of the nail and held it there for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> They only work if you have very small fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy these from local stores, but ever since i started using them a few months ago, I can&#x27;t stop!  </li>
            <li> Then I pressed down on either side of the nail with my thumb and forefinger and again held it therefor a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> So instead of seeing your nail underneath you see a few little lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take them off, buff my nails, let them rest for a few days and reapply.</li>
            <li> Once I did dishes, a few popped off.</li>
            <li> Not a huge biggie.</li>
            <li> That was not easy to do at all.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I keep a small bottle of nail glue (with a brush applicator) on me in case one pops off.  </li>
            <li> I usually put them on before bed and after my nightly routine.</li>
            <li> I have 2 small issues.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Nailene brand but thought I would try these and won&#x27;t again.</li>
            <li> DO NOT wash your hands for at least an hour after application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sized for very small hands and nails.</li>
            <li> I have tried other fake fingernails, and they never had this problem, but EVERY color of this &amp;#34;Kiss Products&amp;#34; brand fake fingernails has not fit</li>
            <li> I tried these Kiss Products On Fire False Nails again because I was convinced that I must be doing something wrong for them all to fit so badly!  </li>
            <li> They are a bit difficult to take off but using acetone helps.</li>
            <li> Repeatedly received wrong product; not as pictured.</li>
            <li> Eventually, Amazon did figure this out, but it was a hassle and unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Years ago I use to have gel nails done in a salon which got crazy expensive and also damaged my nails.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>

            <li> Followed all instructions and the nails were lifting off the next morning!</li>
            <li> Great fake nails that almost look real. I love these stick on nails and I&#x27;ve had mine on for 10 days now doing normal things. The &amp;#34;On Fire&amp;#34; are the most natural looking. More easy to maintain then gel.  Very easy to apply and takes very little time to put on. Just make sure to select the right size ahead of time and start with your pinkie, thumb being lasti. They send enough sizes that you can actually get 2 applications out if 1 &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34;. They are a bit difficult to take off but using acetone helps. I&#x27;m only removing mine because my real nails have grown away from the cuticle. I&#x27;ll take them off, buff my nails, let them rest for a few days and reapply. They also seem to protect my natural nails.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to apply and they look like a fresh manicure for days.  I keep a small bottle of nail glue (with a brush applicator) on me in case one pops off.  Go online Impressmanicure.com for tips for tips on maximizing wear of your press-ons.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and they are already falling off in less than one day. Easy to put on but what&#x27;s the point if they don&#x27;t STAY on?!!</li>
            <li> Fitted all nails except thumbnail...needed bigger size.</li>
            <li> I love all colors and types of this fake nail.&lt;br /&gt;I used to try and do my own gel nails (I was pretty good), the sticker nails, all sorts of valiant efforts to get great looking nails that lasted - these are the first thing that has worked amazingly!&lt;br /&gt;I have had compliments from nail professionals!&lt;br /&gt;A few key points - DO NOT wash your hands for at least an hour after application.&lt;br /&gt;I keep the bottle with spare nails, the file, and Nailene Ultra Adhesive tabs with me at all times.  The nails stay on great, but I&#x27;ve been known to push them a bit too far and lose maybe 2-3 nails over 3-7 days time.  If I have the tabs I can rub the existing glue off the back of any nails that fall off, and stick them back on with a tab.  If I lose the nail completely, I can apply a new one and file it down to match the old.&lt;br /&gt;I have an active job, so this lets me have good looking nails for an event, and I can take them off when I need to have short nails for surgery or active work.&lt;br /&gt;They have been known to last up to 2 weeks for me.</li>
            <li> In just moments I have a gorgeous &amp;#34;manicure&amp;#34; that would have taken a lengthy visit to the nail salon. A lot cheaper too and lasts just as long! I can wear these easily applied press-on nails adequately for one week and if necessary, they&#x27;ll hold on about 10 days. Can&#x27;t beat that...</li>
            <li> Looks like a salon manicure. Even my nail tech admired my nails when I went in for a polish change on my toes!</li>
            <li> Repeatedly received wrong product; not as pictured. Eventually, Amazon did figure this out, but it was a hassle and unfortunate. Generally, though, this line of nails  stay on, look great, and feel fine.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that these nails are still on after a full week (I&#x27;m on Day 8 now) and not one feels loose or is starting to lift yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally keep my natural nails grown out and manicured at all times, but suddenly all of my nails started cracking and peeling on me which caused me to mess with them more than I should have and finally I ended up with nails bitten down to the quick.  After years of having beautiful nails, I did not want to walk around with stubby torn-up nails.  Accordingly, I picked two packs of these up and thought that I will use these for a week or two while I let my natural nail grow a bit (until I have something I can actually file and shape).  In my mind it was just a quick temporary solution - and I purchased two sets figuring one set would only stay on for three or four days tops.  Boy am I surprised how well these are adhering.  It has been one full week and if I wanted to take them off I am sure I would need to soak them in water for a while or use some acetone or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as impressive - THEY LOOK SO GREAT!!!!  It is as if I went to the salon and had a full set of acrylic nails put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I did it - I used nail polish remover to make certain all of my nails were free from any straggling polish.  Next I opened the package and found the correct size nail for each of my fingers and laid them out on the table in order in front of me.  Then I used a cotton pad with alcohol to wipe down my natural nails and remove any oils (the package comes with a towelette you can use for prep, but I did not use it).  I started with my pinky on my right (dominant) hand and removed the clear protective layer by the tab that hangs down below the bottom of the nail to reveal the adhesive already applied to the nail.  I lined it up and pressed with my thumb on the center of the nail and held it there for a few seconds.  Then I pressed down on either side of the nail with my thumb and forefinger and again held it therefor a few seconds.  I repeated this process on all ten nails.  In a matter of minutes I had a full set of beautifully manicured nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to find out if these actually last the two weeks that is advertised.  Even if they all fall off tomorrow, I am extremely happy with the product and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I usually buy these from local stores, but ever since i started using them a few months ago, I can&#x27;t stop!  I love them so, so much.  Years ago I use to have gel nails done in a salon which got crazy expensive and also damaged my nails.  These do minimal damage after wearing set after set constantly for several months. (I probably should give my natural nails a break soon, though.)  I usually buy these french manicure sets and then after a few days paint them with my polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, they last longer than seven days and I am always on the go doing stuff with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently put some on my mom and she also loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend if you are looking for a nearly instant, simple, professional-looking manicure.</li>
            <li> Kiss imPRESS are the BEST nails out there.  They look great, keep their shine &amp; come with sturdy adhesive right on the underside of the nail that lasts well over a week if you follow the directions for application &amp; are careful with them.  I wear rubber gloves to clean or wash dishes &amp; don&#x27;t open any pop-top cans with them.  I highly recommend these, can&#x27;t see myself ever going to the salon again or even polishing my own nails.  Everyone thinks I&#x27;ve had a $60 manicure done at a salon.  For under $10, these just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I love how these look on my fingers, however the adhesive on the back doesn&#x27;t seem to stick very well to my nails.  I used the cleansing pad directly before applying, but they just didn&#x27;t seem to want to stick.  I ended up just applying them using regular nail glue.  They lasted almost a week before they started falling off.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. I have short and bitten nails and these are great!</li>
            <li> Sized for very small hands and nails.</li>
            <li> Product is amazing! I bought a looot, cause is the faster and easier thing I&#x27;ve ever seen. And is really beautiful, amazin, amazing!</li>
            <li> They only work if you have very small fingernails.  They should have different sizes</li>
            <li> I love this brand. It never fails me. I can have them last me up to 2 weeks. I usually put them on before bed and after my nightly routine. I press them on alternating fingers for about 20 minutes while watching a tv show. Then I sleep with them and am careful with water the next day. After that I can do everything I normally do even scrubbing my scalp in the shower! I have 2 small issues. 1: the clear portion of the French nails shows the dimples from the backing you remove off the adhesive. So instead of seeing your nail underneath you see a few little lines. Not a huge biggie. 2: after about 5-6 days they tend to wear down on the corners into a more rounded shape instead of their original square. But overall, awesome nails!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed... The nails I received only fit the fingers of my five year old sister.</li>
            <li> Didnt last more than 24 hours..also looks cheap</li>
            <li> These press on nails are the cats meow!  I have issues with mineral balancing and my nails constantly vacillate between breaking right down at the quick and peeling off in layers.&lt;br /&gt;After I use these for a couple of times, my nails have grown out long enough and strong enough to be able to support a manicure.  With ample sizes to choose from, I have enough press-on nails to do a complete set with a few left over for replacements, if need be.  Also, they are big enough to cover my rather large nail beds.  I start with the short length for a week and when my nails grow out, I move up to the medium size and then I take them off all together.  I would highly recommend to anyone who has issues with weak and brittle nails.</li>
            <li> The nails looked good but wouldn&#x27;t stay on, kept dropping off. Then each nail has a plastic piece on the back to protect the sticky glue, you have to take off each nail. That was not easy to do at all.&lt;br /&gt;  I usually buy Nailene brand but thought I would try these and won&#x27;t again.</li>
            <li> I tried these Kiss Products On Fire False Nails again because I was convinced that I must be doing something wrong for them all to fit so badly!  But once again the nails did not &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; along the natural shape of my nails and the edges &amp;#34;floated&amp;#34; above the end of my nails that disappeared under my cuticle instead of lying flat.  I have tried other fake fingernails, and they never had this problem, but EVERY color of this &amp;#34;Kiss Products&amp;#34; brand fake fingernails has not fit and some have even come off the same day I applied them!  With the others, I have worn them up to two weeks without problems, so I know I am doing something right!  I do not recommend these nails!</li>
            <li> they actually stay on really well.</li>
            <li> They were great stayed on 3 week and finally I had to take them off as my nails had grown out.</li>
            <li> i did buy these from here..but i saw them in the store and figured why not...i had press on nails before and they only lasted a few days ...but theses were really good they stayed on for a week it would have been longer but i decided to take them off...only one thump nail came off and that was because i didn&#x27;t fix it correctly....i had to use nail polish remover to get them off...i will be buying these again cause I&#x27;m really impressed</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stick well but look really nice for a few hours :(</li>
            <li> Nice color nails. I use these type of nails regularly. They look very natural.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. Have purchased several different colors now. Once you get the hang of it, were talking max 5 minutes and you are ready to go!The perfect quick, no waiting &amp;#34;nail polish&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li> I want to Love them but the only issue I have is the thumb sizes on the short length are insanely short... if they fixed the thumb then I would totally give them 4.5 stars.  I tried medium length but they were to long but the thumbs fit better, it&#x27;s like on the short length the thumb is just a bit bitter then the middle finger... not the correct proportions on the bed of the nail or length I try to make it work. East to put on last 1-2 weeks, and they DO NOT hurt your nails I love that!</li>
            <li> As above this is a great alternative to costly salon visits.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly.  Had 1 nail that kept popping off.  They were not as easy to remove as the package says.  After drenching the edges with pure acetone nail polish remover, they were not lifting up easily.  I ended up loosening them off in the shower.  I won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> These are alright. I put them on and they only lasted me a couple days. I was hoping they would at least last me a week.</li>
            <li> I think the nails themselves look fabulous! I have problems biting my cuticles, and fake nails really help me, cause they get in the way of chewing! My mom raves about these, so i figured I would try them out. I love all the different sizes they came in, and they come in a cute bottle that resembles nail polish. Once I put them on, i waited for hours before I did anything. Once I did dishes, a few popped off. The more popped off during laundry. The rest popped off while curling my hair later that day. I only give them 3 stars, because i got regular nil glue, and they stayed on just fine and look nice. So if you buy them, make sure you use nail glue as well!</li>
