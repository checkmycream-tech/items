            <li>I originally found this stuff on beautiful Maui.  </li>
            <li>Product is so amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>BUT WORKS, NICE BROWN COLOR.  </li>
            <li>it smells like wonderful coconuts, but after a session not so much.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised that Maui Babe made a salon lotion and very happy!  </li>
            <li>but I thought the acellerator from the tanning place seemed to work better.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion and got it in the mail in shorter time</li>
            <li>More so than, I need to be.</li>
            <li>smells great and really works</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this stuff</li>
            <li>it is better then</li>
            <li>I love Maui Babe.</li>
            <li>I love the color that this product gives you</li>
            <li>Not too mention, much more affordable than the products at the salon.</li>
            <li>I have gotten the BEST tan in the beds w/ this stuff than any other kind I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Recieved my Maui Babe tanning Salon Formula today in the mail, and was very excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to start tanning again!</li>
            <li>I just recieved this in the mail and was so excited to use it!</li>
            <li>As for the actual tanning solution, it&#x27;s fantastic and you will get a GREAT tan!</li>
            <li>wow, great options.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall my favorite lotion, and great price&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but I ignored them because I love the outdoor version of this lotion so much!!</li>
            <li>With a fantastic smell.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if I get significantly darker over time.</li>
            <li>The product was excellent as usual.  </li>
            <li>Babe tanning lotion is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>You definitely have to shake it up really good</li>
            <li>This has ruined Amazon for me and I have been a loyal customer for years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maui</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been working at tanning beds for years now, and when she told me she wanted this one I filled with excitement, seeing as how most lotions (good ones at least) can go over $100.  </li>
            <li>and I have the golden tan I always wanted.</li>
            <li>As far as how it works, I feel like I&#x27;ve achieved more noticeable results with the salon formulas.</li>
            <li>Also, since you get awesome results so much faster than normal, you get less exposure to uv.</li>
            <li>It never quite absorbs into your skin so if you don&#x27;t shower right after you walk around feeling like you&#x27;ve been dipped in chocolate-cinnamon frosting.</li>
            <li>It definitely made me turn a real golden brown, even after just one use!  </li>
            <li>the smell is great smells like a latte but its messy and sticky!</li>
            <li>not a bad smell , just unusual.  </li>
            <li>but right now I&#x27;m getting ready for my wedding and a trip to Mexico, and I would not have the results I wanted if not for Maui Babe!</li>
            <li>several months the ingredients separated , leaving the oil on top and the color on bottom.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I had to separate it into two smaller bottles that were a more bendy bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, Maui Babe is much better priced, and second, it&#x27;s given me a deeper, darker tan than I&#x27;ve ever had!  </li>
            <li>It usually takes me many, many, many trips to the tanning bed before I see any results because of my skin tone, and Maui Babe reduced that to only one &amp;#34;many&amp;#34; ;)</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m back in PA and the weather has been more than gloomy</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li>I tried this on my last vacation to Hawaii and love the tanning bed version just as much as the beach version!</li>
            <li>This product smelled less coffee scented which was nice.</li>
            <li>With my super fair skin, I generally bounce between ghost white and lobster red.</li>
            <li>and I was kind of bummed to see that the bottle was a little cracked so some of it leaked out in the packaging.  </li>
            <li>After 8 minutes in a bed with Maui babe, I was tanner than after a whole week in Florida.</li>
            <li>Its REALLY greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li>This product is VERY fragrant.</li>
            <li>I found it to be really greasy.</li>
            <li>Straight out the bottle</li>
            <li>do not go tanning very often</li>
            <li>and I must say its VERY oily.  </li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>Very greasy and did not give that brown tan as stated.</li>
            <li>Produces a deep rich color...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My girlfriends words &amp;#34;this lotion is more of an oil based lotion, meaning you&#x27;ll definitely feel a burn, so be careful not to over do it.  </li>
            <li>after the first use I noticed a huge difference!I finally got the dark brown tan</li>
            <li>A little drop goes a long ways, and this warms so nicely in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple times but am not really seeing much of a difference, I think my other tanning lotions work better.  </li>
            <li>Clearly it was used.</li>
            <li>As greasy as the regular Maui Babe tanning formula but does help develop a very brown/bronze tan.</li>
            <li>It gives you a natural brown color instead of the orange tint you get with bronzing lotions</li>
            <li>I would buy this product any another product you are using in or on your body directly from the manufacture.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My only complaint, is it&#x27;s kind of oily</li>
            <li>One of them is the real product the other is filled with something and taped closed.</li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t go back to normal even after shaking it vigorously.</li>
            <li>I normally use the regular Maui Babe lotion for tanning</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong its a wonderful product but in my opinion its just not suitable for a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>Works better than any expensive tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried and soooo much cheaper.</li>
            <li>but it does what it is supposed to...makes you dark fast!  </li>

            <li> Works better than any expensive tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried and soooo much cheaper.</li>
            <li> but it does what it is supposed to...makes you dark fast!  </li>
            <li> My dark tan (and I&#x27;m a natural blonde), has everyone wondering and asking how I got so dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the time and effort to ship back a leaky and semi-greasy bottle that leaks, and I can&#x27;t get a replacement...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep trying though, I&#x27;ll probably alternate it with other lotions maybe that will help!</li>
            <li> It really sinks into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much (a little bit goes a long way).</li>
            <li> ditch the other tanning lotions this one works</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to the online reviews I had read here and on other sites</li>
            <li> Not only is it EXTREMELY greasy and it did nothing out of the ordinary for my tan.</li>
            <li> i will not but any other Tanning Lotion.</li>
            <li> However when I opened the box the bottle was half empty, spilled in the bag ...</li>
            <li> However, upon arrival the bottom rim of the bottle was cracked as if it had been dropped on a hard surface just prior to packaging.</li>
            <li> There is so much less time and work (and money if you pay weekly/per minute to go tanning) involved when using this product.  </li>
            <li> Everyone thinks I am black now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little oily, but goes away after being in the bed.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THE OUTDOOR VERSION FOR A FEW YEARS</li>
            <li> Just a few session in the tanning bed with Maui Babe</li>
            <li> I just got it a few days ago</li>
            <li> I did feel like I smelt like raw cookie dough afterwards though...</li>
            <li> Using this product in your everyday salon tanning on the go (such as on your lunch break etc....) will be difficult to use because you feel as though you need to shower after your tanning session.</li>
            <li> IT IS A BIT SLICK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset! :(</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t get tan no matter what I use.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, oily lotion that is brown</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER: the bottle came cracked at the bottom, so I probably lost maybe 1/7th of the entire contents, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I managed to pour the remains into another bottle and salvage some of the lotion from the bag, but it was a real mess and loss of a portion of the product, which was very disappointing given the price I paid for it!</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely terrible!!!</li>
            <li> Stupid ME!!</li>

            <li> this stuff is the bomb....best product I&#x27;ve used in a tanning salon......will always use it</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product, works great! However, upon arrival the bottom rim of the bottle was cracked as if it had been dropped on a hard surface just prior to packaging. About 1/3 of the lotion had leaked out of the bottle into the zip lock bag it was placed in during shipping. I managed to pour the remains into another bottle and salvage some of the lotion from the bag, but it was a real mess and loss of a portion of the product, which was very disappointing given the price I paid for it! Otherwise the product itself is great..love it!</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing! after the first use I noticed a huge difference!I finally got the dark brown tan I always wanted!Its a must have!! ditch the other tanning lotions this one works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great lotion and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this again matter of fact I threw it away! the smell is great smells like a latte but its messy and sticky!</li>
            <li> This product smells WONDERFUL.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple times but am not really seeing much of a difference, I think my other tanning lotions work better.  I&#x27;ll keep trying though, I&#x27;ll probably alternate it with other lotions maybe that will help!</li>
            <li> This product smelled less coffee scented which was nice.It worked well but I thought the acellerator from the tanning place seemed to work better.</li>
            <li> Received this with a hole in it and all of the tanning lotion in the box. Awful.</li>
            <li> When initially purchased , it worked well .After several months the ingredients separated , leaving the oil on top and the color on bottom. Will not mix back together with vigorous shaking .</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!  IT IS A BIT SLICK BUT WORKS, NICE BROWN COLOR.  I HAVE USED THE OUTDOOR VERSION FOR A FEW YEARS AND I HAVE GOTTEN OTHERS HOOKED OTHERS ON IT TOO.</li>
            <li> Recieved my Maui Babe tanning Salon Formula today in the mail, and was very excited to try it. I open the package and ITS CRACKED!!! The lotion was all over inside the bag!! I&#x27;m very upset! :(</li>
            <li> I left this in my car for a day and then went to use it and it had separated and it wouldn&#x27;t go back to normal even after shaking it vigorously.</li>
            <li> This product works. Smells great (cuz I like coffee) but it does what it is supposed to...makes you dark fast!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to start tanning again! Love this lotion and got it in the mail in shorter time then it said I would couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> With my super fair skin, I generally bounce between ghost white and lobster red. After 8 minutes in a bed with Maui babe, I was tanner than after a whole week in Florida. There is so much less time and work (and money if you pay weekly/per minute to go tanning) involved when using this product.  Also, since you get awesome results so much faster than normal, you get less exposure to uv. This is the only product I will use from here on out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for use in tanning beds or in the sun.  Have been using it for years and continue to like the lotion.</li>
            <li> I normally use the regular Maui Babe lotion for tanning and I thought I would try this one. Turns out I didn&#x27;t like it. Didn&#x27;t get as tan with this in the tanning booth so I will continue to use the regular Maui babe in the standup tanning booth.</li>
            <li> Best tanning bed cream I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> As greasy as the regular Maui Babe tanning formula but does help develop a very brown/bronze tan. You will need to wipe yourself off before getting dressed or it will transfer onto all of your clothing and you will be walking out of your tanning salon with grease stains on your outfit.</li>
            <li> Awesome product...wish I knew about this years ago. Works better than any expensive tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried and soooo much cheaper. It gives you a natural brown color instead of the orange tint you get with bronzing lotions</li>
            <li> My daughter convinced me to try this product. I usually don&#x27;t get tan no matter what I use. Just a few session in the tanning bed with Maui Babe and I have the golden tan I always wanted. It really works! It doesn&#x27;t take much (a little bit goes a long way). Its REALLY greasy if you use too much. So happy with this product...I bought my daughter 2 bottles! I will definitely buy Maui Babe from now on.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion i have tried !!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is VERY fragrant. More so than, I need to be. I found it to be really greasy. It never quite absorbs into your skin so if you don&#x27;t shower right after you walk around feeling like you&#x27;ve been dipped in chocolate-cinnamon frosting. As far as how it works, I feel like I&#x27;ve achieved more noticeable results with the salon formulas. I will use it until it&#x27;s gone but I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have gotten the BEST tan in the beds w/ this stuff than any other kind I&#x27;ve ever used. My only complaint, is it&#x27;s kind of oily so the bottle got brittle and broke in my purse. I had to separate it into two smaller bottles that were a more bendy bottle. As for the actual tanning solution, it&#x27;s fantastic and you will get a GREAT tan! It smells good too! Kinda smells like coffee!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, and she loves.  She&#x27;s been working at tanning beds for years now, and when she told me she wanted this one I filled with excitement, seeing as how most lotions (good ones at least) can go over $100.  My girlfriends words &amp;#34;this lotion is more of an oil based lotion, meaning you&#x27;ll definitely feel a burn, so be careful not to over do it.  Straight out the bottle it smells like wonderful coconuts, but after a session not so much.  Overall my favorite lotion, and great price&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> smells great and really works</li>
            <li> I bought this in a pair. One of them is the real product the other is filled with something and taped closed. Clearly it was used. I would buy this product any another product you are using in or on your body directly from the manufacture. This has ruined Amazon for me and I have been a loyal customer for years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maui Babe tanning lotion is my absolute favorite. Just don&#x27;t buy it from this scammer.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this in the mail and was so excited to use it! However when I opened the box the bottle was half empty, spilled in the bag ...</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, I love the way it smells on me, and I have none of the after suntanning smell on my skin! We&#x27;ll see if I get significantly darker over time. It&#x27;s a little oily, but goes away after being in the bed. It really sinks into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER: the bottle came cracked at the bottom, so I probably lost maybe 1/7th of the entire contents, which is annoying. It&#x27;s not worth the time and effort to ship back a leaky and semi-greasy bottle that leaks, and I can&#x27;t get a replacement...wow, great options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seems awesome, but I would NOT recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Great price and great product!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely terrible!!! I wish I had listened to the online reviews I had read here and on other sites but I ignored them because I love the outdoor version of this lotion so much!! Stupid ME!! Not only is it EXTREMELY greasy and it did nothing out of the ordinary for my tan. It left me feeling and smelling like I&#x27;d been dipped in cooking oil. (Nope, it doesn&#x27;t even smell as good as the outdoor Maui Babe!!) I won&#x27;t buy it ever again!!!</li>
            <li> I would never go back to a lotion from the tanning salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, Maui Babe is much better priced, and second, it&#x27;s given me a deeper, darker tan than I&#x27;ve ever had!  It usually takes me many, many, many trips to the tanning bed before I see any results because of my skin tone, and Maui Babe reduced that to only one &amp;#34;many&amp;#34; ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not go tanning very often but right now I&#x27;m getting ready for my wedding and a trip to Mexico, and I would not have the results I wanted if not for Maui Babe!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I will never use another indoor sun product, this is Amazing! I was hesitant about the price, but after researching I decided to try this lotion. This is a thick, oily lotion that is brown but it does not dye your skin. The smell is amazing like coffee and coconuts!! A little drop goes a long ways, and this warms so nicely in the tanning salon. I have given this as gifts for have recruited others to use this too! Support made in USA products.</li>
            <li> Works too well. Everyone thinks I am black now. Exepct for my girlfriend who is confronted with reality during our lovemaking.</li>
            <li> I originally found this stuff on beautiful Maui.  I had gotten sunburnt there and used the after sun lotion.  Now that I&#x27;m back in PA and the weather has been more than gloomy I&#x27;ve been trying to keep my glow by going indoor tanning.  I was very surprised that Maui Babe made a salon lotion and very happy!  I just got it a few days ago and I was kind of bummed to see that the bottle was a little cracked so some of it leaked out in the packaging.  I used it for the first time yesterday and I must say its VERY oily.  You definitely have to shake it up really good and then it still separates, but if you look at the ingredient list its no surprise.  Just be forewarned haha  It definitely made me turn a real golden brown, even after just one use!  I was super impressed.  I did feel like I smelt like raw cookie dough afterwards though...not a bad smell , just unusual.  My skin felt creamy afterwards, too.  All that oil!  Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this stuff and so glad I found it!!</li>
            <li> Gives you a great color.</li>
            <li> Very greasy and did not give that brown tan as stated.</li>
            <li> greatest tanning lotion ever made out of this world</li>
            <li> This is a Great Product. i will not but any other Tanning Lotion. it is better then Sloan Lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a Great Tanning Lotion, Then You Need This!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deb</li>
            <li> The product was excellent as usual.  I tried this on my last vacation to Hawaii and love the tanning bed version just as much as the beach version!</li>
            <li> The smell was unbearable. It smelt like spoiled celery to me. I used it before going to a friends and she asked if I had just left a hospital.</li>
            <li> i had darker skin in only 10mns of bed tanning. can&#x27;t wait to be brown!</li>
            <li> I love Maui Babe. I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it is the best lotion there is. I&#x27;ve never burned while using Maui Babe either, which is an added bonus. I&#x27;ve gotten all my girlfriends hooked on Maui Babe. My dark tan (and I&#x27;m a natural blonde), has everyone wondering and asking how I got so dark. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Product is so amazing. Hydrates skin all day. Smells great before and after you get out of the tanning bed. All natural ingredients. The only downside is the price.</li>
            <li> I love the color that this product gives you but I think its to oily for indoor tanning. Using this product in your everyday salon tanning on the go (such as on your lunch break etc....) will be difficult to use because you feel as though you need to shower after your tanning session. I will be using the remainder of my bottle out doors around a pool or beach. Don&#x27;t get me wrong its a wonderful product but in my opinion its just not suitable for a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Mmmmm fabulous!! Produces a deep rich color... With a fantastic smell. Not too mention, much more affordable than the products at the salon.</li>
