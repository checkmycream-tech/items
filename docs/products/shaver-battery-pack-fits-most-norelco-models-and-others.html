            <li>Ok but not the best battery if you are looking for longevity  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the solder tabs on the battery...very easy to replace.</li>
            <li>The battery pack is perfect for this application and worked fine after installation.</li>
            <li>Good service from this vendor.</li>
            <li>I figured that even if this battery pack turned out to be a dud that for the cost I might extend the life of my razor until a good season for razor shopping to replace it.  </li>
            <li>you need to be good with a soldering iron.</li>
            <li>Product received in timely mannor and in good condition.</li>
            <li>The batteries are still good</li>
            <li>Forming a v-shape to the lead on the battery pack and tinning it [apply solder to it]will allow for a good connection.</li>
            <li>After charging for an hour and unplugging it, the razor works as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These batteries are good quality.  </li>

            <li>I thought I was going to have good things to say about this product.</li>

            <li>The batteries fit perfectly and wrked well.</li>
            <li>good as described would buy again</li>
            <li>This leads me to believe these are good 700 mAh cells.   </li>
            <li>I avoided throwing out an otherwise perfectly good shaver.</li>
            <li>The battery will fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>These batteries were a perfect fit for my Norelco 7865XL rechargeble shaver.</li>
            <li>also good to have one of those pencil type soldering guns.</li>
            <li>If you are patient, and good with your hands, you can install this battery.</li>
            <li>I did not realize as a user that I would need a Star Wrench bit and good soldering skills when I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I can run it off AC, which indicates a good connection.</li>
            <li>Battery pack fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Saved me from throwing a perfectly good razor into the land fill.</li>
            <li>Good company, on time shipping, good product.</li>
            <li>Good Deal.  </li>
            <li>and you should be good to go.  </li>
            <li>The battery retained a charge for 5 - 6 shaves (good) for about a week.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quick and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>(polarity is important!!)</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more !</li>
            <li>Almost 65% more capacity !</li>
            <li>Received product promptly and is easy to replace (if you have a soldering iron) and works great.</li>
            <li>Easily soldered into my shaver, and works great now.</li>
            <li>This battery is a perfect fit in the Norelco shaver and is easy to install.  </li>
            <li>Price was great, but it didn&#x27;t fit my model.</li>
            <li>Would be great if it would fit in the case.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t attempt this unless your handy with a soldering iron.  </li>
            <li>To concur with others I read about this: it is not for somebody that does not already own their own solder gun.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to be too handy to do this.</li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best batteries for the price on the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent that the batteries have tabs already attached, this makes soldering so much easier.  </li>
            <li>These batteries will discharge on their own over about a week of just sitting on my counter in my shaver..  </li>
            <li>Thank you, kindly</li>
            <li>But to be safe, I also decided to use a pinch of silicone glue along the batteries&#x27; underside once they were making good contact.</li>
            <li>The tabs took the solder nicely, unlike some I&#x27;ve seen.   </li>
            <li>If you are good with soldering circuit board stuff you will be able to do this battery change out.</li>
            <li>While you are replacing the battery pack, this would be a good opportunity to clean the shaver good.  </li>
            <li>After a day in the dock, it works perfectly like new!</li>
            <li>the batteries are working perfectly and the shaver is like new again.  </li>
            <li>This was a very easy to replace item.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fine and packaging was good</li>
            <li>These are great batteries worth the price</li>
            <li>This worked perfectly in restoring an old 8825XL razor.  </li>
            <li>This battery pack, which I purchased from QRW solutions, was a perfect replacement for my 10 year old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Being pretty handy and the advice here I would say this was a great fix.</li>
            <li>It would have been just as easy for Norelco to make the shaver with \\&quot;snap in\\&quot; batteries (maybe easier!)</li>
            <li>Charged over night and after a week still going strong!  </li>
            <li>going strong!</li>
            <li>When I first got the battery it worked great.</li>
            <li>For the first month or two I remained happy.</li>
            <li>Do some reading about how to do the installation before you try it unless you are very comfortable with de-soldering and soldering</li>
            <li>Have purchased two different battery packs and both were absolutely great, easy to install, have worked great and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Then bent connectors on new battery and wedged against original connector stubs for a flawless connection.</li>
            <li>i was however able to grab one of the strips with needle nose pliers, and while stabilizing it</li>
            <li>B000FP63M4 Shaver Battery Pack fits most Norelco models &amp; others]]</li>
            <li>I used a VTOM to be sure I identified the polarity.</li>
            <li>I activated a favorite razor and have been using it since.</li>
            <li>not too many of these items out there, so</li>
            <li>, it would not hold a charge more than 2 days.  </li>
            <li>and the two tabs toward the top of the razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these batteries for a couple years now and can safely say that You Get What You Pay For.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the battery pack.  </li>
            <li>I was able to do it with a bit of effort.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It required some fiddling with the anti-fiddle screws that manufacturers love to use on appliances, and a bit of expertise with a soldering iron, but it wasn&#x27;t beyond my capabilities and made my shaver zoom again.</li>
            <li>checked Amazon and found this battery pack, then read the reviews, many of which contained valuable removal and installation instructions.</li>
            <li>I ran a bead of silicone caulk along the length of each battery, and placed them into the battery compartment, tabs touching tabs.</li>
            <li>When the batteries finally gave out, I looked into replacing them too, but when I opened the shaver up and saw what would be involved, including the \\&quot;time to do it\\&quot;, (isn&#x27;t &#x27;planned obsolescence&#x27; great!! )</li>
            <li>I love the free shipping!</li>
            <li>This strap is where the top screw holds the cover on.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I think you are rolling the dice to make these contacts work, but some of you more gifted will surely triumph.</li>
            <li>I have been able to buy those batteries from Amazom.</li>
            <li>You must be absolutely sure which battery pack your shaver takes before you purchase any replacement battery.  </li>
            <li>Great Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I was able to instal with out soldering</li>
            <li>B000FP63M4 Shaver Battery Pack fits most Norelco models &amp; others]]I</li>
            <li>Look elsewhere for better quality.</li>
            <li>Ok I guess I have to add 6 more words to finish this</li>
            <li>Yeah, Do remember you&#x27;re working with a hot battery (sparks)!!!</li>
            <li>very easy installation, fast delivery and good cost.</li>
            <li>This new pack seems to work perfectly and holds a good strong charge and the heads rotate at the speed they did when the shaver was new.  </li>
            <li>The new batts work great &amp; give many shaves between charging.</li>
            <li>Great inexpensive alternative to buying new.</li>
            <li>It is great to have my shaver working like new.</li>
            <li>My shaver works great again without having to spend $150 for a new one.</li>
            <li>You have to be able to solder electronic circuits to install this battery, but it is really easy.</li>
            <li>They make good positive contact.  </li>
            <li>My Norelco T990 was becoming unusable as one of the 2 batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and became unusable even connected via the power cord.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to risk unsoldering the old battery from the circuit board because I thought the risk of buggering the circuit board too great.</li>
            <li>I bent the tabs, so that they were touching and plugged in the razor to see if the charging light went on.</li>
            <li>These batteries are available from multiple sources but the price here was one of the best when you consider the free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I did not try to re-solder the new batteries, just made sure there was good lead contact.  </li>
            <li>and he/she will have you shaving   with full power in no time!  </li>
            <li>I hope Norelco has made this more user friendly in the newer models.</li>
            <li>It is as good as new!</li>
            <li>Relatively easy to install, but requires some knowledge of how mechanical items work.  </li>
            <li>Then, with the razor on its side, the battery will remain in place for easy soldering.  </li>
            <li>wan&#x27;t easy to install.</li>

            <li>Easy to install, but you do need a sodering gun.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace the existingn battery in my Norelco Quadra 7 razor.</li>
            <li>It would be easy to break the tab if the cover screws were tightened without this step.</li>
            <li>I read in the instructions about the soldering, but once it was apart, I realized this was not an easy solder &amp; space to work in.</li>

            <li>They are still going strong.</li>
            <li>It was easy to solder in place and the shaver charges just fine.</li>
            <li>he was able to free the original batteries.</li>

            <li>The shaver is as good as new now.  </li>

            <li>After recharging, the battery and the shaver works fine again.</li>

            <li>However, it charged fine and works well.</li>

            <li>I did solder it in since my soldering skills are fine.</li>
            <li>works just fine in my razor</li>
            <li>Need some soldering but fine with me.</li>
            <li>Product performs just fine.</li>
            <li>a year ago it worked fine for a while</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t attempt this if you don&#x27;t have a fine soldering unit available.</li>
            <li>I did not attempt to unsolder the original contacts from the circuit board itself, although I see it can be done quite easily.  </li>
            <li>The plastic sleeves hold the connections secure whereas there is no need of sorder.</li>
            <li>The many success stories on the reviews convinced me that these were legit.  </li>
            <li>All went smooth but battery does not hold charge well.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with that, but if you have no choice why not give it a try?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with that, but if you have no choice why not give it a try?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was fortunate in that my re-assembly did not require any soldering (it is held in place by friction, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem in over a year)</li>
            <li>Everything was just flopping around freely inside, and the peanuts served no purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fit was snug and secure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>HE INSTALLED IT FOR FREE</li>
            <li>--mine lasted a year before weekly re-charging; others are available with longer life</li>
            <li>Fit and worked.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Seller said this would fit in Norelco shaver 6826 XL, and it did not.</li>
            <li>While the battery pack fit the shaver it must be soldered in place.  </li>
            <li>They fit into my Reming trimmer without modification.</li>
            <li>Had to move tab to get it to fit without soldering.  </li>
            <li>Considerable difficulty in installation; else a good item.</li>
            <li>After 2 months, so far so good.  </li>
            <li>They are no where near as good as the original batteries that came with my Norelco shaver, but considering the amount  I paid for them, they are fine.</li>
            <li>terminal tab is the one on the right when holding the pack with the tabs at the top and facing away from you.  </li>
            <li>but most anyone can if they have access to the right screw driver and needle nose pliers can do it.</li>
            <li>Easy to order and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I am pleased I was able to order new batteries from them.  </li>
            <li>Remember to recycle the old NiCd battery set at Best Buy or Wal-Mart as it is hazardous waste.</li>
            <li>Make a note with a sharpie as to where the original  + and - ends of the batteries were in the razor.</li>
            <li>When I could not figure out how to get the original battery out of the shaver I called the vendor.  </li>
            <li>Also be patient while doing this, a hot soldering iron is murder on plastic parts :)  </li>
            <li>I instead soldered a connecting wire between the battery terminals and stubs of the original connectors.  </li>
            <li>I replace them when the original batteries held no charge at all</li>
            <li>Installed these babies in my Norelco shaver and now it works better than when I first got the shaver.</li>
            <li>Battery works like original.  </li>
            <li>I cut the original battery out with cuticle scissors.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this purchase because it did exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>Rich  </li>
            <li>and once they arrived discharged my shaver&#x27;s original battery and opened the case.</li>
            <li>my batteries were covered in corrosion, so i had to clean all the gunk off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the indent on the batteries to know which is positive</li>
            <li>Its best if you can cut the tabs on the battery you are replacing, then just solder the new tabs to the old tabs, this makes replacement much easier.</li>
            <li>The battery will work in one orientation only, the best way to find that out is by dry fitting it both orientations and watching the shaver function.</li>
            <li>let it get nice and hot first, then do it quickly so you dont&#x27; cook the circuitry.</li>
            <li>That takes a lot of expertise and special equipment and if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, you&#x27;ll ruin the PC board.  </li>
            <li>Soldering is not difficult and a cheap soldering iron will work just fine.</li>
            <li>Although you need to solder the connections which isn&#x27;t to hard to do, these batteries work great!</li>
            <li>The shaver&#x27;s hardware told me the battery is at full charge, and perhaps stopped the charging process</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea, while your in there, to remove any bits of beard inside the housing and lubricate the gears with white grease.</li>
            <li>I think it would be much more straight forward to go this way.  </li>
            <li>I had heard that replacing the unit&#x27;s rechargeable batteries was more hassle than it was worth, particularly because they had to be soldered and because it was easy to ruin the circuit board.</li>
            <li>short, I am delighted with the outcome.</li>
            <li>Sounds like I am a real clutz, but not so with most \\&quot;do</li>
            <li>The shaver lights came on and read full charge, but my Norelco Reflex Plus shaver won&#x27;t run off the battery.</li>
            <li>Hold the charge fair enough.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, easy solder install, charged up nice and now my shaver functions like new...</li>
            <li>Take old batteries and put new batteries on shaver, recharge batteries very well and work batteries very good and no problems</li>
            <li>Glad i did, Shaver is like new!</li>
            <li>I wish they were only like, $4.00, but I&#x27;m glad to have given more life to my Norelco.</li>
            <li>They shipment arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>This pack arrived quickly and when I installed them did the trick.  </li>
            <li>It was not a trivial task but not impossible.   </li>
            <li>luckily nothing broke.  </li>
            <li>Fits perfectly - with a little soldering and directions off the internet, my Norelco shaver is like new again!</li>
            <li>The best way to remove the old batteries is to use a solder wick or suction device to remove the old melted solder from the board before unbending the connectors and removing the old battery set.</li>
            <li>Fit as original, and holding charge very well.</li>
            <li>Exact fit didn&#x27;t even have to solder connections</li>
            <li>I thought the cost was very reasonable, but I did not realize I would have to unsolder the old one, somewhat tricky although I am experienced at this, and resolder the new battery in place.</li>
            <li>If you have the tools for the job, it is an easy task, and certainly beats the replacement cost of the razor.</li>
            <li>As I have said in the past, I knew that this wasn&#x27;t going to be a five minute job, and it certainly was not, but the end result is excellent.</li>
            <li>(Norelco might argue with me - I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d rather have you buy a new shaver)</li>
            <li>Making sure of the position of the poles I slid the shaver&#x27;s connections into those of the new battery.</li>
            <li>Much better than throwing it away and getting a new one.</li>
            <li>I am able to live with this because the charger is always plugged in any way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m now looking for some new replacements and you can be sure, I&#x27;ll look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>At first I tried replacement with more modern MIMH battery but the Norelco charging system was not compatible.</li>
            <li>Having gone through this \\&quot;ordeal\\&quot; the new batteries don&#x27;t feel as strong as the original, I may have shorted something during installation.  </li>
            <li>The battery pack works fine, but is a real bear to install.</li>
            <li>and I can just remove the battery pack with a little tug and blade to break the silicone bead.razor works great.</li>
            <li>But if you are a little talented, this is an amazing improvement over the old dying batteries.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I agree with others who said do NOT attempt to solder: it&#x27;s not necessary, and would require the right tools and some decent experience to do successfully.    </li>
            <li>Having replaced batteries in my over 20 year old Norelco many, many times, soldering was old hat.</li>
            <li>fast shipping fit</li>
            <li>worth the $10 and 10 minutes of work</li>
            <li>I thought I was handy enough to replace my shaver batteries.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nice to breathe life back into an otherwise perfectly-good razor (since my razor won&#x27;t even run when plugged-in unless the batteries are somewhat working?).</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the bother.</li>
            <li>I recently replaced the blades on my shaver, so the shave was nice and close.</li>
            <li>Even took it to a friend who has far more electronic experience than I do and he gave up.  </li>
            <li>It might be OK, but I did not use it since I can not replace the old one in my shaver.</li>
            <li>These are far too challenging to install in shavers.  </li>
            <li>i had fun soldering them in.</li>
            <li>Even if it did not work, it would have been worth the effort to try to save the shaver.  </li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>Glad to have my old trimmer operational again.</li>
            <li>This battery pack turned my razor into new again, very simple to install if you are handy with your hands, If not there are videos on U Tube explaining in easy steps on how to install.</li>
            <li>With the help of online videos on how to properly replace my husband&#x27;s, Norelco, this battery works even better than the original.</li>
            <li>my battery worked right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Installation is a bit tricky if you do not have the right tools.</li>
            <li>Item was the right price.  </li>
            <li>Priced right, fairly easy to install, holds the charge well---over-all, it&#x27;s like having a brand new</li>
            <li>All they had to do was put non-soldering terminals on the circuit board and a new battery could have been installed easily.  </li>
            <li>With the new strips pushed in front of the old my plug in/time dial lit up, so I used a piece of duct tape to make the batteries in the battery holder in the shaver more secure from jiggling.</li>
            <li>than that problem, this new battery works fine.</li>
            <li>Now, instead of telling me the battery is fully charged, the indicator on the shaver shows me that it is charging, and the battery gets pretty warm, so maybe I didn&#x27;t connect it fully or properly the first time.    </li>
            <li>The battery originally installed in the shaver lasted for many years (5-10, I don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ve had it).</li>
            <li>These batteries did not work as apparently special slightly higher voltages are needed for certain applications.  </li>
            <li>Worked fine in my very old Gizmo can opener.</li>
            <li>The batteries were cheap and I would have to buy a new razor if I couldn&#x27;t install them anyway.  </li>
            <li>Batteries received on time and the old batteries were easy to get out.</li>
            <li>My Norelco rechargeable razor is about 11 years old and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Worked at first and I was pleased but after a couple of months they wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a few days.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased that I have a fairly new razor after replacing the head last year.</li>
            <li>It looked like it hadn&#x27;t been used very much, if at all.</li>
            <li>I do have solder experience, I did de-solder and install the new ones with the full process, and am not convinced I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>Not all internet sellers are willing to be that helpful.</li>
            <li>Heat both metal pieces before applying a liberal amount of solder -- but not too hot to melt the plastic.  </li>
            <li>First charge, one day over two weeks</li>
            <li>Would most definitely recommend this product!        </li>
            <li>However, if you plan to replace the batteries in your shaver, be aware that this is a repair.  </li>
            <li>The batteries first charge lasted 3 weeks and are still going.</li>
            <li>This item was exactly as described and was delivered promptly.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted 7 years.</li>
            <li>It was the first model to use the Nivea packs.    </li>
            <li>Disassembly of this Norelco was more tricky than my last Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>This situation was the reason I replaced them in the first place.</li>
            <li>Actually, it&#x27;s one step better than the reason I replaced them.</li>
            <li>Worked first try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original : I can&#x27;t say for sure the longevity of these, but initially, the motor speed is slower, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to like to be charged with the factory charger.  </li>
            <li>It has now been more than two weeks since I put on the initial charge.</li>
            <li>but i thought i would try this battery first.</li>
            <li>When I opened the shaver up the soldering looked way too delicate for me to accomplish but the experienced radio man did it in just a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>This product works exactly as it was advertised.  </li>
            <li>I just put it on the charging stand for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Armed with the detailed \\&quot;how to\\&quot; from J. Muir, I ordered my batteries, got out my son&#x27;s old soldering iron</li>
            <li>The seller sent to me better replacement batteries than I ordered at no extra charge!!</li>
            <li>battery life for weeks when first installed&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>Something not mentioned if the razor is a model with the trimmer blade: When replacing the the back cover of the razor make sure the drive motor tab is engaged in the notch of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>The need for a tool was the first surprise -</li>
            <li>The installation instructions provided by the seller were exact.  </li>
            <li>Packaged well and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>When my Quad Action Norelco shaver batteries were barely able to hold a day&#x27;s charge, I considered buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>However, a quick look at the new Not-Relcos made in China cleared my thinking.</li>
            <li>My husband is sure that it last much longer than the oem</li>
            <li>Just be aware, when you buy ANY battery for your electric razor, you will almost certainly have to solder it to the circuit board.  </li>
            <li>Thanks very much.</li>
            <li>The new batteries are fine and my machine works like new</li>
            <li>As described in the other reviews, the original is soldered into the shaver instead of being designed for easy removal and replacement.</li>
            <li>is the Positive end of the battery.</li>
            <li>and I figured spending $9.38+WSST for new batteries is worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciated</li>
            <li>Just make sure the new metal strips from the new batteries touch the curved old metal strips to make a connection.  </li>
            <li>It works fine after I replaced the old worn out battery in my Norelco shaver with this new one.</li>
            <li>I found this to be a fairly easy repair, but have had a lot of experience working on electronic items - and have the necessary tools!</li>
            <li>The battery replacement was easy following the guidelines of others here.</li>
            <li>If the batteries last as long as the originals they will be a good deal, assuming you can install them.  </li>
            <li>My unit is still going strong on my initial charge with no sign of needing to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have charged it once after repair and still going strong 3 weeks later without recharge yet.</li>
            <li>but they need us to buy new ones for their bottom line!!</li>
            <li>Worked OK for the first few months but never held a charge worth a darn.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying and replacing the batteries instead of buying a whole new shaver.  </li>
            <li>The manufactures are more interested in selling us NEW razors, so unlike many other products that have reasonably simple to change batteries, razors require an expertise you may not have.  </li>
            <li>The contact was solid and the razor worked fine.  </li>
            <li>These batteries seemed to be working fine when I initially installed them.  </li>
            <li>You have to be a little handy to install them</li>
            <li>You will need to unsolder the old pack and use the original plastic battery holder to hold the new pack.  </li>
            <li>this norelco has been working fine for the past 4yrs and purchasing a new one isn&#x27;t really appealing.  </li>
            <li>It took quite a few until the battery placement felt secure and when plugged in, the charge light went on.</li>
            <li>Fit with no problems at all, plus it was much cheaper than local sources.</li>
            <li>This involved some non-intuitve techniques and I appreciated the help they provided.  </li>
            <li>(it stopped recording after about 2 years and Philips did not make the necessary replacement part available).</li>
            <li>and _should_ be capable of soldering it</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have some experience with electronic repair/construction and have the necessary tools.  </li>
            <li>Norelco really has put built in planned obsolescence in their shavers.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to rate this item.  </li>
            <li>so I had to bend them back to fit.</li>
            <li>and it was ready to go.</li>
            <li>I have Torx drivers, a soldering iron, resin core solder and a mini-pliers set all ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This battery pack fits my Norelco very well.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>(didn&#x27;t want to create too much heat) but pinched them into place.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the service.</li>
            <li>Order was followed up on by supplier to be sure everything was as expected.</li>
            <li>However, I have gotten five or more shaves after it shows it is empty.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see much change in performance.</li>
            <li>QRW provided fast service and the battery pack arrived almost fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Item was as described and was shipped out fast.  </li>
            <li>Be ready to disassemble and solder the battery into place, but when completed, ~</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>These fit right into my old Norelco razor, and it was not necessary to solder them in place.</li>
            <li>TO KNOW THAT YOU FIRST HAVE TO CHARGE THE NEW BATTERY BEFORE IT WORKS.</li>
            <li>I was able to solder the positive terminal directly and nestle the new batteries back into their cradle.</li>
            <li>The idea is to leave as much of the metal leads as possible visible and accessible in the cradle.    </li>
            <li>The overall life of the battery was much shorter than the original</li>
            <li>These new batteries last for over a month now and have strong energy after charging.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s shaver technically doesn&#x27;t accept this replacement since the original batteries were tack welded in, but once he figured out he couldn&#x27;t break the shaver</li>
            <li>the charging time same as the original.</li>
            <li>course, it would much easier if the vendor/manufacturer just added the conventional + and - signs appropriately.  </li>
            <li>This is the second time that I replaced these batteries on my Norelco Razor ,,,I purchaced two other newer Norelco razors but neither shave as good as this older model</li>
            <li>Then, curve the metal strip and put the new battery pack, which comes with 2 metal strips already back on the battery holder with the correct polarity (it fits just fine).  </li>
            <li>I would recommend having an accomplished electronic technician do the installation unless you are pretty skilled with a small soldering iron.</li>
            <li>But for a few bucks to save an old favorite shaver, it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li>make sure you put it in with the strips down</li>
            <li>Mine now runs like new!</li>
            <li>and the battery is still performing as well as it did when new!</li>
            <li>Just like when it was new!</li>
            <li>I really like my shaver but didn&#x27;t want to have to plug it into the wall every time I used it or shell out over $100 for a new one.  </li>
            <li>The new battery made a huge difference, the charge life is back to like new and the shaver runs stronger longer.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Less is more...</li>
            <li>But I came across these batteries on Ebay, found them for less on Amazon, gave them a try, and am glad</li>
            <li>how-to videos on the web, but they may not be anything like your particular razor, so think about trying to replace a battery before you make the purchase.</li>
            <li>how many hours they will put out one milliamp of electrical current,EG if your razor takes 100milliamps of current to run its motor , the batts would run your razor motor for 10 hours --simple !!)</li>
            <li>the shaver was powerful, retained power for a long time, and delivered consistent power.  </li>
            <li>Make sure its in the right position though and follow the simple instruction outlined here in the other reviews</li>
            <li>but I figured the end with ridge around it is positive looking at my old batteries.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if if keeps charges for as long as original.  </li>
            <li>some parts on the PWB (a choke and an IC) became very hot in a second.  </li>
            <li>I said in the second sentence of this review, whether they are a good deal or not depends on how long they last.  </li>
            <li>I said in the second sentence of this review, whether they are a good deal or not depends on how long they last.  </li>
            <li>I had the shaver for a very long time (about 13 years) and the batteries were finally not holding a charge anymore, was only able to operate the shaver for about a minute before the original batteries died.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend a solder removal bulb before you attempt this.</li>
            <li>Cut off the old prongs as close to the old battery ends as possible because leaving the old prongs in place creates a nice tight friction fit when you push in the new prongs.</li>
            <li>(I added a little foam inside U to be sure contacts would stay connected), 4.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it may not matter, but the batteries are not marked for polarity but keep the positive terminal on your right side.  </li>
            <li>It really is as easy as the multi-step instructions listed in other comments indicate.  </li>
            <li>Unless I when to the trouble of building some kind of temporary cradle, it was more straight forward to use a little solid wire to connect the batteries rather that take a chance on damaging the motor connections while refitting the battery connectors.  </li>
            <li>The new NiCad battery works well with my older Norelco Shaver.</li>
            <li>hence they are a total success.  </li>
            <li>to the good stuff: The pack has two small leads at one end, each with a tiny rubber sleeve, which I removed.</li>
            <li>However, after about two or three months, the batteries stopped holding their charge for more than a few days and would die and need to be recharged again.</li>
            <li>This shaver battery pack has made my shaver operate  normal.  </li>
            <li>the low price of new razors it would seem to be more trouble than it worth to replace the battery.</li>
            <li>It takes some technical skill to disassemble, de-solder and solder in a new set but worth doing to save $130 or so on a replacement shaver.</li>
            <li>The new battery pack was easy to replace after reading other reviews and I also did not solder the new battery leads.</li>
            <li>6826XL  ,,,one would think that they would improve  the product not make it worse and the motor even sounds better and stronger than either of my newer quick charge models</li>
            <li>It seems like the new cells  are working normally.   </li>
            <li>I spent hours looking at the new Norelo models and could not justify spending over one hundred dollars on the new cheaply made models.</li>
            <li>Putting the new battery back in was easy, I just bent the tabs instead of soldering back in.  </li>
            <li>like the other guys said leave the tabs nice and long- makes it easier to solder yours in.</li>
            <li>gently fold the strips down semi-flat, and clean off corrosion with a pencil eraser</li>
            <li>i bent the strips on the new batteries out at about a 45 degree angle and laid them in the plastic battery tray.  </li>
            <li>The new batteries have insulated sleeves covering their connectors.</li>
            <li>Then bend the new battery pack</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to order a new battery set</li>
            <li>Bend the leads of the new battery pack into a &#x60;V&#x27; shape</li>
            <li>Saved myself around $100 by not buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>Just snap apart your trimmer and replace the rechargeable battery rather than throwing the unit away and buying a new one.  </li>
            <li>It was like I had a new razor.</li>
            <li>However be warned, you must solder the new batteries  and I had a devil of a time disassembling the shaver to get to the internals.</li>
            <li>easier to buy a new razr</li>
            <li>As others noted, the + - terminals of the new batteries are not identified.  </li>
            <li>i had the choice of getting a new battery or getting a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>the new one on.   </li>
            <li>Since I wanted to avoid having to spring for a new shaver at this time</li>
            <li>I then bent the lead straps on the new batteries in an inverted V shape, inserted the pack into the cradle with the new leads over the lead straps sticking up from the circuit board.  </li>
            <li>My shaver is like new.  </li>
            <li>Bend the leads of the new battery pack into a &#x60;V&#x27; shape</li>
            <li>The new batteries did not have polarity indicated on them so had to test to see which tab was plus.  </li>
            <li>Observing polarity, I soldered the wires to the new battery tabs and placed the battery in the razor tucking the wires out of the way.  </li>
            <li>With the new batteries, I can again go weeks between charges.  </li>
            <li>Then I bent the connector strips into spring contacts for the new batteries.  </li>
            <li>Save yourself a lot of money by restoring your shaver instead of buying a new one.</li>
            <li>I now have &amp;#34;a new shaver&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Cheaper then new shaver.</li>
            <li>My trusty razor works like new again.</li>
            <li>New life for the tri-shaver.  </li>
            <li>This battery pack breathed new life into a shaver that my Dad was using while he was visiting on vacation.</li>
            <li>The shaver now holds a charge as if it was new.</li>
            <li>I gave up on the install and just bought a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Now the shaver has new life.</li>
            <li>Works like new now.</li>
            <li>I was going to but a new shaver</li>
            <li>Battery pack has given new life to my nine-year-old Norelco Quadra 7865XL shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>For that, I can buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li>a new one would be doing my part to help the economy anyway,</li>
            <li>Fold over the tabs on the new pack, and pop in the new pack.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the razor 15 times since installing the new cells.   </li>
            <li>I figured $6.00 vs. a new razor I would try the replacement myself.</li>
            <li>I installed and charged the new batteries two weeks ago</li>
            <li>and so I decided to retire the shaver in favor of a new one now that the new battery quit holding a charge.</li>
            <li>I soldered the new one in.</li>
            <li>I watched a video on youtube that showed how to install this new battery.</li>
            <li>find the video for norelco shaver battery replacement for your model number, on youtube, then Fix your shaver like new for $10.</li>
            <li>this batttery pack works just great,charged battery works like new.</li>
            <li>After installation, I charged my new batteries.  </li>
            <li>In my case I tested the motor after installing the new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Feels like I&#x27;ve got a new razor.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this for anyone needing a new battery pack for their razer.</li>
            <li>buy a new one?</li>
            <li>you will have a new razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like new again.</li>
            <li>This pack had a slightly lower voltage than the original batteries and hence the razor did not spin as fast, which was issue #</li>
            <li>This battery pack was installed in an seventeen year old Norelco shaver and the shaver is working like new!  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find these and replace my dead ones, but after a few months they aren&#x27;t holding a charge</li>
            <li>Once both are soldered, the leads are flexible enough that you can push the battery pack forward so that the leads will fold up to make room to put the battery pack back into the slot securely.  </li>
            <li>I did charge them and ran the batteries down to recharge and everything seems fine.</li>
            <li>I bought this battery pack for a very old Remington shaver that stopped charging.  </li>
            <li>The new pack has two flat leads that are about 3 mm wide, one will fit thru the board to the top side where you can solder it on the board, the other will not without trimming it down about a mm to fit thru the hole.  </li>
            <li>Once this was complete it was easy to solder the new battery leads to the old batter leads, reassemble the shaver and charge the battery the conventional way.  </li>
            <li>turns out that the install was pretty simple.  </li>
            <li>This year I replaced the NiCad batteries for the second time (first time</li>
            <li>Along with the battery, make sure you have a solder iron and some solder, and don&#x27;t forget a small precision screwdriver.</li>
            <li>About 6 months ago I replaced the original batteries in my Norelco shaver with these after several years of daily use.</li>
            <li>I know most battery operated devices use small springs to maintain contact, so I thought I&#x27;d give the procedure a try.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty simple.</li>
            <li>My other batteries were the original after 7 years and were not holding a charge for longer than 1 day.</li>
            <li>so that when the new battery pack is in the cradle, the new leads are against the old leads in the PC board.  </li>
            <li>That way, I avoided having to solder the new batteries into place, and if I ever have to replace them again, I can just pop out the old batteries and slip in the new set.  </li>
            <li>Once the shaver is disassembled, the connectors between the circuit board and the little motor are unsupported and easily damaged.  </li>
            <li>I threw my old shaver and the batteries in the trash and bought a new razor.</li>
            <li>In order to install these you have to de-solder the old battery at the circuit board, then insert the tabs of the new battery into the slots on the circuit board and solder them in place.  </li>
            <li>The replacement required de-soldering the old pack and re-soldering the new.  </li>
            <li>I cheated and cut the old battery leads, trimmed the new battery</li>
            <li>Far cheaper than a new $80 one (if you can find the refurbs anymore).</li>
            <li>I understood the instructions and de-soldered the old Norelco battery as instructed and got the new tabs in place and soldered them.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews talk about dropping in the new batteries (after somehow removing the old ones) creating a press contact.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews talk about dropping in the new batteries (after somehow removing the old ones) creating a press contact.  </li>
            <li>I tensioned the new pack towards the old lead with a piece of wood wedged in between the battery and two capisitors.</li>
            <li>Look online for help on how to disassemble shaver, take out the old one and put the new one in.  </li>
            <li>bend new battery contacts into U shape to make contact with old battery contacts</li>
            <li>I un-soldered the old ones and soldered in the new ones.</li>
            <li>The batteries are a direct replacement for my Razor, and function just like a new unit.</li>
            <li>Both the old and new batteries were in sets of two already glued together and soldered by a strip at their bases.</li>
            <li>I straightened them so that I could solder the strips from the new batteries to the strips remaining from the old.</li>
            <li>Razor would show 45 minutes of shaving time with the old battery but with the new battery it shows about 30.</li>
            <li>Now my old shaver works like new again.</li>
            <li>You will need to remove the old battery and install the new one with a soldering iron.  </li>
            <li>It made an old shaver feel like new again.</li>
            <li>When I talked to Norelce the shaver was so old they advised to just use it as a &amp;#34;plugged&amp;#34; razor or toss &amp; buy a new one.</li>
            <li>The tip on soldering the old tabs to the new tabs was helpful.</li>
            <li>Nothing before or after advised that the old battery leads were soldered in and the new needed to be soldered in.</li>
            <li>cut the old battery out put in the new one in.</li>
            <li>Take note of the polarity of the old battery (i.e. you want to connect the positive battery terminal on the new battery to the same wire).  </li>
            <li>The original batteries in my razor lasted about 10 years -- these lasted less than two years.  </li>
            <li>The original batteries in my razor lasted about 10 years -- these lasted less than two years.  </li>
            <li>Removing the old battery pack was a little tricky and then you have to solder the new pack back into the shaver so you have to be a little mechanical (and have a steady hand) to make the change (or know a good handyman).  </li>
            <li>only problem with this thing was that installing it required the removal of the original battery that was soldered (not sure if that&#x27;s the right term, but there were two metal pieces that were melted onto the circuit board that attached the battery to the unit) to the circuit board.  </li>
            <li>Rather, there was considerable verbage about recycling the whole shaver properly when the batteries died.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;2 gently pry off the back cover</li>
            <li>i gently worked the battery back and forth until the connection broke.  </li>
            <li>Let the shaver run to discharge the old battery pack.   </li>
            <li>The batteries had the tabs needed to attach the battery directly to the circuit board.  </li>
            <li>This has to be done on tiny connectors in a very restrictive location.  </li>
            <li>Ordered 2 sets of batteries and fixed two shavers.  </li>
            <li>I had already clipped the old battery from its terminals with wire cutters and taken it to radio shack, where I thought I&#x27;d find an off-the-shelf replacement.</li>
            <li>I replaced my 10 year old shaver battery with this.  </li>
            <li>Took some work though, had to de-solder the old battery out.  </li>
            <li>On my Norelco 6885XL, my steps were: 1) Let the shaver run to discharge the old battery pack.  </li>
            <li>BUT it is not just a drop and load pack you will have to unsolder the old pack from the circuit board in the shaver to install this one.  </li>
            <li>I pried the old battery from the metal strips in the razor noting which strip was plus.  </li>
            <li>Allowed me to save my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>Saved a bunch in fixing rather than trashing the old one.  </li>
            <li>I had no problem finding on-line instructions and replacing the old batteries of my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>I changed my old battery with this one.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll still have an old razor.  </li>
            <li>Removing the old battery was the challenge.  </li>
            <li>Instead I used a Dremel tool to cut off the old battery leads at the battery connections.  </li>
            <li>This was for an old Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>I have been asking for info to remove the old batteries from my shaver.</li>
            <li>replaced my old batteries with these with no hassle.</li>
            <li>My Norelco needs to be taken apart to change the battery, the old battery is soldered in from the inside.....</li>
            <li>I suggest you check your old battery before ordering this product.</li>
            <li>Pry the tabs off the old battery</li>
            <li>Before ordering, I charged up the old pack and ran the motor  while checking the voltage on each cell.</li>
            <li>I think these are around 7 years old.</li>
            <li>Had it for 2 weeks and works so far.</li>
            <li>Revived my old Norelco shaver that I almost tossed.</li>
            <li>I then cleaned the surfaces of the old leads that had been in contact with the batteries, using emery cloth wrapped around the eraser end of a pencil.</li>
            <li>The batteries were not holding a charge on my old Norelo shaver model 5825.</li>
            <li>I may have damaged the old razor in replacing the battery pack.</li>
            <li>Even if the old battery is discharged before removal, I found the replacement was charged.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize the old battery pack was soldered onto the circuit board.</li>
            <li>The two batteries were already tab soldered, so I put them in and the trimmer was alive again.</li>
            <li>was surprised to find no instruction how to install, so I wound up</li>
            <li>Originally when I installed the battery the razor worked and several days later it didn&#x27;t so I took the battery out and put the tabs facing the back of the razor, put it in the charger and it then charged the battery pack and once again worked.  </li>
            <li>) Solder the new leads to the old leads, re-install the spring clips, put the two halves of the shaver back together, and charge the new battery pack.</li>
            <li>Then put in the new batts with the terminals that are on the new batts folded back so they will press against the old batt terminals which come out of the pc board.</li>
            <li>On a full charge the display indicates 36 minutes remaining, but it typically dies after one or two uses.</li>
            <li>This should be soldered, but I just carefully pulled out the old batteries, and slipped in the new ones, making sure the contact was firm.</li>
            <li>I open the shaver by un-screw the two screws on the side-trim and on the main body.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: Your mileage may vary, but I&#x27;ve been using it this way for two weeks, both wet and dry, and everything&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The first problem is that the two screws for opening the case are \\&quot;torx\\&quot; head screws that are VERY recessed into the narrow plastic housing of the razor.</li>
            <li>He went out of his way to give me specific instructions for removing the old and installing the new battery.</li>
            <li>I would have simply bought a new razor but couldn&#x27;t find one like the Norelco Quadra Action 7885 XL I have.  </li>
            <li>I just took the back cover off and broke off the tabs off the old battery and then put the new battery in and blobbed some soldier on the tabs</li>
            <li>Next, I installed the new pack adjusting its leads so that they pressed against the old leads.</li>
            <li>Finally, I soldered the new and old leads together, using my smallest soldering iron.</li>
            <li>but my razor is back in action!!</li>
            <li>Battery easy to install,some soldering work to do,but only took a few minutes to do.</li>
            <li>I found that with the old strips standing straight up I could bend the new strips straight down to stick them in front of the old--making pretty firm contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:  Before inserting the new battery pack completely into the cradle, solder the new leads to the old leads; I did NOT solder them together, the old and new leads make sufficiently tight contact once the battery pack is fully inserted into the cradle.)       </li>
            <li>You need to remove the old battery pack carefully, clipping the old bottom leads and leaving as much \\&quot;sticking up\\&quot; as you can.    </li>
            <li>By the time I got around to taking it apart to replace the battery, I had waited way too long to really complain.</li>
            <li>Cutting the old lead from the original battery pack as close to the battery as possible will give you more to work with.</li>
            <li>The only solution to remove the dead batteries is to cut the lead off as close as possible to the battery, leaving the most material to work with.</li>
            <li>Your normal torx bits will be too short to reach the screws.</li>
            <li>The battery pack was exactly as advertized, arrived before the expected date, was not a problem to install and has certaiinly improved the performance of my razor.</li>
            <li>The space is sooo tight in there, that there&#x27;s enough pressure where the contacts are secure without soldering.</li>
            <li>Good product but a little hard to work with.</li>
            <li>Easy to buy, hard to install.</li>
            <li>the other battery had even less room, but i was able to stabilize the strip with the end of a screwdriver while wiggling and torquing the batter.  </li>
            <li>Install new batteries using proper soldering technique.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try them to see how they respond prior to getting a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>The shaver has worked like new (I also replaced the heads) for the entire 6 months.</li>
            <li>I could not get the tabs on the new battery pack to make a proper connection that would hold.</li>
            <li>did the same when installing new battery pack.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that you have to open the shaver and solder the wires to the new battery.  </li>
            <li>Desoldering the old batteries and getting the old solder out of the slot where the new tabs go in was the most difficult part of replacing the batteries.</li>
            <li>batteries lasted  exactly two years , who knows how long these will last.</li>
            <li>The battery pack was inside a tiny clear ziploc sleeve, and had been placed in a standard 5x7 yellow envelope with a half-dozen styrofoam peanuts -- it certainly wasn&#x27;t packed to cushion it or prevent damage.</li>
            <li>No other comment.</li>
            <li>no other observation.</li>
            <li>they are not easy to install but not impossible either.</li>
            <li>With my current battery completely dead, I removed it by clipping the pin connection at the battery - allowing me to solder the new battery right at the connections.</li>
            <li>Replaced because the original battery, which was several years old, only lasted a few shaves without requiring charging.</li>
            <li>It would have been helpful if instructions on how to dissasemble the shaver were available, but it wasn&#x27;t too hard to figure out.  </li>
            <li>I twisted on the battery until the first terminal broke free of the battery.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco 6705X shaver barely holds enough charge for one shave.  </li>
            <li>I found the key to soldering is to extend the leads fully and slip them underneath the snipped leads from the old batteries.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The batteries arrived early and I installed them last night.  </li>
            <li>Once you have the old batteries out, replacement is simple.</li>
            <li>The shaver wouldn&#x27;t run plugged in and it wouldn&#x27;t charge the battery enough for a complete shave.</li>
            <li>The old terminals in the razor pressed against the battery contacts, and no movement was possible.</li>
            <li>Also, getting the cover back in place is not a mindless snap job.</li>
            <li>Once in a while, not very often, someone does something really well.</li>
            <li>I inserted the pack at the bottom first, and then pressed it down at the sides until it snapped in.</li>
            <li>A big improvement on spending big bucks for a new razor.</li>
            <li>The long connectors on the new battery can be positioned so that they stay in contact with the metal connectors of the razor.  </li>
            <li>Soldered right in without trouble.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;V\\&quot; leads against the old battery pack flat leads.  </li>
            <li>Then I gently blew the inside of the shaver out with compressed air to remove any metal shavings and other debris.  </li>
            <li>The batteries can&#x27;t be installed in the 4853 razor without a special small torx driver to open the razor case.</li>
            <li>I will end up buying another razor, since there is no way to get a new battery installed for much less than the cost of a new razor - and in Los Angeles, there are</li>
            <li>Ever notice how the old item last practically forever and the new one (made in China) doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I clipped the old soldered connectors and simply replaced the spent batteries with these new batteries.</li>
            <li>Be sure you use a low wattage pencil  iron , and have thin rosin core solder available.&lt;br /&gt;old  </li>
            <li>Doubtful would fit on latest version of Norelco razor.</li>
            <li>I cut the old batteries loose, left enough tension on the leads to make contact with the new batteries when installed....replaced the cover</li>
            <li>Hopefully my new one will last as long and perform as well as this one did....</li>
            <li>The most important and difficult part was using a screwdriver and long nose pliars to carefully pry off the strips of soldered metal that goes down into the battery circuit board from the head of the old battery pack.</li>
            <li>so it would generally stay in contact with the internal connector, so</li>
            <li>Soldering the battery tabs should be done as quickly as possible while assuring a good connection as excessive heat is not good for the batteries.   </li>
            <li>This is not a bad idea, but I&#x27;m not sure it will work on this model razor, as the lead to one of the bateries is very short, even if cut as close to the battery as possible.</li>
            <li>My wife said buy a new shaver, I said for only a few dollars on this replacement battery I can have a like new shaver.  </li>
            <li>so that when the new battery pack is inserted into the cradle, the new leads are forced into contact against the old leads.</li>
            <li>And the cost was far less than if I had a professional do this.</li>
            <li>After several tries to make such a  connection, per the instructions, one of the new contacts simply broke off.</li>
            <li>I started off having a problem with the battery because it didn&#x27;t have the positive pole and negative pole marked, and with no initial charge on it</li>
            <li>Still only lasts 2-3 shaves before it runs weakly and the red charge light comes on.</li>
            <li>I then attached the other end of this wire to the new battery.  </li>
            <li>However, I would advise following a previous reviewers comments about not de-soldering the OEM battery tabs on the Remington&#x27;s board, just remove the old pack (bending them slightly worked for me) from the existing tabs and solder the new battery to the old tabs that are still attached to the board.  </li>
            <li>This entailed very carefully cutting the top off of the old batteries and then trimming.</li>

            <li> Everything else worked great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two use cycles now and they are working great.</li>

            <li> and they are still working great.</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great batteries</li>
            <li> Great price, works well.</li>
            <li> Works great and has the correct sized tabs.</li>
            <li> It worked great.</li>
            <li> Ok but not the best battery if you are looking for longevity  </li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the solder tabs on the battery...very easy to replace.</li>
            <li> The battery pack is perfect for this application and worked fine after installation.</li>
            <li> Good service from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I figured that even if this battery pack turned out to be a dud that for the cost I might extend the life of my razor until a good season for razor shopping to replace it.  </li>
            <li> you need to be good with a soldering iron.</li>
            <li> Product received in timely mannor and in good condition.</li>
            <li> The batteries are still good</li>
            <li> Forming a v-shape to the lead on the battery pack and tinning it [apply solder to it]will allow for a good connection.</li>
            <li> After charging for an hour and unplugging it, the razor works as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These batteries are good quality.  </li>
            <li> Good price and good service.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have good things to say about this product.</li>
            <li> Good bye.</li>
            <li> The batteries fit perfectly and wrked well.</li>
            <li> good as described would buy again</li>
            <li> This leads me to believe these are good 700 mAh cells.   </li>
            <li> I avoided throwing out an otherwise perfectly good shaver.</li>
            <li> The battery will fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> These batteries were a perfect fit for my Norelco 7865XL rechargeble shaver.</li>
            <li> also good to have one of those pencil type soldering guns.</li>
            <li> If you are patient, and good with your hands, you can install this battery.</li>
            <li> I did not realize as a user that I would need a Star Wrench bit and good soldering skills when I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I can run it off AC, which indicates a good connection.</li>
            <li> Battery pack fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Saved me from throwing a perfectly good razor into the land fill.</li>
            <li> Good company, on time shipping, good product.</li>
            <li> Good Deal.  </li>
            <li> and you should be good to go.  </li>
            <li> The battery retained a charge for 5 - 6 shaves (good) for about a week.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quick and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> (polarity is important!!)</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more !</li>
            <li> Almost 65% more capacity !</li>
            <li> Received product promptly and is easy to replace (if you have a soldering iron) and works great.</li>
            <li> Easily soldered into my shaver, and works great now.</li>
            <li> This battery is a perfect fit in the Norelco shaver and is easy to install.  </li>
            <li> Price was great, but it didn&#x27;t fit my model.</li>
            <li> Would be great if it would fit in the case.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t attempt this unless your handy with a soldering iron.  </li>
            <li> To concur with others I read about this: it is not for somebody that does not already own their own solder gun.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to be too handy to do this.</li>
            <li> nice.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best batteries for the price on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent that the batteries have tabs already attached, this makes soldering so much easier.  </li>
            <li> These batteries will discharge on their own over about a week of just sitting on my counter in my shaver..  </li>
            <li> Thank you, kindly</li>
            <li> But to be safe, I also decided to use a pinch of silicone glue along the batteries&#x27; underside once they were making good contact.</li>
            <li> The tabs took the solder nicely, unlike some I&#x27;ve seen.   </li>
            <li> If you are good with soldering circuit board stuff you will be able to do this battery change out.</li>
            <li> While you are replacing the battery pack, this would be a good opportunity to clean the shaver good.  </li>
            <li> After a day in the dock, it works perfectly like new!</li>
            <li> the batteries are working perfectly and the shaver is like new again.  </li>
            <li> This was a very easy to replace item.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fine and packaging was good</li>
            <li> These are great batteries worth the price</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly in restoring an old 8825XL razor.  </li>
            <li> This battery pack, which I purchased from QRW solutions, was a perfect replacement for my 10 year old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Being pretty handy and the advice here I would say this was a great fix.</li>
            <li> It would have been just as easy for Norelco to make the shaver with \\&quot;snap in\\&quot; batteries (maybe easier!)</li>
            <li> Charged over night and after a week still going strong!  </li>
            <li> going strong!</li>
            <li> When I first got the battery it worked great.</li>
            <li> For the first month or two I remained happy.</li>
            <li> Do some reading about how to do the installation before you try it unless you are very comfortable with de-soldering and soldering</li>
            <li> Have purchased two different battery packs and both were absolutely great, easy to install, have worked great and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Then bent connectors on new battery and wedged against original connector stubs for a flawless connection.</li>
            <li> i was however able to grab one of the strips with needle nose pliers, and while stabilizing it</li>
            <li> B000FP63M4 Shaver Battery Pack fits most Norelco models &amp; others]]</li>
            <li> I used a VTOM to be sure I identified the polarity.</li>
            <li> I activated a favorite razor and have been using it since.</li>
            <li> not too many of these items out there, so</li>
            <li> , it would not hold a charge more than 2 days.  </li>
            <li> and the two tabs toward the top of the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these batteries for a couple years now and can safely say that You Get What You Pay For.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the battery pack.  </li>
            <li> I was able to do it with a bit of effort.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It required some fiddling with the anti-fiddle screws that manufacturers love to use on appliances, and a bit of expertise with a soldering iron, but it wasn&#x27;t beyond my capabilities and made my shaver zoom again.</li>
            <li> checked Amazon and found this battery pack, then read the reviews, many of which contained valuable removal and installation instructions.</li>
            <li> I ran a bead of silicone caulk along the length of each battery, and placed them into the battery compartment, tabs touching tabs.</li>
            <li> When the batteries finally gave out, I looked into replacing them too, but when I opened the shaver up and saw what would be involved, including the \\&quot;time to do it\\&quot;, (isn&#x27;t &#x27;planned obsolescence&#x27; great!! )</li>
            <li> I love the free shipping!</li>
            <li> This strap is where the top screw holds the cover on.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I think you are rolling the dice to make these contacts work, but some of you more gifted will surely triumph.</li>
            <li> I have been able to buy those batteries from Amazom.</li>
            <li> You must be absolutely sure which battery pack your shaver takes before you purchase any replacement battery.  </li>
            <li> Great Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was able to instal with out soldering</li>
            <li> B000FP63M4 Shaver Battery Pack fits most Norelco models &amp; others]]I</li>
            <li> Look elsewhere for better quality.</li>
            <li> Ok I guess I have to add 6 more words to finish this</li>
            <li> Yeah, Do remember you&#x27;re working with a hot battery (sparks)!!!</li>
            <li> very easy installation, fast delivery and good cost.</li>
            <li> This new pack seems to work perfectly and holds a good strong charge and the heads rotate at the speed they did when the shaver was new.  </li>
            <li> The new batts work great &amp; give many shaves between charging.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive alternative to buying new.</li>
            <li> It is great to have my shaver working like new.</li>
            <li> My shaver works great again without having to spend $150 for a new one.</li>
            <li> You have to be able to solder electronic circuits to install this battery, but it is really easy.</li>
            <li> They make good positive contact.  </li>
            <li> My Norelco T990 was becoming unusable as one of the 2 batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and became unusable even connected via the power cord.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to risk unsoldering the old battery from the circuit board because I thought the risk of buggering the circuit board too great.</li>
            <li> I bent the tabs, so that they were touching and plugged in the razor to see if the charging light went on.</li>
            <li> These batteries are available from multiple sources but the price here was one of the best when you consider the free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I did not try to re-solder the new batteries, just made sure there was good lead contact.  </li>
            <li> and he/she will have you shaving   with full power in no time!  </li>
            <li> I hope Norelco has made this more user friendly in the newer models.</li>
            <li> It is as good as new!</li>
            <li> Relatively easy to install, but requires some knowledge of how mechanical items work.  </li>
            <li> Then, with the razor on its side, the battery will remain in place for easy soldering.  </li>
            <li> wan&#x27;t easy to install.</li>
            <li> It was easy to fix once i had these parts.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to do</li>
            <li> Once I figured out how to get into the shaver it was easy to install.  </li>
            <li> Batteries were easy to install and it did not even require soldering.  </li>
            <li> Not an easy install for the non-geek.  </li>
            <li> Relatively easy installation.  </li>
            <li> Easy installation.  </li>
            <li> Had to watch a video on how to install it, but it was fairly easy.</li>
            <li> it is easy &amp; you do not need to solder any thing or have a solder gun.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, but you do need a sodering gun.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace the existingn battery in my Norelco Quadra 7 razor.</li>
            <li> It would be easy to break the tab if the cover screws were tightened without this step.</li>
            <li> I read in the instructions about the soldering, but once it was apart, I realized this was not an easy solder &amp; space to work in.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace the batteries in the Norelco Shaver.</li>
            <li> EASY</li>
            <li> The battery pack is fairly easy to install . . .</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> They are still going strong.</li>
            <li> It was easy to solder in place and the shaver charges just fine.</li>
            <li> he was able to free the original batteries.</li>
            <li> Very speedy and powerful again, and best of all very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The new batteries work perfectly and the shaver now holds it&#x27;s charge like it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li> The shaver has been working good as new since the pack arrived.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is as good as new now.  </li>
            <li> Everything works fine.  </li>
            <li> These batteries seem to be just fine and saved my shaver from discard.</li>
            <li> After recharging, the battery and the shaver works fine again.</li>
            <li> Works just fine when finished.  </li>
            <li> However, it charged fine and works well.</li>
            <li> This battery pack worked fine.  </li>
            <li> I did solder it in since my soldering skills are fine.</li>
            <li> works just fine in my razor</li>
            <li> Need some soldering but fine with me.</li>
            <li> Product performs just fine.</li>
            <li> a year ago it worked fine for a while</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t attempt this if you don&#x27;t have a fine soldering unit available.</li>
            <li> I did not attempt to unsolder the original contacts from the circuit board itself, although I see it can be done quite easily.  </li>
            <li> The plastic sleeves hold the connections secure whereas there is no need of sorder.</li>
            <li> The many success stories on the reviews convinced me that these were legit.  </li>
            <li> All went smooth but battery does not hold charge well.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with that, but if you have no choice why not give it a try?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with that, but if you have no choice why not give it a try?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was fortunate in that my re-assembly did not require any soldering (it is held in place by friction, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem in over a year)</li>
            <li> Everything was just flopping around freely inside, and the peanuts served no purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fit was snug and secure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> HE INSTALLED IT FOR FREE</li>
            <li> --mine lasted a year before weekly re-charging; others are available with longer life</li>
            <li> Fit and worked.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Seller said this would fit in Norelco shaver 6826 XL, and it did not.</li>
            <li> While the battery pack fit the shaver it must be soldered in place.  </li>
            <li> They fit into my Reming trimmer without modification.</li>
            <li> Had to move tab to get it to fit without soldering.  </li>
            <li> Considerable difficulty in installation; else a good item.</li>
            <li> After 2 months, so far so good.  </li>
            <li> They are no where near as good as the original batteries that came with my Norelco shaver, but considering the amount  I paid for them, they are fine.</li>
            <li> terminal tab is the one on the right when holding the pack with the tabs at the top and facing away from you.  </li>
            <li> but most anyone can if they have access to the right screw driver and needle nose pliers can do it.</li>
            <li> Easy to order and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I am pleased I was able to order new batteries from them.  </li>
            <li> Remember to recycle the old NiCd battery set at Best Buy or Wal-Mart as it is hazardous waste.</li>
            <li> Make a note with a sharpie as to where the original  + and - ends of the batteries were in the razor.</li>
            <li> When I could not figure out how to get the original battery out of the shaver I called the vendor.  </li>
            <li> Also be patient while doing this, a hot soldering iron is murder on plastic parts :)  </li>
            <li> I instead soldered a connecting wire between the battery terminals and stubs of the original connectors.  </li>
            <li> I replace them when the original batteries held no charge at all</li>
            <li> Installed these babies in my Norelco shaver and now it works better than when I first got the shaver.</li>
            <li> Battery works like original.  </li>
            <li> I cut the original battery out with cuticle scissors.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this purchase because it did exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> Rich  </li>
            <li> and once they arrived discharged my shaver&#x27;s original battery and opened the case.</li>
            <li> my batteries were covered in corrosion, so i had to clean all the gunk off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to use the indent on the batteries to know which is positive</li>
            <li> Its best if you can cut the tabs on the battery you are replacing, then just solder the new tabs to the old tabs, this makes replacement much easier.</li>
            <li> The battery will work in one orientation only, the best way to find that out is by dry fitting it both orientations and watching the shaver function.</li>
            <li> let it get nice and hot first, then do it quickly so you dont&#x27; cook the circuitry.</li>
            <li> That takes a lot of expertise and special equipment and if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, you&#x27;ll ruin the PC board.  </li>
            <li> Soldering is not difficult and a cheap soldering iron will work just fine.</li>
            <li> Although you need to solder the connections which isn&#x27;t to hard to do, these batteries work great!</li>
            <li> The shaver&#x27;s hardware told me the battery is at full charge, and perhaps stopped the charging process</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea, while your in there, to remove any bits of beard inside the housing and lubricate the gears with white grease.</li>
            <li> I think it would be much more straight forward to go this way.  </li>
            <li> I had heard that replacing the unit&#x27;s rechargeable batteries was more hassle than it was worth, particularly because they had to be soldered and because it was easy to ruin the circuit board.</li>
            <li> short, I am delighted with the outcome.</li>
            <li> Sounds like I am a real clutz, but not so with most \\&quot;do</li>
            <li> The shaver lights came on and read full charge, but my Norelco Reflex Plus shaver won&#x27;t run off the battery.</li>
            <li> Hold the charge fair enough.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, easy solder install, charged up nice and now my shaver functions like new...</li>
            <li> Take old batteries and put new batteries on shaver, recharge batteries very well and work batteries very good and no problems</li>
            <li> Glad i did, Shaver is like new!</li>
            <li> I wish they were only like, $4.00, but I&#x27;m glad to have given more life to my Norelco.</li>
            <li> They shipment arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> This pack arrived quickly and when I installed them did the trick.  </li>
            <li> It was not a trivial task but not impossible.   </li>
            <li> luckily nothing broke.  </li>
            <li> Fits perfectly - with a little soldering and directions off the internet, my Norelco shaver is like new again!</li>
            <li> The best way to remove the old batteries is to use a solder wick or suction device to remove the old melted solder from the board before unbending the connectors and removing the old battery set.</li>
            <li> Fit as original, and holding charge very well.</li>
            <li> Exact fit didn&#x27;t even have to solder connections</li>
            <li> I thought the cost was very reasonable, but I did not realize I would have to unsolder the old one, somewhat tricky although I am experienced at this, and resolder the new battery in place.</li>
            <li> If you have the tools for the job, it is an easy task, and certainly beats the replacement cost of the razor.</li>
            <li> As I have said in the past, I knew that this wasn&#x27;t going to be a five minute job, and it certainly was not, but the end result is excellent.</li>
            <li> (Norelco might argue with me - I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d rather have you buy a new shaver)</li>
            <li> Making sure of the position of the poles I slid the shaver&#x27;s connections into those of the new battery.</li>
            <li> Much better than throwing it away and getting a new one.</li>
            <li> I am able to live with this because the charger is always plugged in any way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m now looking for some new replacements and you can be sure, I&#x27;ll look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> At first I tried replacement with more modern MIMH battery but the Norelco charging system was not compatible.</li>
            <li> Having gone through this \\&quot;ordeal\\&quot; the new batteries don&#x27;t feel as strong as the original, I may have shorted something during installation.  </li>
            <li> The battery pack works fine, but is a real bear to install.</li>
            <li> and I can just remove the battery pack with a little tug and blade to break the silicone bead.razor works great.</li>
            <li> But if you are a little talented, this is an amazing improvement over the old dying batteries.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I agree with others who said do NOT attempt to solder: it&#x27;s not necessary, and would require the right tools and some decent experience to do successfully.    </li>
            <li> Having replaced batteries in my over 20 year old Norelco many, many times, soldering was old hat.</li>
            <li> fast shipping fit</li>
            <li> worth the $10 and 10 minutes of work</li>
            <li> I thought I was handy enough to replace my shaver batteries.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s nice to breathe life back into an otherwise perfectly-good razor (since my razor won&#x27;t even run when plugged-in unless the batteries are somewhat working?).</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the bother.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced the blades on my shaver, so the shave was nice and close.</li>
            <li> Even took it to a friend who has far more electronic experience than I do and he gave up.  </li>
            <li> It might be OK, but I did not use it since I can not replace the old one in my shaver.</li>
            <li> These are far too challenging to install in shavers.  </li>
            <li> i had fun soldering them in.</li>
            <li> Even if it did not work, it would have been worth the effort to try to save the shaver.  </li>
            <li> well worth it.</li>
            <li> Glad to have my old trimmer operational again.</li>
            <li> This battery pack turned my razor into new again, very simple to install if you are handy with your hands, If not there are videos on U Tube explaining in easy steps on how to install.</li>
            <li> With the help of online videos on how to properly replace my husband&#x27;s, Norelco, this battery works even better than the original.</li>
            <li> my battery worked right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Installation is a bit tricky if you do not have the right tools.</li>
            <li> Item was the right price.  </li>
            <li> Priced right, fairly easy to install, holds the charge well---over-all, it&#x27;s like having a brand new</li>
            <li> All they had to do was put non-soldering terminals on the circuit board and a new battery could have been installed easily.  </li>
            <li> With the new strips pushed in front of the old my plug in/time dial lit up, so I used a piece of duct tape to make the batteries in the battery holder in the shaver more secure from jiggling.</li>
            <li> than that problem, this new battery works fine.</li>
            <li> Now, instead of telling me the battery is fully charged, the indicator on the shaver shows me that it is charging, and the battery gets pretty warm, so maybe I didn&#x27;t connect it fully or properly the first time.    </li>
            <li> The battery originally installed in the shaver lasted for many years (5-10, I don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ve had it).</li>
            <li> These batteries did not work as apparently special slightly higher voltages are needed for certain applications.  </li>
            <li> Worked fine in my very old Gizmo can opener.</li>
            <li> The batteries were cheap and I would have to buy a new razor if I couldn&#x27;t install them anyway.  </li>
            <li> Batteries received on time and the old batteries were easy to get out.</li>
            <li> My Norelco rechargeable razor is about 11 years old and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Worked at first and I was pleased but after a couple of months they wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a few days.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased that I have a fairly new razor after replacing the head last year.</li>
            <li> It looked like it hadn&#x27;t been used very much, if at all.</li>
            <li> I do have solder experience, I did de-solder and install the new ones with the full process, and am not convinced I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> Not all internet sellers are willing to be that helpful.</li>
            <li> Heat both metal pieces before applying a liberal amount of solder -- but not too hot to melt the plastic.  </li>
            <li> First charge, one day over two weeks</li>
            <li> Would most definitely recommend this product!        </li>
            <li> However, if you plan to replace the batteries in your shaver, be aware that this is a repair.  </li>
            <li> The batteries first charge lasted 3 weeks and are still going.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly as described and was delivered promptly.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted 7 years.</li>
            <li> It was the first model to use the Nivea packs.    </li>
            <li> Disassembly of this Norelco was more tricky than my last Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> This situation was the reason I replaced them in the first place.</li>
            <li> Actually, it&#x27;s one step better than the reason I replaced them.</li>
            <li> Worked first try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original : I can&#x27;t say for sure the longevity of these, but initially, the motor speed is slower, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to like to be charged with the factory charger.  </li>
            <li> It has now been more than two weeks since I put on the initial charge.</li>
            <li> but i thought i would try this battery first.</li>
            <li> When I opened the shaver up the soldering looked way too delicate for me to accomplish but the experienced radio man did it in just a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as it was advertised.  </li>
            <li> I just put it on the charging stand for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Armed with the detailed \\&quot;how to\\&quot; from J. Muir, I ordered my batteries, got out my son&#x27;s old soldering iron</li>
            <li> The seller sent to me better replacement batteries than I ordered at no extra charge!!</li>
            <li> battery life for weeks when first installed&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> Something not mentioned if the razor is a model with the trimmer blade: When replacing the the back cover of the razor make sure the drive motor tab is engaged in the notch of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The need for a tool was the first surprise -</li>
            <li> The installation instructions provided by the seller were exact.  </li>
            <li> Packaged well and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> When my Quad Action Norelco shaver batteries were barely able to hold a day&#x27;s charge, I considered buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> However, a quick look at the new Not-Relcos made in China cleared my thinking.</li>
            <li> My husband is sure that it last much longer than the oem</li>
            <li> Just be aware, when you buy ANY battery for your electric razor, you will almost certainly have to solder it to the circuit board.  </li>
            <li> Thanks very much.</li>
            <li> The new batteries are fine and my machine works like new</li>
            <li> As described in the other reviews, the original is soldered into the shaver instead of being designed for easy removal and replacement.</li>
            <li> is the Positive end of the battery.</li>
            <li> and I figured spending $9.38+WSST for new batteries is worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciated</li>
            <li> Just make sure the new metal strips from the new batteries touch the curved old metal strips to make a connection.  </li>
            <li> It works fine after I replaced the old worn out battery in my Norelco shaver with this new one.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a fairly easy repair, but have had a lot of experience working on electronic items - and have the necessary tools!</li>
            <li> The battery replacement was easy following the guidelines of others here.</li>
            <li> If the batteries last as long as the originals they will be a good deal, assuming you can install them.  </li>
            <li> My unit is still going strong on my initial charge with no sign of needing to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have charged it once after repair and still going strong 3 weeks later without recharge yet.</li>
            <li> but they need us to buy new ones for their bottom line!!</li>
            <li> Worked OK for the first few months but never held a charge worth a darn.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth buying and replacing the batteries instead of buying a whole new shaver.  </li>
            <li> The manufactures are more interested in selling us NEW razors, so unlike many other products that have reasonably simple to change batteries, razors require an expertise you may not have.  </li>
            <li> The contact was solid and the razor worked fine.  </li>
            <li> These batteries seemed to be working fine when I initially installed them.  </li>
            <li> You have to be a little handy to install them</li>
            <li> You will need to unsolder the old pack and use the original plastic battery holder to hold the new pack.  </li>
            <li> this norelco has been working fine for the past 4yrs and purchasing a new one isn&#x27;t really appealing.  </li>
            <li> It took quite a few until the battery placement felt secure and when plugged in, the charge light went on.</li>
            <li> Fit with no problems at all, plus it was much cheaper than local sources.</li>
            <li> This involved some non-intuitve techniques and I appreciated the help they provided.  </li>
            <li> (it stopped recording after about 2 years and Philips did not make the necessary replacement part available).</li>
            <li> and _should_ be capable of soldering it</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I have some experience with electronic repair/construction and have the necessary tools.  </li>
            <li> Norelco really has put built in planned obsolescence in their shavers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to rate this item.  </li>
            <li> so I had to bend them back to fit.</li>
            <li> and it was ready to go.</li>
            <li> I have Torx drivers, a soldering iron, resin core solder and a mini-pliers set all ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This battery pack fits my Norelco very well.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> (didn&#x27;t want to create too much heat) but pinched them into place.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the service.</li>
            <li> Order was followed up on by supplier to be sure everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> However, I have gotten five or more shaves after it shows it is empty.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see much change in performance.</li>
            <li> QRW provided fast service and the battery pack arrived almost fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Item was as described and was shipped out fast.  </li>
            <li> Be ready to disassemble and solder the battery into place, but when completed, ~</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> These fit right into my old Norelco razor, and it was not necessary to solder them in place.</li>
            <li> TO KNOW THAT YOU FIRST HAVE TO CHARGE THE NEW BATTERY BEFORE IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> I was able to solder the positive terminal directly and nestle the new batteries back into their cradle.</li>
            <li> The idea is to leave as much of the metal leads as possible visible and accessible in the cradle.    </li>
            <li> The overall life of the battery was much shorter than the original</li>
            <li> These new batteries last for over a month now and have strong energy after charging.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s shaver technically doesn&#x27;t accept this replacement since the original batteries were tack welded in, but once he figured out he couldn&#x27;t break the shaver</li>
            <li> the charging time same as the original.</li>
            <li> course, it would much easier if the vendor/manufacturer just added the conventional + and - signs appropriately.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time that I replaced these batteries on my Norelco Razor ,,,I purchaced two other newer Norelco razors but neither shave as good as this older model</li>
            <li> Then, curve the metal strip and put the new battery pack, which comes with 2 metal strips already back on the battery holder with the correct polarity (it fits just fine).  </li>
            <li> I would recommend having an accomplished electronic technician do the installation unless you are pretty skilled with a small soldering iron.</li>
            <li> But for a few bucks to save an old favorite shaver, it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li> make sure you put it in with the strips down</li>
            <li> Mine now runs like new!</li>
            <li> and the battery is still performing as well as it did when new!</li>
            <li> Just like when it was new!</li>
            <li> I really like my shaver but didn&#x27;t want to have to plug it into the wall every time I used it or shell out over $100 for a new one.  </li>
            <li> The new battery made a huge difference, the charge life is back to like new and the shaver runs stronger longer.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Less is more...</li>
            <li> But I came across these batteries on Ebay, found them for less on Amazon, gave them a try, and am glad</li>
            <li> how-to videos on the web, but they may not be anything like your particular razor, so think about trying to replace a battery before you make the purchase.</li>
            <li> how many hours they will put out one milliamp of electrical current,EG if your razor takes 100milliamps of current to run its motor , the batts would run your razor motor for 10 hours --simple !!)</li>
            <li> the shaver was powerful, retained power for a long time, and delivered consistent power.  </li>
            <li> Make sure its in the right position though and follow the simple instruction outlined here in the other reviews</li>
            <li> but I figured the end with ridge around it is positive looking at my old batteries.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if if keeps charges for as long as original.  </li>
            <li> some parts on the PWB (a choke and an IC) became very hot in a second.  </li>
            <li> I said in the second sentence of this review, whether they are a good deal or not depends on how long they last.  </li>
            <li> I said in the second sentence of this review, whether they are a good deal or not depends on how long they last.  </li>
            <li> I had the shaver for a very long time (about 13 years) and the batteries were finally not holding a charge anymore, was only able to operate the shaver for about a minute before the original batteries died.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend a solder removal bulb before you attempt this.</li>
            <li> Cut off the old prongs as close to the old battery ends as possible because leaving the old prongs in place creates a nice tight friction fit when you push in the new prongs.</li>
            <li> (I added a little foam inside U to be sure contacts would stay connected), 4.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it may not matter, but the batteries are not marked for polarity but keep the positive terminal on your right side.  </li>
            <li> It really is as easy as the multi-step instructions listed in other comments indicate.  </li>
            <li> Unless I when to the trouble of building some kind of temporary cradle, it was more straight forward to use a little solid wire to connect the batteries rather that take a chance on damaging the motor connections while refitting the battery connectors.  </li>
            <li> The new NiCad battery works well with my older Norelco Shaver.</li>
            <li> hence they are a total success.  </li>
            <li> to the good stuff: The pack has two small leads at one end, each with a tiny rubber sleeve, which I removed.</li>
            <li> However, after about two or three months, the batteries stopped holding their charge for more than a few days and would die and need to be recharged again.</li>
            <li> This shaver battery pack has made my shaver operate  normal.  </li>
            <li> the low price of new razors it would seem to be more trouble than it worth to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> It takes some technical skill to disassemble, de-solder and solder in a new set but worth doing to save $130 or so on a replacement shaver.</li>
            <li> The new battery pack was easy to replace after reading other reviews and I also did not solder the new battery leads.</li>
            <li> 6826XL  ,,,one would think that they would improve  the product not make it worse and the motor even sounds better and stronger than either of my newer quick charge models</li>
            <li> It seems like the new cells  are working normally.   </li>
            <li> I spent hours looking at the new Norelo models and could not justify spending over one hundred dollars on the new cheaply made models.</li>
            <li> Putting the new battery back in was easy, I just bent the tabs instead of soldering back in.  </li>
            <li> like the other guys said leave the tabs nice and long- makes it easier to solder yours in.</li>
            <li> gently fold the strips down semi-flat, and clean off corrosion with a pencil eraser</li>
            <li> i bent the strips on the new batteries out at about a 45 degree angle and laid them in the plastic battery tray.  </li>
            <li> The new batteries have insulated sleeves covering their connectors.</li>
            <li> Then bend the new battery pack</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to order a new battery set</li>
            <li> Bend the leads of the new battery pack into a &#x60;V&#x27; shape</li>
            <li> Saved myself around $100 by not buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Just snap apart your trimmer and replace the rechargeable battery rather than throwing the unit away and buying a new one.  </li>
            <li> It was like I had a new razor.</li>
            <li> However be warned, you must solder the new batteries  and I had a devil of a time disassembling the shaver to get to the internals.</li>
            <li> easier to buy a new razr</li>
            <li> As others noted, the + - terminals of the new batteries are not identified.  </li>
            <li> i had the choice of getting a new battery or getting a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> the new one on.   </li>
            <li> Since I wanted to avoid having to spring for a new shaver at this time</li>
            <li> I then bent the lead straps on the new batteries in an inverted V shape, inserted the pack into the cradle with the new leads over the lead straps sticking up from the circuit board.  </li>
            <li> My shaver is like new.  </li>
            <li> Bend the leads of the new battery pack into a &#x60;V&#x27; shape</li>
            <li> The new batteries did not have polarity indicated on them so had to test to see which tab was plus.  </li>
            <li> Observing polarity, I soldered the wires to the new battery tabs and placed the battery in the razor tucking the wires out of the way.  </li>
            <li> With the new batteries, I can again go weeks between charges.  </li>
            <li> Then I bent the connector strips into spring contacts for the new batteries.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself a lot of money by restoring your shaver instead of buying a new one.</li>
            <li> I now have &amp;#34;a new shaver&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Cheaper then new shaver.</li>
            <li> My trusty razor works like new again.</li>
            <li> New life for the tri-shaver.  </li>
            <li> This battery pack breathed new life into a shaver that my Dad was using while he was visiting on vacation.</li>
            <li> The shaver now holds a charge as if it was new.</li>
            <li> I gave up on the install and just bought a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Now the shaver has new life.</li>
            <li> Works like new now.</li>
            <li> I was going to but a new shaver</li>
            <li> Battery pack has given new life to my nine-year-old Norelco Quadra 7865XL shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> For that, I can buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> a new one would be doing my part to help the economy anyway,</li>
            <li> Fold over the tabs on the new pack, and pop in the new pack.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the razor 15 times since installing the new cells.   </li>
            <li> I figured $6.00 vs. a new razor I would try the replacement myself.</li>
            <li> I installed and charged the new batteries two weeks ago</li>
            <li> and so I decided to retire the shaver in favor of a new one now that the new battery quit holding a charge.</li>
            <li> I soldered the new one in.</li>
            <li> I watched a video on youtube that showed how to install this new battery.</li>
            <li> find the video for norelco shaver battery replacement for your model number, on youtube, then Fix your shaver like new for $10.</li>
            <li> this batttery pack works just great,charged battery works like new.</li>
            <li> After installation, I charged my new batteries.  </li>
            <li> In my case I tested the motor after installing the new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Feels like I&#x27;ve got a new razor.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this for anyone needing a new battery pack for their razer.</li>
            <li> buy a new one?</li>
            <li> you will have a new razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like new again.</li>
            <li> This pack had a slightly lower voltage than the original batteries and hence the razor did not spin as fast, which was issue #</li>
            <li> This battery pack was installed in an seventeen year old Norelco shaver and the shaver is working like new!  </li>
            <li> I was happy to find these and replace my dead ones, but after a few months they aren&#x27;t holding a charge</li>
            <li> Once both are soldered, the leads are flexible enough that you can push the battery pack forward so that the leads will fold up to make room to put the battery pack back into the slot securely.  </li>
            <li> I did charge them and ran the batteries down to recharge and everything seems fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this battery pack for a very old Remington shaver that stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> The new pack has two flat leads that are about 3 mm wide, one will fit thru the board to the top side where you can solder it on the board, the other will not without trimming it down about a mm to fit thru the hole.  </li>
            <li> Once this was complete it was easy to solder the new battery leads to the old batter leads, reassemble the shaver and charge the battery the conventional way.  </li>
            <li> turns out that the install was pretty simple.  </li>
            <li> This year I replaced the NiCad batteries for the second time (first time</li>
            <li> Along with the battery, make sure you have a solder iron and some solder, and don&#x27;t forget a small precision screwdriver.</li>
            <li> About 6 months ago I replaced the original batteries in my Norelco shaver with these after several years of daily use.</li>
            <li> I know most battery operated devices use small springs to maintain contact, so I thought I&#x27;d give the procedure a try.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty simple.</li>
            <li> My other batteries were the original after 7 years and were not holding a charge for longer than 1 day.</li>
            <li> so that when the new battery pack is in the cradle, the new leads are against the old leads in the PC board.  </li>
            <li> That way, I avoided having to solder the new batteries into place, and if I ever have to replace them again, I can just pop out the old batteries and slip in the new set.  </li>
            <li> Once the shaver is disassembled, the connectors between the circuit board and the little motor are unsupported and easily damaged.  </li>
            <li> I threw my old shaver and the batteries in the trash and bought a new razor.</li>
            <li> In order to install these you have to de-solder the old battery at the circuit board, then insert the tabs of the new battery into the slots on the circuit board and solder them in place.  </li>
            <li> The replacement required de-soldering the old pack and re-soldering the new.  </li>
            <li> I cheated and cut the old battery leads, trimmed the new battery</li>
            <li> Far cheaper than a new $80 one (if you can find the refurbs anymore).</li>
            <li> I understood the instructions and de-soldered the old Norelco battery as instructed and got the new tabs in place and soldered them.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews talk about dropping in the new batteries (after somehow removing the old ones) creating a press contact.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews talk about dropping in the new batteries (after somehow removing the old ones) creating a press contact.  </li>
            <li> I tensioned the new pack towards the old lead with a piece of wood wedged in between the battery and two capisitors.</li>
            <li> Look online for help on how to disassemble shaver, take out the old one and put the new one in.  </li>
            <li> bend new battery contacts into U shape to make contact with old battery contacts</li>
            <li> I un-soldered the old ones and soldered in the new ones.</li>
            <li> The batteries are a direct replacement for my Razor, and function just like a new unit.</li>
            <li> Both the old and new batteries were in sets of two already glued together and soldered by a strip at their bases.</li>
            <li> I straightened them so that I could solder the strips from the new batteries to the strips remaining from the old.</li>
            <li> Razor would show 45 minutes of shaving time with the old battery but with the new battery it shows about 30.</li>
            <li> Now my old shaver works like new again.</li>
            <li> You will need to remove the old battery and install the new one with a soldering iron.  </li>
            <li> It made an old shaver feel like new again.</li>
            <li> When I talked to Norelce the shaver was so old they advised to just use it as a &amp;#34;plugged&amp;#34; razor or toss &amp; buy a new one.</li>
            <li> The tip on soldering the old tabs to the new tabs was helpful.</li>
            <li> Nothing before or after advised that the old battery leads were soldered in and the new needed to be soldered in.</li>
            <li> cut the old battery out put in the new one in.</li>
            <li> Take note of the polarity of the old battery (i.e. you want to connect the positive battery terminal on the new battery to the same wire).  </li>
            <li> The original batteries in my razor lasted about 10 years -- these lasted less than two years.  </li>
            <li> The original batteries in my razor lasted about 10 years -- these lasted less than two years.  </li>
            <li> Removing the old battery pack was a little tricky and then you have to solder the new pack back into the shaver so you have to be a little mechanical (and have a steady hand) to make the change (or know a good handyman).  </li>
            <li> only problem with this thing was that installing it required the removal of the original battery that was soldered (not sure if that&#x27;s the right term, but there were two metal pieces that were melted onto the circuit board that attached the battery to the unit) to the circuit board.  </li>
            <li> Rather, there was considerable verbage about recycling the whole shaver properly when the batteries died.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;2 gently pry off the back cover</li>
            <li> i gently worked the battery back and forth until the connection broke.  </li>
            <li> Let the shaver run to discharge the old battery pack.   </li>
            <li> The batteries had the tabs needed to attach the battery directly to the circuit board.  </li>
            <li> This has to be done on tiny connectors in a very restrictive location.  </li>
            <li> Ordered 2 sets of batteries and fixed two shavers.  </li>
            <li> I had already clipped the old battery from its terminals with wire cutters and taken it to radio shack, where I thought I&#x27;d find an off-the-shelf replacement.</li>
            <li> I replaced my 10 year old shaver battery with this.  </li>
            <li> Took some work though, had to de-solder the old battery out.  </li>
            <li> On my Norelco 6885XL, my steps were: 1) Let the shaver run to discharge the old battery pack.  </li>
            <li> BUT it is not just a drop and load pack you will have to unsolder the old pack from the circuit board in the shaver to install this one.  </li>
            <li> I pried the old battery from the metal strips in the razor noting which strip was plus.  </li>
            <li> Allowed me to save my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> Saved a bunch in fixing rather than trashing the old one.  </li>
            <li> I had no problem finding on-line instructions and replacing the old batteries of my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> I changed my old battery with this one.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll still have an old razor.  </li>
            <li> Removing the old battery was the challenge.  </li>
            <li> Instead I used a Dremel tool to cut off the old battery leads at the battery connections.  </li>
            <li> This was for an old Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been asking for info to remove the old batteries from my shaver.</li>
            <li> replaced my old batteries with these with no hassle.</li>
            <li> My Norelco needs to be taken apart to change the battery, the old battery is soldered in from the inside.....</li>
            <li> I suggest you check your old battery before ordering this product.</li>
            <li> Pry the tabs off the old battery</li>
            <li> Before ordering, I charged up the old pack and ran the motor  while checking the voltage on each cell.</li>
            <li> I think these are around 7 years old.</li>
            <li> Had it for 2 weeks and works so far.</li>
            <li> Revived my old Norelco shaver that I almost tossed.</li>
            <li> I then cleaned the surfaces of the old leads that had been in contact with the batteries, using emery cloth wrapped around the eraser end of a pencil.</li>
            <li> The batteries were not holding a charge on my old Norelo shaver model 5825.</li>
            <li> I may have damaged the old razor in replacing the battery pack.</li>
            <li> Even if the old battery is discharged before removal, I found the replacement was charged.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the old battery pack was soldered onto the circuit board.</li>
            <li> The two batteries were already tab soldered, so I put them in and the trimmer was alive again.</li>
            <li> was surprised to find no instruction how to install, so I wound up</li>
            <li> Originally when I installed the battery the razor worked and several days later it didn&#x27;t so I took the battery out and put the tabs facing the back of the razor, put it in the charger and it then charged the battery pack and once again worked.  </li>
            <li> ) Solder the new leads to the old leads, re-install the spring clips, put the two halves of the shaver back together, and charge the new battery pack.</li>
            <li> Then put in the new batts with the terminals that are on the new batts folded back so they will press against the old batt terminals which come out of the pc board.</li>
            <li> On a full charge the display indicates 36 minutes remaining, but it typically dies after one or two uses.</li>
            <li> This should be soldered, but I just carefully pulled out the old batteries, and slipped in the new ones, making sure the contact was firm.</li>
            <li> I open the shaver by un-screw the two screws on the side-trim and on the main body.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: Your mileage may vary, but I&#x27;ve been using it this way for two weeks, both wet and dry, and everything&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The first problem is that the two screws for opening the case are \\&quot;torx\\&quot; head screws that are VERY recessed into the narrow plastic housing of the razor.</li>
            <li> He went out of his way to give me specific instructions for removing the old and installing the new battery.</li>
            <li> I would have simply bought a new razor but couldn&#x27;t find one like the Norelco Quadra Action 7885 XL I have.  </li>
            <li> I just took the back cover off and broke off the tabs off the old battery and then put the new battery in and blobbed some soldier on the tabs</li>
            <li> Next, I installed the new pack adjusting its leads so that they pressed against the old leads.</li>
            <li> Finally, I soldered the new and old leads together, using my smallest soldering iron.</li>
            <li> but my razor is back in action!!</li>
            <li> Battery easy to install,some soldering work to do,but only took a few minutes to do.</li>
            <li> I found that with the old strips standing straight up I could bend the new strips straight down to stick them in front of the old--making pretty firm contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :  Before inserting the new battery pack completely into the cradle, solder the new leads to the old leads; I did NOT solder them together, the old and new leads make sufficiently tight contact once the battery pack is fully inserted into the cradle.)       </li>
            <li> You need to remove the old battery pack carefully, clipping the old bottom leads and leaving as much \\&quot;sticking up\\&quot; as you can.    </li>
            <li> By the time I got around to taking it apart to replace the battery, I had waited way too long to really complain.</li>
            <li> Cutting the old lead from the original battery pack as close to the battery as possible will give you more to work with.</li>
            <li> The only solution to remove the dead batteries is to cut the lead off as close as possible to the battery, leaving the most material to work with.</li>
            <li> Your normal torx bits will be too short to reach the screws.</li>
            <li> The battery pack was exactly as advertized, arrived before the expected date, was not a problem to install and has certaiinly improved the performance of my razor.</li>
            <li> The space is sooo tight in there, that there&#x27;s enough pressure where the contacts are secure without soldering.</li>
            <li> Good product but a little hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Easy to buy, hard to install.</li>
            <li> the other battery had even less room, but i was able to stabilize the strip with the end of a screwdriver while wiggling and torquing the batter.  </li>
            <li> Install new batteries using proper soldering technique.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try them to see how they respond prior to getting a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> The shaver has worked like new (I also replaced the heads) for the entire 6 months.</li>
            <li> I could not get the tabs on the new battery pack to make a proper connection that would hold.</li>
            <li> did the same when installing new battery pack.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that you have to open the shaver and solder the wires to the new battery.  </li>
            <li> Desoldering the old batteries and getting the old solder out of the slot where the new tabs go in was the most difficult part of replacing the batteries.</li>
            <li> batteries lasted  exactly two years , who knows how long these will last.</li>
            <li> The battery pack was inside a tiny clear ziploc sleeve, and had been placed in a standard 5x7 yellow envelope with a half-dozen styrofoam peanuts -- it certainly wasn&#x27;t packed to cushion it or prevent damage.</li>
            <li> No other comment.</li>
            <li> no other observation.</li>
            <li> they are not easy to install but not impossible either.</li>
            <li> With my current battery completely dead, I removed it by clipping the pin connection at the battery - allowing me to solder the new battery right at the connections.</li>
            <li> Replaced because the original battery, which was several years old, only lasted a few shaves without requiring charging.</li>
            <li> It would have been helpful if instructions on how to dissasemble the shaver were available, but it wasn&#x27;t too hard to figure out.  </li>
            <li> I twisted on the battery until the first terminal broke free of the battery.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco 6705X shaver barely holds enough charge for one shave.  </li>
            <li> I found the key to soldering is to extend the leads fully and slip them underneath the snipped leads from the old batteries.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The batteries arrived early and I installed them last night.  </li>
            <li> Once you have the old batteries out, replacement is simple.</li>
            <li> The shaver wouldn&#x27;t run plugged in and it wouldn&#x27;t charge the battery enough for a complete shave.</li>
            <li> The old terminals in the razor pressed against the battery contacts, and no movement was possible.</li>
            <li> Also, getting the cover back in place is not a mindless snap job.</li>
            <li> Once in a while, not very often, someone does something really well.</li>
            <li> I inserted the pack at the bottom first, and then pressed it down at the sides until it snapped in.</li>
            <li> A big improvement on spending big bucks for a new razor.</li>
            <li> The long connectors on the new battery can be positioned so that they stay in contact with the metal connectors of the razor.  </li>
            <li> Soldered right in without trouble.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;V\\&quot; leads against the old battery pack flat leads.  </li>
            <li> Then I gently blew the inside of the shaver out with compressed air to remove any metal shavings and other debris.  </li>
            <li> The batteries can&#x27;t be installed in the 4853 razor without a special small torx driver to open the razor case.</li>
            <li> I will end up buying another razor, since there is no way to get a new battery installed for much less than the cost of a new razor - and in Los Angeles, there are</li>
            <li> Ever notice how the old item last practically forever and the new one (made in China) doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I clipped the old soldered connectors and simply replaced the spent batteries with these new batteries.</li>
            <li> Be sure you use a low wattage pencil  iron , and have thin rosin core solder available.&lt;br /&gt;old  </li>
            <li> Doubtful would fit on latest version of Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> I cut the old batteries loose, left enough tension on the leads to make contact with the new batteries when installed....replaced the cover</li>
            <li> Hopefully my new one will last as long and perform as well as this one did....</li>
            <li> The most important and difficult part was using a screwdriver and long nose pliars to carefully pry off the strips of soldered metal that goes down into the battery circuit board from the head of the old battery pack.</li>
            <li> so it would generally stay in contact with the internal connector, so</li>
            <li> Soldering the battery tabs should be done as quickly as possible while assuring a good connection as excessive heat is not good for the batteries.   </li>
            <li> This is not a bad idea, but I&#x27;m not sure it will work on this model razor, as the lead to one of the bateries is very short, even if cut as close to the battery as possible.</li>
            <li> My wife said buy a new shaver, I said for only a few dollars on this replacement battery I can have a like new shaver.  </li>
            <li> so that when the new battery pack is inserted into the cradle, the new leads are forced into contact against the old leads.</li>
            <li> And the cost was far less than if I had a professional do this.</li>
            <li> After several tries to make such a  connection, per the instructions, one of the new contacts simply broke off.</li>
            <li> I started off having a problem with the battery because it didn&#x27;t have the positive pole and negative pole marked, and with no initial charge on it</li>
            <li> Still only lasts 2-3 shaves before it runs weakly and the red charge light comes on.</li>
            <li> I then attached the other end of this wire to the new battery.  </li>
            <li> However, I would advise following a previous reviewers comments about not de-soldering the OEM battery tabs on the Remington&#x27;s board, just remove the old pack (bending them slightly worked for me) from the existing tabs and solder the new battery to the old tabs that are still attached to the board.  </li>
            <li> This entailed very carefully cutting the top off of the old batteries and then trimming.</li>
            <li> My Norelco/Philips shaver had slowly stopped holding a charge for more than a few shaves.  </li>
            <li> I hate it because I really like that old shaver better than the newer models.</li>
            <li> They do not hold a charge for as long as the original batteries did but only for a bit less than a half hour.</li>
            <li> The tabs on the new batteries were facing down to install</li>
            <li> Particularly if you are like me and have little soldering experience.</li>
            <li> Straightening the leads from the new battery to poke back through the holes (there is just enough room to keep them tight against the remains of the cut leads) was all that was needed.  </li>
            <li> My shaver&#x27;s old batteries required re-charging every other day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine they could be worse than the original ones though.  </li>
            <li> Getting the old battery out was difficult but I would have preferred to just clip the tabs at the old battery and then solder the new battery tabs to the old ones.</li>
            <li> For less than $7 I have virtually a new razor.</li>
            <li> I found that by using needle-nose pliers, I could carefully peel off the tabs from the old batteries (the connector strips are long).  </li>
            <li> I pried the leads away from the old battery pack with the tip of a small screwdriver, then snipped them with a wire cutter, leaving the old leads as long as possible.</li>
            <li> but you do need a small soldering gun to put them in.everything went into place very well.</li>
            <li> No more updates unless something unusual occurs.</li>
            <li> In addition, the shaver&#x27;s sideburn trimmer broke long ago and now I must use a different shaver for this task.</li>
            <li> One end of the battery pack has two flat metal leads that pass thru the plastic cradle, thru the printed-circuit board and are soldered to the underside of the P-C board.  </li>
            <li> If you have moderate desoldering/soldering skills the replacement doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> To make the long story short, I found that the battery leads were oriented so that the polarity was reversed if installed as a drop-in replacement.  </li>
            <li> The battery pack is connected through a pair of flat leads, which are soldered to the razor&#x27;s circuit board.</li>
            <li> trimmed the new battery&#x27;s leads a little, bent them into shape, and soldered the end of the leads into the holes.  </li>
            <li> So, there was little to lose if I damaged the razor installing the new batteries</li>
            <li> I took the shaver and new batteries to a little radio repair shop and had them installed for $3.</li>
            <li> just cut old connections at the batteries and folded them down</li>
            <li> and I would indeed buy another in the future, but my next shaver will definitely not be a Norelco or any other Philips product based on my experience with this product and an experience with a Philips DVD recorder</li>
            <li> When new, I could take it on vacation for a week, use it everyday, and not even have to take the charger.</li>
            <li> I thought I could just take the dead batteries out and replace with the new ones.&lt;br /&gt;Instead</li>
            <li> It seemed much less damaging to the razor than a complete desolder.</li>
            <li> Brought my 10+ year old razor back from the dead.</li>
            <li> Had to break of the soldered tabs but just left the tabs in contact with what was left and closed it up</li>
            <li> Be careful not to short the contacts on the steel strap above the contacts.  </li>
            <li> The most difficult part was opening the plastic casing, my shaver had plastic snaps keeping it closed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a trial and error type thing since the positive and negative are not marked on the battery.</li>
            <li> Also, the batteries were not marked positive or negative</li>
            <li> Then, a set of nickel cadmium recharhreable batteries appears inside, they are seat in a battery holder, opposite side, with one positive and one negative side stick to a metal from the inside, and the other ends are just a metal plate with springs.  </li>
            <li> So cheap of them to make it difficult to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the pack will hold a charge off the charging cradle as I always keep the shaver on the cradle while not in use</li>
            <li> Looks harder to do than it actually is.  </li>
            <li> I expected the same from this battery.</li>
            <li> I closed it, recharged it, and have been using it for over a week (and with this current edit for over two years without a problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These batteries hold a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> The polarity (+ - ) not marked</li>
            <li> I am not certain it was ever possible to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> Actually, that is not quite correct - oddly, they hold a charge at a very low voltage for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> I did have to use a voltmeter to find out which terminal was positive and negative, because they are NOT marked on the batteries!!!  </li>
            <li> The Torx Screws on my razor also had plain old slots too,   </li>
            <li> Apparently they are not designed to be replaced by other than an authorized service center.  </li>
            <li> I forgot how long this razor would keep a charge!</li>
            <li> Lately it requires frequent charging and dies very suddenly.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised to see that the batteries were soldered together at their base and to two tabs at the top.</li>
            <li> small clippers, I cut out the old tabs and removed the batteries.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely discourage the average person from attempting a battery pack change at all.  </li>
            <li> open case (2 screws), 2.  pry contacts from old batteries (used a very small screwdriver &amp; needle nose pliers),</li>
            <li> A multimeter will confirm, but seems that you can rely on orienting the battery such that the tabs extend down toward the razor.  </li>
            <li> After cutting away the old battery and, with careful use of a soldering iron and solder sucker to remove the old tabs, I was attached the new battery directly to the board using the tabs on the battery.  </li>
            <li> After reading a number of reviews indicating that soldering is essential I finally came across one that indicated that all that was needed was a small pair of metal snips.  </li>
            <li> I now only get about a week and a half before it needs recharging.  </li>
            <li> Folded back each tab in half (no solder</li>
            <li> A little tricky to attach the leads to the battery terminals they are very very thin and easily bend.</li>
            <li> Getting it open takes a little care with removing the screws, metal spring clips and the circuit board.  </li>
            <li> (I carefully avoided soldering close to the batteries an tried to heat the battery leads as little as possible when connecting them.)  </li>
            <li> If it didn’t work, then at least I have two new rechargeable batteries I can use on other devices.  </li>
            <li> i had to use some not so common tools to get the old battery off and</li>
            <li> NOTHING WAS WRONG SMOOTH SHAVE, but the battery went dead</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> You can make these things work without soldering if you are careful.    </li>
            <li> Obviously, I won&#x27;t know about their life for a few years.    </li>
            <li> The batteries arrived ahead of the expected date.  </li>
            <li> After reading the description of the battery pack (and before opening the shaver case), I expected this to be a \\&quot;drop-in\\&quot; repair.  </li>
            <li> I carefully inserted the battery pack into the plastic cradle, again with the +</li>
            <li> battery apparently already had a small amount of charge to it, as my shaver came to life almost immediately before petering out after 10 seconds or so.</li>
            <li> I think this shaver was designed to encourage you to use the Norelco service center.  </li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> I have repaired several electric shavers by replacing dead batteries.</li>
            <li> Also pay attention to the battery polarity orientation because that is not straight forward.</li>
            <li> You must soldier the connections which was expected.  </li>
            <li> Once the leads are thru the holes in the board, you will need to trim them down as they can&#x27;t be too long to come in contact with another terminal.  </li>
            <li> You could bend them up vertically, as you would on the new batteries, then press the old and new together to make contact, using spacers at the base of the batteries to create contact pressure.</li>
            <li> Using a small soldering iron, I removed the old cut tabs and used a solder sucker to open the oval holes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not much room to work without pulling other wires out of place.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped the battery would last at least a week, but it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge that long.     </li>
            <li> The hard part was getting the old batter to separate from the soldered connections, but using a small flat screwdriver</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this new shaver battery pack simply did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> Others have suggested cutting the leads from the old battery pack and bending them to make contact with the new one.</li>
            <li> Using small electronics side-cutters, cut these leads as close to the batteries as possible and remove the battery pack.  </li>

            <li> I followed the advice of other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I followed some suggestions from other customers and didn&#x27;t do any soldering of the wires</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews where people had installed the batteries without soldering them in but that just didn&#x27;t seem like the way to go to me.</li>
            <li> So I used a small standard screw driver.</li>

            <li> Based on my experience, I would not recommend this battery and procedure to other prospective users.</li>
            <li> I must have fried the circuit board even though I was very careful with the solder gun.  </li>
            <li> Then I carefully bent each tab down almost in half, making what looked like a pair of upside-down letter Vs.</li>
            <li> Not worth effort and cost to return.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a cheaper alternative to replacement if my electric shaver, but what the seller does not tell you is that replacement requires soldering, which the average person is not set up to do.</li>
            <li> When I finally received the shipment (which was 4 days late)</li>
            <li> waited too late to send back</li>

            <li> followed tips offered by previous commenters.  </li>
            <li> This will make contact and help hold the battery pack into place if you don&#x27;t have a soldering iron (or if you just don&#x27;t want to mess with the solder).      </li>
            <li> Just not worth the time, trouble or money.</li>
            <li> The batteries and blade set cost me about $50 which was a lot less expensive than a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Used pliers to crimp the connection tight after insertion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was a little concerned about the warnings here but decided to go ahead and give it a shot on my 6885xl.  </li>
            <li> leads a little, and soldered the two together.</li>
            <li> I also have a needle nose soldering iron and small sharp dikes to cut wire.  </li>
            <li> and I can just remove the battery pack with a little tug and blade to break the silicone bead.</li>
            <li> it was also a little tricky, putting the circuit board in place without any in instructions.  </li>
            <li> A little tricky installing the batteries in the shaver</li>
            <li> Yeah it was a little tricky soldering</li>
            <li> Worked as expected; soldered to circuit board the correct way for installation, no problem!!!  </li>
            <li> Eventually I had to charge it everyday.</li>
            <li> After seeing how much trouble others encountered with replacing these batteries, I approached the project with a bit of trepidation.</li>
            <li> replaced the batteries in my brothers Norelco shaver with these and they worked for about a day, they do not hold a charge for longer than a few hours.</li>
            <li> (a few buyers reported the pack holds a charge for 6 days or so off the cradle, but I have not verified this).  </li>
            <li> - although there were a few places around LA..  You can mail your razor out of state, or drive - and  you&#x27;ll end up paying $45-$50 for a battery and the repair charge</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> One note, however: the battery made a somewhat loud noise while charging, which made me think there might be something wrong.  </li>
            <li> The + end of each battery in the pack is also distinguished by a thin white border around the exposed metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My shaver had gotten to where I had to charge it every few days and it still felt anemic.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually waste my time on reviews but this battery is well</li>
            <li> I installed this battery in my dead Norelco 785SX a few months after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> After a few months they started to not hold a charge and now, after a year or so, they don&#x27;t hold a charge longer than about 15-20 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and effort on these batteries.</li>
            <li> so \\&quot;why bother\\&quot; with such a tedious task and risk damaging other parts in the process(and</li>
            <li> I bought a few years ago; I thought the battery pack would no longer hold a charge, but there may have been a bad connection when I installed it the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced these type of batteries in all kinds of equipment but this was a particularly difficult task and something happened that apparently damaged the electronics and the bottom line is that the patient (razor) died.  </li>
            <li> You will need a long thin shafted torx screwdriver to remove these two screws.</li>
            <li> Long Term Life is Poor</li>
            <li> Some of the clearances on the board are very tight, and you risk shorting out the leads to adjacent solder points when you try to solder.</li>
            <li> Took a little delicate work to take apart and solder the batteries to the shaver.</li>
            <li> there is very little space</li>
            <li> I have the soldering iron &amp; solder, but was a very difficult taks because my iron&#x27;s lowest thermostat setting was too high.  </li>
            <li> they are torx screws but also slotted so a small screwdriver worked fine&lt;</li>
            <li> the batteries are attached to the circuit board by small metal strips at the butt end of the shaver where the charger plugs in.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to get pictures of the reattached battery terminals because there&#x27;s not enough room between the batteries and the razor terminals for a picture.  </li>
            <li> A small amount of sorder to the tabs</li>
            <li> A small electronic pair of pliers works well to cut the leads or an exacto knife will work as well.</li>
            <li> Using a pencil soldering iron, I soldered small wires to both metal strips.  </li>
            <li> IF you are intent on changing it yourself and have a soldering iron you may want to open up the razor before you purchase a battery, just to get an idea of how complicated the replacement procedure might be.  </li>
            <li> I cut small 30 lb.</li>
            <li> Not too difficult to install following instructions in a YouTube video</li>
            <li> The old batts can be removed by cutting out with small sissors or a cutical cutters.</li>
            <li> I did not but simply looped and twisted on the connectors</li>

            <li> However, when it turns on it runs so slowly that it is unusable.  </li>
            <li> Other orientations for soldering were too cramped to solder without melting the batteries or the holder or without some complicated setup to hold both pieces stationary during the soldering.</li>

            <li> #1 Remove bad batteries and discard properly.  </li>
            <li> In other reviews people talk about \\&quot;cutting off\\&quot; the existing batteries.  </li>
            <li> WAS TO DUMB</li>
            <li> The solder places on the battery were very hard to get to without breaking the wires off.  </li>
            <li> Over time, the length of the charge is getting worse.  </li>

            <li> Well they did poorly</li>
            <li> As others have reported, the batteries are not soldered; rather they are electrically welded to the thin metal strap leads.</li>
            <li> I was indeed disappointed after having spent the money for the batteries, which were delivered on time.    </li>
            <li> You try shaving with a slow electric razor and see how it works - instead of cutting, it pulls.  </li>
            <li> It was a little tedious but not too bad.</li>
            <li> After you get the two spring clips off, use electronics side cutters to cut the leads of the bad battery pack about 3/16\\&quot; above the plastic cradle and remove the bad battery pack.  </li>
            <li> But, if you can&#x27;t install them the batteries are worthless, and this isn&#x27;t a job for the faint of heart or those inexperienced with electronics.  </li>

            <li> My husband&#x27;s shaver technically doesn&#x27;t accept this replacement since the original batteries were tack welded in, but once he figured out he couldn&#x27;t break the shaver he was able to free the original batteries. I think he did use his soldering iron to attach these.</li>
            <li> I purchased this battery pack back in 2009, and two years later I am already looking for replacements. On a full charge the display indicates 36 minutes remaining, but it typically dies after one or two uses. The run time is getting shorter and shorter. I&#x27;ve had to plug it in to finish my shave. I&#x27;m hesitant to buy these batteries again.</li>
            <li> Being pretty handy and the advice here I would say this was a great fix. Do nip the metal tabs off as close to the batteries as you can. Make a note with a sharpie as to where the original  + and - ends of the batteries were in the razor. Batteries received did not have  + and - labeled so take note of picture 4 the indented ring on the end of the battery is the Positive end of the battery. Make the tabs in a sideways V, insert, and you should be good to go!</li>
            <li> i was a little concerned about the warnings here but decided to go ahead and give it a shot on my 6885xl.  turns out that the install was pretty simple.  here is how i did it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 remove screws.  they are torx screws but also slotted so a small screwdriver worked fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 gently pry off the back cover&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 my batteries were covered in corrosion, so i had to clean all the gunk off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 this is the only tricky step.  the batteries are attached to the circuit board by small metal strips at the butt end of the shaver where the charger plugs in.  there is very little space and i could not get a cutting tool in to cut the connections.  i was however able to grab one of the strips with needle nose pliers, and while stabilizing it (i wanted the strips to break at the battery, not closer to the circuit board) i gently worked the battery back and forth until the connection broke.  the other battery had even less room, but i was able to stabilize the strip with the end of a screwdriver while wiggling and torquing the batter.  eventually the strip broke at the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 gently fold the strips down semi-flat, and clean off corrosion with a pencil eraser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 i bent the strips on the new batteries out at about a 45 degree angle and laid them in the plastic battery tray.  the charge indicator on the shaver started flashing so i knew that i had contact and elected to leave well enough alone and reassemble&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 reinstall rear cover, charge, and shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well worth the $10 and 10 minutes of work</li>
            <li> Purchased this replacement battery from Shaver World via Amazon. Delivery was prompt. When I could not figure out how to get the original battery out of the shaver I called the vendor.  He went out of his way to give me specific instructions for removing the old and installing the new battery. This involved some non-intuitve techniques and I appreciated the help they provided.  Not all internet sellers are willing to be that helpful.</li>
            <li> Received product promptly and is easy to replace (if you have a soldering iron) and works great.</li>
            <li> Although we referenced our model number,and was directed to these batteries and site also claimed \\&quot;fits most Norelco Models\\&quot;, it is the wrong pack for my model. Not worth effort and cost to return.</li>
            <li> The batteries in my shaver wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  I really like my shaver but didn&#x27;t want to have to plug it into the wall every time I used it or shell out over $100 for a new one.  Found the battery packs on Amazon along with instructions on how to do the replacement.  Removing the old battery pack was a little tricky and then you have to solder the new pack back into the shaver so you have to be a little mechanical (and have a steady hand) to make the change (or know a good handyman).  The new batteries work perfectly and the shaver now holds it&#x27;s charge like it did when it was new.  Great product!  (Norelco might argue with me - I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d rather have you buy a new shaver)</li>
            <li> After reading a number of reviews indicating that soldering is essential I finally came across one that indicated that all that was needed was a small pair of metal snips.  Worked like a charm.  The old leads poke through thin holes in the plastic bracket for the battery.  Straightening the leads from the new battery to poke back through the holes (there is just enough room to keep them tight against the remains of the cut leads) was all that was needed.  It literally took two minutes.  Less is more...</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  As described.  Works well.  Relatively easy to install, but requires some knowledge of how mechanical items work.  Solved my problem.</li>
            <li> I removed two screws and removed the batteries(they have sordered connections)I snipped the connections close to the battery.The new batteries have insulated sleeves covering their connectors.Making sure of the position of the poles I slid the shaver&#x27;s connections into those of the new battery.The plastic sleeves hold the connections secure whereas there is no need of sorder.The shipping is in excess but the product has has been well thought out.</li>
            <li> You can make these things work without soldering if you are careful.    You need to remove the old battery pack carefully, clipping the old bottom leads and leaving as much \\&quot;sticking up\\&quot; as you can.    Then bend the new battery pack leads in a sort of \\&quot;V\\&quot; shape so that it looks like you sort of make the bottom of the battery pack look like it has two \\&quot;points\\&quot; on it.    Place the \\&quot;V\\&quot; leads against the old battery pack flat leads.  This will make contact and help hold the battery pack into place if you don&#x27;t have a soldering iron (or if you just don&#x27;t want to mess with the solder).      I&#x27;ve had mine working for two weeks this way.</li>
            <li> I found this while looking for a replacement for the battery pack I bought a few years ago; I thought the battery pack would no longer hold a charge, but there may have been a bad connection when I installed it the first time. As described in the other reviews, the original is soldered into the shaver instead of being designed for easy removal and replacement. The shaver&#x27;s hardware told me the battery is at full charge, and perhaps stopped the charging process I thought I would have to order a new battery set but, upon opening the shaver to check the part number, I broke a connection and had to re-solder it. Now, instead of telling me the battery is fully charged, the indicator on the shaver shows me that it is charging, and the battery gets pretty warm, so maybe I didn&#x27;t connect it fully or properly the first time.    The battery pack is definitely designed for the shaver and I would indeed buy another in the future, but my next shaver will definitely not be a Norelco or any other Philips product based on my experience with this product and an experience with a Philips DVD recorder (it stopped recording after about 2 years and Philips did not make the necessary replacement part available). In addition, the shaver&#x27;s sideburn trimmer broke long ago and now I must use a different shaver for this task.</li>
            <li> I agree with others who said do NOT attempt to solder: it&#x27;s not necessary, and would require the right tools and some decent experience to do successfully.    The no-solder approach described by others worked for me.  Here&#x27;s a slightly edited version of someone else&#x27;s instructions that took me less than 10 minutes:    1) Let the shaver run to discharge the old battery pack.   2) Remove 2 screws holding shaver case halves together; separate halves.    3) Remove the two spring-clips: using needle-nosed pliers, slightly bend each side of the spring clips inward (or outward, depending on model) to disengage, then lift to remove.    4) One end of the battery pack has two flat metal leads that pass thru the plastic cradle, thru the printed-circuit board and are soldered to the underside of the P-C board.  Using small electronics side-cutters, cut these leads as close to the batteries as possible and remove the battery pack.  The idea is to leave as much of the metal leads as possible visible and accessible in the cradle.    5) Bend the leads of the new battery pack into a &#x60;V&#x27; shape so that when the new battery pack is inserted into the cradle, the new leads are forced into contact against the old leads. (Optional:  Before inserting the new battery pack completely into the cradle, solder the new leads to the old leads; I did NOT solder them together, the old and new leads make sufficiently tight contact once the battery pack is fully inserted into the cradle.)       6)  Re-install the spring clips, screw the two shaver halves back together, charge overnite.     Mine now runs like new!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a cheaper alternative to replacement if my electric shaver, but what the seller does not tell you is that replacement requires soldering, which the average person is not set up to do. All-in-all the product is misleading in its advertisement and I would discourage anyone from buying it.</li>
            <li> They were as advertised.  The batteries had the tabs needed to attach the battery directly to the circuit board.  After cutting away the old battery and, with careful use of a soldering iron and solder sucker to remove the old tabs, I was attached the new battery directly to the board using the tabs on the battery.  Everything works fine.  Battery capacity is very good.  Obviously, I won&#x27;t know about their life for a few years.    The batteries arrived ahead of the expected date.  Good service from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions about clipping leads and sliding battery leads into curcuit board.  Charged over night and after a week still going strong!  Saved myself around $100 by not buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my Norelco shaver batteries. You need soldering skills to replace batteries, but they tell you that upfront.</li>
            <li> I figured that even if this battery pack turned out to be a dud that for the cost I might extend the life of my razor until a good season for razor shopping to replace it.  The many success stories on the reviews convinced me that these were legit.  I can&#x27;t imagine they could be worse than the original ones though.  Finally got around to replacing my battery before I leave for a trip.  It really is as easy as the multi-step instructions listed in other comments indicate.  If you bend the leads, you could get away without soldering the tabs.  For my peace of mind, since I travel with this, and I have an electrical engineering degree and _should_ be capable of soldering it, I decided to solder them.  Even with soldering, it only took maybe 15 minutes tops.  Oh, and it may not matter, but the batteries are not marked for polarity but keep the positive terminal on your right side.  A multimeter will confirm, but seems that you can rely on orienting the battery such that the tabs extend down toward the razor.  I found the key to soldering is to extend the leads fully and slip them underneath the snipped leads from the old batteries.  Then, with the razor on its side, the battery will remain in place for easy soldering.  Heat both metal pieces before applying a liberal amount of solder -- but not too hot to melt the plastic.  Once both are soldered, the leads are flexible enough that you can push the battery pack forward so that the leads will fold up to make room to put the battery pack back into the slot securely.  Other orientations for soldering were too cramped to solder without melting the batteries or the holder or without some complicated setup to hold both pieces stationary during the soldering.</li>
            <li> I thought I was handy enough to replace my shaver batteries. I have a solder gun and everything I thought I would need. After one attempt followed by a trip to Radio Shack for some advice and additional tools, I tried again. No luck. I threw my old shaver and the batteries in the trash and bought a new razor.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  A bit tricky to replace but my razor is back in action!!</li>
            <li> As I have said in the past, I knew that this wasn&#x27;t going to be a five minute job, and it certainly was not, but the end result is excellent. First charge, one day over two weeks and it&#x27;s still going strong. Would most definitely recommend this product!        JIM</li>
            <li> Yes, but is was difficult to install. The solder places on the battery were very hard to get to without breaking the wires off.  Once installed it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Just snap apart your trimmer and replace the rechargeable battery rather than throwing the unit away and buying a new one.  Originally when I installed the battery the razor worked and several days later it didn&#x27;t so I took the battery out and put the tabs facing the back of the razor, put it in the charger and it then charged the battery pack and once again worked.  It&#x27;s a trial and error type thing since the positive and negative are not marked on the battery.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Easily soldered into my shaver, and works great now.</li>
            <li> My shaver battery was shot after 15 years. Everything else worked great.  I&#x27;m not into chucking something just because the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge. The battery pack was simple to replace after following the instructions posted by another reviewer.</li>
            <li> The batteries can&#x27;t be installed in the 4853 razor without a special small torx driver to open the razor case. I had to return them as I couldn&#x27;t find the torx driver for sale separately..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t attempt this unless your handy with a soldering iron.  But if you are a little talented, this is an amazing improvement over the old dying batteries.&lt;br /&gt;With small clippers, I cut out the old tabs and removed the batteries.  Using a small soldering iron, I removed the old cut tabs and used a solder sucker to open the oval holes.&lt;br /&gt;I trimmed the new battery&#x27;s leads a little, bent them into shape, and soldered the end of the leads into the holes.  Be sure to use the indent on the batteries to know which is positive (indent) and negative (no indent).  These new batteries last for over a month now and have strong energy after charging.&lt;br /&gt;If you feel uncomfortable doing it yourself, try to get a friend to help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After using these batteries for about 1/2 year, I can tell that the current (amperage) capacity is deteriorating.  The shaver quits shaving even though there are 2 bars left.  It then needs recharging.  Over time, the length of the charge is getting worse.  I&#x27;m reducing the star rating from 5 to 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  It now is about 3/4 year and is still deteriorating.  The shaver now quits when there is 3 bars left.  I now only get about a week and a half before it needs recharging.  I can see the batteries are getting worse - I&#x27;m now reducing the rating from 4 stars to 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After 9 months, the shaver quits when there are 3 bars (60% charge indicated).  It is so bad that I got some Sanyo Electric 700mh batteries and replaced these China batteries with these Sanyo, made in Japan.  I reduced the star rating to 1.</li>
            <li> When I first got the battery it worked great. It was like I had a new razor. After about 3 months the battery needed charging 2 to 3 times a week. Eventually I had to charge it everyday. It is to the point now (after 6 months) where it will not hold a charge at all.</li>
            <li> In order to install these you have to de-solder the old battery at the circuit board, then insert the tabs of the new battery into the slots on the circuit board and solder them in place.  Easier said than done, especially if you don&#x27;t have soldering experience. I highly recommend a solder removal bulb before you attempt this. I didn&#x27;t have one and it took a while. Also be patient while doing this, a hot soldering iron is murder on plastic parts :)  Having gone through this \\&quot;ordeal\\&quot; the new batteries don&#x27;t feel as strong as the original, I may have shorted something during installation.  Yeah, Do remember you&#x27;re working with a hot battery (sparks)!!!</li>
            <li> My Norelco T990 was becoming unusable as one of the 2 batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and became unusable even connected via the power cord.  The new batteries are fine and my machine works like new hence they are a total success.  However be warned, you must solder the new batteries  and I had a devil of a time disassembling the shaver to get to the internals.</li>
            <li> This pack had a slightly lower voltage than the original batteries and hence the razor did not spin as fast, which was issue #1.  You try shaving with a slow electric razor and see how it works - instead of cutting, it pulls.  However, after about two months, these batteries would not even hold a charge, which was issue #2.  Actually, that is not quite correct - oddly, they hold a charge at a very low voltage for quite a long time.  In fact, the razor will still turn on weeks after I charge it.  However, when it turns on it runs so slowly that it is unusable.  I end up plugging it in to use.</li>
            <li> All went smooth but battery does not hold charge well. After 3-4 days of non use needs a recharge. Vendor or batt manufacturer problem? Don&#x27;t know and will not judge vendor.</li>
            <li> After reading the description of the battery pack (and before opening the shaver case), I expected this to be a \\&quot;drop-in\\&quot; repair.  WRONG!!.  The replacement required de-soldering the old pack and re-soldering the new.  This has to be done on tiny connectors in a very restrictive location.  Fortunately, I have some experience with electronic repair/construction and have the necessary tools.  The construction and quality of the battery pack seems to be very good.  It has improved the performance of my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> wan&#x27;t easy to install. you need to be good with a soldering iron.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 6885XL. It was down to maybe a 15 minute charge. To concur with others I read about this: it is not for somebody that does not already own their own solder gun.I cheated and cut the old battery leads, trimmed the new battery leads a little, and soldered the two together. It seemed much less damaging to the razor than a complete desolder. I&#x27;ve had two use cycles now and they are working great. Far cheaper than a new $80 one (if you can find the refurbs anymore).</li>
            <li> They worked, for a while... I wish they were only like, $4.00, but I&#x27;m glad to have given more life to my Norelco. I didn&#x27;t solder them in, just bent the metal so it would generally stay in contact with the internal connector, so I sometimes have to jostle the razor to get a connection again. But it&#x27;s nice to breathe life back into an otherwise perfectly-good razor (since my razor won&#x27;t even run when plugged-in unless the batteries are somewhat working?).</li>
            <li> I thought the cost was very reasonable, but I did not realize I would have to unsolder the old one, somewhat tricky although I am experienced at this, and resolder the new battery in place. Works great now!</li>
            <li> They shipment arrived quickly and was well packaged. The batteries installed and work without problem</li>
            <li> Product received in timely mannor and in good condition. Product as ordered but installation is a bit of a problem as connections must be soldered.[[ASIN:B000FP63M4 Shaver Battery Pack fits most Norelco models &amp; others]]</li>
            <li> I understood the instructions and de-soldered the old Norelco battery as instructed and got the new tabs in place and soldered them.  Not much room to work without pulling other wires out of place.  I must have fried the circuit board even though I was very careful with the solder gun.  Got battery in place and was charging.  The problem was that the shaver would NOT turn off.  It just kept running whether the switch was on or off.  I finally pulled out the plug.  I was indeed disappointed after having spent the money for the batteries, which were delivered on time.    Norelco really has put built in planned obsolescence in their shavers.  That&#x27;s the last Norelco I will purchase.  All they had to do was put non-soldering terminals on the circuit board and a new battery could have been installed easily.  Instead I had to throw the shaver out after a couple of years. The batteries are still good so I have saved them in case they can be used by someone in the future.</li>
            <li> easier to buy a new razr</li>
            <li> The batteries are difficult to replace and there were no instructions for how to do so.  Apparently they are not designed to be replaced by other than an authorized service center.  When I contacted the seller to inquire about the availability of instructions, they suggested I do a search on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to rate this item.  If the batteries last as long as the originals they will be a good deal, assuming you can install them.  But, if you can&#x27;t install them the batteries are worthless, and this isn&#x27;t a job for the faint of heart or those inexperienced with electronics.  I would have simply bought a new razor but couldn&#x27;t find one like the Norelco Quadra Action 7885 XL I have.  The batteries were cheap and I would have to buy a new razor if I couldn&#x27;t install them anyway.  So, there was little to lose if I damaged the razor installing the new batteries thus it seemed like a no brainer to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries I received are not like either of the pictures posted before mine in the ad.  I didn&#x27;t realize that in time or I would have also posted a picture of the ones I received.  Mine do not have polarity marks or solder tabs like the ones shown in the ad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have posted a set of four pictures showing the procedure I used to replace them. The pictures are numbered in the order of the steps.  I have a pencil soldering iron and experience building electronics.  Without either I don&#x27;t think I could have done this replacement.  In other reviews people talk about \\&quot;cutting off\\&quot; the existing batteries.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s possible on my razor.  I tried unsuccessfully to unsolder them.  Batteries like this are often spot welded on and I think this was the situation with mine.  I twisted on the battery until the first terminal broke free of the battery.  As I kept twisting and pulling the razor&#x27;s negative terminal broke off.  It was now too short to reconnect so I had to solder/attach a short piece of wire to the razor terminal.  I then attached the other end of this wire to the new battery.  I was able to solder the positive terminal directly and nestle the new batteries back into their cradle. This procedure required four hands so my wife helped. I was unable to get pictures of the reattached battery terminals because there&#x27;s not enough room between the batteries and the razor terminals for a picture.  Some reviews talk about dropping in the new batteries (after somehow removing the old ones) creating a press contact.  I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with that, but if you have no choice why not give it a try?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have other questions, ask them in a Comment and I&#x27;ll attempt to answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said in the second sentence of this review, whether they are a good deal or not depends on how long they last.  Well they did poorly and I&#x27;m lowering my rating from 4 to 2 stars.  The original batteries in my razor lasted about 10 years -- these lasted less than two years.  Given how hard they are to install and how short their life I probably should have rated them one star.ugh room between the batteries and the razor terminals for a picture.

            <li> The battery pack works fine, but is a real bear to install. I don&#x27;t recommend anyone without some electronics equipment repair experience attempting the installation.</li>
            <li> These batteries seem to be just fine and saved my shaver from discard. However, if you plan to replace the batteries in your shaver, be aware that this is a repair.  The shaver is not designed for the user to replaced batteries.  One tool I needed with my shaver that I did not see mentioned by others is a T8 head screw driver.   I also have a needle nose soldering iron and small sharp dikes to cut wire.  I did not attempt to unsolder the original contacts from the circuit board itself, although I see it can be done quite easily.  I instead soldered a connecting wire between the battery terminals and stubs of the original connectors.  Once the shaver is disassembled, the connectors between the circuit board and the little motor are unsupported and easily damaged.  Unless I when to the trouble of building some kind of temporary cradle, it was more straight forward to use a little solid wire to connect the batteries rather that take a chance on damaging the motor connections while refitting the battery connectors.  As others noted, the + - terminals of the new batteries are not identified.  I used a VTOM to be sure I identified the polarity.</li>
            <li> Batteries received on time and the old batteries were easy to get out. Just applied heat with a sordering iron to the tabs and pulled on the tabs with a pair of needlenose pliers. The tabs on the new batteries were facing down to install so I had to bend them back to fit. A small amount of sorder to the tabs and it was ready to go. The batteries first charge lasted 3 weeks and are still going.</li>
            <li> This battery pack installed easly and worked from the start. Forming a v-shape to the lead on the battery pack and tinning it [apply solder to it]will allow for a good connection. Cutting the old lead from the original battery pack as close to the battery as possible will give you more to work with.I tensioned the new pack towards the old lead with a piece of wood wedged in between the battery and two capisitors. A small electronic pair of pliers works well to cut the leads or an exacto knife will work as well.</li>
            <li> My Norelco rechargeable razor is about 11 years old and still going strong. This year I replaced the NiCad batteries for the second time (first time four years ago)and its back to running on a charge for 8 days. It takes some technical skill to disassemble, de-solder and solder in a new set but worth doing to save $130 or so on a replacement shaver. It used to be that you could take a shaver to a jewelry store for repair so lacking the skills and tools necessary someone might try going that route  as well.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FP63M4/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> I activated a favorite razor and have been using it since. It was easy to fix once i had these parts.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to be too handy to do this. I just took the back cover off and broke off the tabs off the old battery and then put the new battery in and blobbed some soldier on the tabs and that was it. It took me no longer then 25 minutes to do it.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected; soldered to circuit board the correct way for installation, no problem!!!  #1 Remove bad batteries and discard properly.  #2 Install new batteries using proper soldering technique. DONE</li>
            <li> Lasted 2 years after replacement.</li>
            <li> Fit as original, and holding charge very well.</li>
            <li> not too many of these items out there, so this is probably the only place you can get it.  i had the choice of getting a new battery or getting a new shaver.  this norelco has been working fine for the past 4yrs and purchasing a new one isn&#x27;t really appealing.  only problem with this thing was that installing it required the removal of the original battery that was soldered (not sure if that&#x27;s the right term, but there were two metal pieces that were melted onto the circuit board that attached the battery to the unit) to the circuit board.  i had to use some not so common tools to get the old battery off and the new one on.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;other than that problem, this new battery works fine.</li>
            <li> I am an Amazon subscriber, having started with a Kindle Fire.  I am pleased I was able to order new batteries from them.  My old Norelco 6705X shaver barely holds enough charge for one shave.  Finish shaving, turn it off, then it won&#x27;t turn on again until charged. (This model does not afford the capability of simply plugging it in.) When new, I could take it on vacation for a week, use it everyday, and not even have to take the charger. Since I wanted to avoid having to spring for a new shaver at this time and I figured spending $9.38+WSST for new batteries is worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciated all the reviews and photos about battery replacement; those are a great help knowing what I am getting into.  Seems to me when I bought this shaver several years ago, the paperwork stated the NiCad batteries were not serviceable.  Rather, there was considerable verbage about recycling the whole shaver properly when the batteries died.  So I am looking forward to this task.  I have Torx drivers, a soldering iron, resin core solder and a mini-pliers set all ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;The batteries arrived early and I installed them last night.  Fairly easy to do but no soldering was possible.  In the 6705X model the batteries, the circuit board and the switch appear to be installed as a unit into the case.  As others have reported, the batteries are not soldered; rather they are electrically welded to the thin metal strap leads. Therefore, no de-soldering was possible. The only solution to remove the dead batteries is to cut the lead off as close as possible to the battery, leaving the most material to work with. I then bent the lead straps on the new batteries in an inverted V shape, inserted the pack into the cradle with the new leads over the lead straps sticking up from the circuit board.  They make good positive contact.  I reasembled the case and charged it up.  The shaver now runs like a mashed cat.  I&#x27;m happy with this inexpensive fix, although it&#x27;s not a slam-dunk repair to do.</li>
            <li> I purchased this replacement battery pack for a Norelco 7886 XL shaver.  I open the shaver by un-screw the two screws on the side-trim and on the main body.  Then, a set of nickel cadmium recharhreable batteries appears inside, they are seat in a battery holder, opposite side, with one positive and one negative side stick to a metal from the inside, and the other ends are just a metal plate with springs.  I used a pier to remove the battery from  the metal strip by force.  Then, curve the metal strip and put the new battery pack, which comes with 2 metal strips already back on the battery holder with the correct polarity (it fits just fine).  Just make sure the new metal strips from the new batteries touch the curved old metal strips to make a connection.  Then put back the cover and screw back the 2 screws.  All done.  After recharging, the battery and the shaver works fine again.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly as described and was delivered promptly.  The batteries are not really very easy to install and do require some soldering for instalation.  The razor worked perfectly.  This is an option to consider if your Norelco shaver can no longer hold a chargee.</li>
            <li> This pack arrived quickly and when I installed them did the trick.  The shaver has been working good as new since the pack arrived.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> Brought my 10+ year old razor back from the dead. A big improvement on spending big bucks for a new razor. I was fortunate in that my re-assembly did not require any soldering (it is held in place by friction, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem in over a year)</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco wet/dry shavers for about 10 years.    My first one lasted 7 years. It was the first model to use the Nivea packs.    After it died, I replaced it with the 7775X. This one died after I dropped it  after owning it 11 months.    I bought another 7775X. After 12 months, it would not hold a charge more than 2 days.  I bought this replacement battery and after installing it, the razor needs a charge every 4 days. I had hoped the battery would last at least a week, but it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge that long.     I am left wondering if it is the battery or the razor.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 sets of batteries and fixed two shavers.  No problelms.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> After seeing how much trouble others encountered with replacing these batteries, I approached the project with a bit of trepidation. I had already clipped the old battery from its terminals with wire cutters and taken it to radio shack, where I thought I&#x27;d find an off-the-shelf replacement. Not so, I was told by a clerk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I ordered this item from the Shaver Outlet through their Amazon store. It arrived promptly, though the shipping and handling charge of $5.64 seemed pretty excessive. The battery pack was inside a tiny clear ziploc sleeve, and had been placed in a standard 5x7 yellow envelope with a half-dozen styrofoam peanuts -- it certainly wasn&#x27;t packed to cushion it or prevent damage. Everything was just flopping around freely inside, and the peanuts served no purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the good stuff: The pack has two small leads at one end, each with a tiny rubber sleeve, which I removed. I held the battery with the tabs pointing up (the + and - signs were facing down). Then I carefully bent each tab down almost in half, making what looked like a pair of upside-down letter Vs. I carefully inserted the battery pack into the plastic cradle, again with the + and - signs facing down (polarity is important!!) and the two tabs toward the top of the razor. I inserted the pack at the bottom first, and then pressed it down at the sides until it snapped in. The fit was snug and secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery apparently already had a small amount of charge to it, as my shaver came to life almost immediately before petering out after 10 seconds or so. I then re-affixed the cover, re-secured it with the two screws, and plugged it in to my charging cord. I powered it up, and all systems were go. After charging for an hour and unplugging it, the razor works as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Your mileage may vary, but I&#x27;ve been using it this way for two weeks, both wet and dry, and everything&#x27;s fine. So spare yourself the soldering iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced these type of batteries in all kinds of equipment but this was a particularly difficult task and something happened that apparently damaged the electronics and the bottom line is that the patient (razor) died.  I imagine the batteries were not at fault.</li>
            <li> Took minutes to replace, but of course as everyone has said, you do need to solder them.  They were even pre charged, started working as soon as I connected them.</li>
            <li> I replaced my 10 year old shaver battery with this.  Took some work though, had to de-solder the old battery out.  Putting the new battery back in was easy, I just bent the tabs instead of soldering back in.  Saved me about 50 bucks.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the soldering, this would have been 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My shaver is like new.  It would have been helpful if instructions on how to dissasemble the shaver were available, but it wasn&#x27;t too hard to figure out.  The shaver is as good as new now.  Definitely worth the bother.</li>
            <li> It either works for you or you have the wrong item.  So if it works it is a five.  Same for below</li>
            <li> Unable to replace the battery. So this will not work for us. I am not certain it was ever possible to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> Once I figured out how to get into the shaver it was easy to install.  Had to break of the soldered tabs but just left the tabs in contact with what was left and closed it up and it charged.</li>
            <li> The item worked perfectly in my shaver. However it is a bit of a hassle to install. Particularly if you are like me and have little soldering experience. Now that I have done it once it would be less of a problem. Someone with experience would probably have it done in 15 min</li>
            <li> This battery pack was for a rechargable electric shaver. It was easy to solder in place and the shaver charges just fine.</li>
            <li> I would definitely discourage the average person from attempting a battery pack change at all.  If you have a mechanical knack, some electronics experience and access to a tiny soldering pencil (3/32\\&quot; 700 or 800 degree tip), it is doable.  On my Norelco 6885XL, my steps were: 1) Let the shaver run to discharge the old battery pack.  2) Remove 2 screws holding the two halves together and take the two halves apart.  3) Use needle-nosed pliers to slightly bend each side of the spring clips inward, then up.  4) After you get the two spring clips off, use electronics side cutters to cut the leads of the bad battery pack about 3/16\\&quot; above the plastic cradle and remove the bad battery pack.  Do not attempt to de-solder the bad battery pack&#x27;s leads from the printed circuit board.  That takes a lot of expertise and special equipment and if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, you&#x27;ll ruin the PC board.  5) Bend the leads of the new battery pack into a &#x60;V&#x27; shape so that when the new battery pack is in the cradle, the new leads are against the old leads in the PC board.  6) Solder the new leads to the old leads, re-install the spring clips, put the two halves of the shaver back together, and charge the new battery pack.</li>
            <li> replaced the batteries in my brothers Norelco shaver with these and they worked for about a day, they do not hold a charge for longer than a few hours. Completely useless.</li>
            <li> I used this replacement battery pack on a Norelco Advantage 5655X shaver.  I had the shaver for a very long time (about 13 years) and the batteries were finally not holding a charge anymore, was only able to operate the shaver for about a minute before the original batteries died.  This new pack seems to work perfectly and holds a good strong charge and the heads rotate at the speed they did when the shaver was new.  I don&#x27;t know how long the pack will hold a charge off the charging cradle as I always keep the shaver on the cradle while not in use (a few buyers reported the pack holds a charge for 6 days or so off the cradle, but I have not verified this).  In order to install this pack, yourself, you will have to have some EXP with a soldering iron and some mechanical understanding.  This replacement pack was not that difficult to install BUT it is not just a drop and load pack you will have to unsolder the old pack from the circuit board in the shaver to install this one.  The shaver has 4 TORX screws you will have to remove to expose battery pack and circuit board compartment.  The pack is on the underside of the board.  You will need to unsolder the old pack and use the original plastic battery holder to hold the new pack.  The new pack has two flat leads that are about 3 mm wide, one will fit thru the board to the top side where you can solder it on the board, the other will not without trimming it down about a mm to fit thru the hole.  Once the leads are thru the holes in the board, you will need to trim them down as they can&#x27;t be too long to come in contact with another terminal.  While you are replacing the battery pack, this would be a good opportunity to clean the shaver good.  I would also remove the head holder and the transparent part that hold the head holder in place (if you have the same model I do).  It is held in place by a couple of TORX screws.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly - with a little soldering and directions off the internet, my Norelco shaver is like new again! Great inexpensive alternative to buying new.</li>
            <li> This should be soldered, but I just carefully pulled out the old batteries, and slipped in the new ones, making sure the contact was firm. I ran the shaver till it quit to discharge the batteries fully, then charged it overnight. It is great to have my shaver working like new. It holds a charge for a week now. Much better than throwing it away and getting a new one. Save The Landfill. Recycle whenever you can. For our kids.</li>
            <li> I pried the old battery from the metal strips in the razor noting which strip was plus.  Using a pencil soldering iron, I soldered small wires to both metal strips.  The new batteries did not have polarity indicated on them so had to test to see which tab was plus.  Observing polarity, I soldered the wires to the new battery tabs and placed the battery in the razor tucking the wires out of the way.  There was no residual charge on the battery but after several hours the razor was fully charged and has been working well ever since.  Very pleased that I have a fairly new razor after replacing the head last year.</li>
            <li> This battery pack fits my Norelco very well. However, there are two problems with the replacement procedure for the 6863XL Norelco razor. The first problem is that the two screws for opening the case are \\&quot;torx\\&quot; head screws that are VERY recessed into the narrow plastic housing of the razor. Your normal torx bits will be too short to reach the screws. You will need a long thin shafted torx screwdriver to remove these two screws. The second problem is that the batteries are soldered in place through two tiny slots in the circuit board of the shaver and the connectors are bent/folded. The best way to remove the old batteries is to use a solder wick or suction device to remove the old melted solder from the board before unbending the connectors and removing the old battery set. Once you have the old batteries out, replacement is simple. Slide the connecting tabs through the tiny slots and bend them in place. Then solder the bent connectors to the circuit board. It&#x27;s a good idea, while your in there, to remove any bits of beard inside the housing and lubricate the gears with white grease. Reassembly is a bit tricky as you juggle the three parts back into place. Remember to recycle the old NiCd battery set at Best Buy or Wal-Mart as it is hazardous waste. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The battery pack was exactly as advertized, arrived before the expected date, was not a problem to install and has certaiinly improved the performance of my razor. And the cost was far less than if I had a professional do this.</li>
            <li> Allowed me to save my old shaver.  Batteries were easy to install and it did not even require soldering.  Shipping was fast and easy.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> They do not hold a charge for as long as the original batteries did but only for a bit less than a half hour.</li>
            <li> The new NiCad battery works well with my older Norelco Shaver. At first I tried replacement with more modern MIMH battery but the Norelco charging system was not compatible.</li>
            <li> Disassembly of this Norelco was more tricky than my last Norelco shaver.  Getting it open takes a little care with removing the screws, metal spring clips and the circuit board.  The battery tabs have to be unsoldered on both sides of the circuit board and this can be destructive to the circuit board.  Getting the old battery out was difficult but I would have preferred to just clip the tabs at the old battery and then solder the new battery tabs to the old ones. You wouldn&#x27;t have to remove the circuit board if this procedure is followed.  I think it would be much more straight forward to go this way.  I think this shaver was designed to encourage you to use the Norelco service center.  The screws have TORX heads and are also slotted. Some proficiency at soldering is required to replace the batteries.  Soldering the battery tabs should be done as quickly as possible while assuring a good connection as excessive heat is not good for the batteries.   Note the location of the colored wires going to the motor; if they both break off during service you need to put them back where they were to assure the correct direction of rotation of the blades. The batteries and blade set cost me about $50 which was a lot less expensive than a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced the blades on my shaver, so the shave was nice and close. But the battery life was terrible, it would stop running with 17 minutes of life showing on the meter. If you have moderate desoldering/soldering skills the replacement doesn&#x27;t take long. The new battery made a huge difference, the charge life is back to like new and the shaver runs stronger longer. Money well spent.</li>
            <li> Not an easy install for the non-geek.  Look online for help on how to disassemble shaver, take out the old one and put the new one in.  Looks harder to do than it actually is.  Works just fine when finished.  Saved a bunch in fixing rather than trashing the old one.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These batteries are available from multiple sources but the price here was one of the best when you consider the free shipping.  The installation was a snap, if you have any concerns look at youtub. It does require a soldering iron you one youtub video suggests you can avoid the soldering but i think that process would result in flaky behavior. Soldering is not difficult and a cheap soldering iron will work just fine.</li>
            <li> These batteries are good quality.  My Norelco/Philips shaver had slowly stopped holding a charge for more than a few shaves.  With the new batteries, I can again go weeks between charges.  The manufacturer-installed batteries were attached to spot-welded tabs.  I found that by using needle-nose pliers, I could carefully peel off the tabs from the old batteries (the connector strips are long).  Then I bent the connector strips into spring contacts for the new batteries.  That way, I avoided having to solder the new batteries into place, and if I ever have to replace them again, I can just pop out the old batteries and slip in the new set.  Save yourself a lot of money by restoring your shaver instead of buying a new one.</li>
            <li> Price was great, but it didn&#x27;t fit my model. By the time I got around to taking it apart to replace the battery, I had waited way too long to really complain.</li>
            <li> I needed a battery for my shaver and I got what I ordered. Good price and good service. I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Had my Norelco rechargeble shaver hooked up with a cord for over a year, finally ordered this battery pac and put it in.&lt;br /&gt;Took me 15 min only and I charged it up. I now have &amp;#34;a new shaver&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice. Didnt even have to solder, just slide the connectors together (checking the polarity)&lt;br /&gt;Works great!</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have good things to say about this product. I had no problem finding on-line instructions and replacing the old batteries of my Norelco shaver. For the first month or two I remained happy. However, after about two or three months, the batteries stopped holding their charge for more than a few days and would die and need to be recharged again. This situation was the reason I replaced them in the first place. Actually, it&#x27;s one step better than the reason I replaced them. I replace them when the original batteries held no charge at all and I had to have the razor plugged in to shave.</li>
            <li> I like it. I changed my old battery with this one. very easy installation, fast delivery and good cost. the charging time same as the original. my Shaver works 37 min. thanks</li>
            <li> Good product but a little hard to work with. Also, the batteries were not marked positive or negative so I had to call the distributor to get the information.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  10 minute battery switch:  1.  open case (2 screws), 2.  pry contacts from old batteries (used a very small screwdriver &amp; needle nose pliers), 3. bend new battery contacts into U shape to make contact with old battery contacts (I added a little foam inside U to be sure contacts would stay connected), 4. insert batteries, 5. close case.</li>
            <li> These are great batteries worth the price but they are a nightmare to replace in the razor because of having to be soldiered in.(which I didn&#x27;t do).  I found out how to install them without soldiering them  They are still going strong.</li>
            <li> Shaver&#x27;s charger wasn&#x27;t fond of this battery. The shaver wouldn&#x27;t run plugged in and it wouldn&#x27;t charge the battery enough for a complete shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these batteries for a couple years now and can safely say that You Get What You Pay For.  They are no where near as good as the original batteries that came with my Norelco shaver, but considering the amount  I paid for them, they are fine. I get about three or four shaves out of a charge, then a recharge is required. I am able to live with this because the charger is always plugged in any way.</li>
            <li> fits well.  works.  didn&#x27;t have to solder it in like the instructions say.  The space is sooo tight in there, that there&#x27;s enough pressure where the contacts are secure without soldering.</li>
            <li> batteries worked well but you do need a small soldering gun to put them in.everything went into place very well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with these.  Trying to get them into the razor is extremely difficult and I have quite a bit of experience with soldering connections.  Even took it to a friend who has far more electronic experience than I do and he gave up.  I threw the razor away and went and bought another one.  Just not worth the time, trouble or money.</li>
            <li> The battery itself was probably OK - but would have been difficult to install.  Just be aware, when you buy ANY battery for your electric razor, you will almost certainly have to solder it to the circuit board.  The manufactures are more interested in selling us NEW razors, so unlike many other products that have reasonably simple to change batteries, razors require an expertise you may not have.  I will end up buying another razor, since there is no way to get a new battery installed for much less than the cost of a new razor - and in Los Angeles, there are is no place to have it done - although there were a few places around LA..  You can mail your razor out of state, or drive - and  you&#x27;ll end up paying $45-$50 for a battery and the repair charge and you&#x27;ll still have an old razor.  IF you are intent on changing it yourself and have a soldering iron you may want to open up the razor before you purchase a battery, just to get an idea of how complicated the replacement procedure might be.  There are some generic how-to videos on the web, but they may not be anything like your particular razor, so think about trying to replace a battery before you make the purchase.</li>
            <li> I replaced batts in shaver. They are perfect replacement. This is the way to go. Cheaper then new shaver.Worked first try.</li>
            <li> But it works! Having replaced batteries in my over 20 year old Norelco many, many times, soldering was old hat. Be sure you use a low wattage pencil  iron , and have thin rosin core solder available.&lt;br /&gt;old  batteries lasted  exactly two years , who knows how long these will last. Replaced them as I just got two sets of replacement blades. Doubtful would fit on latest version of Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> I had to put something here. The shaver packed up from an unrelated cause before I got a chance to try it.</li>
            <li> Removing the old battery was the challenge.  I didn&#x27;t want to risk unsoldering the old battery from the circuit board because I thought the risk of buggering the circuit board too great. Instead I used a Dremel tool to cut off the old battery leads at the battery connections.  This entailed very carefully cutting the top off of the old batteries and then trimming. It was not a trivial task but not impossible.   Then I gently blew the inside of the shaver out with compressed air to remove any metal shavings and other debris.  Once this was complete it was easy to solder the new battery leads to the old batter leads, reassemble the shaver and charge the battery the conventional way.  It works great.</li>
            <li> Install was simple with a soldering iron and some patience. My trusty razor works like new again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t installed them yet.  Must be low quality because they have no markings.  I wanted to try them to see how they respond prior to getting a new shaver.  Ever notice how the old item last practically forever and the new one (made in China) doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> New life for the tri-shaver.  So cheap of them to make it difficult to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> This was for an old Norelco shaver. I started off having a problem with the battery because it didn&#x27;t have the positive pole and negative pole marked, and with no initial charge on it I couldn&#x27;t tell which way to put it in the shaver.  The shaver quit working soon after I got it working, so I can&#x27;t evaluate the battery.</li>
            <li> Used for 6 months and will no longer charge after 1 shave. It must remain on continual charge. Previous battery lasted years.</li>
            <li> Easy to buy, hard to install.</li>
            <li> Considerable difficulty in installation; else a good item. No other comment. Nothing else to say. no other observation.Good bye. Bye.</li>
            <li> This battery pack breathed new life into a shaver that my Dad was using while he was visiting on vacation. I followed others directions about not needing to solder the battery in and have had no problems. The shaver now holds a charge as if it was new.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the performance of this battery. After less than one year I am shopping for another replacement. The battery originally installed in the shaver lasted for many years (5-10, I don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ve had it). I expected the same from this battery. Lately it requires frequent charging and dies very suddenly.</li>
            <li> the batteries appear to be soldered on and no directions, worthless purchase, should never have purchased the batteries. waste of money</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly in restoring an old 8825XL razor.  I followed the advice of other reviewers.  I did not try to re-solder the new batteries, just made sure there was good lead contact.  Worked great!</li>
            <li> Work well.  Came faster than I thought.</li>
            <li> Worked fine in my very old Gizmo can opener. I did have to use a voltmeter to find out which terminal was positive and negative, because they are NOT marked on the batteries!!!  A little tricky to attach the leads to the battery terminals they are very very thin and easily bend. Used pliers to crimp the connection tight after insertion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After a day in the dock, it works perfectly like new! Very speedy and powerful again, and best of all very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find these and replace my dead ones, but after a few months they aren&#x27;t holding a charge</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best batteries for the price on the market. Installed these babies in my Norelco shaver and now it works better than when I first got the shaver. The batteries hold a charge for over a week. The originals only held a charge for a day. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I gave up on the install and just bought a new shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent that the batteries have tabs already attached, this makes soldering so much easier.  Its best if you can cut the tabs on the battery you are replacing, then just solder the new tabs to the old tabs, this makes replacement much easier.</li>
            <li> The new battery pack was easy to replace after reading other reviews and I also did not solder the new battery leads. Now the shaver has new life.</li>
            <li> W took this Battery pack, and Razor to the man that works on my computer and VIOLA.&lt;br /&gt;ps. HE INSTALLED IT FOR FREE</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  These batteries will discharge on their own over about a week of just sitting on my counter in my shaver..  total crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original : I can&#x27;t say for sure the longevity of these, but initially, the motor speed is slower, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to like to be charged with the factory charger.  It does work, it does recharge, but it isn&#x27;t the same as the factory batteries.  I do have solder experience, I did de-solder and install the new ones with the full process, and am not convinced I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> I purchased these batteries quite awhile ago. You have to be a little handy to install them but I found it wasn&#x27;t hard at all. I followed some suggestions from other customers and didn&#x27;t do any soldering of the wires (didn&#x27;t want to create too much heat) but pinched them into place. It worked well. You save a lot of money doing it yourself.</li>
            <li> The batteries arrived on time and worked as described. I un-soldered the old ones and soldered in the new ones. Works like new now. My razor is a Norelco 6885XL  bought in 2001.</li>
            <li> I have been asking for info to remove the old batteries from my shaver. As of this date no one has contacted me.</li>
            <li> This shaver battery pack has made my shaver operate  normal.  I am satisfied with the battery pack.  Thank you, kindly</li>
            <li> Battery works like original.  Time will tell if if keeps charges for as long as original.  After 2 months, so far so good.  Note, as one review stated, installation is a bit tricky.  I cut the original battery out with cuticle scissors.  Then bent connectors on new battery and wedged against original connector stubs for a flawless connection.</li>
            <li> Worked OK for the first few months but never held a charge worth a darn.  I do not think these batteries are OEM.  Probably counterfiet junk.</li>
            <li> When my Quad Action Norelco shaver batteries were barely able to hold a day&#x27;s charge, I considered buying a new razor. I had heard that replacing the unit&#x27;s rechargeable batteries was more hassle than it was worth, particularly because they had to be soldered and because it was easy to ruin the circuit board. But I came across these batteries on Ebay, found them for less on Amazon, gave them a try, and am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced my old batteries with these with no hassle. No solder was necessary. I clipped the old soldered connectors and simply replaced the spent batteries with these new batteries. The old terminals in the razor pressed against the battery contacts, and no movement was possible. When I reassembled the razor, it worked well.  It has now been more than two weeks since I put on the initial charge. My unit is still going strong on my initial charge with no sign of needing to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I am delighted with the outcome. For less than $7 I have virtually a new razor.</li>
            <li> Along with the battery, make sure you have a solder iron and some solder, and don&#x27;t forget a small precision screwdriver. My Norelco needs to be taken apart to change the battery, the old battery is soldered in from the inside.....</li>
            <li> Arrived quick and works perfectly. Charged one time and have been using the shaver for about a week now on the same charge! I was going to but a new shaver but i thought i would try this battery first. Glad i did, Shaver is like new!</li>
            <li> The batteries fit perfectly and wrked well. Would recommend for replacing batteries in Norelco rotary shavers. Easy to order and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It might be OK, but I did not use it since I can not replace the old one in my shaver.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this battery for my Norelco 7865 XL razor.  The hard part was getting the old batter to separate from the soldered connections, but using a small flat screwdriver I was able to do it with a bit of effort.  The long connectors on the new battery can be positioned so that they stay in contact with the metal connectors of the razor.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week with no problems.  I have not had to charge it since the initial charge.  One note, however: the battery made a somewhat loud noise while charging, which made me think there might be something wrong.  However, it charged fine and works well.</li>
            <li> About 6 months ago I replaced the original batteries in my Norelco shaver with these after several years of daily use. I took the shaver and new batteries to a little radio repair shop and had them installed for $3. When I opened the shaver up the soldering looked way too delicate for me to accomplish but the experienced radio man did it in just a couple of minutes. The shaver has worked like new (I also replaced the heads) for the entire 6 months. I am really pleased with this purchase because it did exactly what I wanted. I would recommend having an accomplished electronic technician do the installation unless you are pretty skilled with a small soldering iron. I read the other reviews where people had installed the batteries without soldering them in but that just didn&#x27;t seem like the way to go to me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, easy solder install, charged up nice and now my shaver functions like new...</li>
            <li> good as described would buy again</li>
            <li> great product and price</li>
            <li> Battery pack has given new life to my nine-year-old Norelco Quadra 7865XL shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just followed tips offered by previous commenters.  Relatively easy installation.  Folded back each tab in half (no solder needed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note the + terminal tab is the one on the right when holding the pack with the tabs at the top and facing away from you.  The + end of each battery in the pack is also distinguished by a thin white border around the exposed metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it would much easier if the vendor/manufacturer just added the conventional + and - signs appropriately.  :)</li>
            <li> It required some fiddling with the anti-fiddle screws that manufacturers love to use on appliances, and a bit of expertise with a soldering iron, but it wasn&#x27;t beyond my capabilities and made my shaver zoom again.</li>
            <li> Would be great if it would fit in the case. I suggest you check your old battery before ordering this product.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as it was advertised.  Very satisfied with the results.  Easy installation.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more !</li>
            <li> I bought a Norelco 5825XL for $1.00 at a garage sale. It looked like it hadn&#x27;t been used very much, if at all. It had an electric cord, so I thought I could just plug it in and shave. Wrong! It has to have functioning batteries. I looked around the web and it appeared that the lowest cost of sending this shaver off for repair was about $40.00 with shipping. For that, I can buy a new shaver. I opened it up to see what was inside, thinking I could just buy a couple of batteries at a local store. I was quite surprised to see that the batteries were soldered together at their base and to two tabs at the top. What to do...Hmmm&lt;br /&gt;I checked Amazon and found this battery pack, then read the reviews, many of which contained valuable removal and installation instructions. I ordered the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reviewers noted that if you carefully remove the old batteries, leaving the former tabs intact, attached to the razor, you wouldn&#x27;t have to solder at all. You could bend them up vertically, as you would on the new batteries, then press the old and new together to make contact, using spacers at the base of the batteries to create contact pressure. I know most battery operated devices use small springs to maintain contact, so I thought I&#x27;d give the procedure a try. But to be safe, I also decided to use a pinch of silicone glue along the batteries&#x27; underside once they were making good contact. I bent the tabs, so that they were touching and plugged in the razor to see if the charging light went on. Bingo! Success! I ran a bead of silicone caulk along the length of each battery, and placed them into the battery compartment, tabs touching tabs. I cut small 30 lb. paper spacers to lodge between the batteries and the shaver base. It took quite a few until the battery placement felt secure and when plugged in, the charge light went on. Temporarily, I wrapped the open razor in masking tape to hold the battery pack in place until the silicone glue dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor works great. I can solder and have a soldering iron, but I prefer the procedure/system that I followed. If I need to change the battery pack again, there&#x27;s no solder weld to break and I can just remove the battery pack with a little tug and blade to break the silicone bead.razor works great.

            <li> The batteries are a direct replacement for my Razor, and function just like a new unit. A soldering station is required to replace them, and some care must be used to avoid damaging plastic parts in the vicinity of the batteries. If you have the tools for the job, it is an easy task, and certainly beats the replacement cost of the razor.</li>
            <li> A great way to extend the use of my Norelco shaver</li>
            <li> I had my 5603x for seven years and replaced the heads once. That worked out to about twelve bucks a year for a great shave!  When the batteries finally gave out, I looked into replacing them too, but when I opened the shaver up and saw what would be involved, including the \\&quot;time to do it\\&quot;, (isn&#x27;t &#x27;planned obsolescence&#x27; great!! )I figured buying a new one would be doing my part to help the economy anyway, so \\&quot;why bother\\&quot; with such a tedious task and risk damaging other parts in the process(and then what!?). It would have been just as easy for Norelco to make the shaver with \\&quot;snap in\\&quot; batteries (maybe easier!) but they need us to buy new ones for their bottom line!! Hopefully my new one will last as long and perform as well as this one did....RIP 5603x!!  If you have the time and patience for such an endeavor, have at it!!</li>
            <li> Wow! The order came in about 24 hours after I placed it.  I love the free shipping! Way cheaper than that on-line auction site.  Thank you, Buy-it-now-store!  The Torx Screws on my razor also had plain old slots too,   So I used a small standard screw driver. Lifted up cover at the bottom.  Pry the tabs off the old battery (w/ knife point), it will fall out.  Fold over the tabs on the new pack, and pop in the new pack.   The contact was solid and the razor worked fine.  Note:  Be careful not to short the contacts on the steel strap above the contacts.  This strap is where the top screw holds the cover on. (On my model).  I only soldered the tabs, because the iron was already warmed up.  The tabs took the solder nicely, unlike some I&#x27;ve seen.   Took me about 30 seconds to do the soldering.  Before ordering, I charged up the old pack and ran the motor  while checking the voltage on each cell. 1.27 volts and 0.85 volts!   One of my very old nicads was dying! :(  I think these are around 7 years old. How can that be?   Before installing these replacement cells, I stuck them on my   fancy Simprop battery charger/tester (used for RC model plane packs).  I ran them up and down twice. 818 mA to charge and 753 mA to discharge.  This leads me to believe these are good 700 mAh cells.   (Plus the number 700 was printed on each cell). :)  I would recommend these cells to anyone. If you don&#x27;t have   a pocket knife and a small screwdriver, call your nerd buddy,  show him the pictures (above) and he/she will have you shaving   with full power in no time!  Cheers,  Rich  Edit: Update 9/29/11  I&#x27;ve used the razor 15 times since installing the new cells.   I just put it on the charging stand for the first time.  Edit: Update 10/18/11  Doing my second charge today. Got 20 shaves. It seems like the new cells  are working normally.   No more updates unless something unusual occurs.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this new shaver battery pack simply did not work out for me. I hate it because I really like that old shaver better than the newer models. I could not get the tabs on the new battery pack to make a proper connection that would hold. After several tries to make such a  connection, per the instructions, one of the new contacts simply broke off. Sounds like I am a real clutz, but not so with most \\&quot;do it yourself\\&quot; matters such as this. I think you are rolling the dice to make these contacts work, but some of you more gifted will surely triumph.</li>
            <li> I figured $6.00 vs. a new razor I would try the replacement myself. Armed with the detailed \\&quot;how to\\&quot; from J. Muir, I ordered my batteries, got out my son&#x27;s old soldering iron and once they arrived discharged my shaver&#x27;s original battery and opened the case. Both the old and new batteries were in sets of two already glued together and soldered by a strip at their bases. The most important and difficult part was using a screwdriver and long nose pliars to carefully pry off the strips of soldered metal that goes down into the battery circuit board from the head of the old battery pack. I straightened them so that I could solder the strips from the new batteries to the strips remaining from the old. The soldering part scared me because of my inexperience. I found that with the old strips standing straight up I could bend the new strips straight down to stick them in front of the old--making pretty firm contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to skip the soldering, thought briefly about wire glue, and went ahead with this experiment that I could revisit if need be. With the new strips pushed in front of the old my plug in/time dial lit up, so I used a piece of duct tape to make the batteries in the battery holder in the shaver more secure from jiggling. I closed it, recharged it, and have been using it for over a week (and with this current edit for over two years without a problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone ever use duct tape on ducts?</li>
            <li> I have repaired several electric shavers by replacing dead batteries. I have been able to buy those batteries from Amazom. Thanks for the service.</li>
            <li> the batteries are working perfectly and the shaver is like new again.  they are not easy to install but not impossible either.</li>
            <li> This battery is a perfect fit in the Norelco shaver and is easy to install.  My shaver had gotten to where I had to charge it every few days and it still felt anemic.  My wife said buy a new shaver, I said for only a few dollars on this replacement battery I can have a like new shaver.  You have to be able to solder electronic circuits to install this battery, but it is really easy.</li>
            <li> The battery arrived promptly and as advertised.  It works fine after I replaced the old worn out battery in my Norelco shaver with this new one.</li>
            <li> Soldered right in without trouble.</li>
            <li> You must be absolutely sure which battery pack your shaver takes before you purchase any replacement battery.  To do that you likely will have to take your shaver apart before you order.</li>
            <li> Not too difficult to install following instructions in a YouTube video I found online. I avoided throwing out an otherwise perfectly good shaver.</li>
            <li> Although you need to solder the connections which isn&#x27;t to hard to do, these batteries work great! Awesome replacement for my shaver</li>
            <li> I forgot how long this razor would keep a charge! I was very impressed with the solder tabs on the battery...very easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I took delivery about 15 January. It was already charged (Let&#x27;s just say the Norelco charged for 10 minutes.) I recharged it March 30. I kid you not. Used every day and it just keeps going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word on installation. It comes with a rubber sleeve over one prong. The sleeve prevents it shorting out in transit. Pull it off! Do what others have said. Cut off the old prongs as close to the old battery ends as possible because leaving the old prongs in place creates a nice tight friction fit when you push in the new prongs. Also, getting the cover back in place is not a mindless snap job. You need to get everything aligned and that takes a bit of concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually waste my time on reviews but this battery is well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: September 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here it is September 17th 2014 and the battery is still performing as well as it did when new! Three months ago I experenced an intermitant short when using the Norelco, so after a couple of weeks of annoyance I opened it up and soldered the battery leads in place. A dab of solder on the battery leads and a dab of solder on the contacts and then hold them together while heating them and the solder fuses them together. End of problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: August 2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong! Once in a while, not very often, someone does something really well.</li>
            <li> a little tough to install, just take your time.  I had a very expensive electric shaver NOTHING WAS WRONG SMOOTH SHAVE, but the battery went dead i replaced the battery in about 30 minutes and save LITERALLY OVER $100.00</li>
            <li> Battery arrived on time and worked as soon as it was soldered in place. Order was followed up on by supplier to be sure everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> My shaver&#x27;s old batteries required re-charging every other day. I installed and charged the new batteries two weeks ago and I still have about 2 days left before I need to recharge them. Just like when it was new!</li>
            <li> Great Fast shipping. Had to watch a video on how to install it, but it was fairly easy. Razor would show 45 minutes of shaving time with the old battery but with the new battery it shows about 30. However, I have gotten five or more shaves after it shows it is empty.</li>
            <li> Had it for 2 weeks and works so far. You will need a soldering iron to install it. Also pay attention to the battery polarity orientation because that is not straight forward. The battery will work in one orientation only, the best way to find that out is by dry fitting it both orientations and watching the shaver function. Once the orientation is determined, solder the battery in place. The battery will fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> These are far too challenging to install in shavers.  I thought I could get away with it....unless you have lots of soldering skills, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I had to solder it in place, which I was hoping not to since it was supposed to be a straight-forward replacement.  The overall life of the battery was much shorter than the original and so I decided to retire the shaver in favor of a new one now that the new battery quit holding a charge.</li>
            <li> Replaced because the original battery, which was several years old, only lasted a few shaves without requiring charging. Replacing it was not too difficult. I soldered the new one in. I can&#x27;t see much change in performance. Still only lasts 2-3 shaves before it runs weakly and the red charge light comes on.</li>
            <li> I watched a video on youtube that showed how to install this new battery. It was a little tedious but not too bad. My shaver works great again without having to spend $150 for a new one. If you have a $10 soldering gun, you can install it yourself. Just take your time and it&#x27;s pretty simple. find the video for norelco shaver battery replacement for your model number, on youtube, then Fix your shaver like new for $10. I would like to add that I have never had a problem with anything I have purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> this batttery pack works just great,charged battery works like new. I was able to instal with out soldering leads to geather.</li>
            <li> These are great. The seller sent to me better replacement batteries than I ordered at no extra charge!! The ordered ones were 600mahour batts &amp; the one sent to me were 1000 mahour batteries.Almost 65% more capacity !( mahour means milliamp hours&#x3D; how many hours they will put out one milliamp of electrical current,EG if your razor takes 100milliamps of current to run its motor , the batts would run your razor motor for 10 hours --simple !!)&lt;br /&gt;Norelco will say you can not replace the batts. Youm can &amp; it is easy &amp; you do not need to solder any thing or have a solder gun. See some of the other reviews. The old batts can be removed by cutting out with small sissors or a cutical cutters. See other reviews on this. Then put in the new batts with the terminals that are on the new batts folded back so they will press against the old batt terminals which come out of the pc board. Again read al the other reviews to se al the comments.&lt;br /&gt;Since I bot two sets so X years from now I can do it again the seller sent me a bonus of two extra batts ( so I got 3 sets total. )for no extra charge.&lt;br /&gt;Spectacular. The new batts work great &amp; give many shaves between charging.</li>
            <li> I installed this battery in my dead Norelco 785SX a few months after I purchased it. After I soldered it into the PWB (there&#x27;s no simple way to open the circuit during this procedure) some parts on the PWB (a choke and an IC) became very hot in a second.  The battery itself also started warming up, which indicated a short-circuit to me. To make the long story short, I found that the battery leads were oriented so that the polarity was reversed if installed as a drop-in replacement.  I had to un-solder it, flip it over, make leads extensions and solder it again.  After re-charging the battery everything worked as intended, to my surprise and satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;I have no clue how in the wold the circuitry has survived the reversed for ~ 5 mins. polarity...</li>
            <li> Ok but not the best battery if you are looking for longevity  --mine lasted a year before weekly re-charging; others are available with longer life</li>
            <li> After installation, I charged my new batteries.  I have used my shaver every day for 3 weeks and its initial charge is still holding!</li>
            <li> Did not work for my razor.</li>
            <li> It works great. Don&#x27;t attempt this if you don&#x27;t have a fine soldering unit available. This is the second unit I have repaired.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly in my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> Revived my old Norelco shaver that I almost tossed.</li>
            <li> This battery pack, which I purchased from QRW solutions, was a perfect replacement for my 10 year old Norelco.  Although this looks like a pair of AA batteries, it is not a drop-in replacement. The battery pack is connected through a pair of flat leads, which are soldered to the razor&#x27;s circuit board. I pried the leads away from the old battery pack with the tip of a small screwdriver, then snipped them with a wire cutter, leaving the old leads as long as possible. I then cleaned the surfaces of the old leads that had been in contact with the batteries, using emery cloth wrapped around the eraser end of a pencil. Next, I installed the new pack adjusting its leads so that they pressed against the old leads. Finally, I soldered the new and old leads together, using my smallest soldering iron. This method avoids having to remove the circuit board or apply any heat to it. My razor now works perfectly! I found this to be a fairly easy repair, but have had a lot of experience working on electronic items - and have the necessary tools! QRW provided fast service and the battery pack arrived almost fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li> Exact fit didn&#x27;t even have to solder connections just cut old connections at the batteries and folded them down did the same when installing new battery pack. It is a shame they did not offer an upgrade to Li-ion. Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Have purchased two different battery packs and both were absolutely great, easy to install, have worked great and could not be more pleased.Will continue to purchase them as needed.</li>
            <li> These batteries were a perfect fit for my Norelco 7865XL rechargeble shaver. My other batteries were the original after 7 years and were not holding a charge for longer than 1 day. Now I can go almost 10 days again without charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries took about 20 minutes to replace. If you are good with soldering circuit board stuff you will be able to do this battery change out. You will need a pencil type soldering iron with chisel tip and desoldering copper braid.</li>
            <li> fast shipping fit well. i had fun soldering them in. like the other guys said leave the tabs nice and long- makes it easier to solder yours in. also good to have one of those pencil type soldering guns. let it get nice and hot first, then do it quickly so you dont&#x27; cook the circuitry. my battery worked right out of the box.</li>
            <li> The batteries were not holding a charge on my old Norelo shaver model 5825. I spent hours looking at the new Norelo models and could not justify spending over one hundred dollars on the new cheaply made models. Found this battery pack on Amazon. Easy to install, but you do need a sodering gun. Now my old shaver works like new again.</li>
            <li> Fit and worked.&lt;br /&gt;This second battery outlasted my interest in the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It is now shaving my son&#x27;s whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;Had battery life for weeks when first installed&lt;br /&gt;Your Mileage May Vary</li>
            <li> The batteries in my Norelco Razor died so I thought for the price of these replacements I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose. I cut the old batteries loose, left enough tension on the leads to make contact with the new batteries when installed....replaced the cover and I was finished. After two months it still works.</li>
            <li> Seller said this would fit in Norelco shaver 6826 XL, and it did not.</li>
            <li> These batteries worked perfectly in my Remington Titanium razor.  The only problem was that they come glued together so I had to cut them apart (they sit in a V-shape in my razor).  I went from charging my razor every 3 days to.... well, I haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet and it&#x27;s been about 2 weeks so I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Easy to replace the existingn battery in my Norelco Quadra 7 razor.</li>
            <li> This was a very easy to replace item. I never knew all these years that the battery could be replaced at home. Thank you.</li>
            <li> When I finally received the shipment (which was 4 days late) [[ASIN:B000FP63M4 Shaver Battery Pack fits most Norelco models &amp; others]]I was disapponted to find that the terminals were unmarked with a + or - sign.  Since no instructions were included I had to guess how to install correctly so the poles matched up. I may have damaged the old razor in replacing the battery pack.</li>
            <li> The battery replacement was easy following the guidelines of others here. Something not mentioned if the razor is a model with the trimmer blade: When replacing the the back cover of the razor make sure the drive motor tab is engaged in the notch of the trimmer. It would be easy to break the tab if the cover screws were tightened without this step. If the motor or trimmer haven&#x27;t been moved then this is no problem. In my case I tested the motor after installing the new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that this is a job for someone with mechanical/electrical experience. Even if the old battery is discharged before removal, I found the replacement was charged. Shorting it during installation could cause it to vent or burst. At least wear glasses during the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the low price of new razors it would seem to be more trouble than it worth to replace the battery. However, a quick look at the new Not-Relcos made in China cleared my thinking.</li>
            <li> Batteries worked like a charm. Installation is not for the faint of heart. Do some reading about how to do the installation before you try it unless you are very comfortable with de-soldering and soldering (I am).&lt;br /&gt;I missed reviewing this item and can now tell you it is still working after over two years.</li>
            <li> These replacement batteries worked great in my Norelco. Much cheaper than buying a new shaver. Bought these awhile back and they are still working great.</li>
            <li> You will need to remove the old battery and install the new one with a soldering iron.  Take note of the polarity of the old battery (i.e. you want to connect the positive battery terminal on the new battery to the same wire).  The most difficult part was opening the plastic casing, my shaver had plastic snaps keeping it closed.  Eventually I had to just yank it open- luckily nothing broke.  Closing it was also a little tricky, putting the circuit board in place without any in instructions.  If you are patient, and good with your hands, you can install this battery.</li>
            <li> Fit with no problems at all, plus it was much cheaper than local sources. Went from a 10 minute charge on my razor to only having to plug it in once a week or so. Feels like I&#x27;ve got a new razor.</li>
            <li> I did not realize as a user that I would need a Star Wrench bit and good soldering skills when I made this purchase. The need for a tool was the first surprise - I feel an allen star tool could have been included. I picked one up at Home Depot. I read in the instructions about the soldering, but once it was apart, I realized this was not an easy solder &amp; space to work in. With my current battery completely dead, I removed it by clipping the pin connection at the battery - allowing me to solder the new battery right at the connections. But when I re-assembled and charged it. The shaver lights came on and read full charge, but my Norelco Reflex Plus shaver won&#x27;t run off the battery. After leading it out for a few days, I noticed I get one red light for a dead battery. I can run it off AC, which indicates a good connection. So it would seem after all this work, I was either shipped a BAD battery, or somehow in soldering I damaged it. Based on my experience, I would not recommend this battery and procedure to other prospective users.</li>
            <li> These fit right into my old Norelco razor, and it was not necessary to solder them in place. There are a couple of videos on YouTube showing how to install them without soldering.</li>
            <li> This battery pack worked fine.  You must soldier the connections which was expected.  I have charged it once after repair and still going strong 3 weeks later without recharge yet.</li>
            <li> These batteries hold a charge for a long time. A little tricky installing the batteries in the shaver but it was no fault of the batteries.</li>
            <li> Appears to be a bit difficult to install from watching the videos on line...but will know better when I actually tackle the installation.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the old battery pack was soldered onto the circuit board. I thought I could just take the dead batteries out and replace with the new ones.&lt;br /&gt;Instead I had to unsolder the terminal strips and then solder the replacement battery pack terminal strips in place.&lt;br /&gt;That fact should be noted in the description.&lt;br /&gt;BR</li>
            <li> Installation is a bit tricky if you do not have the right tools. I did not but simply looped and twisted on the connectors and it works great.</li>
            <li> Battery pack fit perfectly. I did solder it in since my soldering skills are fine. Others have suggested cutting the leads from the old battery pack and bending them to make contact with the new one. This is not a bad idea, but I&#x27;m not sure it will work on this model razor, as the lead to one of the bateries is very short, even if cut as close to the battery as possible.</li>
            <li> Once I got the batteries installed, it worked like a miracle – the shaver was powerful, retained power for a long time, and delivered consistent power.  Great batteries but these were hard to install into the Norelco.  It took some skill to solder it into the bed of the shaver.  But for a few bucks to save an old favorite shaver, it was worth trying.  Even if it did not work, it would have been worth the effort to try to save the shaver.  If it didn’t work, then at least I have two new rechargeable batteries I can use on other devices.  It made an old shaver feel like new again.</li>
            <li> works just fine in my razor</li>
            <li> Worked at first and I was pleased but after a couple of months they wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a few days.  Now they won&#x27;t even accept a charge.  I&#x27;d pass on this one if I were you cause it just didn&#x27;t make it.  Look elsewhere for better quality.</li>
            <li> Hold the charge fair enough. It does the work. Need some soldering but fine with me.</li>
            <li> While the battery pack fit the shaver it must be soldered in place.  I have the soldering iron &amp; solder, but was a very difficult taks because my iron&#x27;s lowest thermostat setting was too high.  Also, since putting these in the razor runs all the time.  There&#x27;s no way to turn it off.  When I talked to Norelce the shaver was so old they advised to just use it as a &amp;#34;plugged&amp;#34; razor or toss &amp; buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Battery easy to install,some soldering work to do,but only took a few minutes to do.Charged the battery and the shaver worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace the batteries in the Norelco Shaver. The factory says that you can&#x27;t do it but most anyone can if they have access to the right screw driver and needle nose pliers can do it. EASY</li>
            <li> Item was the right price.  Item was as described and was shipped out fast.  Would recommend this for anyone needing a new battery pack for their razer.</li>
            <li> We have replaced the batteries in the Norelco shaver for the second time and it works again the way it should.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  These batteries did not work as apparently special slightly higher voltages are needed for certain applications.  Check this</li>
            <li> I bought this battery pack for a very old Remington shaver that stopped charging.  Works perfectly.  Keep in mind that you have to open the shaver and solder the wires to the new battery.  So you need the tools and the skills.  The battery pack is perfect for this application and worked fine after installation. Don&#x27;t try this if you don&#x27;t have a soldering iron, solder, and know how to use them.</li>
            <li> Priced right, fairly easy to install, holds the charge well---over-all, it&#x27;s like having a brand new razor!&lt;br /&gt;Why buy a new one?</li>
            <li> Yeah it was a little tricky soldering the batt pack in but well worth it. Saved me from throwing a perfectly good razor into the land fill. I hope Norelco has made this more user friendly in the newer models.</li>
            <li> Some soldering skills needed as mentioned in product description. Desoldering the old batteries and getting the old solder out of the slot where the new tabs go in was the most difficult part of replacing the batteries. Not too difficult. Product performs just fine.</li>
            <li> Good company, on time shipping, good product. Five stars!</li>
            <li> Great price, works well.</li>
            <li> Good Deal.  The installation instructions provided by the seller were exact.  Of course the pictures helped also.  Just so happen I have a small hand held welder.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Works great and has the correct sized tabs. However, I would advise following a previous reviewers comments about not de-soldering the OEM battery tabs on the Remington&#x27;s board, just remove the old pack (bending them slightly worked for me) from the existing tabs and solder the new battery to the old tabs that are still attached to the board.  Some of the clearances on the board are very tight, and you risk shorting out the leads to adjacent solder points when you try to solder.</li>
            <li> I ordered 6-20-2014, received batteries 6-25-2014. Packaged well and exactly as advertised. They fit into my Reming trimmer without modification. The polarity (+ - ) not marked but I figured the end with ridge around it is positive looking at my old batteries. The two batteries were already tab soldered, so I put them in and the trimmer was alive again. I did charge them and ran the batteries down to recharge and everything seems fine. Glad to have my old trimmer operational again.</li>
            <li> These batteries seemed to be working fine when I initially installed them.  (I carefully avoided soldering close to the batteries an tried to heat the battery leads as little as possible when connecting them.)  After a few months they started to not hold a charge and now, after a year or so, they don&#x27;t hold a charge longer than about 15-20 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now looking for some new replacements and you can be sure, I&#x27;ll look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This battery pack was installed in an seventeen year old Norelco shaver and the shaver is working like new!  The battery pack is fairly easy to install . . . several You-Tube type videos were found giving instructions!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this battery because it is not oem. With the help of online videos on how to properly replace my husband&#x27;s, Norelco, this battery works even better than the original. My husband is sure that it last much longer than the oem and we save some $$$ by not having to replace his Norelco.  Great product Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 4 days without a recharge. No need to solder, just bend the tabs to make a &amp;#34;V&amp;#34;. It worked great.</li>
            <li> The battery pack worked as advertised.  I am very pleased with it. The tip on soldering the old tabs to the new tabs was helpful. Thanks very much.</li>
            <li> Nothing before or after advised that the old battery leads were soldered in and the new needed to be soldered in. The new ones are worthless to me!&lt;br /&gt;Steve B.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth buying and replacing the batteries instead of buying a whole new shaver.  Ok I guess I have to add 6 more words to finish this or it won&#x27;t submit my comment ha ha just did it.</li>
            <li> Be ready to disassemble and solder the battery into place, but when completed, ~ 15 min you will have a new razor. It is as good as new!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and effort on these batteries. I replaced mine a year ago it worked fine for a while but now although shaver shows three lights but shaver won&#x27;t work until I charged it again.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  Fast shipping.  Had to move tab to get it to fit without soldering.  Nothing to it.  Had it for 2 weeks without recharging it.  It&#x27;s like new again.</li>
            <li> This battery pack turned my razor into new again, very simple to install if you are handy with your hands, If not there are videos on U Tube explaining in easy steps on how to install.</li>
            <li> Take old batteries and put new batteries on shaver, recharge batteries very well and work batteries very good and no problems</li>
            <li> The delivery was fine and packaging was good and I had no problem soldering the battery&#x27;s in to the razor-charged the system and have been using it with no problems.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I replaced these batteries on my Norelco Razor ,,,I purchaced two other newer Norelco razors but neither shave as good as this older model 6826XL  ,,,one would think that they would improve  the product not make it worse and the motor even sounds better and stronger than either of my newer quick charge models</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Long Term Life is Poor</li>
            <li> battery was not the one for the camera after I opened the case. waited too late to send back</li>
            <li> I bought this item because my battery in my razor was old.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to find no instruction how to install, so I wound up&lt;br /&gt;very sad it would not work&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;it was hard to try to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A UPDATE ON MY REVIEW::&lt;br /&gt;I WAS TO DUMB TO KNOW THAT YOU FIRST HAVE TO CHARGE THE NEW BATTERY BEFORE IT WORKS. all I did was take the razor apart and with snips cut the old battery out put in the new one in. make sure you put it in with the strips down so they make contact with the existing contacts.&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t need nothing else.</li>
            <li> used a youtube video for installation tips and the product was installed and works correctly.  you should know how to solder.</li>
            <li> Thought I had a dead razor but no longer!  Just unscrewed the 2 screws, separated the 2 halves, and replaced the battery!  Make sure its in the right position though and follow the simple instruction outlined here in the other reviews and you should be good to go.  No need to solder as stated.</li>
            <li> The battery retained a charge for 5 - 6 shaves (good) for about a week.  Shortly thereafter the charge was barely enough for one shave.  I suspect a quality control problem in the battery manufacture, but I can&#x27;t rule out a faulty charging circuit. I&#x27;ll try another battery.</li>
            <li> Took a little delicate work to take apart and solder the batteries to the shaver.</li>
