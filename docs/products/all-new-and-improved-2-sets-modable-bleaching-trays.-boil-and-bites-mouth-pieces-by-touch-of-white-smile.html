            <li>These have worked great for me!  </li>
            <li>These work great for me!</li>
            <li>They worked perfectly for what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>However, when they are done well, they are very nice!</li>
            <li>so i hope they work great with the gel and do the job and bleach my teeth</li>
            <li>They are great.</li>
            <li>great deal, great product</li>
            <li>Once I was happy with the impression, I put the tray in ice water for awhile to set it.)</li>
            <li>Happy</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m happy with it, I&#x27;m just still in the process using it, so I&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li>Works great, but if you are like me there may be a learning curve on getting it perfect, and as cheap as these are buy extras.</li>
            <li>Top worked great...</li>
            <li>These are nice trays.</li>
            <li>Allows you to make your own molds and then buy your own whitening agent.</li>
            <li>I could see the impression of my teeth so good that I was able to trim away the excess with my Tonic scissors.</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll just have to figure out how to use them on my own....</li>
            <li>Cheap and effective, nice.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li>They are better than nothing, I suppose, but there are better products out there for this purpose.</li>
            <li>So for the money I paid for these (1.99 + 4.5 S/H), I am extremely pleased.    </li>
            <li>and the fit was ...not even close !</li>
            <li>You get a couple of extras, so that you can practice the fitting process if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The plate should not be able to shift in your mouth using your fingers when done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not been able to use the cream did not bring me to apply</li>
            <li>Woorks ok for the price.</li>
            <li>But once I got them to fit properly, they have been perfect!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and it works.</li>
            <li>easy to use, works well</li>
            <li>The first top tray impression was pretty good but after reheating it and finessing the fit a bit more, it was a fantastic.</li>
            <li>Of course these do not work as well as the ones made by the dentist, but if you pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing these work fine, and you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li>and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>If your interested in a bleaching tray best option is to received a custom one from your orthodontist because these trays melted on me INSTANTLY..</li>
            <li>Everything is fine.</li>
            <li>now i can enjoy my pearly whites.</li>
            <li>It was cheap.</li>
            <li>If you are using a UV light in conjunction with gel, this matters.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t have to heat up twice because the first impression was pretty darned good.    </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, I used the no boil no bite trays, they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>Easy to mold work after the first try</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit your mouth well enough to be effective</li>
            <li>At the cost of having a dentist do your molds for you this product works great and for a LOT less then the professionals.</li>
            <li>You need to work fast as soon as you get the tray in the hot water; make sure you don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>these are easy to mould, but are very bulky</li>
            <li>Easy to use and even remold without any real problems.</li>
            <li>i wished they worked slightly a little better and fit more for the lowers</li>
            <li>these ones came out way nicer and fit really snugly.</li>
            <li>A picture is worth a thousand words.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>so with a little searching...here is a fairly good set of instructions..    </li>
            <li>First of all, when I opened the box, they were not wrapped in anything.</li>
            <li>These were an excellent inexpensive replacement for the expensive Dentist supplied trays that I lost.</li>
            <li>I did have to leave them in the hot water</li>
            <li>These are bigger than most peoples mouth.</li>
            <li>These are basic teeth whitening trays that can be boiled and then molded to your teeth for better whitening gel contact to the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Your better off buying from Colgate at your local retail store.  </li>
            <li>Followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li>They did not mold well, and one would be better off just going to the dentist or buying crest white strips</li>
            <li>this is your first experience with boil and bit trays, a couple of hints when fitting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you place in hot water and fit them, they become clear.</li>
            <li>Do the same :)</li>
            <li>And if you follow the instructions, the water they are being put in is not &#x27;boiling water&#x27; but boiled water that&#x27;s been put in a cup and somewhat cooled down, so regardless of how many people have handled these unprotected trays, they will not be clean or sterile before going in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Hard to use, you have to do 2 much, thats why they were so cheap, go to the dentist, way better..!</li>
            <li>i just want a mouth piece not a hard mouth gaurd.&#x60;!!</li>
            <li>The trays that came with my bleaching gel were much thinner, easier to mold and more comfortable; unfortunately I misplaced them.</li>
            <li>easy to use and an extra set just in case.</li>
            <li>As long as you can get these fitted just right, they do the trick, and are fairly comfortable.</li>
            <li>Yes this is basically the same mouthguard you wear for sports, but it works fine for bleaching.</li>
            <li>I assume I can figure out the boil and bite process for molding these to my teeth but are instructions really too much to ask?</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very unprofessional and unsanitary.</li>
            <li>You can tell when it softens up and is ready to mold.</li>
            <li>They molded somewhat but didn&#x27;t really give much definition to my teeth for bleaching.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really work for teeth whiting.</li>
            <li>Does not confirm to teeth at all, not worth the hassle of ordering and waiting to still have to shop for a suitable item.</li>
            <li>this product is working very well</li>
            <li>Not so good, at least for me.  </li>
            <li>I probably will go back and do a little more fine tuning on my trimming with a jewelry file.     </li>
            <li>These work well, are easy peasy to mold and have lasted, so far, through several whitening sessions.  </li>
            <li>Also, this is only the third time that I have ever done this, and the first where I actually went back and trimmed the excess to get more of a custom dental tray fit.</li>
            <li>id highly recommend these trays.</li>
            <li>The bottom tray was a little more problematic.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;All New and Improved...\\&quot; since I didn&#x27;t have the problems others did.</li>
            <li>Came with no directions on how long to put into hot water!</li>
            <li>Without the customizing, this is the exact same procedure as you would use with a bleaching kit that comes with boil and bite trays.</li>
            <li>The trouble is, if you are not use to processing them for any reason, it is too easy to goof them up.</li>
            <li>in the hot water too long because the plastic becomes extremely soft!</li>
            <li>The tray being clear, you can see your gum line and where there is excess tray.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another note is that they appear clear, but cloudy in the photo.</li>
            <li>These are very bulky and I really only got an impression of the surfaces of the molars and not the front surfaces of my teeth.</li>
            <li>If I leave it on for longer than the recommended fifteen minutes, my teeth are sensitive.</li>
            <li>I had to do the top in 2 tries being very careful to not over heat the tray each time.</li>
            <li>I gave the product 2 stars instead of 1 because I have a small mouth and it might work better for larger mouths.</li>
            <li>I messed up 2 and am wearing the other 2 right now.    </li>
            <li>But I started out with a short dip and was able to do it several times, each time a little longer</li>
            <li>I boiled the water in my electric kettle until it came to a full boil then poured into a small Pyrex bowl, just big enough and deep enough to cover the tray and dunked the tray in right away.</li>
            <li>HARD to fit ...</li>
            <li>Saw whiter teeth within first few days, still using.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t form nearly as well as the ones the dentist uses, so you end up using lots more bleaching compound than the expensive ones you get at the dentist, but overall the cost is still lower, unless you&#x27;re bleaching all the time.</li>
            <li>not so good which then made it very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The boil and bite didn&#x27;t work for me, I tried with both sets following all directions-- not a good fit for me.</li>

            <li> The boil and bite didn&#x27;t work for me, I tried with both sets following all directions-- not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> Once I got my teeth properly in the tray, I bit down pretty hard, sucked out all the air and excess water that I could and used my fingers to mold the tray to my teeth.     </li>
            <li> Even with the extra fine tuning I did, this isn&#x27;t that difficult; it just takes a little patience and concentration.</li>
            <li> They come unwrapped, loose in a plastic bubble bag.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had was with biting down and sucking out the air correctly.</li>
            <li> ) Cut down to size prior to fitting&lt;br</li>
            <li> All these are is your typical self boil mouth guards, same ones you would use for football or hockey.</li>
            <li> Hard to mold directly to your teeth, a bit oversized for an average female</li>
            <li> Who needs a custom tray for $200 dollars from a dentist office, when these little gems will achieve the same results at a rock bottom price!</li>
            <li> After cutting, boiling and trying to fit these things to my teeth....</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected and will buy again</li>
            <li> Also it should be noted that my postman brought be a bill for covering the shipping charge that shit seller didn&#x27;t cover.......I will not be buying products from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> A total waste of my money and time</li>
            <li> but I had a difficult time getting these heated to the just right temperature.</li>
            <li> way nicer than the ones i got in this other kit i bought.  </li>

            <li> You need to work fast as soon as you get the tray in the hot water; make sure you don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;leave in the hot water too long because the plastic becomes extremely soft!</li>
            <li> I just got them today so i hope they work great with the gel and do the job and bleach my teeth white</li>
            <li> These arrived with no instructions as indicated in the product description. By reading a few other reviews I derived what to do. The trays that came with my bleaching gel were much thinner, easier to mold and more comfortable; unfortunately I misplaced them. These are very bulky and I really only got an impression of the surfaces of the molars and not the front surfaces of my teeth. I would try a different product.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!!  Trays did not mold!!!!!!!  The only impression that could be made looked mile a grain of rice!  WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just got my order of 2 sets in the mail. No instructions, no packaging, just 4 trays shoved in a yellow padded envelope without an invoice or anything. I assume I can figure out the boil and bite process for molding these to my teeth but are instructions really too much to ask? Really? Tacky business.</li>
            <li> I agree with Pamela; extremely frustrating to find four molds stuffed in an envelope without instructions...come on....so with a little searching...here is a fairly good set of instructions..    [...]</li>
            <li> i do not like this at all im not a football player i just want a mouth piece not a hard mouth gaurd.&#x60;!!</li>
            <li> id highly recommend these trays. way nicer than the ones i got in this other kit i bought.  the trays i got from my other kit folded over and were ruined&lt;br /&gt;when i dipped them in water. these ones came out way nicer and fit really snugly. now i can enjoy my pearly whites.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was going to be awful, but once I molded it to my mouth, it works awesome. I use it for whitening my teeth and I haven;t had any problems with it. I give it 4/5 stars because it came with no instructions</li>
            <li> A picture is worth a thousand words. The only words I needed were, well made. These are not the little flimsy trays. They are great.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Thanks</li>
            <li> I could not get these trays to mold to my teeth because they were just way too big. I gave the product 2 stars instead of 1 because I have a small mouth and it might work better for larger mouths.</li>
            <li> This product advertises \\&quot;2 sets\\&quot; of these trays (as shown and described), but each time I got three trays, not the four that were promised.  They come unwrapped, loose in a plastic bubble bag.  No instructions were included as promised but were later emailed when I requested them.  Although they sent another set when I told them I only got three, not the four that should have been included, none were useable at all.  They are a dental device, going in your mouth!  And if you follow the instructions, the water they are being put in is not &#x27;boiling water&#x27; but boiled water that&#x27;s been put in a cup and somewhat cooled down, so regardless of how many people have handled these unprotected trays, they will not be clean or sterile before going in your mouth.  They are also very thick, so for using whitening gel, it would be very uncomfortable.  I wouldn&#x27;t put these in my mouth the way they were packaged and could not recommend these to anyone.  It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. First of all, when I opened the box, they were not wrapped in anything. Very unprofessional and unsanitary. After cutting, boiling and trying to fit these things to my teeth.... no luck! You&#x27;re better off looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> these are easy to mould, but are very bulky</li>
            <li> These are nice trays. The trouble is, if you are not use to processing them for any reason, it is too easy to goof them up. I would order a practice set and a set that you will use. We were very careful but all the plastic has to do is slightly fold over on itself when hot/warm and it is ruined! However, when they are done well, they are very nice! Alot less expensive than a dentist!!!</li>
            <li> Yes this is basically the same mouthguard you wear for sports, but it works fine for bleaching. I have an upper guard I had made by the dentist and decided to bleach my bottom teeth as well so I bought these. Of course these do not work as well as the ones made by the dentist, but if you pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing these work fine, and you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> These were an excellent inexpensive replacement for the expensive Dentist supplied trays that I lost. Easy to use and even remold without any real problems. Allows you to make your own molds and then buy your own whitening agent. Dentist charged almost 500. and this total cost, with the whitening cost about 50.00.&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the directions,</li>
            <li> Not so good, at least for me.  They are ill fitting, and uncomfortable and I was not able to get them to mold at all.  They are better than nothing, I suppose, but there are better products out there for this purpose.</li>
            <li> easy to use and an extra set just in case. great deal, great product and I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Works great, but if you are like me there may be a learning curve on getting it perfect, and as cheap as these are buy extras. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected and will buy again</li>
            <li> These have worked great for me!  Didn&#x27;t have any problem setting the 1st pair and still have the 2nd ones un-used!</li>
            <li> I had almost no problems getting these trays to work. And the problems I did have were user error, not product problems.    I did have to leave them in the hot water* a lot longer than the 2 -3 seconds the directions stated. The only problem I had was with biting down and sucking out the air correctly. Thankfully there are 4 trays. I messed up 2 and am wearing the other 2 right now.    I had to do the top in 2 tries being very careful to not over heat the tray each time. You can tell when it softens up and is ready to mold. Once I got my teeth properly in the tray, I bit down pretty hard, sucked out all the air and excess water that I could and used my fingers to mold the tray to my teeth.     The first top tray impression was pretty good but after reheating it and finessing the fit a bit more, it was a fantastic. I could see the impression of my teeth so good that I was able to trim away the excess with my Tonic scissors. I also checked my trimming in a small mirror. The tray being clear, you can see your gum line and where there is excess tray.     The bottom tray was a little more problematic. Some of my bottom teeth are very crooked and it was hard to get them into the tray and then I had to draw trim lines on it (used an ink pen, yeah, yucky so sue me but it worked) to trim them down. But I didn&#x27;t have to heat up twice because the first impression was pretty darned good.    I probably will go back and do a little more fine tuning on my trimming with a jewelry file.     Even with the extra fine tuning I did, this isn&#x27;t that difficult; it just takes a little patience and concentration. Without the customizing, this is the exact same procedure as you would use with a bleaching kit that comes with boil and bite trays. Also, this is only the third time that I have ever done this, and the first where I actually went back and trimmed the excess to get more of a custom dental tray fit. So for the money I paid for these (1.99 + 4.5 S/H), I am extremely pleased.    *I boiled the water in my electric kettle until it came to a full boil then poured into a small Pyrex bowl, just big enough and deep enough to cover the tray and dunked the tray in right away. Once I was happy with the impression, I put the tray in ice water for awhile to set it.)</li>
            <li> Awful.. Uncomfortable.. Horrible</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, I used the no boil no bite trays, they work just fine.  Saw whiter teeth within first few days, still using.  If I leave it on for longer than the recommended fifteen minutes, my teeth are sensitive. Easy to use, and it works.</li>
            <li> These work great for me! I didn&#x27;t boil them too long and had to trim them down a little as my mouth is kinda small. But once I got them to fit properly, they have been perfect!</li>
            <li> They molded somewhat but didn&#x27;t really give much definition to my teeth for bleaching. It was cheap. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> easy to use, works well</li>
            <li> Hard to mold directly to your teeth, a bit oversized for an average female</li>
            <li> It could be me but I had a difficult time getting these heated to the just right temperature.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit your mouth well enough to be effective</li>
            <li> The plastic is to thick and cannot form to my teeth</li>
            <li> The trays are just as described on the website.</li>
            <li> All these are is your typical self boil mouth guards, same ones you would use for football or hockey. They don&#x27;t really work for teeth whiting. Also it should be noted that my postman brought be a bill for covering the shipping charge that shit seller didn&#x27;t cover.......I will not be buying products from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> Instructions that came with it say to dip in boiling water for 3 seconds.  That wasn&#x27;t enough time for me, I had to dip it for ~10 seconds (water had just come off a boil so was still close to 212F).  But I started out with a short dip and was able to do it several times, each time a little longer and it worked fine.  Maybe that&#x27;s why the product title says \\&quot;All New and Improved...\\&quot; since I didn&#x27;t have the problems others did.</li>
            <li> These people do not know how to ship things.  I had to go to the post office and pay for extra postage.  Poor customer service.</li>
            <li> i wished they worked slightly a little better and fit more for the lowers but i will still try to work with them.</li>
            <li> I received the 4 bleaching trays, yes---  but no instructions were included in the generic no-label packaging!  Guess I&#x27;ll just have to figure out how to use them on my own....</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Does not confirm to teeth at all, not worth the hassle of ordering and waiting to still have to shop for a suitable item. Also, item comes without any packaging... trays are stuffed into a shipping envelope with a flyer and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> The boil and bite didn&#x27;t work for me, I tried with both sets following all directions-- not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> These work well, are easy peasy to mold and have lasted, so far, through several whitening sessions.  Cheap and effective, nice.</li>
            <li> Personally I would just go to the dentist if you want to whiten your teeth. I bought these for my girlfriend and it is just crap. Came with no directions on how long to put into hot water! Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product!</li>
            <li> These are bigger than most peoples mouth. Very uncomfortable and have to be trimmed and softened in boiling hot water per instructions. Worst I have ever used. In fact couldn&#x27;t use them at all and tossed them in the trash. A total waste of my money and time&lt;br /&gt;Very frustrating. Would not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> The biting and chewing side of the teeth mould well, but the front surface of the teeth made no impression in the mold at all. No use to me and I had to purchase an alternative solution.</li>
            <li> These are basic teeth whitening trays that can be boiled and then molded to your teeth for better whitening gel contact to the teeth.  Works as described in the brochure.</li>
            <li> Received the product in the mail but no instructions &#x3D; unhappy customer. I am now searching the web for instructions.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  Your better off buying from Colgate at your local retail store.  Followed the directions exactly and the fit was ...not even close !</li>
            <li> They did not mold well, and one would be better off just going to the dentist or buying crest white strips</li>
            <li> At the cost of having a dentist do your molds for you this product works great and for a LOT less then the professionals.</li>
            <li> They worked perfectly for what I was looking for.  Follow the directions, and they will do the job! Happy I bought these.</li>
            <li> Who needs a custom tray for $200 dollars from a dentist office, when these little gems will achieve the same results at a rock bottom price!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to mould these trays. Top worked great...bottom not so good which then made it very uncomfortable to use. Would not order these trays from anyone again.</li>
            <li> Easy to mold work after the first try</li>
            <li> Next to the shutter shades i purchased from amazon this is the next WORSE thing i chose bad judgement on my part. My advice DO NOT invest.. If your interested in a bleaching tray best option is to received a custom one from your orthodontist because these trays melted on me INSTANTLY..</li>
            <li> Tried all different types of trays for teeth whitening, and always come back to the simple boil and bite. The self forming trays that are marketed for teeth whitening (the gel-like ones) just to not hold the gel to the teeth, causing it to seep and burn gums and throat. As long as you can get these fitted just right, they do the trick, and are fairly comfortable. You get a couple of extras, so that you can practice the fitting process if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first experience with boil and bit trays, a couple of hints when fitting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not submerge in boiling water. This will warp the tray. I use the following method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Cut down to size prior to fitting&lt;br /&gt;2) Boil water&lt;br /&gt;3) remove water from heat and lets sit for 1-2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;4) submerge plate for 5-7 seconds&lt;br /&gt;5) remove from water and insert into mouth while sucking and pushing the plate against your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;6) after 5-10 seconds, remove from mouth, and using the same water, repeat steps 4-6 until plate is formed to your liking. The plate should not be able to shift in your mouth using your fingers when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note is that they appear clear, but cloudy in the photo. Once you place in hot water and fit them, they become clear. If you are using a UV light in conjunction with gel, this matters. This was one of the concerns I had with this product, but the cloudiness went away once boiled and fitted.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use the cream did not bring me to apply</li>
            <li> Hard to use, you have to do 2 much, thats why they were so cheap, go to the dentist, way better..!</li>
            <li> These retainers are thick and hard to mold in hot water; they do not fit well</li>
            <li> HARD to fit ... ALLOT of plastic</li>
            <li> this product is working very well, I&#x27;m happy with it, I&#x27;m just still in the process using it, so I&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Lousy.  These are not good at all.</li>
            <li> Woorks ok for the price. They don&#x27;t form nearly as well as the ones the dentist uses, so you end up using lots more bleaching compound than the expensive ones you get at the dentist, but overall the cost is still lower, unless you&#x27;re bleaching all the time.</li>
            <li> Everything is fine. Trays&#x27;re a bit tricky to use. Followed the instructions from other customers&#x27; reviews! Do the same :)</li>
