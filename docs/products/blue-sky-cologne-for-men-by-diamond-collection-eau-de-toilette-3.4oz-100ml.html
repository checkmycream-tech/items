            <li>A nice value.</li>
            <li>Nice bottle and box.</li>
            <li>It may not be as strong, but frankly, I don&#x27;t want to smell like I bathed in it!  </li>
            <li>This cologne was a huge hit smells amazing got this for my dad for Christmas</li>
            <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t ware off like many &amp;#34;our version&amp;#34; types</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>The Blue Sky is a perfect alternative for a change, however.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very pleasant and lasting.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly and was a nice size.</li>
            <li>It would be my favorite if not for the original Dolce &amp; Gambanna  fragrance which is my preference.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, one of the best $10 purchases I&#x27;ve EVER made.</li>
            <li>Almost like the original.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend not only for the great price</li>
            <li>If you like smell Great for a few minutes this product is for you.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Smells very good and it last a long time!!!!</li>
            <li>has kind of a bitter scent after its on for a while</li>
            <li>When I first got a chance to see how this smells</li>
            <li>Smells like Dove soap when first applied and doesn&#x27;t really have the same smell as the original Light Blue.</li>
            <li>The fragrance matches the real thing very well.</li>
            <li>Smells like the real thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably no longer going to purchase the real product anymore.</li>
            <li>As prices of necessary items (food, gas, utilities, etc.) continue to rise, my LOVE for designer fragrances has had to take a back seat.</li>
            <li>the cologne isn&#x27;t as strong of a scent so plus it doesn&#x27;t last long when applied.</li>
            <li>Sorry my review turned into a story, but I didn&#x27;t know how else to describe how pleasantly surpised I was with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Smells ok, doesn&#x27;t last long enough, but it is what it is.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers said, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long, only an hour or two at most.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not bad bad, but nothing to be excited about.</li>

            <li> Hands down, one of the best $10 purchases I&#x27;ve EVER made. As prices of necessary items (food, gas, utilities, etc.) continue to rise, my LOVE for designer fragrances has had to take a back seat. This version of one of my favorites is wonderful. I was introduced to the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; version of this fragrance when my wife gave it to me as a birthday gift a few years ago. She loves the scent as well.  I wore this on our weekly &amp;#34;dinner date&amp;#34;. She recognzed it, not knowing it wasn&#x27;t the name brand version. When I told her, she was equally impressed. Sorry my review turned into a story, but I didn&#x27;t know how else to describe how pleasantly surpised I was with the quality of this product. Hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> A nice value. It came quickly and was a nice size. Scent doesn&#x27;t ware off like many &amp;#34;our version&amp;#34; types</li>
            <li> has kind of a bitter scent after its on for a while</li>
            <li> i was going to buy the name brand version and then was suggested this cheaper item. LOVE it. smells the same at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price or the quality.  The fragrance is very pleasant and lasting.  It would be my favorite if not for the original Dolce &amp; Gambanna  fragrance which is my preference.  The Blue Sky is a perfect alternative for a change, however.</li>
            <li> The fragrance matches the real thing very well. If it lasted longer on the skin, it would be perfect. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Very good price, smell great But only for 10 minutes  I will  not recommend. If you like smell Great for a few minutes this product is for you.</li>
            <li> the cologne isn&#x27;t as strong of a scent so plus it doesn&#x27;t last long when applied. But I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very nice version. Absolutely worth the money. Smells like the real thing. I would recommend this anytime. Nice bottle and box.</li>
            <li> When I first got a chance to see how this smells I was amazed.  I&#x27;m probably no longer going to purchase the real product anymore.</li>
            <li> Smells ok, doesn&#x27;t last long enough, but it is what it is.  Almost like the original.</li>
            <li> Smells very good and it last a long time!!!! Lingers on your clothing for days!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I found it to be very successful!  It may not be as strong, but frankly, I don&#x27;t want to smell like I bathed in it!  Smells great and I&#x27;ll make further purchases!</li>
            <li> This cologne was a huge hit smells amazing got this for my dad for Christmas and everybody is looking to order it already. I highly recommend not only for the great price (reason why I got it instead of wasting on the designer name) but the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed this item smelt nothing like the name brand and literally lasted nothing more than about a min</li>
            <li> bought it for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday and  he said it smelled like crap, i will never buy again, i guess u f&#x3D;get what u pay for, crap</li>
            <li> Great price and prompt service</li>
            <li> Smells like Dove soap when first applied and doesn&#x27;t really have the same smell as the original Light Blue. It&#x27;s really not bad bad, but nothing to be excited about. Like other reviewers said, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long, only an hour or two at most. I would go for another &#x27;off-brand&#x27; cologne.</li>
