            <li>Feeling sooo much better!!  </li>
            <li>A good friend of mine who is from England recommended this product.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for every day use &amp; gargling when you have a sore throat - good price - would buy again :)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>it&#x60;s really nice to have it always.all my families using it too.</li>
            <li>Taste doesn&#x27;t bother me, kind of like it.</li>
            <li>It works fairly well on most scrapes, cuts and bumps.</li>
            <li>A great disinfectant, surprisingly effective on blemishes and an absolute sore throat miracle!</li>
            <li>more tip:</li>
            <li>Using a moisturizer after TCP in the morning will get rid of most of the antiseptic smell, so don&#x27;t worry about stinking up your office or classroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and w/a tail wind, I was still able to smell this vile concoction.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This U.K. product is simply the best.</li>
            <li>but works like magic.</li>
            <li>TCP cures most infections, bites and bumps.  </li>
            <li>TCP works well for sore areas in the mouth, I use a diluted solution as a mouthwash, it does have a potent smell so if you are adverse to that, you may not like it.</li>
            <li>I have avoided flu for many years just using TCP.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this in England all my life and am so happy I can now buy it in Canada, and for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Much better than peroxide.</li>
            <li>Simply the best multi-purpose antiseptic ever !</li>
            <li>You know you&#x27;ll get better with TCP on it.</li>
            <li>I Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Nothing better on the market.</li>
            <li>Good product and extremely fast dispatch on purchase.</li>
            <li>Cleared up the problem with just a couple of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Strong taste and smell, but easily tolerated.</li>
            <li>I grew up using this and though it smells strong, it works so well.</li>
            <li>Strong medicinal smell.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t an equivalent of this here in the USA, which is a real pity as it&#x27;s the best thing for sore throats</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for my face.</li>
            <li>superb UK product, not available here in the USA?</li>
            <li>Great antiseptic for multiple uses.</li>
            <li>But it smells clean, just like any antiseptic should, so it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She said her mom used it on the whole family and they were healthy and germ free because of this product.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly but one bottle leaked.</li>
            <li>my order arrived quickly, well packaged and intact.  </li>
            <li>I missed it and luckily found it on amazon.</li>
            <li>My family is from the island of Jamaica, and it just so happened that my mom had to fly down there because of a family emergency.</li>
            <li>I just opened the cap and this product is so strong we were able to smell it several rooms away.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed when trying TCP for the first time was it strong odor.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s seriously worth</li>
            <li>From the UK, HTF, Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>I ended up with a really dark mark on my cheek because I got too happy with my results and started using too much.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product only wish it was available in North America.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for selling it.</li>
            <li>The product is good for mouthwashes, cuts and scrapes and other purposes, and its a relief that I no longer have to worry about running out of it, thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li>, if you are struggling with pimples or acne, you should absolutely give TCP a try!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>After first apply it is making the pain go away because of numbing chemical in it.</li>
            <li>I will buy more than one next time, so i am never without.</li>
            <li>Although the price was almost $3 more than the last time I purchased it about 6 months ago.</li>
            <li>This stuff could wake the dead its so good.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised how quickly the shipment arrived at my home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After cleansing, I soak a cotton pad with TCP and gently tone my face with it, morning and evening.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work miraculously, but it&#x27;s dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>Now if I could only find some cheap oxo&#x27;s in California.</li>
            <li>I take VERY dilute TCP dip</li>
            <li>I have even diluted it with water to use as a gargle for sore throats, works very well.</li>
            <li>I have been using this antiseptic since I was a child and had to stock up on it when I went to England, however, thanks to Amazon, I can buy it here.  </li>
            <li>and it works really well on itchy insect bites.</li>
            <li>If you want to gargle or stave off an ear infection (by putting a little on a cotton swab), you must use a diluted form, as the product is very strong.  </li>
            <li>Not available in Canada ,a UK store has them ,but only 50ml size and cost too much,found this to be a more cost effective way of obtaining this product ,would give 5 stars if they had the maximum 400ml size ,of which I was looking for,shipped on time in pristine condition,will repeat this order next time also.</li>
            <li>product previously used, handy antiseptic that doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate the skin, can be used directly from the bottle (undiluted).</li>
            <li>at the first onset dilute a small amount and gargle with it, also put it all around the nostrils and it works like magic.  </li>
            <li>Promotes quick healing and suppresses bee and aunt stings instantly.</li>
            <li>Who knows if this cauldron of malodorous liquid  was exposed to high heat or not.</li>
            <li>I grew up with this Antiseptic and now 71 years later I am still using this even though I now live in the USA after moving from the UK, it is worth the price for it to be sent from the UK.</li>
            <li>because no matter how clean these nail salons are you cannot be too careful.</li>
            <li>and my face is 99% clear!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and can be used on zits, etc., and as a general disinfectant.  </li>
            <li>AN ANTISEPTIC.I WILL CONTINUE TO USE SAME AS LONG AS IT IS AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I was in grade school.</li>
            <li>I had acne since I was 9 years old</li>
            <li>Used this in the UK when I was a young lad in the 1950&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for an 80 year old client of mine that is from England.  </li>
            <li>And if some enterprising pharmacist wants to make generic version...</li>
            <li>You can use it directly on an infected pimple or cut.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast the healing became after only two days of using it.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY antiseptic liquid to really work.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a product I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>Great for pimples, rashes, spots, cuts, bleeding gums, sore throats and even painful boils.</li>
            <li>I recommend you stay clear of this item at all costs, especially if you will receive from across the pond.</li>
            <li>( I believe it was a French product, but readily available in the UK), which is where it came from when I bought one of each from Amazon a few years back).</li>
            <li>Apparently (I have never used it)</li>
            <li>I buy one every few months as a mouth wash and find it useful for children on cuts and bruises</li>
            <li>It was off the market for several years but - presumably due to much begging noise from consumers like me - is now back by Glaxo Smith Kline.</li>
            <li>This item was placed in a general mailbox where the Post Office leaves the key in your personal mailbox.</li>
            <li>high before they went down from using the TCP.  </li>

            <li> high before they went down from using the TCP.  </li>
            <li> I use this a lot for minor cuts and bruises, helps the wound heal quicker .</li>
            <li> I have had problems with a goat of mine having hoof rot for a long time, over a year.</li>
            <li> Another definitive is north American  OREGANOL- put in empty capsules to swallow, a cure all!</li>
            <li> only down side to the product is the smell  and the burning sensation; my eyes always water.</li>
            <li> Now my trips and very limited</li>
            <li> My parents would buy loads of it on our trips to Ireland, then bring those little brown bottles back to the States to share with everyone.</li>
            <li> I still have a few bumps on my forehead, but they are tiny</li>
            <li> and I know they will be subsiding in the next few days.</li>
            <li> I took the boots off a few days later and what a difference it made!!!</li>
            <li> Read all if the other recommendations.</li>
            <li> I was almost to the point of condering having to put her down.</li>
            <li> I jus got back from Jamaica a week ago and seriously stocked up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I placed an order in about a week and half ago and my delivery dates were to be in a month.</li>

            <li> I just opened the cap and this product is so strong we were able to smell it several rooms away. I haven&#x27;t had a reason to use it yet but I&#x27;ll bet it works great.</li>
            <li> Even my husband who thought I was crazy for reaching for TCP for everything is converted.  Sore throat (gargle), skin break outs, insect bites, skin irritations you name it... bring out the TCP!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Good product and extremely fast dispatch on purchase. I buy one every few months as a mouth wash and find it useful for children on cuts and bruises</li>
            <li> My family is from the island of Jamaica, and it just so happened that my mom had to fly down there because of a family emergency. My acne came up in a conversation and my aunt sent this product up with my mom. To my surprise it actually worked! I had acne since I was 9 years old (I&#x27;m 19 now)and I don&#x27;t have not 1 bump or crater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to the product is the smell  and the burning sensation; my eyes always water. In addition to that, if you have oily skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this during the day because you&#x27;ll look like a grease ball. Overall, this is a product I can&#x27;t live without! I jus got back from Jamaica a week ago and seriously stocked up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more tip: Don&#x27;t use too much! I ended up with a really dark mark on my cheek because I got too happy with my results and started using too much. (The mark went away w/in a few weeks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Guys it&#x27;s seriously worth a try ***</li>
            <li> I struggled with breakouts ever since I was in college. I tried everything...and I mean everything to try and stop them but I could never find a product or combination of products to stop my pimples. That is until I found TCP by accident!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read somewhere online about TCP and how it zaps pimples almost overnight...I had to try it. I was a little concerned since I am in America and it only ships from overseas, but I was desperate so I ordered it. I was quite surprised how quickly the shipment arrived at my home. It was a matter of 5-7 business days. Impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when trying TCP for the first time was it strong odor. But it smells clean, just like any antiseptic should, so it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing, I soak a cotton pad with TCP and gently tone my face with it, morning and evening. Using a moisturizer after TCP in the morning will get rid of most of the antiseptic smell, so don&#x27;t worry about stinking up your office or classroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night, after cleansing, I tone my face again with TCP and do not put any moisturizer on after. I think this lets my face breathe while it heals itself overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days after using this product and my face is 99% clear! I still have a few bumps on my forehead, but they are tiny and I know they will be subsiding in the next few days. My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I was in grade school. Simply incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are struggling with pimples or acne, you should absolutely give TCP a try! Not only does it work miraculously, but it&#x27;s dirt cheap. What do you have to lose?</li>
            <li> Husband swears by it. ;)</li>
            <li> Being a Brit in the states, I found it annoying that they don&#x27;t sell this stuff. So I bought some TCP online, it arrived, and it was TCP.</li>
            <li> You know the dad with the windex in My Big Fat Greek Wedding? That&#x27;s how I feel about TCP. A great disinfectant, surprisingly effective on blemishes and an absolute sore throat miracle! I  always have some around.</li>
            <li> This item arrived leaking. This item was placed in a general mailbox where the Post Office leaves the key in your personal mailbox. About 20 yards away and w/a tail wind, I was still able to smell this vile concoction. When I brought this into my home, I thought that after I washed it, the smell would abate. No such luck. It seemed to get worse. I threw it out later that evening. Unfortunately, I forgot to take out the garbage and this smell invaded every nook and cranny of my home during the day. Who knows if this cauldron of malodorous liquid  was exposed to high heat or not. I recommend you stay clear of this item at all costs, especially if you will receive from across the pond.</li>
            <li> Used this in the UK when I was a young lad in the 1950&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s gentle and can be used on zits, etc., and as a general disinfectant.  It also comes as ointment in a tube.  ( I believe it was a French product, but readily available in the UK), which is where it came from when I bought one of each from Amazon a few years back).</li>
            <li> Has a very strong smell but is excellent for pimples, bites, and cleaning of wounds. I use it primarily for my face. I wish I could show before and after pictures. Love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff - never thought I could get here in the US. (Shipped from UK) Used it when in England recently when having sore gum issues. Cleared up the problem with just a couple of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Strong taste and smell, but easily tolerated.</li>
            <li> This U.K. product is simply the best. External cuts &amp; scrapes - dab it on with some cotton wool. Mouth ulcers, sore throats - simply gargle (but DO NOT SWALLOW). It smells and tastes horrible and stings like heck - but works like magic. Would DEFINITELY recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for every day use &amp; gargling when you have a sore throat - good price - would buy again :)</li>
            <li> I was raised in the U.K. and all my life my Mother used tcp for everything from cuts and sore throats and sore gums. Once prevented me from have stiches in my lip a dose of tcp on the cut and walla it was healed the next day. This was back in 50s. Now I have been living in the U.S. and always brought back some tcp and Savlon cream with me. Now my trips and very limited so I am running out. Can&#x27;t wait to order some. Jem</li>
            <li> Not available in Canada ,a UK store has them ,but only 50ml size and cost too much,found this to be a more cost effective way of obtaining this product ,would give 5 stars if they had the maximum 400ml size ,of which I was looking for,shipped on time in pristine condition,will repeat this order next time also.</li>
            <li> A client of mine from Ghana saw my face covered with acne told me about this product and gave me some of the little bit she had. And I was seeing results in 2 days of using it. So I placed an order in about a week and half ago and my delivery dates were to be in a month. But toy suprised Thursday evening there was a box at my door and it was my orders. I was shocked at how quickly I got it. Thanks for your fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> TCP cures most infections, bites and bumps.  I count on it all the time. It is one of the best antiseptics on the market.</li>
            <li> I found this,...finally! I grew up using this and though it smells strong, it works so well. Do use sparingly or you&#x27;d smell like a hospital in the olden times!</li>
            <li> superb UK product, not available here in the USA?</li>
            <li> TCP works well for sore areas in the mouth, I use a diluted solution as a mouthwash, it does have a potent smell so if you are adverse to that, you may not like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for an 80 year old client of mine that is from England.  She swears by the stuff and shares it with neighbors that rave about it.  Apparently (I have never used it) it is impossible to find in the US, but these people think this is well worth the time and expense to get it in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Sent as described. Happy with product.</li>
            <li> I grew up with this Antiseptic and now 71 years later I am still using this even though I now live in the USA after moving from the UK, it is worth the price for it to be sent from the UK. Now if I could only find some cheap oxo&#x27;s in California.</li>
            <li> I have been using TCP since my mother treated us for all types of ailments or sores. I have avoided flu for many years just using TCP. I take VERY dilute TCP dip a cotton wool bud and sniff up my nose - spit out the phlegm and then gargle with dilute TCP to ward off colds and flu. I bought 3 extra bottles for family and friends.</li>
            <li> I use this a lot for minor cuts and bruises, helps the wound heal quicker . I have even diluted it with water to use as a gargle for sore throats, works very well. I always keep a bottle or two around for those little emergencies...</li>
            <li> arrived quickly but one bottle leaked.</li>
            <li> A good friend of mine who is from England recommended this product. She said her mom used it on the whole family and they were healthy and germ free because of this product. so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like horse liniment to me and the smell won&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a small amount on a scalp cut two days ago and can still smell it after washing my hair three times and showering twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I think it may have embedded itself in my nasal membranes, so I&#x27;m heading out the door to get some nasal saline spray in the hope that I can eventually wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this in England all my life and am so happy I can now buy it in Canada, and for a reasonable price.  I have introduced all my friends to this product as a means of preventing a cold - at the first onset dilute a small amount and gargle with it, also put it all around the nostrils and it works like magic.  It is also an excellent antiseptic for cuts and grazes.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon service was excellent.  I no longer have to bring back bottles for everyone as they can buy it through Amazon.  Betty Vowles</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT ALL MY LIFE AS AN ANTISEPTIC.I WILL CONTINUE TO USE SAME AS LONG AS IT IS AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with a goat of mine having hoof rot for a long time, over a year. I tried everything to get rid of if, but nothing worked. I was almost to the point of condering having to put her down. My last effort was TCP. I put some on a paper towel, put a plastic sandwich bag over it, and them wrapped it in vet wrap, essentially making a boot for each of her front hooves. I took the boots off a few days later and what a difference it made!!! She is walking again. Feeling sooo much better!!  This literally saved her life!!!</li>
            <li> It is an awesome product for pimples and scratches. That is why I like it.  Thank you very much for selling it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this antiseptic since I was a child and had to stock up on it when I went to England, however, thanks to Amazon, I can buy it here.  The product is good for mouthwashes, cuts and scrapes and other purposes, and its a relief that I no longer have to worry about running out of it, thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> my order arrived quickly, well packaged and intact.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great for everything from sore throat to pimples. I use it on my nails after a mani/pedi ! because no matter how clean these nail salons are you cannot be too careful.</li>
            <li> i&#x60;m always buying this product everytime i go to london,,and it&#x60;s really nice to have it always.all my families using it too.</li>
            <li> scrapes, Scratches, Itches, Wonferful product that stops infection been using since i was a kid.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the go-to medicine when me and my family start to get sick and it kicks it everytime</li>
            <li> product previously used, handy antiseptic that doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate the skin, can be used directly from the bottle (undiluted).</li>
            <li> I had an infected tooth which was really smelly and very painful. within a few minutes after placing T.C.P. on a piece of cotton wool and then onto the tooth, the pain and smell disappeared. I did still have the tooth though!!!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t an equivalent of this here in the USA, which is a real pity as it&#x27;s the best thing for sore throats and it works really well on itchy insect bites. Nail varnish on your chiggers? Use this instead. And if some enterprising pharmacist wants to make generic version...</li>
            <li> This is one of the great antiseptic for kids. After first apply it is making the pain go away because of numbing chemical in it.</li>
            <li> Having grown up with this product I learned to appreciate its antiseptic and healing properties while learning to tolerate the smell - which I now appreciate since olfactory masking agents are not present to interfere with efficacy. It was off the market for several years but - presumably due to much begging noise from consumers like me - is now back by Glaxo Smith Kline. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Best antiseptic. Promotes quick healing and suppresses bee and aunt stings instantly.</li>
            <li> Great product. Taste doesn&#x27;t bother me, kind of like it. Antiseptic taste. Cleans teeth and mouth. Does not burn. Needs to be diluted. Read all if the other recommendations. Doubles as a skin antiseptic. Great product. Gets rud if sore throats. I will buy more than one next time, so i am never without. Another definitive is north American  OREGANOL- put in empty capsules to swallow, a cure all!</li>
            <li> Best ointment for a sore throat! Grew up in the Uk and always used this when I moved to america I missed it and luckily found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I used this when I visited London a while back and have been trying to buy it ever since.  If you want to gargle or stave off an ear infection (by putting a little on a cotton swab), you must use a diluted form, as the product is very strong.  You can use it directly on an infected pimple or cut.  The smell is horrible and it lingers, but it is totally worth it.  This is an excellent antiseptic.  Much better than peroxide.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well on most scrapes, cuts and bumps. Although the price was almost $3 more than the last time I purchased it about 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> Have been using this since I was a child. My parents would buy loads of it on our trips to Ireland, then bring those little brown bottles back to the States to share with everyone. Simply the best multi-purpose antiseptic ever !</li>
            <li> I had severe burns on my knuckles.  Blisters were 1/4 in. high before they went down from using the TCP.  The burns were 4 weeks along before my friend gave me a sample of her TCP.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast the healing became after only two days of using it.  I didn&#x27;t think I would ever get my wedding ring off! I will be forever grateful to my friend.</li>
            <li> Great antiseptic for multiple uses. Strong medicinal smell. I always have it on hand. From the UK, HTF, Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The ONLY antiseptic liquid to really work. And the smell is glorious. You know you&#x27;ll get better with TCP on it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product only wish it was available in North America.</li>
            <li> This stuff could wake the dead its so good. I apply this to anything from using it as a mouth wash, to cut&#x27;s etc. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff. It was packed so well by the shipper it could have been used as a football and still be intact. Great value. This TCP will cure anything you have from spots, sore throat to athletes foot..</li>
            <li> Best antiseptic out there. Great for pimples, rashes, spots, cuts, bleeding gums, sore throats and even painful boils. Nothing better on the market.</li>
