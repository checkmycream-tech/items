            <li>This sponge lathers very nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is sponge is really nice!  </li>
            <li>As someone mentioned already - use deluded hydrogen peroxide to soak the sponge once in a while, about every month is perfect, to kill off the bacteria and make sure there&#x27;s no chance of mold.</li>
            <li>It feels great in the shower, builds up a good lather, and soaks up water.  </li>
            <li>Provides a good lather and seems to be fairly durable.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>At first I was very happy with this product, but after couple of baths it started falling apart until I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li>I love this sponge!</li>
            <li>But, with that said, this is an amazing sea sponge, and probably the softest thing you can find.</li>
            <li>Honestly, any buyer should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It does lather nicely and the longer you use it, the softer it gets (hence the two stars).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks nice too.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>Generates a really nice and luxurious lather&lt;</li>
            <li>it is the perfect size for use in the shower; it is soft and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend a good rinse after each use; and replacing it after 3 or 4 months.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that I got my moneys worth in this sponge!</li>
            <li>This is very good sponge, it is very soft but still does its job and also good size, fits nicely in hand.</li>
            <li>The sponge fits in my hand easily and does a good job.</li>
            <li>very nice and makes lots of suds, dries out quickly,</li>
            <li>natural sea wool is perfect and does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>These are soft, luxurious, the best I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>This sponge is soft and perfect.</li>
            <li>Best natural sponge I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>ITS QUALITY IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE SPONGES</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>, I really love it.</li>
            <li>I love to cover it with neutrogena soap and lather up each morning.</li>
            <li>Rather than being a sponge that I can hold my hand around, this is more of a \\&quot;finger</li>
            <li>I love this sponge.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the synthetic ones at \\&quot;walley world\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>These do not flake off, hold more water, and are softer.</li>
            <li>I love the way this sponge feels.</li>
            <li>that my hand and more like the gig plastic scrubs I was used too.  </li>
            <li>So this sponge was okay.</li>
            <li>I have been using bath sponges for many years.</li>
            <li>There are better sponges out there; spend your money elsewhere.     </li>
            <li>I bought 6 just to make sure I have some on hand.  </li>
            <li>This sponge is ideal for people with sensitive skin who don&#x27;t want the abrasive scratch of a synthetic body puff.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find a better value for a sea sponge anywhere</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>There were great reviews on this particular sponge</li>
            <li>I am happily purchasing another and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that I need to use more body wash than with a synthetic sponge because the suds fall off the sponge quite easily.</li>
            <li>It also dries really quickly, and this keeps it clean and in good</li>
            <li>Then I have to use a looflah to feel REALLY clean!</li>
            <li>Works great and is pretty mesmerizing to boot</li>
            <li>It was soft and wonderful to use for the first 5 baths, and then it literally fell apart in pieces.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and soft for no longer than 1 month max and than it just fall into pieces.</li>
            <li>Hi I bought these to try because I read a review in a magazines that these were a great natural sponge.  </li>
            <li>These natural sea sponge&#x27;s from Lather are great.</li>
            <li>We LOVE these real sponges!!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>IT RINSES OUT WELL AND IS ALWAYS EASY ON MY FACE.</li>
            <li>it easily slips out of my hand and there is no string to hang it from for storage or to wrap around my fingers when showering.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy to hold</li>
            <li>Durable quality and easy to maintain</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy to hold</li>
            <li>Durable quality and easy to maintain</li>
            <li>It feels great on my face and leaves it clean, oil free, and soft.</li>
            <li>It also lathers super well!</li>
            <li>GREAT SPOONGE AND LAST</li>
            <li>more thing worth noting - these sponges do require periodic maintenance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a pretty good deal - cheap and pretty durable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m choosy as anyone can be, and these are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I use it a few times a day to wash and rinse my face and it is perfect.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is soft and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Large, clean, nice.</li>
            <li>Very effective at overall cleaning</li>
            <li>Very effective at overall cleaning</li>
            <li>I purchased this sponge originally on 7/13/09</li>
            <li>I hope as I continue to order them the size will be more consistent.  </li>
            <li>It is quite sturdy and produces lots of great foamy lather with just a small amount of soap but is also very easy to rinse clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, and is perfect for dry, sensitive skin, as well as any other type of skin (though if you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliating product, this might not be a good choice for you).&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Some sponges are rough, or visually unseemly, this is good looking and gentle, and perfect for lathering yourself or someone else!</li>
            <li>I have had great sponges - especially when I bought large natural sponges on overseas trips - and I have had others that were just ok, which is what most of the online sponges have been.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural sea sponge I have owned in a long time.  </li>
            <li>The sponge is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Sponge is good holds up not like local ones in stores here.</li>
            <li>Any suggestions for a good, large, natural online sponge, regardless of price, would be most appreciated.</li>
            <li>Then two months later, it started falling apart more and more until I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li>It is fairly large(about the size of my hand), extremely soft, and it lathers up my body wash really well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super flexible.</li>
            <li>Trying to find good quality natural bath sponges is a real chore.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly with no residue</li>
            <li>Dries quickly with no residue</li>
            <li>This is actually pretty good for a natural sea sponge - most of them don&#x27;t last that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, keeps its shape and does not fall apart like some sea sponges costing a lot more money.  </li>
            <li>This was worth every penny</li>
            <li>This time I  received what I think should be used on a baby more than on an adult.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly soft and glides over your skin like silk with a nice gentle exfoliating property.</li>
            <li>Also the size is just right.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing, it&#x27;s about the size of a baseball, and EXTREMELY soft, exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used natural sea sponges in the past and I&#x27;m particularly impressed with the quality of this wool sponge from Lather.</li>
            <li>A kitchen sponge from the local super market is better than this item.</li>
            <li>I much prefer this as there is no smell, dries quickly, and has not fallen apart yet.</li>
            <li>This is a soft and absorbing sponge, so much better than synthetic sponge.  </li>
            <li>IT IS VERY SOFT AND SMOOTH ON MY SKIN - -</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY GENTLE ON MY FACE.</li>
            <li>Since they&#x27;ve lasted over a year, the purchase was reasonably good for the money spent and I will buy again not only for their lasting quality, but because they are really good shower sponges.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin,  other nylon loofas irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely, super soft natural sponge.</li>
            <li>I WILL DEFINITELY ORDER MORE WHEN I NEED THEM</li>
            <li>I have been an avid sponge user for years.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered these I bought 2</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li>how well it cleans and revitalizes skin until you start getting compliments from friends and family on how much better your overall complexion looks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but not fantastic.</li>
            <li>MORE Unidentified Scratches on my body, only soft and clean</li>
            <li>We bought this sponge for our newborn after reading the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t be for a long time because of the outstanding quality.</li>
            <li>Beginning to degrade more quickly than previously owned sponges.</li>
            <li>for a good, soft sponge to help me lather my body wash better; I&#x27;ve tried baby products, washcloths, I&#x27;ve tried all the things you could possibly try, and everything was too harsh or just did</li>
            <li>It is super soft.</li>
            <li>and it is SUPER soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Pretty large size (more than enough for any adult)&lt;br /&gt;- Soft texture</li>
            <li>A good sponge should hold lather, feel full and of course spongey, and it should last for several motnhs of daily use.</li>
            <li>I wish Lather would go back to their original version and be consistent about size and quality.  </li>
            <li>- - THANKS</li>
            <li>I expected a lot more out of it after reading the reviews, but really the sponge died fast.</li>
            <li>I am a frequent Amazon shopper, but I rarely leave reviews.</li>
            <li>Much, much softer than synthetic sponges I have used.  </li>
            <li>It has no problem absorbing and releasing water.  </li>
            <li>This one is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>like with most natural sponges there&#x27;s an initial break-in period.</li>
            <li>It gives the right scrub without being too soft or scratchy.</li>
            <li>and I will continue to order as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>THE LATHER NATURAL SEA WOOL SPONGE IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty soft and lathers well.</li>
            <li>It is a nice sponge, but it&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li>Each sponge has been clearly from another, as it is evident by the clean, flat shape on one side.  </li>
            <li>Nice..............a little too soft, but nice.</li>
            <li>finally banned those self-injurious colorful poofs of scratching nylon from the bathroom and replaced it with an all natural super soft sea sponge.</li>
            <li>However, it is much smaller than I would have liked and not really practical for bathing.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the fact that its an all natural alternative to those gross loofahs and washcloths.</li>
            <li>When I started ordering Lather sponges a few years ago, they were robust, long lasting, and very good quality.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft and lathers well!  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how large this sponge is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large, ultra soft, and has lasted months with no sign of falling apart.</li>
            <li>WAY TOO SOFT!!  </li>
            <li>She says it is superior to those plastic mesh things that she has been using but the sea sponge is not nearly firm enough or large enough (when wet) for this man.</li>
            <li>It is very porous and really soft so</li>
            <li>I will buy it again only because to me it was worth not having to worry about bacteria and also because it was so soft and gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>The 1st one broke apart after 6 - 7 months,but the 2nd is still going strong although reaching its inevitable death soon.</li>
            <li>Texture may be off-putting for people used to rough, mesh scrubbersPretty large size (more than enough for any adult)&lt;br /&gt;- Soft texture</li>
            <li>and I am just now ordering a new one.</li>
            <li>and i can say that it is time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>It also seems quite durable, since it is very tightly meshed (for lack of a more scientific word).</li>
            <li>However, be aware that there is significant size variation across sellers/orders - I have ordered two now, and the second was only half as large as the first (see photos).</li>
            <li>and I was very surprised at the quality, size and longevity of the sponge.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its very soft and durable.</li>
            <li>It is very soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really, really soft and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sponges, so far this one is my favuorite!</li>
            <li>It is soft!  </li>
            <li>It is a natural sea sponge after all!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a loofah consistency, but when wet it&#x27;s almost like a damp bunch of toilet paper in consistency</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how soft it is!  </li>
            <li>This sea sponge is a BIG (fills your hand) and is a super SOFT sea sponge with a hole in the middle where I pour my liquid body wash to lather and shower with daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first natural sea sponge, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to other than the synthetic types.  </li>
            <li>Smaller than expected and fell apart after 2 weeks of light use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh or scratch the skin.  </li>
            <li>Lately, it&#x27;s been more misses than hits.</li>
            <li>This is also not as soft as some of the sponges I have used.</li>
            <li>Soft sponge, holds up well.</li>
            <li>I have used natural sea sponges since I was 18</li>
            <li>A natural sea sponge is a bit of a luxury, but I figured birthday&#x27;s should be all about luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this sponge to bathe my 2 year old baby</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soft to be a manly shower scrubber.</li>
            <li>product is really, really soft, and works wonders with the lather.</li>
            <li>It feels natural and fits well in one hand.  </li>
            <li>The natural sea wool is luxuriously soft and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too soft for me.  </li>
            <li>I have sometimes been weary of purchasing sponges over the internet for fear that they aren&#x27;t natural.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s so soft that you probably won&#x27;t even realize</li>
            <li>The  sponge  is  soft  </li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed it tearing or crumbling.</li>
            <li>There is nothing, and I mean nothing, better than the softness of natural sea</li>
            <li>But as with any new experience, you&#x27;ll get it down to your own science after a few uses and will think nothing of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We gently squeezed the water out of it after each bath and carefully stored it in a special container (for $14, we were VERY careful with this sponge!).</li>
            <li>I got busy with a move a year ago and realized my current sponge was 18 months old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to using a mildly abrasive mesh shower puff, so this took a few days to get used to.</li>
            <li>It may be a plus for some folks, especially for the elderly or to use on very young children, but not for me.</li>
            <li>The rich lather that it creates from ANY soap or body wash is unbelievable.</li>
            <li>Most (and often times more expensive) natural sea sponge&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used in the past start to fall apart around the 2 week mark with regular use and reduced to shreds on my shower floor within a month.</li>
            <li>Other Sea sponges I have had in the past felt rougher on the skin and probably did a better job exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>small and gets soggy quickly</li>
            <li>It was tough when dry but when wet - it was soft and supple and wonderful for delicate cleaning of face &amp; body.</li>
            <li>Others seem to have complained so they may be more rough with their sponge.</li>
            <li>When its wet, it grows to a decent size</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that bad, and doesn&#x27;t matter too much, but would have been nice if it was a bit bigger, nothing</li>
            <li>It is barely the size of my (female) palm.</li>
            <li>The first sponge has lasted well over a year with only a little wear and tear..</li>
            <li>It seems a little more compact then others I have had in the past</li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin, and was on the lookout (for years!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some reviews that natural sponges don&#x27;t last all that long.</li>
            <li>With spag is shrinks into a small slimey thing that I can&#x27;t get my fingers around; it is a choice between holding it firmly and leaving no surface to wash with, or leaving a little bit of surface without having a good grip on the spong.</li>
            <li>It gets very soft and velvety when it is wet.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is sponge is really nice!  </li>
            <li> As someone mentioned already - use deluded hydrogen peroxide to soak the sponge once in a while, about every month is perfect, to kill off the bacteria and make sure there&#x27;s no chance of mold.</li>
            <li> It feels great in the shower, builds up a good lather, and soaks up water.  </li>
            <li> Provides a good lather and seems to be fairly durable.</li>

            <li> I love this sponge!</li>
            <li> But, with that said, this is an amazing sea sponge, and probably the softest thing you can find.</li>
            <li> Honestly, any buyer should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It does lather nicely and the longer you use it, the softer it gets (hence the two stars).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks nice too.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> Generates a really nice and luxurious lather&lt;</li>
            <li> it is the perfect size for use in the shower; it is soft and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend a good rinse after each use; and replacing it after 3 or 4 months.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that I got my moneys worth in this sponge!</li>
            <li> This is very good sponge, it is very soft but still does its job and also good size, fits nicely in hand.</li>
            <li> The sponge fits in my hand easily and does a good job.</li>
            <li> very nice and makes lots of suds, dries out quickly,</li>
            <li> natural sea wool is perfect and does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> These are soft, luxurious, the best I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> This sponge is soft and perfect.</li>
            <li> Best natural sponge I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> ITS QUALITY IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE SPONGES</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> , I really love it.</li>
            <li> I love to cover it with neutrogena soap and lather up each morning.</li>
            <li> Rather than being a sponge that I can hold my hand around, this is more of a \\&quot;finger</li>
            <li> I love this sponge.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the synthetic ones at \\&quot;walley world\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> These do not flake off, hold more water, and are softer.</li>
            <li> I love the way this sponge feels.</li>
            <li> that my hand and more like the gig plastic scrubs I was used too.  </li>
            <li> So this sponge was okay.</li>
            <li> I have been using bath sponges for many years.</li>
            <li> There are better sponges out there; spend your money elsewhere.     </li>
            <li> I bought 6 just to make sure I have some on hand.  </li>
            <li> This sponge is ideal for people with sensitive skin who don&#x27;t want the abrasive scratch of a synthetic body puff.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find a better value for a sea sponge anywhere</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> There were great reviews on this particular sponge</li>
            <li> I am happily purchasing another and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that I need to use more body wash than with a synthetic sponge because the suds fall off the sponge quite easily.</li>
            <li> It also dries really quickly, and this keeps it clean and in good</li>
            <li> Then I have to use a looflah to feel REALLY clean!</li>
            <li> Works great and is pretty mesmerizing to boot</li>
            <li> It was soft and wonderful to use for the first 5 baths, and then it literally fell apart in pieces.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and soft for no longer than 1 month max and than it just fall into pieces.</li>
            <li> Hi I bought these to try because I read a review in a magazines that these were a great natural sponge.  </li>
            <li> These natural sea sponge&#x27;s from Lather are great.</li>
            <li> We LOVE these real sponges!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> IT RINSES OUT WELL AND IS ALWAYS EASY ON MY FACE.</li>
            <li> it easily slips out of my hand and there is no string to hang it from for storage or to wrap around my fingers when showering.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s easy to hold</li>
            <li> Durable quality and easy to maintain</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s easy to hold</li>
            <li> Durable quality and easy to maintain</li>
            <li> It feels great on my face and leaves it clean, oil free, and soft.</li>
            <li> It also lathers super well!</li>
            <li> GREAT SPOONGE AND LAST</li>
            <li> more thing worth noting - these sponges do require periodic maintenance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a pretty good deal - cheap and pretty durable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m choosy as anyone can be, and these are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I use it a few times a day to wash and rinse my face and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is soft and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Large, clean, nice.</li>
            <li> Very effective at overall cleaning</li>
            <li> Very effective at overall cleaning</li>
            <li> I purchased this sponge originally on 7/13/09</li>
            <li> I hope as I continue to order them the size will be more consistent.  </li>
            <li> It is quite sturdy and produces lots of great foamy lather with just a small amount of soap but is also very easy to rinse clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, and is perfect for dry, sensitive skin, as well as any other type of skin (though if you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliating product, this might not be a good choice for you).&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Some sponges are rough, or visually unseemly, this is good looking and gentle, and perfect for lathering yourself or someone else!</li>
            <li> I have had great sponges - especially when I bought large natural sponges on overseas trips - and I have had others that were just ok, which is what most of the online sponges have been.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural sea sponge I have owned in a long time.  </li>
            <li> The sponge is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Sponge is good holds up not like local ones in stores here.</li>
            <li> Any suggestions for a good, large, natural online sponge, regardless of price, would be most appreciated.</li>
            <li> Then two months later, it started falling apart more and more until I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> It is fairly large(about the size of my hand), extremely soft, and it lathers up my body wash really well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super flexible.</li>
            <li> Trying to find good quality natural bath sponges is a real chore.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly with no residue</li>
            <li> Dries quickly with no residue</li>
            <li> This is actually pretty good for a natural sea sponge - most of them don&#x27;t last that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, keeps its shape and does not fall apart like some sea sponges costing a lot more money.  </li>
            <li> This was worth every penny</li>
            <li> This time I  received what I think should be used on a baby more than on an adult.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly soft and glides over your skin like silk with a nice gentle exfoliating property.</li>
            <li> Also the size is just right.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing, it&#x27;s about the size of a baseball, and EXTREMELY soft, exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used natural sea sponges in the past and I&#x27;m particularly impressed with the quality of this wool sponge from Lather.</li>
            <li> A kitchen sponge from the local super market is better than this item.</li>
            <li> I much prefer this as there is no smell, dries quickly, and has not fallen apart yet.</li>
            <li> This is a soft and absorbing sponge, so much better than synthetic sponge.  </li>
            <li> IT IS VERY SOFT AND SMOOTH ON MY SKIN - -</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY GENTLE ON MY FACE.</li>
            <li> Since they&#x27;ve lasted over a year, the purchase was reasonably good for the money spent and I will buy again not only for their lasting quality, but because they are really good shower sponges.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin,  other nylon loofas irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely, super soft natural sponge.</li>
            <li> I WILL DEFINITELY ORDER MORE WHEN I NEED THEM</li>
            <li> I have been an avid sponge user for years.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered these I bought 2</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li> how well it cleans and revitalizes skin until you start getting compliments from friends and family on how much better your overall complexion looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but not fantastic.</li>
            <li> MORE Unidentified Scratches on my body, only soft and clean</li>
            <li> We bought this sponge for our newborn after reading the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t be for a long time because of the outstanding quality.</li>
            <li> Beginning to degrade more quickly than previously owned sponges.</li>
            <li> for a good, soft sponge to help me lather my body wash better; I&#x27;ve tried baby products, washcloths, I&#x27;ve tried all the things you could possibly try, and everything was too harsh or just did</li>
            <li> It is super soft.</li>
            <li> and it is SUPER soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Pretty large size (more than enough for any adult)&lt;br /&gt;- Soft texture</li>
            <li> A good sponge should hold lather, feel full and of course spongey, and it should last for several motnhs of daily use.</li>
            <li> I wish Lather would go back to their original version and be consistent about size and quality.  </li>
            <li> - - THANKS</li>
            <li> I expected a lot more out of it after reading the reviews, but really the sponge died fast.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent Amazon shopper, but I rarely leave reviews.</li>
            <li> Much, much softer than synthetic sponges I have used.  </li>
            <li> It has no problem absorbing and releasing water.  </li>
            <li> This one is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> like with most natural sponges there&#x27;s an initial break-in period.</li>
            <li> It gives the right scrub without being too soft or scratchy.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to order as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li> THE LATHER NATURAL SEA WOOL SPONGE IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty soft and lathers well.</li>
            <li> It is a nice sponge, but it&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> Each sponge has been clearly from another, as it is evident by the clean, flat shape on one side.  </li>
            <li> Nice..............a little too soft, but nice.</li>
            <li> finally banned those self-injurious colorful poofs of scratching nylon from the bathroom and replaced it with an all natural super soft sea sponge.</li>
            <li> However, it is much smaller than I would have liked and not really practical for bathing.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the fact that its an all natural alternative to those gross loofahs and washcloths.</li>
            <li> When I started ordering Lather sponges a few years ago, they were robust, long lasting, and very good quality.  </li>
            <li> It is very soft and lathers well!  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how large this sponge is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large, ultra soft, and has lasted months with no sign of falling apart.</li>
            <li> WAY TOO SOFT!!  </li>
            <li> She says it is superior to those plastic mesh things that she has been using but the sea sponge is not nearly firm enough or large enough (when wet) for this man.</li>
            <li> It is very porous and really soft so</li>
            <li> I will buy it again only because to me it was worth not having to worry about bacteria and also because it was so soft and gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> The 1st one broke apart after 6 - 7 months,but the 2nd is still going strong although reaching its inevitable death soon.</li>
            <li> Texture may be off-putting for people used to rough, mesh scrubbersPretty large size (more than enough for any adult)&lt;br /&gt;- Soft texture</li>
            <li> and I am just now ordering a new one.</li>
            <li> and i can say that it is time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> It also seems quite durable, since it is very tightly meshed (for lack of a more scientific word).</li>
            <li> However, be aware that there is significant size variation across sellers/orders - I have ordered two now, and the second was only half as large as the first (see photos).</li>
            <li> and I was very surprised at the quality, size and longevity of the sponge.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its very soft and durable.</li>
            <li> It is very soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really, really soft and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sponges, so far this one is my favuorite!</li>
            <li> It is soft!  </li>
            <li> It is a natural sea sponge after all!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more of a loofah consistency, but when wet it&#x27;s almost like a damp bunch of toilet paper in consistency</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how soft it is!  </li>
            <li> This sea sponge is a BIG (fills your hand) and is a super SOFT sea sponge with a hole in the middle where I pour my liquid body wash to lather and shower with daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first natural sea sponge, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to other than the synthetic types.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected and fell apart after 2 weeks of light use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh or scratch the skin.  </li>
            <li> Lately, it&#x27;s been more misses than hits.</li>
            <li> This is also not as soft as some of the sponges I have used.</li>
            <li> Soft sponge, holds up well.</li>
            <li> I have used natural sea sponges since I was 18</li>
            <li> A natural sea sponge is a bit of a luxury, but I figured birthday&#x27;s should be all about luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this sponge to bathe my 2 year old baby</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soft to be a manly shower scrubber.</li>
            <li> product is really, really soft, and works wonders with the lather.</li>
            <li> It feels natural and fits well in one hand.  </li>
            <li> The natural sea wool is luxuriously soft and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too soft for me.  </li>
            <li> I have sometimes been weary of purchasing sponges over the internet for fear that they aren&#x27;t natural.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s so soft that you probably won&#x27;t even realize</li>
            <li> The  sponge  is  soft  </li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed it tearing or crumbling.</li>
            <li> There is nothing, and I mean nothing, better than the softness of natural sea</li>
            <li> But as with any new experience, you&#x27;ll get it down to your own science after a few uses and will think nothing of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We gently squeezed the water out of it after each bath and carefully stored it in a special container (for $14, we were VERY careful with this sponge!).</li>
            <li> I got busy with a move a year ago and realized my current sponge was 18 months old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using a mildly abrasive mesh shower puff, so this took a few days to get used to.</li>
            <li> It may be a plus for some folks, especially for the elderly or to use on very young children, but not for me.</li>
            <li> The rich lather that it creates from ANY soap or body wash is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Most (and often times more expensive) natural sea sponge&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used in the past start to fall apart around the 2 week mark with regular use and reduced to shreds on my shower floor within a month.</li>
            <li> Other Sea sponges I have had in the past felt rougher on the skin and probably did a better job exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> small and gets soggy quickly</li>
            <li> It was tough when dry but when wet - it was soft and supple and wonderful for delicate cleaning of face &amp; body.</li>
            <li> Others seem to have complained so they may be more rough with their sponge.</li>
            <li> When its wet, it grows to a decent size</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad, and doesn&#x27;t matter too much, but would have been nice if it was a bit bigger, nothing</li>
            <li> It is barely the size of my (female) palm.</li>
            <li> The first sponge has lasted well over a year with only a little wear and tear..</li>
            <li> It seems a little more compact then others I have had in the past</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin, and was on the lookout (for years!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some reviews that natural sponges don&#x27;t last all that long.</li>
            <li> With spag is shrinks into a small slimey thing that I can&#x27;t get my fingers around; it is a choice between holding it firmly and leaving no surface to wash with, or leaving a little bit of surface without having a good grip on the spong.</li>
            <li> It gets very soft and velvety when it is wet.</li>
            <li> I took one star off because it does not scrub as well as a regular sea sponge... and that is because of how soft these sponges get when they are wet!</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, I ordered 2 more and received two very small sponges.  </li>
            <li> The smaller sponges don&#x27;t seem to last as long.  </li>
            <li> It plumps when wet and feels way too soft, once you squeeze the water out it stays shrunken for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Much too small to use for a bath sponge.</li>
            <li> Flat bottom to prevent it from rolling around everywhere&lt;</li>
            <li> Flat bottom to prevent it from rolling around everywhere&lt;</li>
            <li> After wetting it, it flops down into a soft, silky sponge.</li>
            <li> I am done I rinse the sponge and squeeze excess water out of it and place it on the shower shelf to dry until next use.</li>
            <li> It’s soft enough to wash without irritating my skin, but firm enough to help exfoliate it, and it works really well with creamy body washes.  </li>
            <li> expected this sponge to last from 6-9 months</li>
            <li> hope it lasts a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> Naturally filters dead skin, bacteria, and impurities</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Feels strange and mushy at first&lt;br</li>
            <li> Naturally filters dead skin, bacteria, and impurities</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Feels strange and mushy at first&lt;br</li>
            <li> Occassionally, one of the larger sponges arrives, but the norm is shifting toward the smaller, less durable versions.  </li>
            <li> The sponge can be a little difficult to rinse and dry completely at first because they retain so much soap.</li>
            <li> so well I didn&#x27;t realize it had been so long since I replaced it!</li>
            <li> I do like the little extra scrub of a regular sea sponge.</li>
            <li> Also, dry it well after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a personal side note; I like to shower with Dial Gold Antibacterial Body Wash with this sponge about once a week to ensure it gets 100% cleansed of any odor causing bacteria or dead skin that I may have missed from rinsing it out in the days prior.</li>
            <li> Sea sponges are extremely efficient at filtering dead skin and impurities by nature, so the Antibacterial wash is just something of personal preference and absolutely not necessary to maintain cleanliness.</li>
            <li> I tend to use to less during the winter, since my skin tends to dry and break out in cold weather, but it’s still soft enough not to initiate a dermatographic reaction as long as I use it gently</li>
            <li> It is much more expensive than what I usually spend for a sea sponge, so</li>
            <li> Little on the small side,  but still decent.</li>
            <li> This has been a regular part of my showering routine for about 2 months now and there are no signs of deterioration except for a little fade in color.</li>
            <li> I tried using one, and it is like using one of those small, thin, synthetic sponges one uses to clean the sink.  </li>
            <li> it wet</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was as expected.  </li>
            <li> is some shrinkage when it gets wet, but I thought it was workable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few months, I threw the sponge away because it was starting to collect dirt that would not rinse out.</li>
            <li> Gently exfoliates without irritating skin</li>
            <li> Gently exfoliates without irritating skin</li>
            <li> Texture may be off-putting for people used to rough, mesh scrubbers</li>
            <li> I just received the sponges and they are are also tiny with very small overall volume.  </li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve received some smaller sponges, some half the size of the earlier sponges I received.  </li>
            <li> The fact that you can just put a drop of soap gel is also a plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it started falling apart after the first month.</li>
            <li> When wet, it shrinks massively and is hard to grab and use it</li>
            <li> So considering the hefty price tag, it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I like how it retains its shape, and wasn&#x27;t cut down into a ball or something.  </li>
            <li> I HAD PREVIOUSLY USED FROM WALMART...</li>
            <li> They were less than half of the size of the sponges I previously received.  </li>
            <li> I have been using one for about 6 weeks, and it does not have any sign of wear, odor or mildew as would typically be seen with a synthetic sponge or pouf.</li>
            <li> highly recommend try it if you are tired of being scratched instead of washed in the shower!</li>
            <li> It will feel a little scratchy for a week or two but it will soften up after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its downfall is that it is now coming apart a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> When dry, it&#x27;s quite hard and stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft that I can&#x27;t even get it to lather, I&#x27;m afraid it might tear if I get rough with it.</li>
            <li> however there are a few tears from use that I catch my fingers on sometimes in the mornings</li>
            <li> It is too rough for delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that I can get the oils off my face by just wiping with this sponge a few times then squeezing it out in the shower spray.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a few months now</li>
            <li> It started to come apart after a few uses.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little stiff, but as soon as you get</li>
            <li> (formerly I couldn&#x27;t use anything but my hands during really dry, cold days).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that they are cut, but the resulting sponge is really small.  </li>
            <li> This was both small and slimey.</li>
            <li> It is so small that I can&#x27;t grasp it in my hand.</li>
            <li> Just too small to recommend.</li>
            <li> Its larger than the fake ones you can get at walmart.</li>
            <li> And they are really small,  had to return them all.</li>
            <li> and they were quite small about the size of my hand as some people have said.  </li>
            <li> The size is too small.  </li>
            <li> About the size of my fist (and I have a small hand).</li>

            <li> Not a top quality spong!</li>
            <li> I am tired of finding scratches on my shoulders and back/legs from the nylon pot scrubber type shower ball of nylon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> WAY TOO SOFT!!  Then I have to use a looflah to feel REALLY clean!</li>
            <li> THE LATHER NATURAL SEA WOOL SPONGE IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED...IT IS VERY SOFT AND SMOOTH ON MY SKIN - - ITS QUALITY IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE SPONGES I HAD PREVIOUSLY USED FROM WALMART...I WILL DEFINITELY ORDER MORE WHEN I NEED THEM - - THANKS</li>
            <li> GREAT SPOONGE AND LAST</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Large, clean, nice. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great! Provides a good lather and seems to be fairly durable. Others seem to have complained so they may be more rough with their sponge. I try to replace it out once or twice a year. I got busy with a move a year ago and realized my current sponge was 18 months old. It has been washed in a dishwasher twice though. The sponge was holding up so well I didn&#x27;t realize it had been so long since I replaced it! Even as a guy I find it has held up well and cleans well. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this thing!! Love love love. Works great and is pretty mesmerizing to boot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge for a couple of months and I have to say, I really love it. It&#x27;s big and creates a lot of lather.  It&#x27;s not harsh or scratch the skin.  It&#x27;s really, really soft and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet!</li>
            <li> These must be the softest sea sponges on the planet! The \\&quot;wool\\&quot; part is not overstated. They do feel like wool/cotton, truly impressive. Also, the size is quite impressive. At least twice that of a common bath sponge. I took one star off because it does not scrub as well as a regular sea sponge... and that is because of how soft these sponges get when they are wet! It may be a plus for some folks, especially for the elderly or to use on very young children, but not for me. I do like the little extra scrub of a regular sea sponge. But, with that said, this is an amazing sea sponge, and probably the softest thing you can find. It also seems quite durable, since it is very tightly meshed (for lack of a more scientific word).</li>
            <li> Yes, it is soft and I loved it. Then two months later, it started falling apart more and more until I can&#x27;t use it anymore. See the customer picture I just took.</li>
            <li> We bought this sponge for our newborn after reading the positive reviews here. We gently squeezed the water out of it after each bath and carefully stored it in a special container (for $14, we were VERY careful with this sponge!). It was soft and wonderful to use for the first 5 baths, and then it literally fell apart in pieces. What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these sponges about 6 months ago.  Both sponges were good-sized, about the size of my hand and good thickness.  I was very pleased with the sponges.  A few weeks ago, I ordered 2 more and received two very small sponges.  They were less than half of the size of the sponges I previously received.  I returned them and tried re-ordering again.  I just received the sponges and they are are also tiny with very small overall volume.  Each sponge has been clearly from another, as it is evident by the clean, flat shape on one side.  I don&#x27;t mind that they are cut, but the resulting sponge is really small.  I tried using one, and it is like using one of those small, thin, synthetic sponges one uses to clean the sink.  I am very disappointed as I feel I am being ripped off.</li>
            <li> When I started ordering Lather sponges a few years ago, they were robust, long lasting, and very good quality.  Lately, I&#x27;ve received some smaller sponges, some half the size of the earlier sponges I received.  The smaller sponges don&#x27;t seem to last as long.  Occassionally, one of the larger sponges arrives, but the norm is shifting toward the smaller, less durable versions.  I wish Lather would go back to their original version and be consistent about size and quality.  Lately, it&#x27;s been more misses than hits.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sponge originally on 7/13/09 and I am just now ordering a new one. The first sponge has lasted well over a year with only a little wear and tear.. it still holds a great shape, lots of water and lathers and rinses out well.. however there are a few tears from use that I catch my fingers on sometimes in the mornings so it&#x27;s time to replace!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected this sponge to last from 6-9 months and I was very surprised at the quality, size and longevity of the sponge. I am happily purchasing another and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is also not as soft as some of the sponges I have used. It is too rough for delicate skin.  I am returning it</li>
            <li> I have been an avid sponge user for years. I love to cover it with neutrogena soap and lather up each morning. I have had great sponges - especially when I bought large natural sponges on overseas trips - and I have had others that were just ok, which is what most of the online sponges have been. This sponge was all by itself whay at the bottom of the heap. A good sponge should hold lather, feel full and of course spongey, and it should last for several motnhs of daily use. This was both small and slimey. It is so small that I can&#x27;t grasp it in my hand. Rather than being a sponge that I can hold my hand around, this is more of a \\&quot;finger sponge.\\&quot;  With spag is shrinks into a small slimey thing that I can&#x27;t get my fingers around; it is a choice between holding it firmly and leaving no surface to wash with, or leaving a little bit of surface without having a good grip on the spong. Combined with its slimey texture that means it just skips out of my fingers. Honestly, any buyer should look elsewhere. A kitchen sponge from the local super market is better than this item. Any suggestions for a good, large, natural online sponge, regardless of price, would be most appreciated.</li>
            <li> I have never used a sea sponge before, so I have nothing to compare it to.  I love this sponge.  It is fairly large(about the size of my hand), extremely soft, and it lathers up my body wash really well.  I will be purchasing a second one to have as a spare.</li>
            <li> This sponge is tiny. Much too small to use for a bath sponge. You could use it to put on your foundation, but that&#x27;s about it. Or perhaps for a baby&#x27;s sponge. It is barely the size of my (female) palm. Just too small to recommend.</li>
            <li> There is nothing, and I mean nothing, better than the softness of natural sea wool.&lt;br /&gt;This is hand size and works perfectly with shower gels.  I have very sensitive skin and&lt;br /&gt;the natural sea wool is perfect and does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected and fell apart after 2 weeks of light use.  Lathered up well, but still wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I am tired of finding scratches on my shoulders and back/legs from the nylon pot scrubber type shower ball of nylon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally banned those self-injurious colorful poofs of scratching nylon from the bathroom and replaced it with an all natural super soft sea sponge. This sea sponge is a BIG (fills your hand) and is a super SOFT sea sponge with a hole in the middle where I pour my liquid body wash to lather and shower with daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE Unidentified Scratches on my body, only soft and clean skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I am done I rinse the sponge and squeeze excess water out of it and place it on the shower shelf to dry until next use. Holds up well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend try it if you are tired of being scratched instead of washed in the shower! Have a blessed day!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how large this sponge is. Its larger than the fake ones you can get at walmart. Its very soft and durable. No pieces have came off of this one unlike the walmart ones I used before. I am happy to say that I got my moneys worth in this sponge!</li>
            <li> This is the best natural sea sponge I have owned in a long time.  It&#x27;s soft, keeps its shape and does not fall apart like some sea sponges costing a lot more money.  This was worth every penny and I will continue to order as long as it is available.  Probably won&#x27;t be for a long time because of the outstanding quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Sponge for about 1.5 months and it is still intact! It&#x27;s super flexible. It gives the right scrub without being too soft or scratchy. Perfect size to fit in the hand. Great use of nature.</li>
            <li> I ordered 5 of them for Mother&#x27;s day , the biggest sponge was 0.56 oz, the rest were 0.26-0.28 oz. Not even close to the advertized size. And they are really small,  had to return them all.</li>
            <li> At first I was very happy with this product, but after couple of baths it started falling apart until I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore. It&#x27;s great and soft for no longer than 1 month max and than it just fall into pieces. I&#x27;m very disappointed from it.</li>
            <li> It plumps when wet and feels way too soft, once you squeeze the water out it stays shrunken for a long time.  Sort of useless for bathing, unless it&#x27;s for a baby!</li>
            <li> Much better than the synthetic ones at \\&quot;walley world\\&quot;.  These do not flake off, hold more water, and are softer. Definately purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the way this sponge feels. It&#x27;s large, ultra soft, and has lasted months with no sign of falling apart.</li>
            <li> Well i literally just got this and used it once. When you take it out of the bag it&#x27;s a little stiff, but as soon as you get it wet it&#x27;s pretty soft and lathers well. My only problem with this is i swear it feels like it&#x27;s going to fall apart already. It&#x27;s good but not fantastic.</li>
            <li> Hi I bought these to try because I read a review in a magazines that these were a great natural sponge.  I didn&#x27;t want to scrub my skin with those plastic puffs that I had been using for years and got scratches.  The first time I ordered these I bought 2 and they were quite small about the size of my hand as some people have said.  The second time I ordered them they were much bigger larger that my hand and more like the gig plastic scrubs I was used too.  I hope as I continue to order them the size will be more consistent.  The fact that you can just put a drop of soap gel is also a plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The sponge is nice and soft. However, it is much smaller than I would have liked and not really practical for bathing.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely, super soft natural sponge. It is quite sturdy and produces lots of great foamy lather with just a small amount of soap but is also very easy to rinse clean. I have been using one for about 6 weeks, and it does not have any sign of wear, odor or mildew as would typically be seen with a synthetic sponge or pouf. However, be aware that there is significant size variation across sellers/orders - I have ordered two now, and the second was only half as large as the first (see photos).</li>
            <li> Soft sponge, holds up well. Fits good in hand and lathers up nicely. Very good deal for the price.  Only improvement might be a cord to hang it.</li>
            <li> The 1st one broke apart after 6 - 7 months,but the 2nd is still going strong although reaching its inevitable death soon. Since they&#x27;ve lasted over a year, the purchase was reasonably good for the money spent and I will buy again not only for their lasting quality, but because they are really good shower sponges.</li>
            <li> So this sponge was okay. I expected a lot more out of it after reading the reviews, but really the sponge died fast. Maybe I didn&#x27;t take care of it properly? Can you take care of a sea sponge?</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  I have used natural sea sponges since I was 18 - I am now over 60.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Little on the small side,  but still decent. Great for sensitive skin,  other nylon loofas irritate my skin. I&#x27;ll definitely keep purchasing these.</li>
            <li> disappointed, does not do as well as others.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was as expected.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I loved this item and have used it for months now. It has held up to soap and all types of bathroom uses.</li>
            <li> This is sponge is really nice!  I use it regularly in the shower, and I couldn’t be happier.  It’s soft enough to wash without irritating my skin, but firm enough to help exfoliate it, and it works really well with creamy body washes.  I tend to use to less during the winter, since my skin tends to dry and break out in cold weather, but it’s still soft enough not to initiate a dermatographic reaction as long as I use it gently (formerly I couldn&#x27;t use anything but my hands during really dry, cold days). It also dries really quickly, and this keeps it clean and in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this sponge! I really enjoy the fact that its an all natural alternative to those gross loofahs and washcloths. I much prefer this as there is no smell, dries quickly, and has not fallen apart yet.</li>
            <li> Been awhile now.  Sponge is good holds up not like local ones in stores here.</li>
            <li> I have been using bath sponges for many years. There were great reviews on this particular sponge so I was all set to like it.     It does lather nicely and the longer you use it, the softer it gets (hence the two stars). Unfortunately, it started falling apart after the first month. So considering the hefty price tag, it&#x27;s just not worth it. There are better sponges out there; spend your money elsewhere.     I am a frequent Amazon shopper, but I rarely leave reviews. I felt compelled, however, to write this one because I was so outraged at the speed at which this sponge deteriorated.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the size of this sponge.  I am a sea wool sponge user. Ad did not specify size, just weight.  The package this sponge came in said 5-6 inches.  It was much smaller.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the material falling a part (having read that in some reviews) but I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all and I bought it six months ago. I love this thing, it&#x27;s about the size of a baseball, and EXTREMELY soft, exactly what I was hoping for. Some sponges are rough, or visually unseemly, this is good looking and gentle, and perfect for lathering yourself or someone else! ;)</li>
            <li> This feels ahhhmazing. When dry, it&#x27;s quite hard and stiff. After wetting it, it flops down into a soft, silky sponge. It&#x27;s so soft that I can&#x27;t even get it to lather, I&#x27;m afraid it might tear if I get rough with it. But I&#x27;ve repurposed it to use on my face. It&#x27;s quite absorbent and I&#x27;ve found that I can get the oils off my face by just wiping with this sponge a few times then squeezing it out in the shower spray. It feels great on my face and leaves it clean, oil free, and soft.</li>
            <li> small and gets soggy quickly</li>
            <li> These area GREAT sponges unlike the phony rubber foam ones sold in stores. Have purchased for various family members. We LOVE these real sponges!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now. It is super soft. My skin loves the touch of it. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sponges, so far this one is my favuorite!</li>
            <li> This is the best bath sponge I have every bought. It seems a little more compact then others I have had in the past and I feel it will last a lot longer. The sponge fits in my hand easily and does a good job. I very happy with this sponge and will buy another when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sponge for almost nine month before replacing it. This is actually pretty good for a natural sea sponge - most of them don&#x27;t last that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like with most natural sponges there&#x27;s an initial break-in period. It will feel a little scratchy for a week or two but it will soften up after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing worth noting - these sponges do require periodic maintenance. As someone mentioned already - use deluded hydrogen peroxide to soak the sponge once in a while, about every month is perfect, to kill off the bacteria and make sure there&#x27;s no chance of mold. Also, dry it well after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty good deal - cheap and pretty durable. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This was part of a \\&quot;bath set\\&quot; gift I got for my wife for her birthday.  A natural sea sponge is a bit of a luxury, but I figured birthday&#x27;s should be all about luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is thrilled with this, which makes me happy. This was her (and mine) first natural sea sponge, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to other than the synthetic types.  It is soft!  I was surprised at how soft it is!  Much, much softer than synthetic sponges I have used.  It feels great in the shower, builds up a good lather, and soaks up water.  I thought it was a good size (about the size of a grapefruit)--there is some shrinkage when it gets wet, but I thought it was workable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks nice too.  I like how it retains its shape, and wasn&#x27;t cut down into a ball or something.  It is a natural sea sponge after all! I want it to look like one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have only been using it for a couple of weeks, so I hope the goodness lasts. I&#x27;ve seen some reviews that natural sponges don&#x27;t last all that long. Seeing how happy my wife is with this, something tells me if it falls apart I will be buying her a replacement!</li>
            <li> Trying to find good quality natural bath sponges is a real chore.  Until I found these on Amazon.  I&#x27;ll tell you how good these are. I bought 6 just to make sure I have some on hand.  These are soft, luxurious, the best I have ever purchased.  I&#x27;m choosy as anyone can be, and these are fantastic.  Buy these, you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sponge to bathe my 2 year old baby and it is SUPER soft.  I have been using it a few months now and i can say that it is time for a new one.  It is very porous and really soft so its downfall is that it is now coming apart a little at a time.  I will buy it again only because to me it was worth not having to worry about bacteria and also because it was so soft and gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin.  It also lathers super well! I definitely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> It is a nice sponge, but it&#x27;s too small. When wet, it shrinks massively and is hard to grab and use it</li>
            <li> very nice and makes lots of suds, dries out quickly, hope it lasts a long, long time.  Would recommend to anyone to buy.</li>
            <li> This sponge is soft and perfect.</li>
            <li> This is like the second or third time I buy this product.  This time I  received what I think should be used on a baby more than on an adult.  The size is too small.  When its wet, it grows to a decent size but once I rinse it out it becomes like the size of my palm of my hand....  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soft to be a manly shower scrubber. I was hoping for more of a loofah consistency, but when wet it&#x27;s almost like a damp bunch of toilet paper in consistency</li>
            <li> This is a soft and absorbing sponge, so much better than synthetic sponge.  Also the size is just right.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin, and was on the lookout (for years!) for a good, soft sponge to help me lather my body wash better; I&#x27;ve tried baby products, washcloths, I&#x27;ve tried all the things you could possibly try, and everything was too harsh or just didn&#x27;t quite work.&lt;br /&gt;This product is really, really soft, and works wonders with the lather. It&#x27;s very easy to use, and is perfect for dry, sensitive skin, as well as any other type of skin (though if you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliating product, this might not be a good choice for you).&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this one is that it&#x27;s very, very tiny. About the size of my fist (and I have a small hand). It&#x27;s not that bad, and doesn&#x27;t matter too much, but would have been nice if it was a bit bigger, nothing crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep purchasing this sponge, and I feel like I finally found what I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li> This sponge lathers very nicely.  It feels natural and fits well in one hand.  It has no problem absorbing and releasing water.  It feels like it should last for quite a while.  I&#x27;ll probably update this review when it starts breaking apart.  I like it but wish it was just a bit bigger hence 4 out of 5.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED. IT IS VERY GENTLE ON MY FACE. IT RINSES OUT WELL AND IS ALWAYS EASY ON MY FACE.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  It is very soft.  Other Sea sponges I have had in the past felt rougher on the skin and probably did a better job exfoliating.  It lathers excellently and the softness of it feels luxurious..  It is much more expensive than what I usually spend for a sea sponge, so I hope it lasts.  If it does last, I would rate it a 5.</li>
            <li> Beginning to degrade more quickly than previously owned sponges. All tend to do this though.</li>
            <li> This is very good sponge, it is very soft but still does its job and also good size, fits nicely in hand.</li>
            <li> Not a top quality spong! It started to come apart after a few uses. It is also smaller then I would like. Would not buy another one.</li>
            <li> This sponge is ideal for people with sensitive skin who don&#x27;t want the abrasive scratch of a synthetic body puff. The natural sea wool is luxuriously soft and non-irritating. However, the sponge is too small- it easily slips out of my hand and there is no string to hang it from for storage or to wrap around my fingers when showering. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that I need to use more body wash than with a synthetic sponge because the suds fall off the sponge quite easily. After a few months, I threw the sponge away because it was starting to collect dirt that would not rinse out. Great idea, but implementation could be better.</li>
            <li> Best natural sponge I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to buy one.</li>
            <li> Nice..............a little too soft, but nice.</li>
            <li> Perfect sea wool sponge dries very fast and i love the way it feels on my skin and a perfect size for washing all body parts.</li>
            <li> When this thing meets water it softens up and shrinks to an unusable soggy mass about the size of a golf ball.  It&#x27;s way too soft for me.  My wife loves it though so I gave it to her.  She says it is superior to those plastic mesh things that she has been using but the sea sponge is not nearly firm enough or large enough (when wet) for this man. I  noticed that it holds lots of soap and my spouse says the same for her body wash.</li>
            <li> I have sometimes been weary of purchasing sponges over the internet for fear that they aren&#x27;t natural.  This one is the real thing.  It was tough when dry but when wet - it was soft and supple and wonderful for delicate cleaning of face &amp; body.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and lathers well!  I didnt give it 5 stars because It was almost too soft when wet.</li>
            <li> These natural sea sponge&#x27;s from Lather are great. I&#x27;m used to using a mildly abrasive mesh shower puff, so this took a few days to get used to. It&#x27;s incredibly soft and glides over your skin like silk with a nice gentle exfoliating property. In fact, it&#x27;s so soft that you probably won&#x27;t even realize how well it cleans and revitalizes skin until you start getting compliments from friends and family on how much better your overall complexion looks. The rich lather that it creates from ANY soap or body wash is unbelievable. I use Dove Visible Care Toning body wash along with this sea sponge and it&#x27;s almost like showering with body lotion. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it! The sponge can be a little difficult to rinse and dry completely at first because they retain so much soap. But as with any new experience, you&#x27;ll get it down to your own science after a few uses and will think nothing of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a personal side note; I like to shower with Dial Gold Antibacterial Body Wash with this sponge about once a week to ensure it gets 100% cleansed of any odor causing bacteria or dead skin that I may have missed from rinsing it out in the days prior. Sea sponges are extremely efficient at filtering dead skin and impurities by nature, so the Antibacterial wash is just something of personal preference and absolutely not necessary to maintain cleanliness. I&#x27;ve used natural sea sponges in the past and I&#x27;m particularly impressed with the quality of this wool sponge from Lather. This has been a regular part of my showering routine for about 2 months now and there are no signs of deterioration except for a little fade in color. Most (and often times more expensive) natural sea sponge&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used in the past start to fall apart around the 2 week mark with regular use and reduced to shreds on my shower floor within a month. You won&#x27;t find a better value for a sea sponge anywhere else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Generates a really nice and luxurious lather&lt;br /&gt;- Pretty large size (more than enough for any adult)&lt;br /&gt;- Soft texture that&#x27;s easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;- Gently exfoliates without irritating skin&lt;br /&gt;- Flat bottom to prevent it from rolling around everywhere&lt;br /&gt;- Very effective at overall cleaning&lt;br /&gt;- Dries quickly with no residue&lt;br /&gt;- Naturally filters dead skin, bacteria, and impurities&lt;br /&gt;- Durable quality and easy to maintain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Can be difficult to rinse completely&lt;br /&gt;- Feels strange and mushy at first&lt;br /&gt;- Texture may be off-putting for people used to rough, mesh scrubbersPretty large size (more than enough for any adult)&lt;br /&gt;- Soft texture that&#x27;s easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;- Gently exfoliates without irritating skin&lt;br /&gt;- Flat bottom to prevent it from rolling around everywhere&lt;br /&gt;- Very effective at overall cleaning&lt;br /&gt;- Dries quickly with no residue&lt;br /&gt;- Naturally filters dead skin, bacteria, and impurities&lt;br /&gt;- Durable quality and easy to maintain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Can be difficult to rinse completely&lt;br /&gt;- Feels strange and mushy at first&lt;br /&gt;- Texture may be off-putting for people used to rough, mesh scrubbers</li>
            <li> The  sponge  is  soft  holds  body  gel  perfectly  feels  very  good  on  my  skin . I  am  very  glad  I  purchased  it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and I love it. I use it a few times a day to wash and rinse my face and it is perfect. It gets very soft and velvety when it is wet. So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed it tearing or crumbling. I would definitely buy this product again, and probably will!</li>
            <li> it is the perfect size for use in the shower; it is soft and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend a good rinse after each use; and replacing it after 3 or 4 months.</li>
