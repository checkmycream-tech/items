            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure this is great for anti-snap.  </li>
            <li>It is best to apply this right after the shower, when your hair is still damp.  </li>

            <li>It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly giving you secrets I learned over weeks of researching before investing lots of money in these products.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many many years, it is great.</li>
            <li>Having a bottle around is nice</li>
            <li>And that product smells nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I use like 3-4 pumps of this stuff and just saturate my hair after I comb out the tangles.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good product for my hair which I have been coloring and straightening for many years.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t do a thing with it, my new best friend told me about this product</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly, I&#x27;ve always loved this product, came in a timely fashion, the product was packaged well and there were no damages</li>
            <li>It would break off very easily</li>
            <li>Great product, easy and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE Redken&#x27;s Anti-Snap.</li>
            <li>Leaves my ends frizzy even though they are healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I also love to use this if I&#x27;m straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product sure did help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but thanks to this product it always looks healthy and has great shine.</li>
            <li>I had several perms in my life and with this product my curks looked soooooooooooo great!</li>
            <li>I bought this product after having bleached my hair one too many times and was looking for some relief.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a year and love it.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see that Amazon carries it at a much better price than a salon.  </li>
            <li>and I can say that although it is somewhat \\&quot;pricey\\&quot;, I&#x27;m glad that I decided to try this line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I get compliments all of the time and plan on keeping this product in my life as a permanent knight in shining armor, for my hair :)</li>
            <li>they love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can confidently say the following:&lt;br /&gt;Using this is better than using nothing.  </li>
            <li>I just think I&#x27;ve found better for my hair type.  </li>
            <li>but then it gradually got better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My hair seems to be much more healthy when I use it.  </li>
            <li>It is also more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Will get again for sure.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know what happened, i really was looking forward to using it and read great reviews</li>
            <li>Redken have everything you need to make your hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is not sticky, smells great and really does seem to strengthen my hair.</li>
            <li>Could not possibly recommend this product more!!!</li>
            <li>I will keep buying it, but only cause it does work great, when you use it appropriately!</li>
            <li>I used to use Redken for ages long time ago, and my hair looks the best at that time; then for some reason I stopped.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff at Albertson&#x27;s and loved it from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is the best for colored treated hair, that is dry.   </li>
            <li>Extreme by Redken is about the most perfect shampoo I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t lie, I have spent over $50 on just one hair treatment product and it hasn&#x27;t even done anything as wonderful as this</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for my hair, except make it smell good.</li>
            <li>It is great for after shampoo use.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soft and easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Redken Extreme Anti-snap is the best.</li>
            <li>my hair snaps off really easily and sheds a lot.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and this makes it easy to comb without leaving it greasy at the end of the day</li>
            <li>I use other treatments in my hair (including a creamy leave in) and the combination of this with a lightweight creamy leave in and anti frizz serum results in perfect smooth hair when I use heat or roller set my hair.</li>
            <li>Hands down best product.</li>
            <li>(my hair is fine</li>
            <li>My Caucasian hair is on the fine side, colored, and somewhat damaged.  </li>
            <li>This product provides the protein I need for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Works wonders on fine distressed hair that is prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>Leave in, it has made a HUGE difference in frizz, health, etc....</li>
            <li>and I can tell a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>She loves this leave in conditioner because it&#x27;s not oily and her hair feels light after using it.</li>
            <li>I had been using DevaCurl&#x27;s shampoo (a sulfate free curly shampoo)</li>
            <li>then I apply the anti-snap concentrating on my ends and then lightly brushing through my roots and strands with the leftovers.</li>
            <li>It is shiney, smooth and managable.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair detangled and conditioned, smooth, and prevents shedding and breakage.</li>
            <li>This is worth the $$ and better then any leave in product I have tried.</li>
            <li>All they do is smooth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to pay couple extra dollars for your hair to look good.</li>
            <li>I really want to know why because everyone talks great things about this product, maybe it was too much protein</li>
            <li>Loving my new hair!</li>
            <li>I have a new stylist who always raves about how healthy my hair is and I contribute most of that to Anti-Snap.</li>
            <li>I first use a Sexy Hair spray leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li>My hair has dramatically improved in it&#x27;s condition in the past couple months that I&#x27;ve been using it, which is great!</li>
            <li>If you can justify the price in your budget, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I washed with Moroccan old shampoo and conditioned it with intense hydrating mask (which I love, love, love)</li>
            <li>I feel confident that the redken Extreme line can help keep my hair strong and healthy during the process!</li>
            <li>I have very dry frizzy hair and this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product works for someone, but for me it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>love this product really helps frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Because it is true, once your hair is split, there is no remedy for it, any products that say they fix it are lying.</li>
            <li>Please check out my full review here:&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is PERFECT for thin, fine grease prone hair.  </li>
            <li>It helped tremendously with split ends, and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>My wife has always had brittle hair, she also likes having long hair and the two aren&#x27;t a good match.</li>
            <li>i got thick course ethnic hair and this redken product leaves my hair feeling nice, smelling nice &amp;&amp; tangle free .</li>
            <li>This is a really good product for hair prone to breakage, i.e. chemically treated hair, as well has curly hair that tends to be on the dry side.</li>
            <li>As recently my hair get pretty dray I made decision to get Redken back-that was a good decision.  </li>
            <li>I have no words to describe this product there only  one thing I can say, is excellent as the first time I used it  leave my hair very soft very shiny</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>It is the best product for damaged, breaking, or just weak hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure my hair was as strong as possible.</li>
            <li>maybe a quarter size throught my whole head of 3c/4a fine hair).</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair and</li>
            <li>It helps smooth out he damage so much compared to not using the product at all (and blow drying).</li>
            <li>Really great for dried out damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>and I have chemically treated hair, it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>For me, I have not found anything else on the market that works so well on my hair in keeping it soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I then took the bag off and put in some plaits to maintain it for the night, I have my satin cap on right now to protect my hair from my pillow, I&#x27;m waiting &#x27;til morning to see what happens, but otherwise you style the way you want to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;d rather just grow out healthy natural hair since I&#x27;ve seen improvement and how damaged my hair really was.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much (from Ulta).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight, not sticky or greasy at all but makes SUCH a difference.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who needs to condition and tame long hair, keeping it healthy and in great condition.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>If I find something I like better than the Chi, I&#x27;ll try to come back here to recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am buying more instantly and giving it to all my friend</li>
            <li>I really like!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve used that promotes healthy ends.  </li>
            <li>I now use this shampoo first, and then the DevaCurl shampoo after.</li>
            <li>I went in the other day to get my hair trimmed and the stylist commented on how shiny and healthy my hair was!</li>
            <li>and I mostly only apply the products to the ends of my hair where the damage is most noticeable.</li>
            <li>1-2 pumps is more than enough!</li>
            <li>It still works, but I have to use more of it than I used to in order to get the same effect since it&#x27;s so diluted.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure if it&#x27;s actually working</li>
            <li>This is my first night trying the product</li>
            <li>I can find better product than this one at a lesser price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what you supposed to receive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much healthier and softer when using this product!</li>
            <li>I still have my first bottle (bought almost a year ago, use it once a week maybe one pump or so)</li>
            <li>This product was much more watery and wasn&#x27;t the same formula as the type you buy from the salon.</li>
            <li>and I make sure I always have an extra ready, because I can tell right away</li>
            <li>My hair is color treated, tends to be dry and is very fine</li>
            <li>but less is more!</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to use, but I think I used 4 pumps too many, this didn&#x27;t give me a negative result</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair super soft when I use it</li>
            <li>I have owned a large hair salon, and beauty supply.</li>
            <li>this has been one of my all time fav hair products(&#x3D; it smells great and makes my highly textured african american curly hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>If the next bottle is back to normal, I will definitely rate 5 stars since it is usually much more effective at protecting against and repairing split end damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for three days and already see a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I did not use too much of it</li>
            <li>I was giving it too much moisture which was ironically drying it out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-there wasn&#x27;t much in there to begin with even my mother noticed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>has really damaged hair from dyes over the years</li>
            <li>but I wanted to help them out as much as I could without chopping off all my hair.</li>
            <li>It helps my hair from breaking from use of straight iron.</li>
            <li>The real Redken product does not make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>Theyust have filled the bottle with a different product.</li>
            <li>very qick</li>
            <li>Seller needs to be more careful with packaging.</li>
            <li>but you dont need much.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 3 years straight</li>
            <li>Its really helped my hair from breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has absolutely helped my hair.</li>
            <li>It was fixing my heat damaged hair really well, but I noticed my hair was falling out a bit.</li>
            <li>When I used it consistently, I noted fewer new split ends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with armpit length, full, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I am thinking about just throwing away most of my other products now since this alone can take care of it.</li>
            <li>It does smooth the hair down and calm frizzies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Redken Anti-Snap for years and will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to many different hair dressers/salons, and I asked each stylist what they recommended for a product to help cut back on how much my hair sheds.</li>
            <li>I have been battling extremely dry, brittle split-ends for as long as I can remember and this leave-in treatment is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I rarely blow dry it or put any styling products in it, and consistently use leave in treatments, so its not too damaged.</li>
            <li>and I used a high quality conditioner with it, so that&#x27;s not the problem.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Within 2 days my blonde dry hair showed less  fly aways and much softer and managable..</li>
            <li>But I get it, if you use it everyday you will buy more of their product faster.</li>
            <li>have medium long, fine hair, and I use about 4 or 5 pumps right after I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li>I have super long hair.</li>
            <li>my hair was like brand new.  </li>
            <li>This is my new staple product for an emergency hair fix.</li>
            <li>I live for this stuff...</li>
            <li>so the air is super dry.</li>
            <li>Super, HIGHLY recommended for those with dry, damaged, brittle hair!!</li>
            <li>I am moving out of the country and have made sure I have enough of this to last me until the next time I am state side.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the same luscious feel on my hair compare to the first bottle of anti snap redken I purchased from the salon.</li>
            <li>Its a protein treatment, and too much protein will result in breakage all over again, so I recommend using it about three to four times a week, and two small pumps for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I also use Redken smooth down shampoo, and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on the roots, just from the middle down to the ends- focusing most of the product on my ends &#x27;cause</li>
            <li>so it was easy enough to untangle gently, but if your hair is thick you may need something more, even if yout conditioner says to rinse out, if it&#x27;s typical leaving some in WON&#x27;T kill your hair.</li>
            <li>Now, because I&#x27;ve been using this treatment for so long, I have to take a break, as my hair is healthy again and the protein is now drying my hair, so instead of 2x a week, I&#x27;ll use it 1x a week to once every other week.</li>
            <li>I swim 2 to 3 times a week and have recently had a dying mishap (purely my fault</li>
            <li>Redken Extreme Anti Snap is a great product to have on hand when your hair is weak, breaking, and falling out.</li>
            <li>I am only giving it a 3 because although it is a great product, they fail to tell you not to use it every day.</li>
            <li>My hair is no longer breaking, it is soft and bouncy even when I was it myself.</li>
            <li>and it really helps, especially because I&#x27;m growing my hair longer.  </li>
            <li>I have been dying my hair, relaxing it, bleaching it, and stripping it since I was 14 years old</li>
            <li>I need a product that conditions it well, prevents and repairs split ends, and leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>mines curly but fragile and this has helped soooo much</li>
            <li>Not heavy like some leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue after applying it.</li>
            <li>Now that I have been using this stuff for a month, my hair shines like what you see in commercials and it is so soft.</li>
            <li>I lighten my hair every 2 months and Redkin has helped my hair maintain the natural shine and thickness while allowing it to be wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li>Will not waste my money again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try a few more different products to help with my damaged hair</li>
            <li>I will use this product a few more times before making a final decision.  </li>
            <li>By the way I&#x27;m half filipino and black and my hair has been color treated (just to give you an idea of what kind of hair this prouduct is not working on).</li>
            <li>I felt this Redken Extreme Anti-Snap cream was worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly giving you secrets I learned over weeks of researching before investing lots of money in these products.tonight (African American hair should only be washed twice a week, too much more strips NATURAL oils our hair NEEDS) with the Anti-Snap, because the extreme line is geared toward adding protein back to your hair, the second time you wash your hair in a week you should drop the Anti-Snap and switch your Extreme Conditioner for a DEEP CONDITIONER like Organic Root Stimulater&#x27;s Replishing Olive Oil Conditioner.</li>
            <li>: Some women complained that this made their hair stiff and breakable, this happens with more powerful protein treatments like ApHogee&#x27;s Two Step Protein Treatment, if this happens to your hair using this light treatment you have a sensitivity to protein or your hair didn&#x27;t need it in the first place, too much protein is bad, this is why you should always deep conditioner after using one, even a light one like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair its ridiculous</li>
            <li>That might seem excessive but it hasn&#x27;t been above 18 degrees F in a while, and many nights are below zero</li>
            <li>I have tailbone length super straight thick hair.</li>
            <li>I usually put it in my hair after a shower and it helps smooth out and untangle before I brush.</li>
            <li>This is clearly not the real product.</li>
            <li>If you put too much on then your hair becomes crunchy, and if you focus too much on the ends then they get dried out - hair breaks mainly from mid length so focus</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this for thin fine hair though.</li>
            <li>I have been using this particular Redken product for a few years now, and this is the first bottle I&#x27;ve purchased online as opposed to in the store.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the past year and a half and ABSOLUTELY love it!</li>
            <li>So much so my hair grows long instead of breaking!</li>
            <li>I recently went to a new hairdresser and she told me that I needed a balance in my hair-</li>
            <li>I am left wondering if this is a new formula or just a one-time bottling mistake.</li>
            <li>Since using this product I have had no further breakage, and my hair feels so thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>and now I can barely find any!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I added the product in I combed through, put on a plastic bag and added hot rags on top for five minutes to keep my hair shaft open, this is an extra typically done with deep conditioning treatments, but it helped anyway, and my hair shedded less IMMEDIATELY, no joke.</li>
            <li>I use this with the redken butter and smooth down oil,then blow dry.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight strawberry blonde thin/fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This product not only returned a natural looking shine to my hair</li>
            <li>I think the product was old because it left my hair feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Also, after I use this product, because it feels so stiff, I end up using a lot more of other products just to bring the softness back to my hair.</li>
            <li>but this product really helped take the frizz and dryness out vs the other products I have been trying.</li>
            <li>(African American hair should only be washed twice a week, too much more strips NATURAL oils our hair NEEDS) with the Anti-Snap, because the extreme line is geared toward adding protein back to your hair, the second time you wash your hair in a week you should drop the Anti-Snap and switch your Extreme Conditioner for a DEEP CONDITIONER like Organic Root Stimulater&#x27;s Replishing Olive Oil Conditioner.</li>
            <li>, it does not dry my hair out nor weigh it down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a small amount rubbed in after towel drying hair, leaves hair soft, managable, and you did not spend 5 minutes in shower trying to rinse this out of your hair, 1 bottle lasts through many shampoos, because only a small amount is needed each time.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it my hair ends up being really stiff, and in turn my hair breaks, which is really ironic!</li>
            <li>In the morning, my hair is soft and my ends aren&#x27;t dry at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m letting my hair dry naturally w/out hairdryer</li>
            <li>After using several products, I noted that even the best ones can weigh your hair down or just make your hair look downright awful if you use too much of it.  </li>
            <li>I calm down and reached for the Redken Extreme Anti-snap.</li>

            <li> It is best to apply this right after the shower, when your hair is still damp.  </li>

            <li> It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly giving you secrets I learned over weeks of researching before investing lots of money in these products.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many many years, it is great.</li>
            <li> Having a bottle around is nice</li>
            <li> And that product smells nice.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I use like 3-4 pumps of this stuff and just saturate my hair after I comb out the tangles.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good product for my hair which I have been coloring and straightening for many years.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t do a thing with it, my new best friend told me about this product</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly, I&#x27;ve always loved this product, came in a timely fashion, the product was packaged well and there were no damages</li>
            <li> It would break off very easily</li>
            <li> Great product, easy and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely LOVE Redken&#x27;s Anti-Snap.</li>
            <li> Leaves my ends frizzy even though they are healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I also love to use this if I&#x27;m straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> This product sure did help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but thanks to this product it always looks healthy and has great shine.</li>
            <li> I had several perms in my life and with this product my curks looked soooooooooooo great!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after having bleached my hair one too many times and was looking for some relief.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a year and love it.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see that Amazon carries it at a much better price than a salon.  </li>
            <li> and I can say that although it is somewhat \\&quot;pricey\\&quot;, I&#x27;m glad that I decided to try this line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I get compliments all of the time and plan on keeping this product in my life as a permanent knight in shining armor, for my hair :)</li>
            <li> they love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can confidently say the following:&lt;br /&gt;Using this is better than using nothing.  </li>
            <li> I just think I&#x27;ve found better for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> but then it gradually got better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My hair seems to be much more healthy when I use it.  </li>
            <li> It is also more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Will get again for sure.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what happened, i really was looking forward to using it and read great reviews</li>
            <li> Redken have everything you need to make your hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It is not sticky, smells great and really does seem to strengthen my hair.</li>
            <li> Could not possibly recommend this product more!!!</li>
            <li> I will keep buying it, but only cause it does work great, when you use it appropriately!</li>
            <li> I used to use Redken for ages long time ago, and my hair looks the best at that time; then for some reason I stopped.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff at Albertson&#x27;s and loved it from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is the best for colored treated hair, that is dry.   </li>
            <li> Extreme by Redken is about the most perfect shampoo I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t lie, I have spent over $50 on just one hair treatment product and it hasn&#x27;t even done anything as wonderful as this</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my hair, except make it smell good.</li>
            <li> It is great for after shampoo use.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soft and easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Redken Extreme Anti-snap is the best.</li>
            <li> my hair snaps off really easily and sheds a lot.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and this makes it easy to comb without leaving it greasy at the end of the day</li>
            <li> I use other treatments in my hair (including a creamy leave in) and the combination of this with a lightweight creamy leave in and anti frizz serum results in perfect smooth hair when I use heat or roller set my hair.</li>
            <li> Hands down best product.</li>
            <li> (my hair is fine</li>
            <li> My Caucasian hair is on the fine side, colored, and somewhat damaged.  </li>
            <li> This product provides the protein I need for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on fine distressed hair that is prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> Leave in, it has made a HUGE difference in frizz, health, etc....</li>
            <li> and I can tell a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> She loves this leave in conditioner because it&#x27;s not oily and her hair feels light after using it.</li>
            <li> I had been using DevaCurl&#x27;s shampoo (a sulfate free curly shampoo)</li>
            <li> then I apply the anti-snap concentrating on my ends and then lightly brushing through my roots and strands with the leftovers.</li>
            <li> It is shiney, smooth and managable.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair detangled and conditioned, smooth, and prevents shedding and breakage.</li>
            <li> This is worth the $$ and better then any leave in product I have tried.</li>
            <li> All they do is smooth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to pay couple extra dollars for your hair to look good.</li>
            <li> I really want to know why because everyone talks great things about this product, maybe it was too much protein</li>
            <li> Loving my new hair!</li>
            <li> I have a new stylist who always raves about how healthy my hair is and I contribute most of that to Anti-Snap.</li>
            <li> I first use a Sexy Hair spray leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li> My hair has dramatically improved in it&#x27;s condition in the past couple months that I&#x27;ve been using it, which is great!</li>
            <li> If you can justify the price in your budget, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I washed with Moroccan old shampoo and conditioned it with intense hydrating mask (which I love, love, love)</li>
            <li> I feel confident that the redken Extreme line can help keep my hair strong and healthy during the process!</li>
            <li> I have very dry frizzy hair and this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works for someone, but for me it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> love this product really helps frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Because it is true, once your hair is split, there is no remedy for it, any products that say they fix it are lying.</li>
            <li> Please check out my full review here:&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is PERFECT for thin, fine grease prone hair.  </li>
            <li> It helped tremendously with split ends, and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> My wife has always had brittle hair, she also likes having long hair and the two aren&#x27;t a good match.</li>
            <li> i got thick course ethnic hair and this redken product leaves my hair feeling nice, smelling nice &amp;&amp; tangle free .</li>
            <li> This is a really good product for hair prone to breakage, i.e. chemically treated hair, as well has curly hair that tends to be on the dry side.</li>
            <li> As recently my hair get pretty dray I made decision to get Redken back-that was a good decision.  </li>
            <li> I have no words to describe this product there only  one thing I can say, is excellent as the first time I used it  leave my hair very soft very shiny</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> It is the best product for damaged, breaking, or just weak hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure my hair was as strong as possible.</li>
            <li> maybe a quarter size throught my whole head of 3c/4a fine hair).</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and</li>
            <li> It helps smooth out he damage so much compared to not using the product at all (and blow drying).</li>
            <li> Really great for dried out damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have chemically treated hair, it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> For me, I have not found anything else on the market that works so well on my hair in keeping it soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I then took the bag off and put in some plaits to maintain it for the night, I have my satin cap on right now to protect my hair from my pillow, I&#x27;m waiting &#x27;til morning to see what happens, but otherwise you style the way you want to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;d rather just grow out healthy natural hair since I&#x27;ve seen improvement and how damaged my hair really was.</li>
            <li> and I like it very much (from Ulta).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight, not sticky or greasy at all but makes SUCH a difference.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who needs to condition and tame long hair, keeping it healthy and in great condition.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> If I find something I like better than the Chi, I&#x27;ll try to come back here to recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am buying more instantly and giving it to all my friend</li>
            <li> I really like!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve used that promotes healthy ends.  </li>
            <li> I now use this shampoo first, and then the DevaCurl shampoo after.</li>
            <li> I went in the other day to get my hair trimmed and the stylist commented on how shiny and healthy my hair was!</li>
            <li> and I mostly only apply the products to the ends of my hair where the damage is most noticeable.</li>
            <li> 1-2 pumps is more than enough!</li>
            <li> It still works, but I have to use more of it than I used to in order to get the same effect since it&#x27;s so diluted.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for sure if it&#x27;s actually working</li>
            <li> This is my first night trying the product</li>
            <li> I can find better product than this one at a lesser price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you supposed to receive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much healthier and softer when using this product!</li>
            <li> I still have my first bottle (bought almost a year ago, use it once a week maybe one pump or so)</li>
            <li> This product was much more watery and wasn&#x27;t the same formula as the type you buy from the salon.</li>
            <li> and I make sure I always have an extra ready, because I can tell right away</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated, tends to be dry and is very fine</li>
            <li> but less is more!</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to use, but I think I used 4 pumps too many, this didn&#x27;t give me a negative result</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair super soft when I use it</li>
            <li> I have owned a large hair salon, and beauty supply.</li>
            <li> this has been one of my all time fav hair products(&#x3D; it smells great and makes my highly textured african american curly hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li> If the next bottle is back to normal, I will definitely rate 5 stars since it is usually much more effective at protecting against and repairing split end damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for three days and already see a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I did not use too much of it</li>
            <li> I was giving it too much moisture which was ironically drying it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-there wasn&#x27;t much in there to begin with even my mother noticed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> has really damaged hair from dyes over the years</li>
            <li> but I wanted to help them out as much as I could without chopping off all my hair.</li>
            <li> It helps my hair from breaking from use of straight iron.</li>
            <li> The real Redken product does not make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Theyust have filled the bottle with a different product.</li>
            <li> very qick</li>
            <li> Seller needs to be more careful with packaging.</li>
            <li> but you dont need much.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 years straight</li>
            <li> Its really helped my hair from breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has absolutely helped my hair.</li>
            <li> It was fixing my heat damaged hair really well, but I noticed my hair was falling out a bit.</li>
            <li> When I used it consistently, I noted fewer new split ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with armpit length, full, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I am thinking about just throwing away most of my other products now since this alone can take care of it.</li>
            <li> It does smooth the hair down and calm frizzies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Redken Anti-Snap for years and will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to many different hair dressers/salons, and I asked each stylist what they recommended for a product to help cut back on how much my hair sheds.</li>
            <li> I have been battling extremely dry, brittle split-ends for as long as I can remember and this leave-in treatment is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I rarely blow dry it or put any styling products in it, and consistently use leave in treatments, so its not too damaged.</li>
            <li> and I used a high quality conditioner with it, so that&#x27;s not the problem.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Within 2 days my blonde dry hair showed less  fly aways and much softer and managable..</li>
            <li> But I get it, if you use it everyday you will buy more of their product faster.</li>
            <li> have medium long, fine hair, and I use about 4 or 5 pumps right after I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> I have super long hair.</li>
            <li> my hair was like brand new.  </li>
            <li> This is my new staple product for an emergency hair fix.</li>
            <li> I live for this stuff...</li>
            <li> so the air is super dry.</li>
            <li> Super, HIGHLY recommended for those with dry, damaged, brittle hair!!</li>
            <li> I am moving out of the country and have made sure I have enough of this to last me until the next time I am state side.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same luscious feel on my hair compare to the first bottle of anti snap redken I purchased from the salon.</li>
            <li> Its a protein treatment, and too much protein will result in breakage all over again, so I recommend using it about three to four times a week, and two small pumps for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I also use Redken smooth down shampoo, and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on the roots, just from the middle down to the ends- focusing most of the product on my ends &#x27;cause</li>
            <li> so it was easy enough to untangle gently, but if your hair is thick you may need something more, even if yout conditioner says to rinse out, if it&#x27;s typical leaving some in WON&#x27;T kill your hair.</li>
            <li> Now, because I&#x27;ve been using this treatment for so long, I have to take a break, as my hair is healthy again and the protein is now drying my hair, so instead of 2x a week, I&#x27;ll use it 1x a week to once every other week.</li>
            <li> I swim 2 to 3 times a week and have recently had a dying mishap (purely my fault</li>
            <li> Redken Extreme Anti Snap is a great product to have on hand when your hair is weak, breaking, and falling out.</li>
            <li> I am only giving it a 3 because although it is a great product, they fail to tell you not to use it every day.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer breaking, it is soft and bouncy even when I was it myself.</li>
            <li> and it really helps, especially because I&#x27;m growing my hair longer.  </li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair, relaxing it, bleaching it, and stripping it since I was 14 years old</li>
            <li> I need a product that conditions it well, prevents and repairs split ends, and leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> mines curly but fragile and this has helped soooo much</li>
            <li> Not heavy like some leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue after applying it.</li>
            <li> Now that I have been using this stuff for a month, my hair shines like what you see in commercials and it is so soft.</li>
            <li> I lighten my hair every 2 months and Redkin has helped my hair maintain the natural shine and thickness while allowing it to be wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li> Will not waste my money again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try a few more different products to help with my damaged hair</li>
            <li> I will use this product a few more times before making a final decision.  </li>
            <li> By the way I&#x27;m half filipino and black and my hair has been color treated (just to give you an idea of what kind of hair this prouduct is not working on).</li>
            <li> I felt this Redken Extreme Anti-Snap cream was worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly giving you secrets I learned over weeks of researching before investing lots of money in these products.tonight (African American hair should only be washed twice a week, too much more strips NATURAL oils our hair NEEDS) with the Anti-Snap, because the extreme line is geared toward adding protein back to your hair, the second time you wash your hair in a week you should drop the Anti-Snap and switch your Extreme Conditioner for a DEEP CONDITIONER like Organic Root Stimulater&#x27;s Replishing Olive Oil Conditioner.</li>
            <li> : Some women complained that this made their hair stiff and breakable, this happens with more powerful protein treatments like ApHogee&#x27;s Two Step Protein Treatment, if this happens to your hair using this light treatment you have a sensitivity to protein or your hair didn&#x27;t need it in the first place, too much protein is bad, this is why you should always deep conditioner after using one, even a light one like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair its ridiculous</li>
            <li> That might seem excessive but it hasn&#x27;t been above 18 degrees F in a while, and many nights are below zero</li>
            <li> I have tailbone length super straight thick hair.</li>
            <li> I usually put it in my hair after a shower and it helps smooth out and untangle before I brush.</li>
            <li> This is clearly not the real product.</li>
            <li> If you put too much on then your hair becomes crunchy, and if you focus too much on the ends then they get dried out - hair breaks mainly from mid length so focus</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this for thin fine hair though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular Redken product for a few years now, and this is the first bottle I&#x27;ve purchased online as opposed to in the store.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past year and a half and ABSOLUTELY love it!</li>
            <li> So much so my hair grows long instead of breaking!</li>
            <li> I recently went to a new hairdresser and she told me that I needed a balance in my hair-</li>
            <li> I am left wondering if this is a new formula or just a one-time bottling mistake.</li>
            <li> Since using this product I have had no further breakage, and my hair feels so thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> and now I can barely find any!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I added the product in I combed through, put on a plastic bag and added hot rags on top for five minutes to keep my hair shaft open, this is an extra typically done with deep conditioning treatments, but it helped anyway, and my hair shedded less IMMEDIATELY, no joke.</li>
            <li> I use this with the redken butter and smooth down oil,then blow dry.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight strawberry blonde thin/fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This product not only returned a natural looking shine to my hair</li>
            <li> I think the product was old because it left my hair feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Also, after I use this product, because it feels so stiff, I end up using a lot more of other products just to bring the softness back to my hair.</li>
            <li> but this product really helped take the frizz and dryness out vs the other products I have been trying.</li>
            <li> (African American hair should only be washed twice a week, too much more strips NATURAL oils our hair NEEDS) with the Anti-Snap, because the extreme line is geared toward adding protein back to your hair, the second time you wash your hair in a week you should drop the Anti-Snap and switch your Extreme Conditioner for a DEEP CONDITIONER like Organic Root Stimulater&#x27;s Replishing Olive Oil Conditioner.</li>
            <li> , it does not dry my hair out nor weigh it down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a small amount rubbed in after towel drying hair, leaves hair soft, managable, and you did not spend 5 minutes in shower trying to rinse this out of your hair, 1 bottle lasts through many shampoos, because only a small amount is needed each time.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it my hair ends up being really stiff, and in turn my hair breaks, which is really ironic!</li>
            <li> In the morning, my hair is soft and my ends aren&#x27;t dry at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m letting my hair dry naturally w/out hairdryer</li>
            <li> After using several products, I noted that even the best ones can weigh your hair down or just make your hair look downright awful if you use too much of it.  </li>
            <li> I calm down and reached for the Redken Extreme Anti-snap.</li>
            <li> My hair has been damaged since I was a young girl (see my review for Redken&#x27;s Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li> And then continue the cycle, protein treating and deep conditioning once a week on different nights, for extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> And then continue the cycle, protein treating and deep conditioning once a week on different nights, for extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> I mean, at first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working</li>
            <li> It helped my severely, highly dry, damaged hair back from the brink.</li>
            <li> Definitely get this product if you have fuzzy, tangled hair because once you use a dime size of this product on damp hair and let it dry you will feel the difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> So my hair stylist actually recommended this product to me because my hair was very dry and prone to breaking.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair that I get highlighted twice a year so its not too overly processed</li>
            <li> Just a quarter sized amount on my long hair tames flyaways and doesn&#x27;t feel oily, just stronger.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait for my hair to be long again!</li>
            <li> you feel like your hair needs some help being tamed and lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> My hair is very, very long.</li>
            <li> It was dry, brittle and breaking off after all of these treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> now use Anti-snap every time before i Blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It can be a little drying to ethnic hair because one the main ingredients is PROTEIN, so it is recommended that you use a little bit of oil or a creamy leave-in conditioner after using the Anti-Snap.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> I used this after shampooing and conditioning, I put in about 6 pumps, this product is thin and it&#x27;s the first protein I used</li>
            <li> so far her hair is less and less brittle.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it actually repaired my current split ends because I&#x27;m not totally sure</li>
            <li> I used to have very dry hair</li>
            <li> After looking for a long time and using other leave in conditioners we tried this.</li>
            <li> put on a little of your daily conditioner before adding this in</li>
            <li> I will take a little break and come back to this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff literally saved my hair a few years back.</li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair, when i want to leave my hair</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Protein and moisture should be balanced, so lets say you use Redken&#x27;s Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner tonight</li>
            <li> Then we bought the Redken Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I recently tried a small sample bottle of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Redken Extreme Anti-Snap leave in conditioner didn&#x27;t stop my hair breakage after washing.</li>
            <li> Use Redkin Extreme Anti-Snap helped moisturize and add noticible shine.  </li>
            <li> I just went out and got more today because I didn&#x27;t learn my lesson from last time and will be going through several months of correction to get rid of a horrible color I did on myself.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Other than this product I also just use leave in conditioner or glossing cream now along with it.</li>
            <li> I had waist length hair that had to be cut under my shoulders and used this the past 2 years to get it back to the length</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended Redken Extreme Anti-Snap.  </li>
            <li> But it is pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other reviews I&#x27;ve read</li>
            <li> Like the Redken Extreme shampoo, I have used this off and on for some time and it works wonders on the hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to moisture my hair and just use this product every other time and give it another chance.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T slick your hair like a typical conditioner because it isn&#x27;t, if you need extra slip to untangle your hair</li>
            <li> Used on fine, thin, naturally curly over processed hair after having a bad dye job then having it stripped, re-colored, re highlighted a couple times to have this dye job corrected.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to what some other reviewers have said about it drying out your hair, that&#x27;s not necessarily true.</li>
            <li> I needed a leave-in treatment that would not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Watered down...</li>
            <li> This makes my hair behave without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not weighed down or anything either so</li>
            <li> What used to be a ton of hair in the drain is now just a few strands after 2 weeks of anti-snap and one week of the Extreme shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Its not smooth or stronger as other reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> I have a problem where I get too impatient waiting to see if leave in conditioner/hair repair products work, so I buy other products</li>
            <li> I just got a haircut and put this on my ends after I showered, now my hair looks and feels frizzy and slightly damaged.</li>
            <li> My hair was easier to comb through, and less hair fell out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up using even half of the product because it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, 18-20 inch long hair.</li>
            <li> She wets down her hair and put it on everyday before work.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it on my towel dried hair before using the hair dryer, my hair has  a slight friz to it.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been thick, wavy, frizzy, and dry</li>
            <li> A little on the pricey side</li>
            <li> This leave in is a little pricey</li>
            <li> It strengthens weak hair and prevents breakage if used properly.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this to me a few years ago after unending amounts of breakage in my hair and I can tell that using it has kept my hair from breaking, and also helps it grow.</li>
            <li> , I just wasted</li>
            <li> It felt and looked dead.</li>
            <li> and I heat style it everyday</li>
            <li> Down past my waist.</li>
            <li> Other online services come late and sometimes not at all.  </li>
            <li> This batch seems much less thick, almost watery for some reason.</li>
            <li> I have to say,when my hair stylist recommended this product I held out little hope!</li>
            <li> Little or no hair breakage!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel crunch and hard to brush once dried.</li>
            <li> Redken, overall, is a brand I have yet to go wrong on.</li>
            <li> and my hair is no more damaged now than it was before I started bleaching it.</li>
            <li> I would occasionally go pump crazy and put a lot of this in my hair.</li>
            <li> and so I have been forced to stop processing it because of the sodium.</li>
            <li> I thought the keratin treatment would fix my dead and split end problem, but almost seemed to make it worse.</li>
            <li> I am no longer experiencing the split ends and shedding, and my hair has gradually gotten thick again.  </li>
            <li> Dried my hair worse.</li>
            <li> used it in conjunction with the Redken Extreme shampoo and conditioner and these are my go to products if I ever do wrong to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a serious reduction in the amount of breakage in my hair, usually when I&#x27;m bored I will go through my ends and break off the dead parts</li>
            <li> i bought this back in May for my badly damaged hair from bleaching it.</li>
            <li> I used this for my hair after I decided to go blonde, bad idea.</li>
            <li> Always have used this and having a hard time finding it!</li>
            <li> , my stylist was not happy)</li>
            <li> but it just made things worse.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of what it is &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to do, but alas I have used it for almost 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weigh it down or look bad.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin and weak hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too soft (hate that!)</li>
            <li> It was as if the product fused the ends of my hair to the point where it was difficult to get a comb through it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to like this product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> My hair has been shedding like crazy as of late every time I comb it which is bad.</li>
            <li> My hair was breaking badly and I read the reviews for this product</li>
            <li> (I used to bleach it which is really bad for your hair).</li>
            <li> but it was just bad packaging on their part.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s a bad product..</li>
            <li> My hair was to a point that it was commiting suicide and falling out and breaking like crazy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with it tho for one:&lt;br /&gt;-the product had busted and</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have the worst chemical damage to my hair, and I straighten it every day.</li>

            <li> My hair was breaking badly and I read the reviews for this product and I love it! My hair is no longer breaking, it is soft and bouncy even when I was it myself. I am African American and I have chemically treated hair, it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use this leave in product on the ends of my hair strands every time I wash may hair. I have noticed a big difference when I do not use it. I use a very tiny amount maybe a quarter size throught my whole head of 3c/4a fine hair). I use other treatments in my hair (including a creamy leave in) and the combination of this with a lightweight creamy leave in and anti frizz serum results in perfect smooth hair when I use heat or roller set my hair.</li>
            <li> I am African American with relaxed hair and I absolutely LOVE Redken&#x27;s Anti-Snap. My stylist recommended this to me a few years ago after unending amounts of breakage in my hair and I can tell that using it has kept my hair from breaking, and also helps it grow. I have a new stylist who always raves about how healthy my hair is and I contribute most of that to Anti-Snap. Contrary to what some other reviewers have said about it drying out your hair, that&#x27;s not necessarily true. It can be a little drying to ethnic hair because one the main ingredients is PROTEIN, so it is recommended that you use a little bit of oil or a creamy leave-in conditioner after using the Anti-Snap. It is the best product for damaged, breaking, or just weak hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has been damaged since I was a young girl (see my review for Redken&#x27;s Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner 33.8OZ pack for details), I&#x27;m now 16. My hair has been shedding like crazy as of late every time I comb it which is bad. I used this after shampooing and conditioning, I put in about 6 pumps, this product is thin and it&#x27;s the first protein I used so I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to use, but I think I used 4 pumps too many, this didn&#x27;t give me a negative result, I just wasted product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOESN&#x27;T slick your hair like a typical conditioner because it isn&#x27;t, if you need extra slip to untangle your hair put on a little of your daily conditioner before adding this in (my hair is fine so it was easy enough to untangle gently, but if your hair is thick you may need something more, even if yout conditioner says to rinse out, if it&#x27;s typical leaving some in WON&#x27;T kill your hair. I&#x27;ve done it lots with products like Suave Professionals Humectant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I added the product in I combed through, put on a plastic bag and added hot rags on top for five minutes to keep my hair shaft open, this is an extra typically done with deep conditioning treatments, but it helped anyway, and my hair shedded less IMMEDIATELY, no joke. I then took the bag off and put in some plaits to maintain it for the night, I have my satin cap on right now to protect my hair from my pillow, I&#x27;m waiting &#x27;til morning to see what happens, but otherwise you style the way you want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Some women complained that this made their hair stiff and breakable, this happens with more powerful protein treatments like ApHogee&#x27;s Two Step Protein Treatment, if this happens to your hair using this light treatment you have a sensitivity to protein or your hair didn&#x27;t need it in the first place, too much protein is bad, this is why you should always deep conditioner after using one, even a light one like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protein and moisture should be balanced, so lets say you use Redken&#x27;s Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner tonight (African American hair should only be washed twice a week, too much more strips NATURAL oils our hair NEEDS) with the Anti-Snap, because the extreme line is geared toward adding protein back to your hair, the second time you wash your hair in a week you should drop the Anti-Snap and switch your Extreme Conditioner for a DEEP CONDITIONER like Organic Root Stimulater&#x27;s Replishing Olive Oil Conditioner. And then continue the cycle, protein treating and deep conditioning once a week on different nights, for extremely dry hair you can deep condition twice a week WITHOUT A WASH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Please RESEARCH what protein treatments are made for and what to expect, also research how to protect your hair at night the benefits of deep conditioning once or twice a week. I&#x27;m honestly giving you secrets I learned over weeks of researching before investing lots of money in these products.tonight (African American hair should only be washed twice a week, too much more strips NATURAL oils our hair NEEDS) with the Anti-Snap, because the extreme line is geared toward adding protein back to your hair, the second time you wash your hair in a week you should drop the Anti-Snap and switch your Extreme Conditioner for a DEEP CONDITIONER like Organic Root Stimulater&#x27;s Replishing Olive Oil Conditioner.

            <li> I put this on just my ends and it really helps, especially because I&#x27;m growing my hair longer.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too soft (hate that!), it&#x27;s just right.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  I saw a difference in my hair after just one use.  It repaired my damaged hair without making it look greasy.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> My wife has always had brittle hair, she also likes having long hair and the two aren&#x27;t a good match. After looking for a long time and using other leave in conditioners we tried this. It was bought locally but we can save money buying through Amazon, so next time we will. She cut her hair shoulder length and she started using the anti-snap leave in conditioner. Then we bought the Redken Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner. so far her hair is less and less brittle. What used to be a ton of hair in the drain is now just a few strands after 2 weeks of anti-snap and one week of the Extreme shampoo and conditioner. She has tried so many shampoos and conditioners and most were awful. She loves this leave in conditioner because it&#x27;s not oily and her hair feels light after using it. She wets down her hair and put it on everyday before work. That might seem excessive but it hasn&#x27;t been above 18 degrees F in a while, and many nights are below zero so the air is super dry. Redken makes some great stuff and my wife loves it. You would not believe the difference between then and now.  It really works! If your hair is brittle this along with the shampoo and conditioer should put an end to it.</li>
            <li> A lot of people seem to like this product but it did not work well for me.  My Caucasian hair is on the fine side, colored, and somewhat damaged.  This product seemed to increase frizziness and stiffness.  It was as if the product fused the ends of my hair to the point where it was difficult to get a comb through it.  I did not use too much of it and I used a high quality conditioner with it, so that&#x27;s not the problem. I recently tried a small sample bottle of [[ASIN:B003XFKACM CHI Silk Infusion, 6 Fluid Ounce]] and I like it very much (from Ulta).  I&#x27;ll try a few more different products to help with my damaged hair but I will not be buying the Redken product again.  If I find something I like better than the Chi, I&#x27;ll try to come back here to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Redken Extreme Anti-Snap leave in conditioner didn&#x27;t stop my hair breakage after washing. It did dramatically improve the texture of my hair.  I&#x27;m African American with armpit length, full, fine hair.  I washed with Moroccan old shampoo and conditioned it with intense hydrating mask (which I love, love, love) Use Redkin Extreme Anti-Snap helped moisturize and add noticible shine.  I will use this product a few more times before making a final decision.  I&#x27;m not quite sold yet.</li>
            <li> HOLY REPAIR HAIR REDKEN!! I have to say,when my hair stylist recommended this product I held out little hope! I have dyed my hair for YEARS! I swim 2 to 3 times a week and have recently had a dying mishap (purely my fault, my stylist was not happy) so when my hair felt like straw and I couldn&#x27;t do a thing with it, my new best friend told me about this product and I thought I would give it a try! I saw INSTANT improvements! It has only been about two weeks but my husband even commented about how beautiful my hair was looking. This product not only returned a natural looking shine to my hair (NO GREASE HERE Ladies!) but it felt better than it had in years!! I am buying more instantly and giving it to all my friend I really like! THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. Leaves my ends frizzy even though they are healthy. I just got a haircut and put this on my ends after I showered, now my hair looks and feels frizzy and slightly damaged. I have bleached blonde hair, so I was hoping this product would help but it just made things worse. I find that a lot of Redken products don&#x27;t work for me. I reccomend Nexxus Split End Mending cream. I will stick to that one.</li>
            <li> i bought this back in May for my badly damaged hair from bleaching it. my hair snaps off really easily and sheds a lot. ive been using it after i get out of the shower for 5 months granted i dont wash my hair every day since its so damaged but i havent seen any change at all its still breaking off and snapping off. maybe my hair is beyond repair who knows. i also use different deep conditioners too.</li>
            <li> So my hair stylist actually recommended this product to me because my hair was very dry and prone to breaking. Unfortunately, my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to like this product. Every time I use it my hair ends up being really stiff, and in turn my hair breaks, which is really ironic! Also, after I use this product, because it feels so stiff, I end up using a lot more of other products just to bring the softness back to my hair. I&#x27;m sure this product works for someone, but for me it really doesn&#x27;t. By the way I&#x27;m half filipino and black and my hair has been color treated (just to give you an idea of what kind of hair this prouduct is not working on).</li>
            <li> I burned my hair by over bleaching in 2008; this product is the only thing I have used to recover some of the shine and strength to my hair.  Redken Extreme Anti-snap is the best. Amazon delivers my products everytime on time.  Other online services come late and sometimes not at all.  Thank you Redken and Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve used that promotes healthy ends.  So much so my hair grows long instead of breaking!</li>
            <li> Extreme by Redken is about the most perfect shampoo I have ever tried! I am a beauty product junkie, and have tried every shampoo out there. I had been using DevaCurl&#x27;s shampoo (a sulfate free curly shampoo) that was pricey but not quite enough for my hair. I recently went to a new hairdresser and she told me that I needed a balance in my hair- I was giving it too much moisture which was ironically drying it out. She explained that I needed protein to balance out all of the moisture, and protein would make my hair stronger (and healthier). I&#x27;ve only used it for three days and already see a huge difference in my hair. I now use this shampoo first, and then the DevaCurl shampoo after. This adds protein and strength, and the DevaCurl adds moisture and body. Follow with Redken&#x27;s \\&quot;Anti-Snap\\&quot; leave in product and your hair will be feeling  like silk. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying all of the products my hairstylist used, including CIBU&#x27;s Hi-YA! line. Loving my new hair!</li>
            <li> Used on fine, thin, naturally curly over processed hair after having a bad dye job then having it stripped, re-colored, re highlighted a couple times to have this dye job corrected.  It was dry, brittle and breaking off after all of these treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it in conjunction with the Redken Extreme shampoo and conditioner and these are my go to products if I ever do wrong to my hair.  After a bottle of this stuff (again I recommend using the shampoo/conditioner accompanying it) my hair was like brand new.  I just went out and got more today because I didn&#x27;t learn my lesson from last time and will be going through several months of correction to get rid of a horrible color I did on myself.  I feel confident that the redken Extreme line can help keep my hair strong and healthy during the process! It&#x27;s a MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair, relaxing it, bleaching it, and stripping it since I was 14 years old and I&#x27;m 23 now. I got a keratin treatment back in July and so I have been forced to stop processing it because of the sodium. I thought the keratin treatment would fix my dead and split end problem, but almost seemed to make it worse. My hair was to a point that it was commiting suicide and falling out and breaking like crazy! My friend who is a hair dresser told me about this Anti-Snap stuff, so I decided to try it because my hair was getting ever shorter and I was starting to freak out! I have really thick, 18-20 inch long hair. I am part Native American and French/Irish. I first use a Sexy Hair spray leave-in conditioner then I apply the anti-snap concentrating on my ends and then lightly brushing through my roots and strands with the leftovers. It smells really great and does not leave a sticky or oily residue, but always wipe your hands after applying any product to your hair. I have noticed a serious reduction in the amount of breakage in my hair, usually when I&#x27;m bored I will go through my ends and break off the dead parts and now I can barely find any! I cannot wait for my hair to be long again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. A little goes a long way! My hair has dramatically improved in it&#x27;s condition in the past couple months that I&#x27;ve been using it, which is great! I used to have very dry hair (I used to bleach it which is really bad for your hair). It would break off very easily and I always shed a lot. I went in the other day to get my hair trimmed and the stylist commented on how shiny and healthy my hair was! Redken products are great... Esp. this one!</li>
            <li> My hair is very, very long. Down past my waist. I need a product that conditions it well, prevents and repairs split ends, and leaves it soft and manageable. This product is the only one that works for me. I have tried dozens of products and none of the leave in conditioners I have tried work as well as this one. While there are cheaper products out there, they definitely don&#x27;t work as well as this one. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to condition and tame long hair, keeping it healthy and in great condition.</li>
            <li> My hair was breaking off and splitting. Now ot looks great, full and beautiful! I have used this product about 1 month now!</li>
            <li> I have used this conditiner for years. Just a small amount rubbed in after towel drying hair, leaves hair soft, managable, and you did not spend 5 minutes in shower trying to rinse this out of your hair, 1 bottle lasts through many shampoos, because only a small amount is needed each time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Snap for years.   If I don&#x27;t use it on my towel dried hair before using the hair dryer, my hair has  a slight friz to it. I also use Redken smooth down shampoo, and conditioner.  In my opinion it is the best for colored treated hair, that is dry.   I have owned a large hair salon, and beauty supply. Redken Snap was my biggest seller as   a leave in Conditioner. I have not found another product that can compare to Redken&#x27;s Snap.  It gives your hair body, does a bit of contitioning, and you have control over your hair, no matter what type of hair you have.  I noticed some people have said there hair does not fall out when they use Snap!   I don&#x27;t think its from using Snap, although its a great product.</li>
            <li> Diddn&#x27;t see the effects of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and my hair is much healthier. It is shiney, smooth and managable. My hair has always been thick, wavy, frizzy, and dry but this product really helped take the frizz and dryness out vs the other products I have been trying. I usually put it in my hair after a shower and it helps smooth out and untangle before I brush. I have been dying my hair for years and it finally feels like its health is coming back. Now I&#x27;d rather just grow out healthy natural hair since I&#x27;ve seen improvement and how damaged my hair really was. I am thinking about just throwing away most of my other products now since this alone can take care of it. Other than this product I also just use leave in conditioner or glossing cream now along with it. Works great!</li>
            <li> This product definitely improved the strength of my hair. I don&#x27;t need to use it on a regular basis. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight strawberry blonde thin/fine hair.  I love this stuff.  It smells absolutely wonderful.  I do not have damaged hair or distressed hair, I just use it for conditioner.  Sometimes I don&#x27;t use conditioner in the shower, so I&#x27;ll just use this stuff.  I also love to use this if I&#x27;m straightening my hair.  I have used this for many many years, it is great.</li>
            <li> This leave-in treatment is perfection! It helped my severely, highly dry, damaged hair back from the brink. I used a combination of this and Morrocan Oil in my hair and this was the formula that helped me get my hair back on track. I had waist length hair that had to be cut under my shoulders and used this the past 2 years to get it back to the length it was when I got it cut. Now, because I&#x27;ve been using this treatment for so long, I have to take a break, as my hair is healthy again and the protein is now drying my hair, so instead of 2x a week, I&#x27;ll use it 1x a week to once every other week. Could not possibly recommend this product more!!! Super, HIGHLY recommended for those with dry, damaged, brittle hair!!</li>
            <li> I was experiencing a lot of breakage after moving to the hot/dry Phoenix climate.  I needed a leave-in treatment that would not weigh my hair down.  My stylist recommended Redken Extreme Anti-Snap.  I have been using it for about 4 months now.  It is worth every penny.  I am no longer experiencing the split ends and shedding, and my hair has gradually gotten thick again.  Of course I am using this product in conjunction with getting my ends trimmed every 4 weeks.  This is a really good product for hair prone to breakage, i.e. chemically treated hair, as well has curly hair that tends to be on the dry side.</li>
            <li> best product ever for strengthening hair. mines curly but fragile and this has helped soooo much</li>
            <li> It is great for after shampoo use.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soft and easy to comb.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This product smells very good. I&#x27;m disappointed with it tho for one:&lt;br /&gt;-the product had busted and it was all over the inside of the box&lt;br /&gt;-looks like they tried to tape it or something but it was just bad packaging on their part.&lt;br /&gt;-there wasn&#x27;t much in there to begin with even my mother noticed.&lt;br /&gt;-She has really damaged hair from dyes over the years shes tried everything this just wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Redken Extreme Anti Snap is a great product to have on hand when your hair is weak, breaking, and falling out. I just relaxed my hair today, and when i was detangling,  my hair was falling out from the root. It felt and looked dead. beyond repair. I calm down and reached for the Redken Extreme Anti-snap. My hair was easier to comb through, and less hair fell out. No one product can save total damaged breaking falling out hair. This product sure did help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use Anti-snap every time before i Blow dry my hair. This is my new staple product for an emergency hair fix. and every day maintenance. Will keep stocked up.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and works well at the job it is supposed to do.  But it is pretty expensive.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I like it but it&#x27;s way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very dry frizzy hair and this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Redken Anti-Snap for years and will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available. I use it every night on my hair after my shower, 3-4 pumps of product and work it in on the ends and work my way up the length of my hair about 2/3 of the way up. It&#x27;s very light weight, not sticky or greasy at all but makes SUCH a difference. My hair is color treated, tends to be dry and is very fine and I heat style it everyday but thanks to this product it always looks healthy and has great shine. Try this product, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I use redken since I was 7. My mom is a hear dresser and she only carries these brand. The color, shampoo, conditioners, and treatments are amazing. It&#x27;s better to pay couple extra dollars for your hair to look good. Anti-Snap is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ON CURLY HAIR! I had several perms in my life and with this product my curks looked soooooooooooo great! Not only I received compliments on my look, but also the smell. The smell is fantastic. Definitely get this product if you have fuzzy, tangled hair because once you use a dime size of this product on damp hair and let it dry you will feel the difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for good hair products. I just don&#x27;t have great hair. I used to bleach it (I have since gone to darker blonde) so I had breakage and fly aways. This is some of the best stuff I have used, and I have used a LOT. Redken, overall, is a brand I have yet to go wrong on. If you can justify the price in your budget, it&#x27;s worth it! I have fine, straight hair and this did wonders!</li>
            <li> Not heavy like some leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel crunch and hard to brush once dried. Its not smooth or stronger as other reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after having bleached my hair one too many times and was looking for some relief. I know you cannot repair split ends but I wanted to help them out as much as I could without chopping off all my hair. A little on the pricey side I felt this Redken Extreme Anti-Snap cream was worth the price. I use it every time I was my hair and before blow drying and I mostly only apply the products to the ends of my hair where the damage is most noticeable. It helps smooth out he damage so much compared to not using the product at all (and blow drying). Having a bottle around is nice incase you feel like your hair needs some help being tamed and lasts a really long time! 1-2 pumps is more than enough!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure this is great for anti-snap.  I will probably try something else in the line before purchasing this again.  It is best to apply this right after the shower, when your hair is still damp.  I love the smell !</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with your hair always being staticy this is the answer!  This is the only solution I&#x27;ve ever found.  I love it!  I used to work in a beauty supply store and everyone loved this product.  That was 13 years ago and they are still selling this product.  I think that says something.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular Redken product for a few years now, and this is the first bottle I&#x27;ve purchased online as opposed to in the store. This batch seems much less thick, almost watery for some reason. It still works, but I have to use more of it than I used to in order to get the same effect since it&#x27;s so diluted. I am left wondering if this is a new formula or just a one-time bottling mistake. If the next bottle is back to normal, I will definitely rate 5 stars since it is usually much more effective at protecting against and repairing split end damage.</li>
            <li> I used to use Redken for ages long time ago, and my hair looks the best at that time; then for some reason I stopped. As recently my hair get pretty dray I made decision to get Redken back-that was a good decision.  And that product smells nice.</li>
            <li> This product provides the protein I need for my fine hair. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different but for people like me I would definitely&lt;br /&gt;recommend.</li>
            <li> Watered down... Did absolutely nothing for my hair, except make it smell good.</li>
            <li> This product works very good on my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that took the frizz out of my hair after chemo therapy. It is my BFF!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a year and love it. It helps my hair from breaking from use of straight iron. It also leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue after applying it.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair behave without weighing it down. Not oily. Just makes my hair happy. Not even volume, simply healed, for my otherwise frizzy ends.</li>
            <li> I think the product was old because it left my hair feeling greasy. It also didn&#x27;t help with my split ends.</li>
            <li> This is clearly not the real product. The real Redken product does not make my hair greasy. Theyust have filled the bottle with a different product. I will never purchase from this seller again.  It was a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  I was glad to see that Amazon carries it at a much better price than a salon.  I use this on my hair every time I wash it and it keeps my senior hair in really good shape.  I would not like to do without this product.  For me, I have not found anything else on the market that works so well on my hair in keeping it soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> I got my product very qick and this leave  in condtioner is great!! Within 2 days my blonde dry hair showed less  fly aways and much softer and managable.. I will be purchasing from Amazon again</li>
            <li> I live for this stuff... great when growing out your hair and want to keep the ends strong. I put it on every time I get out of the shower and it helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I have been battling extremely dry, brittle split-ends for as long as I can remember and this leave-in treatment is amazing. I use it at night after my shower and put a generous amount on my hair. Honestly, I use like 3-4 pumps of this stuff and just saturate my hair after I comb out the tangles. I don&#x27;t use it on the roots, just from the middle down to the ends- focusing most of the product on my ends &#x27;cause they&#x27;re the driest. I absolutely LOVE this leave-in conditioner! In the morning, my hair is soft and my ends aren&#x27;t dry at all. And it&#x27;s not weighed down or anything either so styling is a breeze.</li>
            <li> this has been one of my all time fav hair products(&#x3D; it smells great and makes my highly textured african american curly hair soft and very manageable. I seall with coconut oil for added moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however the price is such a turn off and the product arrived SCREWED OPENED AND SOME POURED OUT IN THE BOX. Only reason I knocked off a star. Seller needs to be more careful with packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff at Albertson&#x27;s and loved it from the first time I used it. I have really long hair that I get highlighted twice a year so its not too overly processed and I rarely blow dry it or put any styling products in it, and consistently use leave in treatments, so its not too damaged. Now that I have been using this stuff for a month, my hair shines like what you see in commercials and it is so soft. I get so many compliments on my hair its ridiculous and I give all the credit to this product. I am moving out of the country and have made sure I have enough of this to last me until the next time I am state side. I heart Redkin for making this stuff and making it affordable as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have bleached hair and I&#x27;m planning on bleaching it further, so I wanted to make sure my hair was as strong as possible. I&#x27;m no hair expert so I can&#x27;t say for sure if it&#x27;s actually working or if it&#x27;s just coincidence, but I use this every once in a while and my hair is no more damaged now than it was before I started bleaching it. It also makes my hair super soft when I use it and it smells amaaazing. I wish they made shampoo and conditioner that smelled like this so I could use it every time I wash my hair! It&#x27;s the best and the bottle has lasted me forever because I don&#x27;t need to use very much on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first night trying the product and I already can tell that it is doing miracles. I&#x27;m letting my hair dry naturally w/out hairdryer and I can already tell that it is shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other reviews I&#x27;ve read, it does not dry my hair out nor weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a wonderful smell.&lt;br /&gt;I bleached my hair intensively for a year before going back to red and I can say that although it is somewhat \\&quot;pricey\\&quot;, I&#x27;m glad that I decided to try this line.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t lie, I have spent over $50 on just one hair treatment product and it hasn&#x27;t even done anything as wonderful as this product.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely A++++ purchase!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Always have used this and having a hard time finding it! This was great and is just what I have been using</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past year and a half and ABSOLUTELY love it! I lighten my hair every 2 months and Redkin has helped my hair maintain the natural shine and thickness while allowing it to be wonderfully soft. I get compliments all of the time and plan on keeping this product in my life as a permanent knight in shining armor, for my hair :)</li>
            <li> I use this with the redken butter and smooth down oil,then blow dry.Helps with breakage.Good price,fast dlvry.! ! ! !</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I apply to damp hair and then brush, then braid. my hair. Leave in, it has made a HUGE difference in frizz, health, etc....LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on fine distressed hair that is prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> love this product really helps frizzy hair but you dont need much.</li>
            <li> I used this for my hair after I decided to go blonde, bad idea. I have very thin and weak hair and it constantly breaks, until I used this! Now this was years ago since then I have become a hair stylist and I will tell you, THIS IS NOT A CONDITIONER!! Its a protein treatment, and too much protein will result in breakage all over again, so I recommend using it about three to four times a week, and two small pumps for fine hair. This stuff literally saved my hair a few years back. Great product. Just don&#x27;t over do it!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d highly recommend this product! for every hair type! i got thick course ethnic hair and this redken product leaves my hair feeling nice, smelling nice &amp;&amp; tangle free . I use it on wet hair, when i want to leave my hair curly.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m a hair stylist and I recommend this to my clients. they love it</li>
            <li> I have a problem where I get too impatient waiting to see if leave in conditioner/hair repair products work, so I buy other products and then I use them all at once and then I can&#x27;t tell which one is actually working.  That happened to me with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can confidently say the following:&lt;br /&gt;Using this is better than using nothing.  When I used it consistently, I noted fewer new split ends. I can&#x27;t say that it actually repaired my current split ends because I&#x27;m not totally sure if that&#x27;s possible if you aren&#x27;t getting regular haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is PERFECT for thin, fine grease prone hair.  After using several products, I noted that even the best ones can weigh your hair down or just make your hair look downright awful if you use too much of it.  That is not the case here. I would occasionally go pump crazy and put a lot of this in my hair. It didn&#x27;t weigh it down or look bad.  I can see how some hair types would greatly benefit from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all being said, I probably not buy this again. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s a bad product.. I just think I&#x27;ve found better for my hair type.  I really do recommend this for thin fine hair though.</li>
            <li> I have no words to describe this product there only  one thing I can say, is excellent as the first time I used it  leave my hair very soft very shiny , it was a good experience fully recommend..</li>
            <li> This is THE best product I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been to many different hair dressers/salons, and I asked each stylist what they recommended for a product to help cut back on how much my hair sheds. One showed me this and I&#x27;ll use it for the rest of my life. It is that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium long, fine hair, and I use about 4 or 5 pumps right after I towel dry my hair but before I run a comb through it. It keeps my hair detangled and conditioned, smooth, and prevents shedding and breakage. I have been using this for 3 years straight and I make sure I always have an extra ready, because I can tell right away if I forget to use it after I shower. One bottle lasts about 9 or 10 months. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have the worst chemical damage to my hair, and I straighten it every day. Since using this product I have had no further breakage, and my hair feels so thick and healthy. I use this daily and I use A LOT. I have super long hair. This is worth the $$ and better then any leave in product I have tried.</li>
            <li> My hair was so brittle and damaged before I used the line. I mean, at first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working but then it gradually got better. Getting my hair trimmed and cut also helped a lot. Because it is true, once your hair is split, there is no remedy for it, any products that say they fix it are lying. All they do is smooth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a great preventative. I bought the Shampoo, conditioner, mask, anti-snap leave in treatment, and the cat protein treatment. Its really helped my hair from breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has absolutely helped my hair. Put it in after my shower and not only helps soften but after I recently got my hair trimmed a couple months ago, I haven&#x27;t seen any split ends.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Like the Redken Extreme shampoo, I have used this off and on for some time and it works wonders on the hair.  My hair seems to be much more healthy when I use it.  It is also more manageable.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Have used it for a couple of years and won&#x27;t go without it. My hair is very soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and this makes it easy to comb without leaving it greasy at the end of the day</li>
            <li> I am only giving it a 3 because although it is a great product, they fail to tell you not to use it every day. It was fixing my heat damaged hair really well, but I noticed my hair was falling out a bit. My hair stylist told me it was because this product is so packed with protein, that you can&#x27;t use it every day or it&#x27;ll make your hair fall out! Wish they would inform the consumer of that. But I get it, if you use it everyday you will buy more of their product faster. I will keep buying it, but only cause it does work great, when you use it appropriately!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  My hair has never been healthier!  Will get again for sure.  Great service and great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it enough to see if it works for my ends, but it does help ease blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a while... I throw about a tablespoon amount in my hair after the shower. I don&#x27;t like the smell and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my hair. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I can find better product than this one at a lesser price</li>
            <li> This is great to use as a \\&quot;leave in\\&quot; before styling your hair. It smells like bananas to me. It is good to use as a heat protectant as well. It does smooth the hair down and calm frizzies.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have been using it for years. It is good on all hair types and condition. Please check out my full review here:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what happened, i really was looking forward to using it and read great reviews but now after a week or 2 of use my hair is breaking. I really want to know why because everyone talks great things about this product, maybe it was too much protein and i have to keep a balance of moisture and protein. I&#x27;ll try to moisture my hair and just use this product every other time and give it another chance.</li>
            <li> This product is excelent!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the idea of what it is &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to do, but alas I have used it for almost 2-3 weeks and I have yet to notice any difference.  I will continue to use for another month or so to determine whether its going to be a staple in my hair care regime or if I will have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> it does what it says.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly, I&#x27;ve always loved this product, came in a timely fashion, the product was packaged well and there were no damages</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you supposed to receive. Redken have everything you need to make your hair feel healthy. Excellent choose. 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just a quarter sized amount on my long hair tames flyaways and doesn&#x27;t feel oily, just stronger. Love it!</li>
            <li> Did not do as advertised. Really disappointed. Will not waste my money again. Dried my hair worse.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It saved my hair</li>
            <li> I have tailbone length super straight thick hair. It breaks a lot! But after I wash my hair I put 2 pumps on my hair - (mid length and a bit on the ends) it has worked wonders! Little or no hair breakage! If you put too much on then your hair becomes crunchy, and if you focus too much on the ends then they get dried out - hair breaks mainly from mid length so focus there but less is more! It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Hands down best product. I&#x27;ve used it of and on for the last 8yrs. I take breaks from it and I can tell a huge difference in my hair. It&#x27;s so much healthier and softer when using this product!</li>
            <li> Really great for dried out damaged hair.  It helped to repair mine so I didn&#x27;t have to cut it all off!!</li>
            <li> This leave in is a little pricey but it is worth it. It strengthens weak hair and prevents breakage if used properly. A little goes a long way. I have only used 1/4 of the product after about 4 months.</li>
            <li> It was great at he beginning, but I do believe you need to stop after a while since hair can get used to it. I will take a little break and come back to this again. It helped tremendously with split ends, and lasts forever. I still have my first bottle (bought almost a year ago, use it once a week maybe one pump or so)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same luscious feel on my hair compare to the first bottle of anti snap redken I purchased from the salon.I don&#x27;t know if it has something to do with bottle color coding.The one I bought from the salon is darker blue bottle and the one I got from you is lighter blue bottle.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good product for my hair which I have been coloring and straightening for many years. This product has a great texture and smells wonderful on my hair. After I wash my hair, I pump about 3 squirts of this cream into my hand and then rub it all over my head. It is not sticky, smells great and really does seem to strengthen my hair.</li>
            <li> This product was much more watery and wasn&#x27;t the same formula as the type you buy from the salon. I didn&#x27;t end up using even half of the product because it just didn&#x27;t work. I think it&#x27;s fake.</li>
