    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The mirror&#x27;s magnification, quality of the mirror and lighting are excellent.</li>
            <li>so you will look naturally beautiful under all lighting -- even outdoors!</li>
            <li>A refund would probably be best.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome make-up mirror!</li>
            <li>This mirror arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>The 10x side is excellent for grooming as it allows you to see every stray hair.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t do this again, no matter how good the reviews are!</li>
            <li>The lighting is perfect and the pedestal is a good height.</li>
            <li>The dimmable lighting is great.</li>
            <li>LOL I went to the Zadro website just to see if they sold replacement bulbs for the mirror</li>
            <li>She loved it until it began to fall apart.</li>
            <li>THE LIGHT RANGE IS PERFECT.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good customer service.  </li>
            <li>The light is very bright, even in a bright room.  </li>
            <li>Light is very bright and is dimmable.</li>
            <li>If you want to be able to see what is going on with your skin, between the excellent light it gives off and the 10x magnifying mirror, you will see things you may not want to know are there.</li>
            <li>Love this mirror!  </li>
            <li>great look, height, light, and magnification.</li>
            <li>It is a nice quality mirror with no distortion.  </li>
            <li>The light is ok, but not as great as you&#x27;d imagine.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if the height were more adjustable.  </li>
            <li>(and what a shame because it was simply the BEST until it broke!)</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY FOR GOOD QUALITY.  </li>
            <li>and the light never worked again!</li>
            <li>I love the mirror and the weight of it...but want one that works.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I expect better.    </li>
            <li>I love the lighting but my bulb burned out in about 9 months.</li>
            <li>I, too, had done a lot of looking and I am glad I picked this one.</li>
            <li>Beware if you are thinking of shelling out more money because you think \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It was more than I wanted to spend</li>
            <li>I love the surround light.</li>
            <li>The cheap plastic lens that circles and holds the bulb easily comes apart.</li>
            <li>- you can&#x27;t get a nice, crisp, clean image at all.  </li>
            <li>THE ZADRO LIGHT WAS JUST WHAT</li>
            <li>About 10 years ago I bought a light (another brand and cheap) and it still works.  </li>
            <li>- the light still does not work.  </li>
            <li>This was a really good mirror until the light quit working and changing the bulb didn&#x27;t make a difference, is it&#x27;s only an ok mirror now</li>
            <li>I took a chance and purchased the Zadro surround light 10X/1X dimmable sunlight mirror pivoting pedestal.  </li>
            <li>When I opened it, the light covers fell off and would not stay together.</li>
            <li>It has great clear mirrors and a great light, BUT, after about six months the on-off switch works only with a lot of \\&quot;Fiddling\\&quot; and the mirror wants to rest in a horizontal position.</li>
            <li>I was willing to have it replaced with one that works but not so sure anymore.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great light and after internet research, the only light I found that had stellar reviews.      </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good makeup mirror, look no further.  </li>
            <li>I performed multiple searches over the internet trying to find someone that recommended a good makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li>Back to my search to find a good makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this mirror for a week and the light never worked consistently.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it -</li>
            <li>Both sides of the mirror look like they&#x27;ve been brushed on with some kind of mirror paint and are very distorted</li>
            <li>The white plastic around the bulb is very cheap.  </li>
            <li>Same as many of the reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure not going to buy another and have it do the same thing!</li>
            <li>and I was expecting it to last many years.</li>
            <li>I think I transferred some static electricity to the mirror that caused the bulb to burn out (dry winter weather).</li>
            <li>If the Zadro replacement bulb does not work, I will have to see how much it will cost for Zadro to repair this mirror.</li>
            <li>Vastly overpriced and cheaply made mirror.    </li>
            <li>The light bulb recently blew which enabled me to find the Zadro brand.  </li>
            <li>Very well packed by the manufacturer to insure no breakage would occur.</li>
            <li>I searched for a lighted make-up mirror and was very dissapointed when the mirror fell apart when I took it out of the box.  </li>
            <li>It is nowhere near worth the price.  </li>
            <li>For once, I&#x27;d like to be able to sit straight and be comfortable instead of constantly looking down at myself.    </li>
            <li>I wish I had paid more attention to the other reviews.</li>
            <li>My original post is below, but after my mirror starting falling apart and the bulb burned out I have to say</li>
            <li>simple, right?  </li>
            <li>Has new technology that emmulates sunlight</li>
            <li>And the two pieces (front / back) are only held together by cheap platic ticks at two points.</li>
            <li>If you purchase this, be careful of static electricity discharge and/or get an extended warranty if possible.</li>
            <li>The only brand that I could find that got higher reviews was on the Zadro brand.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even get it back together enough to put in the original package.  </li>
            <li>I have now ordered a replacement bulb directly from Zadro to see if the two new bulbs I received from LK were defective (the bulbs were well packaged but may have froze on the delivery truck).</li>
            <li>The mirror is fantastic, but like others, my bulbs did not last long...</li>
            <li>This is a great disappointment.</li>
            <li>Rather it is a form of plastic, so the images are not as clear as glass would have been.  </li>
            <li>NOW MY SISTER CAN PUT ON HER MAKE-UP WITH NO TROUBLE</li>
            <li>The 10x magnification is very distorted and essentially unusable.     </li>
            <li>I am completely astounded at the folks who found this mirror valuable.</li>
            <li>The mirror is bulk, heavy and cheap looking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m receiving emails from Ryan Chang, who is more concerned about filing a claim with UPS than for replacing my broken merchandise.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is not worth the headache unless you purchase from a company with a reasonable exchange policy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it from day one because the light was never bright enough.  </li>
            <li>One side of the mirror is normal and the other is a 10X magnification side.</li>
            <li>Using the magnifying side, I am able to see those eyebrow (and other) hairs that I was missing with my other mirror.</li>

            <li> This mirror (which I initially LOVED) has already fallen apart, just like the other reviewer said it would (and which I could not imagine from such a heavy, expensive mirror!).</li>
            <li> One of the little notches actually did.  </li>
            <li> I was told by seller that we can contact manufacturer, which is not what we expected.</li>
            <li> I fully expected this defective product to be replaced by the seller who would work out the situation with the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Active</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bulbs but with the shipping restrictions and restocking fee it is not worth returning them.</li>
            <li> I, however, am giving it two thumbs down.</li>
            <li> less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 9/08 within less than 3 months it quit working.  </li>
            <li> (A customer service rep directed me to the manufacturer for replacements, but that was a dead end.)</li>
            <li> Not only did my item arrive broken</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago the bulb burned out.</li>
            <li> The plastic cracked and did not fit together correctly.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, the plastic round bit surrounding one side of the mirror fell off and could not be made to reliably stay on again.     </li>
            <li> However, the replacement bulb will cost you $10 and is of a round type which I assume is proprietary.    </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written - I am so compelled because the quality of this product is SO bad.  </li>
            <li> To make things worse, Active Forever has a 15 day period for returns and was less than helpful.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointing to spend this much money on a piece and have it die in less than a year.</li>
            <li> Beware this is not a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Plus the pivoting mirror inside is now so loose that it is impossible to keep in any position she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I cannot get this seller to send me a UPS label to return this broken merchandise.  </li>
            <li> Once these chipped off the mirror was about useless.</li>
            <li> Since I paid $138 with shipping, it is too expensive to just throw out.</li>
            <li> They tried to help, but failed.  </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work at all now!  </li>
            <li> All I can say is buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I had a very difficult time getting it together because I was worried the plastic would break.  </li>
            <li> It is pricey, but if you invest in it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also, the base does not adjust vertically and cannot be raised or lowered to a convenient height.</li>
            <li> Terrible for the price.</li>

            <li> The mirror is fantastic, but like others, my bulbs did not last long... less than two weeks. To make things worse, Active Forever has a 15 day period for returns and was less than helpful. (A customer service rep directed me to the manufacturer for replacements, but that was a dead end.) In my opinion, this is not worth the headache unless you purchase from a company with a reasonable exchange policy. Active Forever is not that company.</li>
            <li> Not only did my item arrive broken, I cannot get this seller to send me a UPS label to return this broken merchandise.  I&#x27;m receiving emails from Ryan Chang, who is more concerned about filing a claim with UPS than for replacing my broken merchandise.  To file his claim, he needed me to give him the order number again, which I did.  Then he wanted me to confirm the address of the person who ordered the item, which I did.  A week later and still no UPS label. Now I just want my money refunded.  Hopefully in time for NEXT Christmas!</li>
            <li> Purchased this mirror for my wife at BB&amp;B. She loved it until it began to fall apart. The cheap plastic lens that circles and holds the bulb easily comes apart. And the two pieces (front / back) are only held together by cheap platic ticks at two points. Once these chipped off the mirror was about useless. Eventually the frame itself cracked and now it only holds together if not touched. Plus the pivoting mirror inside is now so loose that it is impossible to keep in any position she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great mirror out of the box but not made to last.</li>
            <li> Revised review submitted 4/5/09:  This mirror (which I initially LOVED) has already fallen apart, just like the other reviewer said it would (and which I could not imagine from such a heavy, expensive mirror!). The mirror itself started detaching from the frame and now the bulb no longer works. I am AMAZED at this, since its only been in use for about 2 weeks!!  This mirror is JUNK !!!! (and what a shame because it was simply the BEST until it broke!)</li>
            <li> I purchased this Zadro SLV410 make-up mirror in April 2008. A few weeks ago the bulb burned out. I think I transferred some static electricity to the mirror that caused the bulb to burn out (dry winter weather). I purchased two replacement bulbs from LK Technology but neither of them work. I have now ordered a replacement bulb directly from Zadro to see if the two new bulbs I received from LK were defective (the bulbs were well packaged but may have froze on the delivery truck). If the Zadro replacement bulb does not work, I will have to see how much it will cost for Zadro to repair this mirror. Since I paid $138 with shipping, it is too expensive to just throw out. I recommend getting an extended warranty if you can on this unit.    The mirror&#x27;s magnification, quality of the mirror and lighting are excellent. I love the surround light. Other than the bulb problem this mirror has been a tremendous help for my poor eyesight, especially when it comes to tweezing the eyebrow area.    If you purchase this, be careful of static electricity discharge and/or get an extended warranty if possible.</li>
            <li> It has great clear mirrors and a great light, BUT, after about six months the on-off switch works only with a lot of \\&quot;Fiddling\\&quot; and the mirror wants to rest in a horizontal position.

            <li> Love this mirror!  Has new technology that emmulates sunlight so you will look naturally beautiful under all lighting -- even outdoors!</li>
            <li> THE ZADRO LIGHT WAS JUST WHAT MY SISTER NEEDED - IT WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FROM ME.  NOW MY SISTER CAN PUT ON HER MAKE-UP WITH NO TROUBLE SEEING AT ALL.  THE LIGHT RANGE IS PERFECT.  WELL WORTH THE MONEY FOR GOOD QUALITY.  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Worked for a while until my husband dropped it from a very short height. The plastic cracked and did not fit together correctly. The bulb went out after a year and then I replaced it (twice) and the light never worked again! Terrible for the price.</li>
            <li> Vastly overpriced and cheaply made mirror.    Out of the box, the plastic round bit surrounding one side of the mirror fell off and could not be made to reliably stay on again.     One side of the mirror is normal and the other is a 10X magnification side. The 10x magnification is very distorted and essentially unusable.     Light is very bright and is dimmable. However, the replacement bulb will cost you $10 and is of a round type which I assume is proprietary.    I am completely astounded at the folks who found this mirror valuable. I, however, am giving it two thumbs down.</li>
            <li> This mirror is not glass.  Rather it is a form of plastic, so the images are not as clear as glass would have been.  Also, the base does not adjust vertically and cannot be raised or lowered to a convenient height.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 9/08 within less than 3 months it quit working.  Zadro sent me a new bulb (wrong size); sent me another bulb (right size, did not work).  They tried to help, but failed.  About 10 years ago I bought a light (another brand and cheap) and it still works.  This Zadro is so much more expensive and it doesn&#x27;t work.  They want me to buy another bulb (approx. $12).  I can&#x27;t find it locally, but I can order it from Zadro (how convenient).  1/5/13 - the light still does not work.  It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for a week and the light never worked consistently. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work at all now!  I was told by seller that we can contact manufacturer, which is not what we expected. I paid for a mirror that is supposed to work properly and shouldn&#x27;t have to deal with the manufacturer,just a week after purchasing it!  I fully expected this defective product to be replaced by the seller who would work out the situation with the manufacturer. I love the mirror and the weight of it...but want one that works.  Told by seller the product can not be returned without an RA#, but wasn&#x27;t offered an RA#. I have never understood the purpose of the RA#&#x27;s. One sells a product, that doesn&#x27;t work, customer returns it and gets a refund or replacement...simple, right?  It&#x27;s good customer service.  I was willing to have it replaced with one that works but not so sure anymore.  A refund would probably be best. Stay tuned!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great light and after internet research, the only light I found that had stellar reviews.      I have two complaints:    1.) The white plastic around the bulb is very cheap.  I had a very difficult time getting it together because I was worried the plastic would break.  One of the little notches actually did.  For the price, I expect better.    2.)  It would be nice if the height were more adjustable.  For once, I&#x27;d like to be able to sit straight and be comfortable instead of constantly looking down at myself.    I do recommend this product.  The light is very bright, even in a bright room.  A++++  when it comes to brightness!</li>
            <li> Same as many of the reviews. I love the lighting but my bulb burned out in about 9 months. I purchased a replacement bulb which cost over $20 with shipping. It still does not work, so I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s not the bulb, but the lamp itself. I even took the mirror a part to try to fix it, but I have no idea what&#x27;s wrong with it. VERY disappointing to spend this much money on a piece and have it die in less than a year. And they got an extra $20 out of me because the replacement bulb is a specialty one and you can only buy it from the maker of the mirror. Wish I knew what to buy now.... I&#x27;m sure not going to buy another and have it do the same thing!</li>
            <li> Beware this is not a good purchase. Ballast went out and cannot get another one.  I purchased 2 bulbs but with the shipping restrictions and restocking fee it is not worth returning them. $23.00 dollar bulbs, 6.00 shipping to me $14.00 to return to sender and a 15% restocking fee.  I wish I had paid more attention to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> This was a really good mirror until the light quit working and changing the bulb didn&#x27;t make a difference, is it&#x27;s only an ok mirror now</li>
            <li> This is an awesome make-up mirror! The lighting is perfect and the pedestal is a good height. Using the magnifying side, I am able to see those eyebrow (and other) hairs that I was missing with my other mirror. I, too, had done a lot of looking and I am glad I picked this one.</li>
            <li> My original post is below, but after my mirror starting falling apart and the bulb burned out I have to say, I did not get what I paid for. I&#x27;ve only had my mirror for 8 months now and I was expecting it to last many years. This is a great disappointment. Beware if you are thinking of shelling out more money because you think \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;. In this case, you pay for it, but it turns out to be junk!!    This mirror exceeds my expectations. I researched for a while before deciding on the Zadro. It is pricey, but if you invest in it you won&#x27;t be disappointed. The dimmable lighting is great. Although the 10X magnification might make you cringe when you see hairs you didn&#x27;t even know you had! LOL I went to the Zadro website just to see if they sold replacement bulbs for the mirror and they do. I hope I won&#x27;t need a bulb for a while, but in case I do I know I can get one. That was a major concern of mine looking at other makeup mirror reviews. All I can say is buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good makeup mirror, look no further.  I performed multiple searches over the internet trying to find someone that recommended a good makeup mirror.  The only brand that I could find that got higher reviews was on the Zadro brand.  I took a chance and purchased the Zadro surround light 10X/1X dimmable sunlight mirror pivoting pedestal.  If you want to be able to see what is going on with your skin, between the excellent light it gives off and the 10x magnifying mirror, you will see things you may not want to know are there. I had a Conair purchased from a store like Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond for years. I didn&#x27;t like it from day one because the light was never bright enough.  The light bulb recently blew which enabled me to find the Zadro brand.  It was more than I wanted to spend but it is worth it - great look, height, light, and magnification.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a Christmas Gift. When I opened it, the light covers fell off and would not stay together. We had to glue it to make it stay together. Won&#x27;t do this again, no matter how good the reviews are!</li>
            <li> This mirror arrived in excellent condition. Very well packed by the manufacturer to insure no breakage would occur. It is a nice quality mirror with no distortion.  The 10x side is excellent for grooming as it allows you to see every stray hair.  I would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I searched for a lighted make-up mirror and was very dissapointed when the mirror fell apart when I took it out of the box.  I couldn&#x27;t even get it back together enough to put in the original package.  I also paid for expedited service which I didn&#x27;t receive.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written - I am so compelled because the quality of this product is SO bad.  Both sides of the mirror look like they&#x27;ve been brushed on with some kind of mirror paint and are very distorted - you can&#x27;t get a nice, crisp, clean image at all.  The mirror is bulk, heavy and cheap looking.  It is nowhere near worth the price.  The light is ok, but not as great as you&#x27;d imagine.  Back to my search to find a good makeup mirror.</li>
