            <li>Which is good.</li>

            <li>Felt good.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful going on, absorbs well and makes my skin feel fabulous.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased to say this lotion does both.</li>

            <li>I love this lotion!</li>

            <li>Love how it makes my skin looks and feels!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It also has hyaluronic acid in it as well, so make sure to apply over a toner(no alcohol!)</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love!</li>
            <li>A nice sort of powdery-soft feeling.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?:</li>
            <li>This is amazing lotion.</li>
            <li>lotion goes on smooth and feels great.</li>
            <li>This product was truly amazing.</li>
            <li>Once applied to skin it gives your skin a great glow and goes on smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li>It is light, not oily and feels really great.</li>
            <li>Both hubby and I liked the way it felt on our skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this cream at a reduced price for an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>It also kind of burns my face when applied.</li>
            <li>read that in a dermo&#x27;s offfice---asked him about it---and he said that was the honest truth.  </li>
            <li>All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>(but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support).</li>
            <li>My job is to give an honest opinion, not help the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>The product absorbs nicely and does not leave any residue.  </li>
            <li>Nice smelling and lotion is not greasy feeling when applied.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a win for sure:)</li>
            <li>This is nice face cream.  </li>
            <li>And he liked it, kept his skin nice and moist for hours.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and smells nice.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like that kind of scent then this isn&#x27;t for you probably</li>
            <li>Regardless, my opinions and thoughts are always honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li>Nice on my skin and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>Phytochemicals - Effectively prevents premature aging of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>It smells great, isnt greasy (which I love) and doesnt break me out like most lotions do.</li>
            <li>Best lotion Ive used by far!!!</li>
            <li>It has a very mild scent and it is quite pleasant as well.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent (unisex) on the verge of too strong, but it disappears before you would notice it was a problem.  </li>
            <li>I loved this item it had a great scent and the texture is light but not too light</li>
            <li>But this product absorbed into my skin beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Live everything Foxbrim,  this is an awesome moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It didn’t absorb too quickly into my pores so it was great to massage in.</li>
            <li>It does have a more manly scent, kind of like a cologne.</li>
            <li>and it is incredible how much smoother and fuller my skin looks.</li>
            <li>far, I have been very impressed with every Foxbrim product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best moisturizers I have tried out there.</li>
            <li>Came in a bottle not a little tub, great product though!</li>
            <li>This lotion pumps out of the bottle very easily and feels very smooth and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty pricey, but the smell is pleasant and it absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>---please don&#x27;t go up because of great feedback;)  </li>
            <li>Very smooth and emollient.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very important to me that I don&#x27;t put any additives, silicones or parabens on my skin if I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>As we age, we lose a lot of elastin in our skin, so it is very important to find a lotion that helps keep elastin longer.</li>
            <li>This Foxbrim Ocean mineral lotion is very light and absorbs quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very light and does not cause my acne prone skin to breakout.</li>
            <li>This facial moisturizer is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the best lotion I have ever used for my face.</li>
            <li>Also I don&#x27;t need more than 1/2 a pump to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I do like that it does not make my skin oily at all and most lotions do.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and my skin looks well moisturized.</li>
            <li>The product is okay</li>

            <li>I love your products and prices</li>

            <li>I love the smell and feel of this.</li>

            <li>then you already know that I love Foxbrim products</li>
            <li>and I love how my skin feels after application</li>
            <li>Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum is a nice product that claims to help with anti-aging efforts and to boost collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key</li>
            <li>By using this you will notice your skin more supple and softer.  </li>
            <li>It moisturized my face ok.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the quality ingredients that go on my skin.</li>
            <li>and i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if it makes me look better to anyone else, but I think I look better and</li>
            <li>I am in love with this lotion.</li>
            <li>It was perfect as facial lotion to use every morning after washing my face.</li>
            <li>really, really am satisfied with this lotion</li>
            <li>It just smells so good &amp; soaks right in.</li>
            <li>I did notice my skin becoming nice and smooth and glowing with more and more use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for a month and noticed my mild Rosacea getting better!</li>
            <li>Nice and light and easy to put foundation over</li>
            <li>Pretty good lotion.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells pretty good</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and it leaves my skin feeling very refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I use this in combination with your vitamin C Lotion---and the 2 work great together to make this sun-damaged 5 year old skin look glowing once again!  </li>
            <li>I say this because not only does it have a pleasant smell, but it absorbs within seconds and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel greasy!</li>
            <li>The scent is very “cool”.</li>
            <li>Very pleased ;)</li>
            <li>and so far great.</li>
            <li>For the price and natural ingredients, Foxbrim is a great brand.</li>
            <li>I love that this is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients and the fact that it is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is a nice size and well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Only the best natural skin care products backed by our exceptional satisfaction guarantee.</li>
            <li>We are more than an original name and world-class customer service.</li>
            <li>this lotion is not sticky at all , it goes on easy and blend in with your skin.</li>
            <li>Pump is easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li>I think this is a great daily moisturizer for many skin types.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to take on trips.</li>
            <li>They honored their promise of an easy and \\&quot;no-hassle\\&quot; refund policy.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a strong scent.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is too strong for me to use on my face, but I like it as a hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>I did not like the strong smell of this product.</li>
            <li>It wears off some over time, but goes on strong, and smells like a man&#x27;s aftershave.</li>
            <li>The glycerin also makes this ideal for me because when I use this in the mornings and apply my makeup after, it makes my makeup last longer and go on smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing this product again because I think it works fantastic, absorbs quickly into my skin, and leaves my skin feeling so much better than products</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really soft and nice!</li>
            <li>It has a very good texture for my combination to dry skin.  </li>
            <li>These guys at Foxbrim create great quality products; I&#x27;m already a customer for somo of their other products and this one is no different, is also awesome.</li>
            <li>But it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, light weight.  </li>
            <li>found the serum easy to use and it made my skin feel smooth, hydrated and nourished.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super creamy!</li>
            <li>This lotion is super hydrating!</li>
            <li>Even though I received a promo offer for the product, this is my honest evaluation and now that I have used it longer, I have to say it&#x27;s a favorite, so smooth, clean feeling, really like it</li>
            <li>From the very first day I started using it my love keeps getting stonger.</li>
            <li>Love the texture; not greasy; goes on smooth and dries quick.  </li>
            <li>I could feel the difference immediately after applying it to my face the very first time!</li>
            <li>I love this cream so much!!</li>
            <li>Just a tab of this lotion applied in the morning and just before bed is making a huge difference in the skin.</li>
            <li>Did not notice a huge improvement of skin..</li>
            <li>Non greasy, light</li>
            <li>but I enjoy the smell</li>
            <li>It spread onto the skin in a light even manner</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a light non-greasy moisturizer, this is for you.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the look of the product as well as the bottle.</li>
            <li>I think this product is fabulous and truly work</li>
            <li>This lotion actually works great on my face.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this because it&#x27;s paraben free and isn&#x27;t harmful to your skin or clogs your poors.</li>
            <li>a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li>The lotion is great for the face especially after you take a shower.</li>
            <li>moisturizer went on smoothly, without any greasiness.  </li>
            <li>In this case, I just do not feel comfortable putting something so highly-fragranced onto my face.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I was emailed by the company and sent a free replacement.  </li>
            <li>and they send it to me to review for them, especially because I always have great results with their products!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vitamin C - Promote collagen formation while fighting against free radicals</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received both of these products free in exchange for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and cooling on your skin.</li>
            <li>This is a light weight moisturizer for your face and neck.</li>
            <li>Lots of great ingredients in this lightweight lotion...silky, soft, fresh scent...</li>
            <li>I have to say, I&#x27;ve loved every Foxbrim product I&#x27;ve tested so far.</li>
            <li>Smells good and masculine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lotion was light and absorbed easily.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews of people complaining about the smell, but in my opinion the smell is soo good!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin and works fine under my makeup including foundation.</li>
            <li>It is light, non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It feels so clean.</li>
            <li>When I put these products to the test, I do aggressively on my own body even taking the measures to apply very near (almost in)</li>
            <li>Feels like a special treat putting it on my face.</li>
            <li>My skin gets progressively more oily over the course of the day and certain products will speed that up, but that is not the case here.</li>
            <li>The lotion has a light scent and easy on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim has quickly become one of my favorite skin care brands.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and is completely absorbed without any residual greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I liked the natural ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product from AMZ Review Trader at a very steep discount to review, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I am really quite pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This light and fresh lotion will create balanced and nourished skin.</li>
            <li>but overall, good product.</li>
            <li>This light and fresh lotion will create balanced and nourished skin.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this company.  </li>
            <li>You can read the full review on my blog:  </li>
            <li>It’s light and fresh.</li>
            <li>Once absorbed, my face felt so smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this one is especially good for dry and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It soaks right in while leaving my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I did find the fragrance to be a bit strong at first</li>
            <li>It feels great going on, has no heavy oily or greasy feeling at all, and hours later my skin is as smooth as when I first put it on!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend checking the ingredient list just to make sure you have no allergies (such as seaweed), but this is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and no greasy look.</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t have the scent I would probably use it more, but with my sensitive skin I like light or no scents in my products.</li>
            <li>(my sensitive skin people - don&#x27;t let this review make a huge impact on your decision as I have many allergies and could have just had an allergic reaction to the product).</li>
            <li>For being super creamy, it abaorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>You Want More - Expect more from your daily face lotion.</li>
            <li>but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We were lucky to find and purchase this lotion in a promotion for&lt;br /&gt;testing and review.  </li>
            <li>Love how it makes my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the smell of this, though, as it was very strongly scented.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is also very nice like other Foxbrim products.</li>
            <li>Very nice lotion a bit expensive for me but good.</li>
            <li>This product was nice and rich but it didnt last along time.</li>
            <li>so I love it when they come out with something new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just fine, but after years and years of telling myself that fragrances don&#x27;t go above my neck, this just goes against everything I know.  </li>
            <li>I would say the smell is more masculine than femenin</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes your skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It might be worth the price for some people</li>
            <li>I received an email from Foxbrim thanking me for my business as well as further product detail, which was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>but once it dries your face feels fresh</li>
            <li>I like the potential of this one far better than the Foxbrim Vitamin C lotion I just reviewed; it looks to be a nicely beneficial</li>
            <li>I did receive this complimentary in hopes for a review.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>It absorbed well into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I really enjoyed the scent I felt it was a bit too masculine for me and</li>
            <li>My skin absorbed it immediately.  </li>
            <li>Cosmetic products are all about improving ones looks and this bottle/label/name is not pretty, striking or memorable in any way.</li>
            <li>Other than that, good for all types.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could put on makeup right away.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size for the purse.  </li>
            <li>And, let me tell you…if you run it on right after shaving your legs they will feel heavenly!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only gave a 4 star rating because the scent is very strong, like that of men&#x27;s cologne (I am scent-sative to smell).</li>
            <li>it could very easily work for both male and females.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is the consistency.</li>
            <li>After reviewing and testing most of the Foxbrim line of products, I would have to say that this one lotion is my favorite hands down.  </li>
            <li>If you feel pretty you look pretty and using this product does not make me feel pretty or special whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I put it over my argon oil and my face is really looking much better and definitely not dried out anymore.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and can break out easily.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I was very exited to try it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easily absorbed and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This went on light and my face was very soft.  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older my skin seems more sensitive to what I put on it.</li>
            <li>I love all of the products I have ever tried from here, especially this one!</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion!  </li>
            <li>It has a fresh scent and really works well.  </li>
            <li>I most likely will not purchase again because of this.</li>
            <li>this is the first Foxbrim product i have tried that i did not like.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t a fragrance I could detect, which I know is very desirable in skincare products!  </li>
            <li>I use it to help my sunscreen absorb into my skin a bit better as my sunscreen is drying and leaves a white cast since it has zinc oxide in it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a Foxbrim product</li>
            <li>I look forward to trying more of their products in the future !!!</li>
            <li>Like most moisture lotions, I wouldn&#x27;t use on oily or acne-prone facial skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li>moisturizes pretty well.</li>
            <li>, it shows Foxbrim really pays attention to the products they are making!</li>
            <li>At first it reminded me of a bar of soap, but after having a friend smell it, she made me realize that this smells like men&#x27;s aftershave.  </li>
            <li>but I for one was in love from the second</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid - Unmatched natural moisturizer for plump and smooth skin</li>
            <li>When you first put this on it has a cooling effect.</li>
            <li>This first thing I noticed about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product but unfortunately my skin breaks out when using it.</li>
            <li>so one area might be really dry while another area will get greasy very easily.</li>
            <li>This cream is very hydrating and soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other Foxbrim products with great success (most especially the Total Repair Hair Oil, which was absolutely amazing), so I was excited to try the Seaweed Complex Lotion.</li>
            <li>Based on previous reviews I wanted to love product, however the product broke me out significantly.</li>
            <li>,  soft,  clean.  </li>
            <li>I got the Seaweed Complex Lotion for free from Foxbrim for my husband to try; regardless this is our 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Out of all the lotions, moisturizers and creams I have ever tried I love this one I think the most (or at least it&#x27;s up there).</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product but it is absolutely one of the best moisturizers I have EVER used.</li>
            <li>I can note the shea butter that they use on first sniff, pump action is good and distributes product well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other department/natural food store skin care lines</li>
            <li>I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review.</li>
            <li>I wanted a light facial moisturizer for daily wear an Foxbrim&#x27;s Ocean Mineral Lotion is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the cream - it feels good on my face and smells like one of those really expensive French lotions - very fresh with the slightest sweetness to it.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my face extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have made my face more dry,  </li>
            <li>Without the use of harsh synthetic ingredients, this lotion is perfect for those suffering from dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really Do like this product...</li>
            <li>My skin really does show a difference in texture, redness, reduction of pores,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really didnt work well on my skin, acne that I never get started to appear</li>
            <li>I really like how this makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>My purchase felt sincerely appreciated, and not just another</li>
            <li>I am always in search of products that give me great results without irritating my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope it does because I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always really worried about sun damage</li>
            <li>I really like how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone and very oily skin</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it really did wonders in improving my skin, but it did what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will put this disclaimer on here - I am very fussy about scents.  </li>
            <li>haha) scented candle.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Tomoson.com</li>
            <li>To me, this really spoke of the integrity of the company to reach out and do this.&lt;br /&gt;About</li>
            <li>The lotion is really lightweight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely really hydrating</li>
            <li>All I&#x27;m going to say is I was very disappoint in this product.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight lotion, moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I feel like the one pump is too much for my face.  </li>
            <li>It really is.</li>
            <li>and I don’t say that very often.</li>
            <li>I am a certified beauty junkie, and while this brand is entirely new to me, the powerhouse list of natural ingredients sold me right away!  </li>
            <li>So far my skin seems less oily, but more time will be the true test.  </li>
            <li>The scent was pleasant, but just a bit overpowering for me personally, although it went away after about a half hour.</li>
            <li>In conjunction with E.L.F. makeup, not sure which is the culprit, most likely the makeup, but I now have huge ZITS!</li>
            <li>I have received other products from Foxbrim and I love their products.  </li>
            <li>- like I had to use a lot if I wanted full moisturization after shaving or if its really brisk outside.</li>
            <li>skin was soft and elastic after the first use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Specs: From Nature To You - Nature continues to hold the key to true beauty.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I am a Foxbrim fan!  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion especially because not only can it be applied to your body all over as a moisturizer, but can even be applied on your face as we&#x27;ll!</li>
            <li>Of course this is still much more expensive than the costco 2-jar cetaphil cream (which probably lasts me the better part of a year for about $10)..</li>
            <li>The main issue is the fragrance.</li>
            <li>One or two pumps of the product is plenty to evenly apply over your entire face, and it absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with the brand and because I like their other products I was willing to give this product</li>
            <li>Decent size bottle.  </li>
            <li>This makes my face so soft and smooth especially in combination with a face mask.</li>
            <li>It feels very light, but keeps my face moisturized through most of the day (at the very least, until I get home from work).&lt;br /&gt;For perspective, my skin is quite sensitive, but I have tried a myriad of products for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>skin is very sensitive...very, very sensitive.</li>
            <li>and I really like it so far!  </li>
            <li>This lotion feels high quality</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest to add this to your anti aging routine.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It absorbed into my skin quite quickly, allowing me to continue with my daily facial routine without needing to wait around.  </li>
            <li>I have to say so far this lotion has not irritated my skin at all!!</li>
            <li>and I read that it was normal.  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>so good knowing that the anti-radiation properties in this lotion will protect from sun damage and helps boost collagen production while filling in existing wrinkles and restores firmness to tired and worn skin.</li>
            <li>It is a nice thick cream to cover and not runny at all.</li>
            <li>so I rarely try new facial products.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin and so many facial products</li>
            <li>This is coming from someone that has paid well over the $100 price point for single skin care product and pays more for things I can actually pronounce on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Organic Spirulina (Blue Green Algae) - Reduce skin inflammation while boosting antioxidants and defending against free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;+ Hyaluronic Acid - Unmatched natural moisturizer for plump and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also use it as a quick moisturizer during the day if I see a dry patch somewhere.  </li>
            <li>Very natural,  I like that.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, it is not greasy at all, just leaves your face feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>So, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Ever since I became pregnant with my first child I have been very sensitive to scent (to the point where I had to give up cologne for a few years).</li>
            <li>It also arrived early!</li>
            <li>But I started a new skin routine and wanted to incorporate a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I found that it helped calm my dry winter skin with in two uses.</li>
            <li>It does have a strange light burning sensation when you initially start using it, but that has faded</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed is that this lotion definitely had a masculine smell to it once dispensed.</li>
            <li>I was also stoked when Foxbrim sent me their Seaweed Complex Lotion to review, as I have been looking for a new moisturizer ever since leaving my last favorite one with my mom!  </li>
            <li>I am very surprised that something that is all natural can have this level of fragrance in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well I was a little worried about purchasing another lotion because like many other people out there I spent so much money on skin care and pretty much things just end up in the garbage.</li>
            <li>Foxbrim Ocean Mineral Lotion contains favorite ingredients of mine including:  Aloe, hyraluronic acid, jojoba, and shea butter as well as some promising new (to me)  wonders such as:  Irish Moss, Blue Green Algae, and Yarrow (a very beneficial plant, but, I&#x27;ve never seen it in skincare before).</li>
            <li>The lotion itself was a white color with a normal lotion texture, not to runny but not thick like a cream.</li>
            <li>It is recommended that you use a moisturizer on top of serums with Hyaluronic Acid to seal in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seaweed Complex Lotion is also power packed with helpful ingredients to help keep your skin looking young and</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And, there was no heavy or greasy feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely for daytime use, as I prefer a much heavier cream for night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it did not bother my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s crafted with all natural and organic products in the USA, not tested on animals, and can be used on all skin types.  </li>
            <li>Applied a few times a week prior to bed, and I was pleased with how well it kept my skin hydrated without any irritation or discomfort, despite how sensitive my skin is.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>My husband even noticed how soft my face was and that is saying something.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite a tiny quantity.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The product is acceptable and has not caused any issues with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(joking----you got to go naturally---</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I enjoy using it everyday in my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>I did my research on natural moisturizers and found Foxbrim&#x27;s Ocean Mineral Lotion.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this did not cause any rashes or breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It has a neutral smell which I like since I am sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>The natural and organic ingredients enticed me to try it as a means of reducing the natural oils my skin produces</li>
            <li>After my week of experimentation of both my husband and I, I can admittedly say, Foxbrim is a contender in the natural skin care market.  </li>
            <li>Made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>made my skin feel really soft and</li>
            <li>The smell goes away after it completely dries.</li>
            <li>My skin might be too sensitive for this product.  </li>
            <li>It has slightly masculine scent</li>
            <li>I am going to go back to all natural, thick moisturizers like Amazing Face or stuff from Organic Fields of Heather.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combo skin</li>
            <li>The scent is a little unique, but I don&#x27;t find it off-putting or masculine at all.</li>
            <li>I was given a big discount for agreeing to review this lotion, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t be honest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to stay as smooth as possible for as long as I possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream itself is pretty thick but actually thins as you smooth it over your face.</li>
            <li>I have dry, tight skin and with most moisturizers I feel the need to reapply.</li>
            <li>Definitely bang for buck and a decent night creme.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it improved my skin, but it definitely feels better on my face than a lot of moisturizers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really, the only criticism I can offer is that this is a highly scented lotion.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for new lotions and moisturizers to try, especially with natural ingredients, so I was looking forward to giving this product a try.</li>
            <li>but when I apply moisturizer daily I break out usually - not with this though!  </li>
            <li>Will continue to keep your products on hand---as long as the prices stay reasonable :0  </li>
            <li>Hubby will continue to use the product until it is gone, but he currently does not see any benefits to using it over the lotion he normally uses.</li>
            <li>After being diagnosed with a thyroid issue and having to take daily medication that dried out my skin, I had to discontinue using a name brand independent product I had used for 15 years because I needed more moisture.</li>
            <li>importantly, I have been applying a little of this lotion on my elbows and can&#x27;t believe the change in just a short time.</li>
            <li>Seemed a little more synthetic than I expected and also</li>
            <li>Foxbrimâ€™s Seaweed Complex lotion boosts collagen production while leaving your skin clear, smooth, and youthful glow.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is silky and not too thick and it leaves my face smooth, soft and oil-free through out the day.</li>
            <li>It is one that you pump out and half a pumps worth.</li>
            <li>It left my face very soft and feeling supple.  </li>
            <li>getting uneven dry patches and occasional acne ( which i typically do not get) love everything else ive tried, but this one is not for me.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, anti-radiation properties found in this complex protect from daily and long term sun damage and progressive aging of the skin.</li>
            <li>I have not seen major improvement in my skin, but itâ€™s a lotion that keeps my skin moisturized, itâ€™s light-weight, and isnâ€™t oily.</li>
            <li>I been using it for of weeks now, will continue to use it to see if it make major changes.</li>
            <li>would be interested in trying their other products.</li>
            <li>I like the way my face feels right after applying but within a few minutes it&#x27;s no longer soft.</li>
            <li>Lots of good stuff in it too, including aloe, glycerin, sunflower oil, hyaluronic acid, blue green algae, Irish moss, yarrow, shea butter, Jojoba oil, vitamin B5, green tea.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes a long way and comes in a decent sized bottle.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a thick luxurious feel, but absorbs quickly and did not leave my oily, acne-prone skin feeling greasy or irritated at all!  </li>
            <li>primarily use the Seaweed Complex Lotion as part of my nighttime skincare routine</li>
            <li>which is always something I personally look for in a lotion because my skin is sensitive and combo skin</li>
            <li>The lotion does not really have much of a fragrance, which I like.</li>
            <li>I may only be 25, but I need to start using anti-aging products now so that I don&#x27;t get wrinkles too early.</li>
            <li>We utilize only premium ingredients in our natural and organic products.</li>
            <li>This Ocean Mineral Lotion sinks in fast while still being hydrating.</li>
            <li>It left my hands feeling soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>If you suffer from dry skin like I do during the colder months I would highly suggest you give this a try.</li>
            <li>concern was that this small container would not last long enough, but I was again pleasantly surprised that it lasted about 8 weeks using the recommended amount of a dime size, twice a day (I was actually probably using more than a &amp;#34;dime&amp;#34; size).</li>
            <li>I was probably expecting too much based on the other rave reviews.  </li>
            <li>It has a subtle light scent.</li>
            <li>I recently tried their Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum and their Seaweed Complex Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amino Complex - Effective skin repair treatment to keep skin firm</li>
            <li>aquaphor is too greasy feeling and leaves a visible &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;, cetaphil is very very mild and lasts only a couple hours on me, aveeno last a little longer but some of them (to my surprise) irritate my skin (and aveeno still does not last as long as this).&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>at first it is a little greasy</li>
            <li>It does not leave my skin looking greasy, therefore I use this during the day and other moisturizers (such as shea butter) at night, since they make my skin very shiny.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned, out of the box, that the description said &#x27;serum&#x27; as it was lotion I really needed.</li>
            <li>The only real comment i have is, that once you pump it out, its not a clean close.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased to say this lotion does both.</li>

            <li> I love this lotion!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It also has hyaluronic acid in it as well, so make sure to apply over a toner(no alcohol!)</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love!</li>
            <li> A nice sort of powdery-soft feeling.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?:</li>
            <li> This is amazing lotion.</li>
            <li> lotion goes on smooth and feels great.</li>
            <li> This product was truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Once applied to skin it gives your skin a great glow and goes on smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> It is light, not oily and feels really great.</li>
            <li> Both hubby and I liked the way it felt on our skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this cream at a reduced price for an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> It also kind of burns my face when applied.</li>
            <li> read that in a dermo&#x27;s offfice---asked him about it---and he said that was the honest truth.  </li>
            <li> All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support).</li>
            <li> My job is to give an honest opinion, not help the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The product absorbs nicely and does not leave any residue.  </li>
            <li> Nice smelling and lotion is not greasy feeling when applied.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a win for sure:)</li>
            <li> This is nice face cream.  </li>
            <li> And he liked it, kept his skin nice and moist for hours.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and smells nice.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like that kind of scent then this isn&#x27;t for you probably</li>
            <li> Regardless, my opinions and thoughts are always honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> Nice on my skin and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Phytochemicals - Effectively prevents premature aging of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> It smells great, isnt greasy (which I love) and doesnt break me out like most lotions do.</li>
            <li> Best lotion Ive used by far!!!</li>
            <li> It has a very mild scent and it is quite pleasant as well.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent (unisex) on the verge of too strong, but it disappears before you would notice it was a problem.  </li>
            <li> I loved this item it had a great scent and the texture is light but not too light</li>
            <li> But this product absorbed into my skin beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Live everything Foxbrim,  this is an awesome moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It didn’t absorb too quickly into my pores so it was great to massage in.</li>
            <li> It does have a more manly scent, kind of like a cologne.</li>
            <li> and it is incredible how much smoother and fuller my skin looks.</li>
            <li> far, I have been very impressed with every Foxbrim product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best moisturizers I have tried out there.</li>
            <li> Came in a bottle not a little tub, great product though!</li>
            <li> This lotion pumps out of the bottle very easily and feels very smooth and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty pricey, but the smell is pleasant and it absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> ---please don&#x27;t go up because of great feedback;)  </li>
            <li> Very smooth and emollient.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very important to me that I don&#x27;t put any additives, silicones or parabens on my skin if I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> As we age, we lose a lot of elastin in our skin, so it is very important to find a lotion that helps keep elastin longer.</li>
            <li> This Foxbrim Ocean mineral lotion is very light and absorbs quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very light and does not cause my acne prone skin to breakout.</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely the best lotion I have ever used for my face.</li>
            <li> Also I don&#x27;t need more than 1/2 a pump to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I do like that it does not make my skin oily at all and most lotions do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and my skin looks well moisturized.</li>
            <li> The product is okay</li>

            <li> I love the smell and feel of this.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency and the lack of scents involved.</li>

            <li> I love scented products and I absolutely love the smell of this one.</li>
            <li> Think like the scent of most mens gillette products.</li>

            <li> then you already know that I love Foxbrim products</li>
            <li> and I love how my skin feels after application</li>
            <li> Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum is a nice product that claims to help with anti-aging efforts and to boost collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key</li>
            <li> By using this you will notice your skin more supple and softer.  </li>
            <li> It moisturized my face ok.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the quality ingredients that go on my skin.</li>
            <li> and i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it makes me look better to anyone else, but I think I look better and</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion.</li>
            <li> It was perfect as facial lotion to use every morning after washing my face.</li>
            <li> really, really am satisfied with this lotion</li>
            <li> It just smells so good &amp; soaks right in.</li>
            <li> I did notice my skin becoming nice and smooth and glowing with more and more use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a month and noticed my mild Rosacea getting better!</li>
            <li> Nice and light and easy to put foundation over</li>
            <li> Pretty good lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells pretty good</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and it leaves my skin feeling very refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I use this in combination with your vitamin C Lotion---and the 2 work great together to make this sun-damaged 5 year old skin look glowing once again!  </li>
            <li> I say this because not only does it have a pleasant smell, but it absorbs within seconds and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel greasy!</li>
            <li> The scent is very “cool”.</li>
            <li> Very pleased ;)</li>
            <li> and so far great.</li>
            <li> For the price and natural ingredients, Foxbrim is a great brand.</li>
            <li> I love that this is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients and the fact that it is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a nice size and well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Only the best natural skin care products backed by our exceptional satisfaction guarantee.</li>
            <li> We are more than an original name and world-class customer service.</li>
            <li> this lotion is not sticky at all , it goes on easy and blend in with your skin.</li>
            <li> Pump is easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li> I think this is a great daily moisturizer for many skin types.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to take on trips.</li>
            <li> They honored their promise of an easy and \\&quot;no-hassle\\&quot; refund policy.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a strong scent.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is too strong for me to use on my face, but I like it as a hand lotion.  </li>
            <li> I did not like the strong smell of this product.</li>
            <li> It wears off some over time, but goes on strong, and smells like a man&#x27;s aftershave.</li>
            <li> The glycerin also makes this ideal for me because when I use this in the mornings and apply my makeup after, it makes my makeup last longer and go on smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing this product again because I think it works fantastic, absorbs quickly into my skin, and leaves my skin feeling so much better than products</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really soft and nice!</li>
            <li> It has a very good texture for my combination to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> These guys at Foxbrim create great quality products; I&#x27;m already a customer for somo of their other products and this one is no different, is also awesome.</li>
            <li> But it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, light weight.  </li>
            <li> found the serum easy to use and it made my skin feel smooth, hydrated and nourished.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super creamy!</li>
            <li> This lotion is super hydrating!</li>
            <li> Even though I received a promo offer for the product, this is my honest evaluation and now that I have used it longer, I have to say it&#x27;s a favorite, so smooth, clean feeling, really like it</li>
            <li> From the very first day I started using it my love keeps getting stonger.</li>
            <li> Love the texture; not greasy; goes on smooth and dries quick.  </li>
            <li> I could feel the difference immediately after applying it to my face the very first time!</li>
            <li> I love this cream so much!!</li>
            <li> Just a tab of this lotion applied in the morning and just before bed is making a huge difference in the skin.</li>
            <li> Did not notice a huge improvement of skin..</li>
            <li> Non greasy, light</li>
            <li> but I enjoy the smell</li>
            <li> It spread onto the skin in a light even manner</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a light non-greasy moisturizer, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the look of the product as well as the bottle.</li>
            <li> I think this product is fabulous and truly work</li>
            <li> This lotion actually works great on my face.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this because it&#x27;s paraben free and isn&#x27;t harmful to your skin or clogs your poors.</li>
            <li> a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> The lotion is great for the face especially after you take a shower.</li>
            <li> moisturizer went on smoothly, without any greasiness.  </li>
            <li> In this case, I just do not feel comfortable putting something so highly-fragranced onto my face.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I was emailed by the company and sent a free replacement.  </li>
            <li> and they send it to me to review for them, especially because I always have great results with their products!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vitamin C - Promote collagen formation while fighting against free radicals</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received both of these products free in exchange for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and cooling on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a light weight moisturizer for your face and neck.</li>
            <li> Lots of great ingredients in this lightweight lotion...silky, soft, fresh scent...</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;ve loved every Foxbrim product I&#x27;ve tested so far.</li>
            <li> Smells good and masculine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lotion was light and absorbed easily.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews of people complaining about the smell, but in my opinion the smell is soo good!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into my skin and works fine under my makeup including foundation.</li>
            <li> It is light, non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It feels so clean.</li>
            <li> When I put these products to the test, I do aggressively on my own body even taking the measures to apply very near (almost in)</li>
            <li> Feels like a special treat putting it on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin gets progressively more oily over the course of the day and certain products will speed that up, but that is not the case here.</li>
            <li> The lotion has a light scent and easy on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim has quickly become one of my favorite skin care brands.</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and is completely absorbed without any residual greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I liked the natural ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product from AMZ Review Trader at a very steep discount to review, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I am really quite pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> This light and fresh lotion will create balanced and nourished skin.</li>
            <li> but overall, good product.</li>
            <li> This light and fresh lotion will create balanced and nourished skin.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this company.  </li>
            <li> You can read the full review on my blog:  </li>
            <li> It’s light and fresh.</li>
            <li> Once absorbed, my face felt so smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this one is especially good for dry and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It soaks right in while leaving my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I did find the fragrance to be a bit strong at first</li>
            <li> It feels great going on, has no heavy oily or greasy feeling at all, and hours later my skin is as smooth as when I first put it on!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend checking the ingredient list just to make sure you have no allergies (such as seaweed), but this is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and no greasy look.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t have the scent I would probably use it more, but with my sensitive skin I like light or no scents in my products.</li>
            <li> (my sensitive skin people - don&#x27;t let this review make a huge impact on your decision as I have many allergies and could have just had an allergic reaction to the product).</li>
            <li> For being super creamy, it abaorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> You Want More - Expect more from your daily face lotion.</li>
            <li> but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We were lucky to find and purchase this lotion in a promotion for&lt;br /&gt;testing and review.  </li>
            <li> Love how it makes my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the smell of this, though, as it was very strongly scented.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is also very nice like other Foxbrim products.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion a bit expensive for me but good.</li>
            <li> This product was nice and rich but it didnt last along time.</li>
            <li> so I love it when they come out with something new</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just fine, but after years and years of telling myself that fragrances don&#x27;t go above my neck, this just goes against everything I know.  </li>
            <li> I would say the smell is more masculine than femenin</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes your skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It might be worth the price for some people</li>
            <li> I received an email from Foxbrim thanking me for my business as well as further product detail, which was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> but once it dries your face feels fresh</li>
            <li> I like the potential of this one far better than the Foxbrim Vitamin C lotion I just reviewed; it looks to be a nicely beneficial</li>
            <li> I did receive this complimentary in hopes for a review.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> It absorbed well into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I really enjoyed the scent I felt it was a bit too masculine for me and</li>
            <li> My skin absorbed it immediately.  </li>
            <li> Cosmetic products are all about improving ones looks and this bottle/label/name is not pretty, striking or memorable in any way.</li>
            <li> Other than that, good for all types.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could put on makeup right away.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size for the purse.  </li>
            <li> And, let me tell you…if you run it on right after shaving your legs they will feel heavenly!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only gave a 4 star rating because the scent is very strong, like that of men&#x27;s cologne (I am scent-sative to smell).</li>
            <li> it could very easily work for both male and females.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is the consistency.</li>
            <li> After reviewing and testing most of the Foxbrim line of products, I would have to say that this one lotion is my favorite hands down.  </li>
            <li> If you feel pretty you look pretty and using this product does not make me feel pretty or special whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I put it over my argon oil and my face is really looking much better and definitely not dried out anymore.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and can break out easily.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I was very exited to try it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easily absorbed and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This went on light and my face was very soft.  </li>
            <li> As I have gotten older my skin seems more sensitive to what I put on it.</li>
            <li> I love all of the products I have ever tried from here, especially this one!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion!  </li>
            <li> It has a fresh scent and really works well.  </li>
            <li> I most likely will not purchase again because of this.</li>
            <li> this is the first Foxbrim product i have tried that i did not like.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a fragrance I could detect, which I know is very desirable in skincare products!  </li>
            <li> I use it to help my sunscreen absorb into my skin a bit better as my sunscreen is drying and leaves a white cast since it has zinc oxide in it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a Foxbrim product</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying more of their products in the future !!!</li>
            <li> Like most moisture lotions, I wouldn&#x27;t use on oily or acne-prone facial skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li> moisturizes pretty well.</li>
            <li> , it shows Foxbrim really pays attention to the products they are making!</li>
            <li> At first it reminded me of a bar of soap, but after having a friend smell it, she made me realize that this smells like men&#x27;s aftershave.  </li>
            <li> but I for one was in love from the second</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid - Unmatched natural moisturizer for plump and smooth skin</li>
            <li> When you first put this on it has a cooling effect.</li>
            <li> This first thing I noticed about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product but unfortunately my skin breaks out when using it.</li>
            <li> so one area might be really dry while another area will get greasy very easily.</li>
            <li> This cream is very hydrating and soaks right in.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other Foxbrim products with great success (most especially the Total Repair Hair Oil, which was absolutely amazing), so I was excited to try the Seaweed Complex Lotion.</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews I wanted to love product, however the product broke me out significantly.</li>
            <li> ,  soft,  clean.  </li>
            <li> I got the Seaweed Complex Lotion for free from Foxbrim for my husband to try; regardless this is our 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Out of all the lotions, moisturizers and creams I have ever tried I love this one I think the most (or at least it&#x27;s up there).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but it is absolutely one of the best moisturizers I have EVER used.</li>
            <li> I can note the shea butter that they use on first sniff, pump action is good and distributes product well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other department/natural food store skin care lines</li>
            <li> I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review.</li>
            <li> I wanted a light facial moisturizer for daily wear an Foxbrim&#x27;s Ocean Mineral Lotion is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the cream - it feels good on my face and smells like one of those really expensive French lotions - very fresh with the slightest sweetness to it.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my face extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have made my face more dry,  </li>
            <li> Without the use of harsh synthetic ingredients, this lotion is perfect for those suffering from dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really Do like this product...</li>
            <li> My skin really does show a difference in texture, redness, reduction of pores,</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It really didnt work well on my skin, acne that I never get started to appear</li>
            <li> I really like how this makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> My purchase felt sincerely appreciated, and not just another</li>
            <li> I am always in search of products that give me great results without irritating my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope it does because I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always really worried about sun damage</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone and very oily skin</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it really did wonders in improving my skin, but it did what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will put this disclaimer on here - I am very fussy about scents.  </li>
            <li> haha) scented candle.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Tomoson.com</li>
            <li> To me, this really spoke of the integrity of the company to reach out and do this.&lt;br /&gt;About</li>
            <li> The lotion is really lightweight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely really hydrating</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;m going to say is I was very disappoint in this product.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight lotion, moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I feel like the one pump is too much for my face.  </li>
            <li> It really is.</li>
            <li> and I don’t say that very often.</li>
            <li> I am a certified beauty junkie, and while this brand is entirely new to me, the powerhouse list of natural ingredients sold me right away!  </li>
            <li> So far my skin seems less oily, but more time will be the true test.  </li>
            <li> The scent was pleasant, but just a bit overpowering for me personally, although it went away after about a half hour.</li>
            <li> In conjunction with E.L.F. makeup, not sure which is the culprit, most likely the makeup, but I now have huge ZITS!</li>
            <li> I have received other products from Foxbrim and I love their products.  </li>
            <li> - like I had to use a lot if I wanted full moisturization after shaving or if its really brisk outside.</li>
            <li> skin was soft and elastic after the first use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Specs: From Nature To You - Nature continues to hold the key to true beauty.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I am a Foxbrim fan!  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion especially because not only can it be applied to your body all over as a moisturizer, but can even be applied on your face as we&#x27;ll!</li>
            <li> Of course this is still much more expensive than the costco 2-jar cetaphil cream (which probably lasts me the better part of a year for about $10)..</li>
            <li> The main issue is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> One or two pumps of the product is plenty to evenly apply over your entire face, and it absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with the brand and because I like their other products I was willing to give this product</li>
            <li> Decent size bottle.  </li>
            <li> This makes my face so soft and smooth especially in combination with a face mask.</li>
            <li> It feels very light, but keeps my face moisturized through most of the day (at the very least, until I get home from work).&lt;br /&gt;For perspective, my skin is quite sensitive, but I have tried a myriad of products for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> skin is very sensitive...very, very sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I really like it so far!  </li>
            <li> This lotion feels high quality</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest to add this to your anti aging routine.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It absorbed into my skin quite quickly, allowing me to continue with my daily facial routine without needing to wait around.  </li>
            <li> I have to say so far this lotion has not irritated my skin at all!!</li>
            <li> and I read that it was normal.  </li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> so good knowing that the anti-radiation properties in this lotion will protect from sun damage and helps boost collagen production while filling in existing wrinkles and restores firmness to tired and worn skin.</li>
            <li> It is a nice thick cream to cover and not runny at all.</li>
            <li> so I rarely try new facial products.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and so many facial products</li>
            <li> This is coming from someone that has paid well over the $100 price point for single skin care product and pays more for things I can actually pronounce on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Organic Spirulina (Blue Green Algae) - Reduce skin inflammation while boosting antioxidants and defending against free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;+ Hyaluronic Acid - Unmatched natural moisturizer for plump and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also use it as a quick moisturizer during the day if I see a dry patch somewhere.  </li>
            <li> Very natural,  I like that.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> , it is not greasy at all, just leaves your face feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> So, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Ever since I became pregnant with my first child I have been very sensitive to scent (to the point where I had to give up cologne for a few years).</li>
            <li> It also arrived early!</li>
            <li> But I started a new skin routine and wanted to incorporate a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I found that it helped calm my dry winter skin with in two uses.</li>
            <li> It does have a strange light burning sensation when you initially start using it, but that has faded</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed is that this lotion definitely had a masculine smell to it once dispensed.</li>
            <li> I was also stoked when Foxbrim sent me their Seaweed Complex Lotion to review, as I have been looking for a new moisturizer ever since leaving my last favorite one with my mom!  </li>
            <li> I am very surprised that something that is all natural can have this level of fragrance in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well I was a little worried about purchasing another lotion because like many other people out there I spent so much money on skin care and pretty much things just end up in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Foxbrim Ocean Mineral Lotion contains favorite ingredients of mine including:  Aloe, hyraluronic acid, jojoba, and shea butter as well as some promising new (to me)  wonders such as:  Irish Moss, Blue Green Algae, and Yarrow (a very beneficial plant, but, I&#x27;ve never seen it in skincare before).</li>
            <li> The lotion itself was a white color with a normal lotion texture, not to runny but not thick like a cream.</li>
            <li> It is recommended that you use a moisturizer on top of serums with Hyaluronic Acid to seal in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seaweed Complex Lotion is also power packed with helpful ingredients to help keep your skin looking young and</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And, there was no heavy or greasy feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely for daytime use, as I prefer a much heavier cream for night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it did not bother my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s crafted with all natural and organic products in the USA, not tested on animals, and can be used on all skin types.  </li>
            <li> Applied a few times a week prior to bed, and I was pleased with how well it kept my skin hydrated without any irritation or discomfort, despite how sensitive my skin is.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> My husband even noticed how soft my face was and that is saying something.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quite a tiny quantity.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The product is acceptable and has not caused any issues with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (joking----you got to go naturally---</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I enjoy using it everyday in my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I did my research on natural moisturizers and found Foxbrim&#x27;s Ocean Mineral Lotion.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this did not cause any rashes or breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It has a neutral smell which I like since I am sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> The natural and organic ingredients enticed me to try it as a means of reducing the natural oils my skin produces</li>
            <li> After my week of experimentation of both my husband and I, I can admittedly say, Foxbrim is a contender in the natural skin care market.  </li>
            <li> Made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> made my skin feel really soft and</li>
            <li> The smell goes away after it completely dries.</li>
            <li> My skin might be too sensitive for this product.  </li>
            <li> It has slightly masculine scent</li>
            <li> I am going to go back to all natural, thick moisturizers like Amazing Face or stuff from Organic Fields of Heather.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combo skin</li>
            <li> The scent is a little unique, but I don&#x27;t find it off-putting or masculine at all.</li>
            <li> I was given a big discount for agreeing to review this lotion, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t be honest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to stay as smooth as possible for as long as I possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream itself is pretty thick but actually thins as you smooth it over your face.</li>
            <li> I have dry, tight skin and with most moisturizers I feel the need to reapply.</li>
            <li> Definitely bang for buck and a decent night creme.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it improved my skin, but it definitely feels better on my face than a lot of moisturizers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really, the only criticism I can offer is that this is a highly scented lotion.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for new lotions and moisturizers to try, especially with natural ingredients, so I was looking forward to giving this product a try.</li>
            <li> but when I apply moisturizer daily I break out usually - not with this though!  </li>
            <li> Will continue to keep your products on hand---as long as the prices stay reasonable :0  </li>
            <li> Hubby will continue to use the product until it is gone, but he currently does not see any benefits to using it over the lotion he normally uses.</li>
            <li> After being diagnosed with a thyroid issue and having to take daily medication that dried out my skin, I had to discontinue using a name brand independent product I had used for 15 years because I needed more moisture.</li>
            <li> importantly, I have been applying a little of this lotion on my elbows and can&#x27;t believe the change in just a short time.</li>
            <li> Seemed a little more synthetic than I expected and also</li>
            <li> Foxbrimâ€™s Seaweed Complex lotion boosts collagen production while leaving your skin clear, smooth, and youthful glow.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is silky and not too thick and it leaves my face smooth, soft and oil-free through out the day.</li>
            <li> It is one that you pump out and half a pumps worth.</li>
            <li> It left my face very soft and feeling supple.  </li>
            <li> getting uneven dry patches and occasional acne ( which i typically do not get) love everything else ive tried, but this one is not for me.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, anti-radiation properties found in this complex protect from daily and long term sun damage and progressive aging of the skin.</li>
            <li> I have not seen major improvement in my skin, but itâ€™s a lotion that keeps my skin moisturized, itâ€™s light-weight, and isnâ€™t oily.</li>
            <li> I been using it for of weeks now, will continue to use it to see if it make major changes.</li>
            <li> would be interested in trying their other products.</li>
            <li> I like the way my face feels right after applying but within a few minutes it&#x27;s no longer soft.</li>
            <li> Lots of good stuff in it too, including aloe, glycerin, sunflower oil, hyaluronic acid, blue green algae, Irish moss, yarrow, shea butter, Jojoba oil, vitamin B5, green tea.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes a long way and comes in a decent sized bottle.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a thick luxurious feel, but absorbs quickly and did not leave my oily, acne-prone skin feeling greasy or irritated at all!  </li>
            <li> primarily use the Seaweed Complex Lotion as part of my nighttime skincare routine</li>
            <li> which is always something I personally look for in a lotion because my skin is sensitive and combo skin</li>
            <li> The lotion does not really have much of a fragrance, which I like.</li>
            <li> I may only be 25, but I need to start using anti-aging products now so that I don&#x27;t get wrinkles too early.</li>
            <li> We utilize only premium ingredients in our natural and organic products.</li>
            <li> This Ocean Mineral Lotion sinks in fast while still being hydrating.</li>
            <li> It left my hands feeling soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry skin like I do during the colder months I would highly suggest you give this a try.</li>
            <li> concern was that this small container would not last long enough, but I was again pleasantly surprised that it lasted about 8 weeks using the recommended amount of a dime size, twice a day (I was actually probably using more than a &amp;#34;dime&amp;#34; size).</li>
            <li> I was probably expecting too much based on the other rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle light scent.</li>
            <li> I recently tried their Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum and their Seaweed Complex Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amino Complex - Effective skin repair treatment to keep skin firm</li>
            <li> aquaphor is too greasy feeling and leaves a visible &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;, cetaphil is very very mild and lasts only a couple hours on me, aveeno last a little longer but some of them (to my surprise) irritate my skin (and aveeno still does not last as long as this).&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> at first it is a little greasy</li>
            <li> It does not leave my skin looking greasy, therefore I use this during the day and other moisturizers (such as shea butter) at night, since they make my skin very shiny.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned, out of the box, that the description said &#x27;serum&#x27; as it was lotion I really needed.</li>
            <li> The only real comment i have is, that once you pump it out, its not a clean close.</li>
            <li> It’s thick and had just the right amount of oil.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to testify to its anti wrinkle properties, but will continue to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The problem is that I also have chronically very dry skin, meaning these &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; products often do not keep it moisturized, or not long enough.</li>
            <li> I probably haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice if it has helped my maturing skin.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results.  </li>
            <li> The two generally do not go hand in hand.  </li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin , and it goes well with my sensitive skin, but still feel a little bit dry, so I have to apply a lot!</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that there is a bit of shine on my face because of excess oil (which I expected to happen because it has with every other new product I try); however, it is minimal enough to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Being over 50, I tend to get dry patches around my nose and different areas of my face.</li>
            <li> Never left me feeling oily or dry.</li>
            <li> I also used it on moistened skin and dry skin and found that it had the same effect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the their new Seaweed Complex Lotion as one of my main moisturizers for the past several weeks</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t linger a long time and it isn&#x27;t over-powering or perfumey.</li>
            <li> I really like that it contains aloe, which helps my redness, and jojoba oil, which matches my skin&#x27;s sebum, which makes for less breakouts and less flakey dry skin!</li>
            <li> I used to have a few dry spots that have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> And I do mean very.</li>
            <li> I can apply my makeup right after using this and it doesn&#x27;t slow down my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen too many scary results to go there!  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term results are!</li>
            <li> My face is still dry and cracking.</li>
            <li> My face is still dry after I apply and by the end of the day my face is itchy.</li>
            <li> Moistens dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this moisturizer both in the morning and at night before bed to try and combat the dry skin that winter has been causing around my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I used it on a lot of the dry areas on my body-ankles, knees, elbows, and hands.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I suffer from eczema that causes our skin to be irritatingly dry and some lotions don’t even help in the slightest.</li>
            <li> You only need a dime size, or 1 pump, but I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I usually notice tightness after washing my face and using my old lotion.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely try their other products!</li>
            <li> mine actually came in a skinnier black bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit odd, because of the deep sea ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is one if you use a half to three quarters of a pump you should last quite a while.</li>
            <li> and it made my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little concerned about this product only because I had never tried it.</li>
            <li> I only needed a little amount.  </li>
            <li> My elbows crack and are rough feeling.</li>
            <li> We are noticing less dry skin.</li>
            <li> Anti-radiation properties found in this complex protect from daily and long term sun damage and progressive aging of the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels hydrated and fresh.i would recommend this to anyone who also has dry, tight skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned a &#x27;manly&#x27; smell.</li>
            <li> No breakouts, rashes,that I got with other products.</li>
            <li> They make quality products and offer a money back guarantee if you are not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a cosmetic product which sets on a shelf among other cosmetics and it gets overlooked.</li>
            <li> I noticed some red spots on my face seemed to heal  faster than usual after using this regimen of serum and moisturizer for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it really isnt irritating or harsh.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a thin moisturizer so that I wouldn&#x27;t break out, however this is a very thick rich cream.</li>
            <li> There are tons of other lotions that work just as well for less money that come in prettier bottles.</li>
            <li> Thick white lotion&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to start using it immediately-even though i have other brands opened already!  </li>
            <li> under eyes is also less baggy and dark...</li>
            <li> I had some dry patches on my legs too, and they are smoother than ever after applying just a small amount of the ocean mineral lotion.  </li>
            <li> * The active ingredients are hyaluronic acid, ocean mineral complex (who knows what that is), blue green algae, Iris moss, yarrow, and Vitamin B5.</li>
            <li> A little lotion goes a long way, I usually use less than a dime size squeeze for my face.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel less flexible.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to take away any discoloration and tightens up any subtle wrinkles especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and break out in red blotches that itch like crazy when my skin doesn&#x27;t like what is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed that my first purchase of this item came open and appeared used, which prompted me to comment on the fact.  </li>
            <li> This does NOT mean this is a fake review.</li>
            <li> I wish a little less would come out with one pump.  </li>
            <li> With it getting cold, I could always use new moisturizer, because my skin tends to get very dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I had exfoliated a little too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little to no smell though, and my face is softer so it does moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Does not have a heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few weeks to see if it made a difference.</li>
            <li> It does not leave an oily or heavy feeling after you apply it.</li>
            <li> I just got this a few days ago</li>
            <li> I will update this review after I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It never feels greasy, oily, or heavy.</li>
            <li> I like to switch things up with moisturizer, but I&#x27;m grabbing for this one everyday -</li>
            <li> Foxbrim makes their products without harsh synthetic ingredients</li>
            <li> It’s hard to explain other than that.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is thick, I have extremely oily skin.  </li>
            <li> No strong scent is a plus.</li>
            <li> have it 4 stars because the size of the bottle seems a little small.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use any moisturizer on my face because I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that they are destroying Indonesian forest and wildlife just because they are planting palm trees for oil!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but for some reason it made my face red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> I feel like a poor plain jane using face lotion from an overpriced plain jane bottle.</li>
            <li> It does have this hard scent once applied</li>
            <li> It does contain alcohol, which I was not thrilled about since it has drying properties.</li>
            <li> This ocean mineral lotion with seaweed complex is no exception.  </li>
            <li> Ocean Mineral Lotion with Seaweed Complex utilizes phytochemicals, polysaccharides and 90+ minerals and micro minerals to bring the restorative and youthening elements of the ocean to you in a bioavailable format.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the serum in conjunction with Foxbrim&#x27;s Seaweed Complex Lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky , I hate having a sticky feeling after lotion .</li>
            <li> Just too thick for me</li>
            <li> If you do not own atleast one Foxbrim product, this is the one you need!</li>
            <li> With Foxbrim&#x27;s Seaweed Complex Lotion it gives my skin nutrients and moisture that it needs to get through the day!</li>
            <li> Rapidly restore firmness to tired and worn skin.</li>
            <li> thin</li>
            <li> just make it 10x worse.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t believe me, click my profile and scroll down to see the poor reviews I&#x27;ve given bad products.</li>
            <li> Palm oil is very bad for you in general.</li>
            <li> I have very bad dry spots on my face.</li>
            <li> People, please ban any product that contain completely unnecessary palm oil!</li>
            <li> but it seems weird to moisturize my face with beer smelling lotion.</li>
            <li> skin feel greasy or dirty</li>
            <li> You wont be sorry if you purchase this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult for me to find a product that won&#x27;t make me react.</li>
            <li> The pump bottle is a bad design as it seems you can&#x27;t dispense all of the product.</li>
            <li> doesnt smell bad.</li>
            <li> , Maybe I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> The packaging is just awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this lotion! It is light, non-greasy and absorbs quickly. Does not have a heavy fragrance. It feels so clean. Lots of good stuff in it too, including aloe, glycerin, sunflower oil, hyaluronic acid, blue green algae, Irish moss, yarrow, shea butter, Jojoba oil, vitamin B5, green tea. Customer service great. Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is wonderful.  Non greasy, light but it does a great job of moisturizing.  I have sensitive skin and it I did not break out once when switching.  It does have a strange light burning sensation when you initially start using it, but that has faded and I read that it was normal.  I thought maybe I had exfoliated a little too much.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li> If you do not own atleast one Foxbrim product, this is the one you need! I love all of the products I have ever tried from here, especially this one! I love this lotion especially because not only can it be applied to your body all over as a moisturizer, but can even be applied on your face as we&#x27;ll! I read other reviews of people complaining about the smell, but in my opinion the smell is soo good! It does have a more manly scent, kind of like a cologne. This product is great for women AND men!  With it getting cold, I could always use new moisturizer, because my skin tends to get very dry and flaky. With Foxbrim&#x27;s Seaweed Complex Lotion it gives my skin nutrients and moisture that it needs to get through the day! I would give this product a 10 out of 10!! Way to go Foxbrim!</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel less flexible.  I want a lotion that will make my skin supple.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Foxbrim products with great success (most especially the Total Repair Hair Oil, which was absolutely amazing), so I was excited to try the Seaweed Complex Lotion. I had never used seaweed as a skincare treatment, although I know it&#x27;s a traditional Asian beauty secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion was light and absorbed easily. I could put on makeup right away. And, there was no heavy or greasy feel. It&#x27;s definitely for daytime use, as I prefer a much heavier cream for night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was soft and elastic after the first use. After one week, my skin felt great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the only criticism I can offer is that this is a highly scented lotion. Ever since I became pregnant with my first child I have been very sensitive to scent (to the point where I had to give up cologne for a few years). The scent was pleasant, but just a bit overpowering for me personally, although it went away after about a half hour.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned a &#x27;manly&#x27; smell. I think it is rather gender-neutral...it just smells clean/fresh to me. It does not leave my skin looking greasy, therefore I use this during the day and other moisturizers (such as shea butter) at night, since they make my skin very shiny. It does contain alcohol, which I was not thrilled about since it has drying properties. But it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best lotion I have ever used for my face. I could feel the difference immediately after applying it to my face the very first time! It feels very light, but keeps my face moisturized through most of the day (at the very least, until I get home from work).&lt;br /&gt;For perspective, my skin is quite sensitive, but I have tried a myriad of products for sensitive skin. The problem is that I also have chronically very dry skin, meaning these &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; products often do not keep it moisturized, or not long enough. I am very pleased to say this lotion does both. A short list of some of the products I am comparing to... aquaphor is too greasy feeling and leaves a visible &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;, cetaphil is very very mild and lasts only a couple hours on me, aveeno last a little longer but some of them (to my surprise) irritate my skin (and aveeno still does not last as long as this).&lt;br /&gt;My concern was that this small container would not last long enough, but I was again pleasantly surprised that it lasted about 8 weeks using the recommended amount of a dime size, twice a day (I was actually probably using more than a &amp;#34;dime&amp;#34; size). Of course this is still much more expensive than the costco 2-jar cetaphil cream (which probably lasts me the better part of a year for about $10).. but there is no comparison in quality for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend checking the ingredient list just to make sure you have no allergies (such as seaweed), but this is an outstanding product. I am now trying the Vitamin C Foxbrim to compare.</li>
            <li> Came in a bottle not a little tub, great product though! I would say the smell is more masculine than femenin but I enjoy the smell</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes your skin so soft and silky. It also seems to take away any discoloration and tightens up any subtle wrinkles especially around the eyes. The fact that the majority of the ingredients are organic is an additional bonus. I will continue to buy this for my facial cream. Update: I have been using this product for over a year now and it is incredible how much smoother and fuller my skin looks. I used to have a few dry spots that have completely disappeared. I love this cream so much!!</li>
            <li> I really Do like this product...My skin really does show a difference in texture, redness, reduction of pores, under eyes is also less baggy and dark...Skin on neck is smoother as well.It absorbs quickly and no greasy look. No strong scent is a plus. Also I don&#x27;t need more than 1/2 a pump to cover my face and neck. Very pleased ;)</li>
            <li> This lotion feels high quality but it is just so pricy for a tiny bottle. It might be worth the price for some people but I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again. I do like that it does not make my skin oily at all and most lotions do.</li>
            <li> I got the Seaweed Complex Lotion for free from Foxbrim for my husband to try; regardless this is our 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is that this lotion definitely had a masculine smell to it once dispensed. It went away after spreading it into your skin, so a woman could use it if they didn&#x27;t mind the initial scent of the lotion. The lotion itself was a white color with a normal lotion texture, not to runny but not thick like a cream. It spread onto the skin in a light even manner and it didn&#x27;t make either mine or hubbies skin feel greasy or dirty which is always something I personally look for in a lotion because my skin is sensitive and combo skin so one area might be really dry while another area will get greasy very easily. It moisturizes well and it did not bother my sensitive skin at all. Both hubby and I liked the way it felt on our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving this product 4 stars because I did not see any improvement or change in my husband&#x27;s facial skin. I did not use it for an extended amount of time, just a bit when it arrived to see how it felt. Hubby will continue to use the product until it is gone, but he currently does not see any benefits to using it over the lotion he normally uses. If it didn&#x27;t have the scent I would probably use it more, but with my sensitive skin I like light or no scents in my products.</li>
            <li> My face is still dry and cracking. I use this with the vitamin c serum. My face is still dry after I apply and by the end of the day my face is itchy. I gave it a few weeks to see if it made a difference. I like the way my face feels right after applying but within a few minutes it&#x27;s no longer soft.</li>
            <li> This works fairly well. The main issue is the fragrance. Why do they insist on adding perfumes to something you put on your face? The pump bottle is a bad design as it seems you can&#x27;t dispense all of the product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product! I was a little concerned, out of the box, that the description said &#x27;serum&#x27; as it was lotion I really needed. But it goes on with the creaminess of a lotion - and it tightens like a serum! Wonderful! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion!  It has a fresh scent and really works well.  I put it over my argon oil and my face is really looking much better and definitely not dried out anymore.</li>
            <li> Foxbrimâ€™s Seaweed Complex lotion boosts collagen production while leaving your skin clear, smooth, and youthful glow. Itâ€™s crafted with all natural and organic products in the USA, not tested on animals, and can be used on all skin types.  I am always looking for new lotions and moisturizers to try, especially with natural ingredients, so I was looking forward to giving this product a try. One or two pumps of the product is plenty to evenly apply over your entire face, and it absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. The scent is pleasant, and not overpowering. Applied a few times a week prior to bed, and I was pleased with how well it kept my skin hydrated without any irritation or discomfort, despite how sensitive my skin is.  I have not seen major improvement in my skin, but itâ€™s a lotion that keeps my skin moisturized, itâ€™s light-weight, and isnâ€™t oily. I will continue to use it for a nightly facial lotion.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft. This is amazing lotion. One of the best lotions I have used for my face. My husband even noticed how soft my face was and that is saying something. Lol. I bought at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. it&#x27;s great for morning and night and works perfect under makeup</li>
            <li> Love the smell and my skin looks well moisturized.</li>
            <li> These guys at Foxbrim create great quality products; I&#x27;m already a customer for somo of their other products and this one is no different, is also awesome. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product from Foxbrim. This cream is lightweight, yet creamy.  I had to start using it immediately-even though i have other brands opened already!  It just smells so good &amp; soaks right in.I received this cream at a reduced price for an honest opinion.  I also use this on my neck &amp; elbows.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and emollient.</li>
            <li> Being over 50, I tend to get dry patches around my nose and different areas of my face. This has got to be one of the lightest lotions I have used, yet the most effective at hydrating my skin! It feels great going on, has no heavy oily or greasy feeling at all, and hours later my skin is as smooth as when I first put it on!! I had some dry patches on my legs too, and they are smoother than ever after applying just a small amount of the ocean mineral lotion.  I like it!!</li>
            <li> It really didnt work well on my skin, acne that I never get started to appear and it made my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I loved this item it had a great scent and the texture is light but not too light</li>
            <li> I love the cream - it feels good on my face and smells like one of those really expensive French lotions - very fresh with the slightest sweetness to it.  But the bottle was smaller than the jar looks in the add.  It&#x27;s really quite a tiny quantity.  The quality is great, though!</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin looks and feels! As I have gotten older my skin seems more sensitive to what I put on it. So I have been trying different products to find something compatible, I think this is it.  Just started using it and so far great. No breakouts, rashes,that I got with other products. Very natural,  I like that.  Even though I received a promo offer for the product, this is my honest evaluation and now that I have used it longer, I have to say it&#x27;s a favorite, so smooth, clean feeling, really like it</li>
            <li> I really like how this makes my face feel. Its not greasy. I have very bad dry spots on my face. This helps it a lot . I did get this to review and I would recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a strong scent. It also kind of burns my face when applied. In conjunction with E.L.F. makeup, not sure which is the culprit, most likely the makeup, but I now have huge ZITS! I have NEVER had these big of ZITS! EVER! Since starting this, I also have had oily skin. ICK!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a light non-greasy moisturizer, this is for you. I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother me at all. I&#x27;ve been using for a month and noticed my mild Rosacea getting better! I probably haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice if it has helped my maturing skin. I will Def recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have tried ! I&#x27;m very picky , I hate having a sticky feeling after lotion . this lotion is not sticky at all , it goes on easy and blend in with your skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling very smooth. I really enjoy the look of the product as well as the bottle.</li>
            <li> Instantly moisturizes!  I have very dry skin on my face but when I apply moisturizer daily I break out usually - not with this though!  Great value and great product!</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have dry, tight skin and with most moisturizers I feel the need to reapply. With Foxbrim, I apply in the morning and it lasts all day. My skin feels hydrated and fresh.i would recommend this to anyone who also has dry, tight skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the Customer service. I received an email from Foxbrim thanking me for my business as well as further product detail, which was a nice touch. My purchase felt sincerely appreciated, and not just another sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have it 4 stars because the size of the bottle seems a little small. You only need a dime size, or 1 pump, but I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Feels like a special treat putting it on my face. Also smells great.</li>
            <li> I was probably expecting too much based on the other rave reviews.  The product is okay and I will update this if I change my mind.  Definitely bang for buck and a decent night creme. Just don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> Foxbrim has done it again. This is my third product purchase from them. I have loved each product and this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive...very, very sensitive. I also have rosacea and eczema. I am always in search of products that give me great results without irritating my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion goes on smooth and feels great. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores. The scent is a little unique, but I don&#x27;t find it off-putting or masculine at all. I use this twice a day; once in the morning and once at night before bed. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have been very impressed with every Foxbrim product I&#x27;ve tried. I will continue to shop from this company. They make quality products and offer a money back guarantee if you are not completely satisfied. Another point in their favor is that they ask how they can improve. I see great things ahead for this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at a promotional price for purposes of testing and review.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my skin is very sensitive and I had a reaction to it (my sensitive skin people - don&#x27;t let this review make a huge impact on your decision as I have many allergies and could have just had an allergic reaction to the product). However, I give the product 4 stars because Tony actually contacted me and asked about my feelings on the product via email and then processed me a refund when I told him what happened.</li>
            <li> The product is acceptable and has not caused any issues with my sensitive skin. The packaging is just awful. This is a cosmetic product which sets on a shelf among other cosmetics and it gets overlooked. I use this daily but its always a struggle to find it. Cosmetic products are all about improving ones looks and this bottle/label/name is not pretty, striking or memorable in any way. I most likely will not purchase again because of this. There are tons of other lotions that work just as well for less money that come in prettier bottles. If you feel pretty you look pretty and using this product does not make me feel pretty or special whatsoever. I feel like a poor plain jane using face lotion from an overpriced plain jane bottle.</li>
            <li> Very effective product:)</li>
            <li> this is the first Foxbrim product i have tried that i did not like. I used the vit c lotion and my skin was looking great, when it was time to reorder i decided to try this one out. dissapointed and i had to order vit c lotion as i wont be able to keep using this one. getting uneven dry patches and occasional acne ( which i typically do not get) love everything else ive tried, but this one is not for me.</li>
            <li> Love the mineral lotion it has made my skin feel more smoother and tighter..great product..</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with your vitamin C Lotion---and the 2 work great together to make this sun-damaged 5 year old skin look glowing once again!  Thank you!  I love your products and prices---please don&#x27;t go up because of great feedback;)  Will continue to keep your products on hand---as long as the prices stay reasonable :0  Thank you for another product!  going to check out your entire line....this sun-loving fool can not get enough help!  Also this product has a hydro----something acid in it---which in combination with vitamin C works wonders on restoring youth....read that in a dermo&#x27;s offfice---asked him about it---and he said that was the honest truth.  This doctor does many plastic surgery procedures---should save my money and just invest in the surgical department....(joking----you got to go naturally---I&#x27;ve seen too many scary results to go there!  Just call me the T.M.I. girl :0</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer without feeling greasy!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion.  It has amazing results!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this. I been using it for of weeks now, will continue to use it to see if it make major changes. I hope it does because I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is the send time I ordered it. I love the consistency and the lack of scents involved.,Does it work miracles....no....but it helps.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I don&#x27;t like to wear products that I can &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; on my face and skin. I also have sensitive skin and break out in red blotches that itch like crazy when my skin doesn&#x27;t like what is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned about this product only because I had never tried it. I am familiar with the brand and because I like their other products I was willing to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow..it smells wonderful! It applies smoothly and is completely absorbed without any residual greasy feeling. I like that I can apply my makeup right after using this and it doesn&#x27;t slow down my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, I have been applying a little of this lotion on my elbows and can&#x27;t believe the change in just a short time. My elbows crack and are rough feeling. Just a tab of this lotion applied in the morning and just before bed is making a huge difference in the skin. I would recommend it just for your elbows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with the product and will continue to use it...both on my face and on my elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> Lots of great ingredients in this lightweight lotion...silky, soft, fresh scent...</li>
            <li> This product was truly amazing. Once applied to skin it gives your skin a great glow and goes on smooth and not oily. It does have this hard scent once applied but it seems to vanish after applying on skin. So it really isnt irritating or harsh. I have sensitive skin and it did not bother my skin at all. I did notice my skin becoming nice and smooth and glowing with more and more use. I think this product is fabulous and truly work and I enjoy using it everyday in my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use any moisturizer on my face because I have oily skin. But I started a new skin routine and wanted to incorporate a natural moisturizer. I did my research on natural moisturizers and found Foxbrim&#x27;s Ocean Mineral Lotion. I liked the natural ingredients in this product. This lotion actually works great on my face. I apply this lotion in the morning after I&#x27;ve put on my vitamin c serum. The lotion does not really have much of a fragrance, which I like. A little lotion goes a long way, I usually use less than a dime size squeeze for my face. The lotion itself is silky and not too thick and it leaves my face smooth, soft and oil-free through out the day. For the price and natural ingredients, Foxbrim is a great brand.</li>
            <li> I really love how this Ocean Mineral Lotion by Foxbrim feels on my skin. It makes my face feel so healthy and moisturized. I&#x27;m always really worried about sun damage so I feel so good knowing that the anti-radiation properties in this lotion will protect from sun damage and helps boost collagen production while filling in existing wrinkles and restores firmness to tired and worn skin. It&#x27;s also very important to me that I don&#x27;t put any additives, silicones or parabens on my skin if I don&#x27;t need to. I may only be 25, but I need to start using anti-aging products now so that I don&#x27;t get wrinkles too early. I&#x27;d like to stay as smooth as possible for as long as I possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Wife love it will buy again and give as gift</li>
            <li> I am a certified beauty junkie, and while this brand is entirely new to me, the powerhouse list of natural ingredients sold me right away!  Foxbrim Ocean Mineral Lotion contains favorite ingredients of mine including:  Aloe, hyraluronic acid, jojoba, and shea butter as well as some promising new (to me)  wonders such as:  Irish Moss, Blue Green Algae, and Yarrow (a very beneficial plant, but, I&#x27;ve never seen it in skincare before). This lotion has a thick luxurious feel, but absorbs quickly and did not leave my oily, acne-prone skin feeling greasy or irritated at all!  There wasn&#x27;t a fragrance I could detect, which I know is very desirable in skincare products!  I did receive this product from AMZ Review Trader at a very steep discount to review, and I am glad I did. otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have known about this great product!</li>
            <li> This cream is very hydrating and soaks right in.  I use it to help my sunscreen absorb into my skin a bit better as my sunscreen is drying and leaves a white cast since it has zinc oxide in it.  The Ocean Mineral Lotion helps to hydrate my skin and also blur out the white cast.  I also use it as a quick moisturizer during the day if I see a dry patch somewhere.  Pleasant smell and I like ingredients.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, light weight.  Decent size bottle.  I have sensitive skin, and this did not cause any rashes or breakouts.  I have not used it long enough to testify to its anti wrinkle properties, but will continue to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I only gave a 4 star rating because the scent is very strong, like that of men&#x27;s cologne (I am scent-sative to smell). Otherwise this has a pleasant texture.</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer. It works wonderful for my skin type, which is combination. It does not leave an oily or heavy feeling after you apply it. I will definitely try their other products!</li>
            <li> I have received other products from Foxbrim and I love their products.  This lotion pumps out of the bottle very easily and feels very smooth and luxurious.  It has a neutral smell which I like since I am sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> Feels good, looks good. Even in the month I have been using it I noted a difference. Will be staying with this!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a Foxbrim product but I am sold.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my face extremely soft.  I look forward to trying more of their products in the future !!!</li>
            <li> Was looking for a thin moisturizer so that I wouldn&#x27;t break out, however this is a very thick rich cream. Little to no smell though, and my face is softer so it does moisturizer. Just too thick for me and I break out</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results.  I&#x27;ll update soon.</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to try this for review.  I&#x27;m always looking for organic face moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy.  This went on light and my face was very soft.  No irritation or burning.</li>
            <li> I just got this a few days ago and i apply it after my showers at night. It seems to have made my face more dry,  so I think I&#x27;m going to apply it in the morning before I put on makeup too. I like the way it feels when you&#x27;re putting it on.. at first it is a little greasy but once it dries your face feels fresh,  soft,  clean.  I&#x27;ve noticed my complexion is getting smoothand toned. I would recommend this because it&#x27;s paraben free and isn&#x27;t harmful to your skin or clogs your poors. This is definitely a product I will use forever.</li>
            <li> This face cream is lovely in every way. It has a subtle light scent. The cream itself is pretty thick but actually thins as you smooth it over your face. For being super creamy, it abaorbs fairly quickly. I have to say, I&#x27;ve loved every Foxbrim product I&#x27;ve tested so far. Cheers!</li>
            <li> I just received and started using this lotion.  I really like how it feels on my skin. Very creamy and moisturizing without being greasy. It has a very mild scent and it is quite pleasant as well.  I will update this review after I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> As a product tester I compare dozens of skin care products, and I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations from fragrance to long-term results. I hope these are helpful to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Virtually none.&lt;br /&gt;~ Color and texture: Thick white lotion&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Creamy and pleasant&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: A nice sort of powdery-soft feeling.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Like most moisture lotions, I wouldn&#x27;t use on oily or acne-prone facial skin. Other than that, good for all types.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: 3.4oz plastic pump bottle with cap. Pump is easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Moistens dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* The active ingredients are hyaluronic acid, ocean mineral complex (who knows what that is), blue green algae, Iris moss, yarrow, and Vitamin B5. The moisturizers are palm oil, safflower oil, shea butter, and jojoba oil. I like the potential of this one far better than the Foxbrim Vitamin C lotion I just reviewed; it looks to be a nicely beneficial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review. This does NOT mean this is a fake review. I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review. If you don&#x27;t believe me, click my profile and scroll down to see the poor reviews I&#x27;ve given bad products. My job is to give an honest opinion, not help the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> Pretty pricey, but the smell is pleasant and it absorbs nicely. I&#x27;m not sure if it improved my skin, but it definitely feels better on my face than a lot of moisturizers. I use this once a day after I shower and it&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is too strong for me to use on my face, but I like it as a hand lotion.  It moisturizes my hands without making them feel greasy or like I am leaving oily fingerprints everywhere.  I also like the lift pump bottle it comes in.  It is just the right size for the purse.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I am a Foxbrim fan!  Love their products.  This ocean mineral lotion with seaweed complex is no exception.  I have acne prone and very oily skin so I rarely try new facial products.  The natural and organic ingredients enticed me to try it as a means of reducing the natural oils my skin produces and I am really quite pleased with the results.  The product absorbs nicely and does not leave any residue.  The smell is pleasant and it leaves my skin feeling very refreshed.  So far my skin seems less oily, but more time will be the true test.  I will update after using the product longer.</li>
            <li> After reviewing and testing most of the Foxbrim line of products, I would have to say that this one lotion is my favorite hands down.  It has a very good texture for my combination to dry skin.  Wears well under makeup and does work well as a night time moisturizer.  I can note the shea butter that they use on first sniff, pump action is good and distributes product well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other department/natural food store skin care lines, I feel that you get excellent value for the quality of products you receive.  The $15-$20 price point is very fair.  There is no fragrance (always be suspicious when you open a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product and it smells like perfume) When I put these products to the test, I do aggressively on my own body even taking the measures to apply very near (almost in) my actual eye to wait and see what happens.  After my week of experimentation of both my husband and I, I can admittedly say, Foxbrim is a contender in the natural skin care market.  This is coming from someone that has paid well over the $100 price point for single skin care product and pays more for things I can actually pronounce on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t find the product up to par, they will make sure you are satisfied.  I love that this is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I love this line of beauty products. I received this one to review. I really loved it. My skin is smoother and brighter. I did not get any reactions.</li>
            <li> great moisture without grease or dryness</li>
            <li> Nice smelling and lotion is not greasy feeling when applied.  Will update review when I have used the product faithfully for a month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great product and works as it says it does.  I really love this company and will continue to use their products.  I am a very happy customer. It also arrived early! Thank you so much!  Smells great!</li>
            <li> This product is so good. I love how it makes me feel. It came well packaged and works just as described. Time to buy some more. :) Thanks for the great product</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, it is not greasy at all, just leaves your face feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> As we age, we lose a lot of elastin in our skin, so it is very important to find a lotion that helps keep elastin longer. I think this is one of those lotions. I use it all over. It is light, not oily and feels really great. Made with all natural ingredients. made my skin feel really soft and nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specs: From Nature To You - Nature continues to hold the key to true beauty.

            <li> Love the texture; not greasy; goes on smooth and dries quick.  Doesn&#x27;t break me out.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> So, I have very sensitive skin. And I do mean very. It&#x27;s very difficult for me to find a product that won&#x27;t make me react. After searching all over Amazon for a moisturizer, I came across this one. I took the plunge and bought it. I&#x27;m glad I did! It didn&#x27;t cause any reaction! That&#x27;s a win for sure:) I can&#x27;t say that it really did wonders in improving my skin, but it did what I wanted it to. I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star rating for that fact and also cause I wish it came with more product. But, I would still repurchase it. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Super creamy! Love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is the best.  But it is good.</li>
            <li> This is nice face cream.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily feeling, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It has a neutral smell to it.  Which is good.</li>
            <li> mine actually came in a skinnier black bottle. Great packaging and design. I like that the cap snaps on and off. moisturizes pretty well. doesnt smell bad. The only real comment i have is, that once you pump it out, its not a clean close. there will still be a tiny bit of product coming out. but overall, good product. would be interested in trying their other products.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great daily moisturizer for many skin types. My skin gets progressively more oily over the course of the day and certain products will speed that up, but that is not the case here. This Ocean Mineral Lotion sinks in fast while still being hydrating. It&#x27;s nice not to have a greasy, tacky layer of moisturizer on your skin before you do your makeup! I really like that it contains aloe, which helps my redness, and jojoba oil, which matches my skin&#x27;s sebum, which makes for less breakouts and less flakey dry skin! I also like that it contains ocean minerals, as the dead sea mud soaps and masks really helped with my acne and my skin responds quite favorably. It also has hyaluronic acid in it as well, so make sure to apply over a toner(no alcohol!) for maximum benefits.  I also like that it was made here in the US, and their products are not tested on animals. I also like that this came in an airless pump instead of a tub, it shows Foxbrim really pays attention to the products they are making!</li>
            <li> I will never understand why would anyone put Palm oil into a face cream??!! Palm oil is very bad for you in general. It is the cheapest oil. Not to mention that they are destroying Indonesian forest and wildlife just because they are planting palm trees for oil! People, please ban any product that contain completely unnecessary palm oil!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I just opened it and have been using it , good no problems</li>
            <li> The lotion is great for the face especially after you take a shower. Smells a bit odd, because of the deep sea ingredients. The smell goes away after it completely dries. Works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was also stoked when Foxbrim sent me their Seaweed Complex Lotion to review, as I have been looking for a new moisturizer ever since leaving my last favorite one with my mom!  I used this moisturizer both in the morning and at night before bed to try and combat the dry skin that winter has been causing around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer went on smoothly, without any greasiness.  It absorbed into my skin quite quickly, allowing me to continue with my daily facial routine without needing to wait around.  I was surprised by the smell of this, though, as it was very strongly scented.  At first it reminded me of a bar of soap, but after having a friend smell it, she made me realize that this smells like men&#x27;s aftershave.  I am very surprised that something that is all natural can have this level of fragrance in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will put this disclaimer on here - I am very fussy about scents.  In this case, I just do not feel comfortable putting something so highly-fragranced onto my face.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just fine, but after years and years of telling myself that fragrances don&#x27;t go above my neck, this just goes against everything I know.  I really, really feel this would be an excellent product for a guy who needs a good moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t want to feel too &amp;#34;metro&amp;#34; about it or for anyone who isn&#x27;t as fussy about scents as I am!</li>
            <li> This makes my face so soft and smooth especially in combination with a face mask. Never left me feeling oily or dry.</li>
            <li> This product was nice and rich but it didnt last along time. I used it on my husband And he liked it, kept his skin nice and moist for hours. He said he would for surely use it again.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this lotion.  It absorbs well and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Although I have never seen an ocean (or smelled one) in person, this smells like an &amp;#34;Ocean Breeze&amp;#34; (or something along those lines haha) scented candle. It smells very pleasant and fresh. The scent doesn&#x27;t linger a long time and it isn&#x27;t over-powering or perfumey. I like that in a lotion/facial moisturizer. This is by far one of the best moisturizers I have tried out there. I say this because not only does it have a pleasant smell, but it absorbs within seconds and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel greasy! I love that. Once again, Foxbrim has made a quality product. I give it two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Pretty good lotion. We are noticing less dry skin. The lotion smells pretty good and I like the size of the bottle. Makes it easy to take on trips.</li>
            <li> Out of all the lotions, moisturizers and creams I have ever tried I love this one I think the most (or at least it&#x27;s up there). I love scented products and I absolutely love the smell of this one. It reminds me of a men&#x27;s cologne or even a deodorant. Think like the scent of most mens gillette products. If you don&#x27;t like that kind of scent then this isn&#x27;t for you probably but I for one was in love from the second I opened it. The lotion is also very nice like other Foxbrim products. It never feels greasy, oily, or heavy. The lotion goes a long way and comes in a decent sized bottle. It absorbs quickly into my skin and works fine under my makeup including foundation. The scent doesn&#x27;t stay with you and will disappear. I think this is a great option for men and women alike. I did receive this complimentary in hopes for a review. Regardless, my opinions and thoughts are always honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> I did not like the strong smell of this product. It wears off some over time, but goes on strong, and smells like a man&#x27;s aftershave. The company however was GREAT! They honored their promise of an easy and \\&quot;no-hassle\\&quot; refund policy. They even took the time after I received the refund to ask me, in what way did the product not meet my expectations. Again... A great company!</li>
            <li> Well I was a little worried about purchasing another lotion because like many other people out there I spent so much money on skin care and pretty much things just end up in the garbage. I have really sensitive skin and can break out easily. I have to say so far this lotion has not irritated my skin at all!! It goes on smooth and is moisturizing without the greasy feeling! I believe I may have found a keeper!! :)</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized. It has a pleasant scent (unisex) on the verge of too strong, but it disappears before you would notice it was a problem.  I like to switch things up with moisturizer, but I&#x27;m grabbing for this one everyday - would totally buy this again!</li>
            <li> Nice on my skin and will continue to use. Bottle is perfect too. Sample received for review purposes*</li>
            <li> This lotion is super hydrating! I love it, I just wish it had a stronger scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtesy of Amazon Review Trader</li>
            <li> Love love love this. It is moisturizing without any greasy feeling.  The smell is relaxing and pleasant. I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews I wanted to love product, however the product broke me out significantly. The ingredient list has several oils and as I have combination skin, this was a no.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the feel of this on my skin.  It left my hands feeling soft and touchable. This light and fresh lotion will create balanced and nourished skin. Anti-radiation properties found in this complex protect from daily and long term sun damage and progressive aging of the skin. Great for someone like me living with the Texas sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I really like this. Nice and light and easy to put foundation over</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion a bit expensive for me but good.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Tomoson.com I was able to review this moisturizer. It arrived quickly and I was very exited to try it. I used it at night before bed. I found that it helped calm my dry winter skin with in two uses. I also noticed that it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry. It absorbed well into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave any residue. I also used it on moistened skin and dry skin and found that it had the same effect. I did find the fragrance to be a bit strong at first but it faded quickly. If you suffer from dry skin like I do during the colder months I would highly suggest you give this a try.</li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed that my first purchase of this item came open and appeared used, which prompted me to comment on the fact.  I was emailed by the company and sent a free replacement.  To me, this really spoke of the integrity of the company to reach out and do this.&lt;br /&gt;About the product, my initial thought was, &amp;#34;OH NO&amp;#34;.  The moisturizer is thick, I have extremely oily skin.  The two generally do not go hand in hand.  But this product absorbed into my skin beautifully.  It left my face very soft and feeling supple.  The glycerin also makes this ideal for me because when I use this in the mornings and apply my makeup after, it makes my makeup last longer and go on smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing this product again because I think it works fantastic, absorbs quickly into my skin, and leaves my skin feeling so much better than products I spend triple the money on.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! I received a discount to review this and loved it! It makes my skin feel really soft and nice!</li>
            <li> This Foxbrim Ocean mineral lotion is very light and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;We were lucky to find and purchase this lotion in a promotion for&lt;br /&gt;testing and review.  The lotion has a light scent and easy on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim has quickly become one of my favorite skin care brands.</li>
            <li> If you follow my blog, GlamRiver then you already know that I love Foxbrim products so I love it when they come out with something new and they send it to me to review for them, especially because I always have great results with their products!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the their new Seaweed Complex Lotion as one of my main moisturizers for the past several weeks and I really like it so far!  Foxbrim makes their products without harsh synthetic ingredients so it&#x27;s perfect for all skin types but this one is especially good for dry and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I primarily use the Seaweed Complex Lotion as part of my nighttime skincare routine and I apply it to my neck, decollete and shoulders.  The lotion is really lightweight so it&#x27;s easily absorbed and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s definitely really hydrating and I love how my skin feels after application so I can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term results are!</li>
            <li> Foxbrim has been generous enough to send me samples of some of their products to test.  I recently tried their Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum and their Seaweed Complex Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum is a nice product that claims to help with anti-aging efforts and to boost collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key Ingredients Include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Vitamin C - Promote collagen formation while fighting against free radicals&lt;br /&gt;+ Vitamin E - Essential antioxidant that helps protect and nourish skin&lt;br /&gt;+ Amino Complex - Effective skin repair treatment to keep skin firm&lt;br /&gt;+ Hyaluronic Acid - Unmatched natural moisturizer for plump and smooth skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the serum easy to use and it made my skin feel smooth, hydrated and nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the serum in conjunction with Foxbrim&#x27;s Seaweed Complex Lotion.  It is recommended that you use a moisturizer on top of serums with Hyaluronic Acid to seal in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seaweed Complex Lotion is also power packed with helpful ingredients to help keep your skin looking young and plump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key Ingredients Include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Phytochemicals - Effectively prevents premature aging of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;+ Polysaccharides - Essential building block for skin repair and renewal.&lt;br /&gt;+ Organic Spirulina (Blue Green Algae) - Reduce skin inflammation while boosting antioxidants and defending against free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;+ Hyaluronic Acid - Unmatched natural moisturizer for plump and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that I can use these 2 products together and that I didn&#x27;t experience any breakouts or dryness from using them.  I noticed some red spots on my face seemed to heal  faster than usual after using this regimen of serum and moisturizer for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I really enjoyed the scent I felt it was a bit too masculine for me and have passed the remainder of the bottle onto my husband so he can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received both of these products free in exchange for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> It is one that you pump out and half a pumps worth. It is plenty to cover the face. It is a nice thick cream to cover and not runny at all. When you first put this on it has a cooling effect. It goes on so smooth and cooling on your skin. Once I tried this I was so happy with the way it felt on my skin. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!  The bottle is a nice size and well worth every penny. This is one if you use a half to three quarters of a pump you should last quite a while. On of the ingredient is blue algae from the ocean. This is a light weight moisturizer for your face and neck. By using this you will notice your skin more supple and softer.  I would highly suggest to add this to your anti aging routine. I am feeling younger already by using this.</li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin , and it goes well with my sensitive skin, but still feel a little bit dry, so I have to apply a lot!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but it is absolutely one of the best moisturizers I have EVER used. It erases lines but it is NOT Greasy at all. Wish I could use it over my entire body!!!!</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;m going to say is I was very disappoint in this product. It did nothing for me but left me feel greasy!</li>
            <li> Very lightweight lotion, moisturizes well. Love how it makes my face soft and smooth. I have acne prone skin so I use a AHA facial wash that can be drying and this balances my skin out well. Feels great on hands too, but I&#x27;ll stick to my face so it lasts longer. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to future results!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but for some reason it made my face red and blotchy. My skin might be too sensitive for this product.  Felt good.</li>
            <li> Great product - leaves me skin feeling and looking great!</li>
            <li> hello wake up! my face in the morning just glows and shines!</li>
            <li> Used this as one of my nighttime moisturizers and seems to work great.</li>
            <li> Live everything Foxbrim,  this is an awesome moisturizer.  It has slightly masculine scent so it&#x27;s very appropriate for the men.  I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this company.  You can read the full review on my blog:  http://www.followthevoicewithin.com/foxbrim-seaweed-complex-lotion-review/</li>
            <li> It moisturized my face ok. Smells good and masculine. Seemed a little more synthetic than I expected and also thin - like I had to use a lot if I wanted full moisturization after shaving or if its really brisk outside. I am mostly Italian and have olive skin. I am going to go back to all natural, thick moisturizers like Amazing Face or stuff from Organic Fields of Heather.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It soaks right in while leaving my skin silky smooth. I put on before my makeup and alone. My favorite part is the quality ingredients that go on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used this twice and i love this stuff. I only needed a little amount.  My skin absorbed it immediately.  I think I&#x27;ve finally found my moisturizer.  I does not come in a big package but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Highly recommend. Buy it!!</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients and the fact that it is fragrance free.  I wish a little less would come out with one pump.  I feel like the one pump is too much for my face.  I usually notice tightness after washing my face and using my old lotion.  This feels great and I feel like it has helped reduce lines.</li>
            <li> I was given a big discount for agreeing to review this lotion, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t be honest. It feels wonderful going on, absorbs well and makes my skin feel fabulous. Time will tell if it makes me look better to anyone else, but I think I look better and that what counts.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion. From the very first day I started using it my love keeps getting stonger. It smells great, isnt greasy (which I love) and doesnt break me out like most lotions do. I will be purchasing this again as soon as I run out if not before. I have already recommended this product to my family and friends. You wont be sorry if you purchase this product! Best lotion Ive used by far!!!</li>
            <li> Good cream I guess.. Did not notice a huge improvement of skin..</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! It really is. I have extremely dry skin and so many facial products just make it 10x worse. This first thing I noticed about this product is the smell. It’s light and fresh. The scent is very “cool”. It’s hard to explain other than that. I like that it could very easily work for both male and females.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is the consistency. It’s thick and had just the right amount of oil. It was perfect as facial lotion to use every morning after washing my face. It didn’t absorb too quickly into my pores so it was great to massage in. Once absorbed, my face felt so smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion doesn’t work for just the face, though. I used it on a lot of the dry areas on my body-ankles, knees, elbows, and hands. And, let me tell you…if you run it on right after shaving your legs they will feel heavenly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, really am satisfied with this lotion and I don’t say that very often. Both my daughter and I suffer from eczema that causes our skin to be irritatingly dry and some lotions don’t even help in the slightest.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product but unfortunately my skin breaks out when using it. Customer service is excellent, I emailed them explaining I wanted to return it as it didn&#x27;t work with my skin and they refunded the money and told me it wasn&#x27;t necessary to send the product back.</li>
            <li> This cream moisturizes well but it smells identical to Heineken, Maybe I got a bad batch but it seems weird to moisturize my face with beer smelling lotion.</li>
            <li> After being diagnosed with a thyroid issue and having to take daily medication that dried out my skin, I had to discontinue using a name brand independent product I had used for 15 years because I needed more moisture. I have sensitive combo skin so I decided to give this product a try. I have used it for about 2 weeks. It works like a charm on my skin and works perfect under makeup. The only issue I have is that there is a bit of shine on my face because of excess oil (which I expected to happen because it has with every other new product I try); however, it is minimal enough to continue using this product. This product is scentless (to me).</li>
            <li> I wanted a light facial moisturizer for daily wear an Foxbrim&#x27;s Ocean Mineral Lotion is fantastic! Very light and does not cause my acne prone skin to breakout. I will be purchasing this again. Maybe I&#x27;ll get my boyfriend to use it. Men need to moisturize too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love! Smells great, and feels great on my skin! I will continue buying this product!</li>
