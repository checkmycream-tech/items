            <li>Very good, worth my five stars</li>
            <li>super good!</li>
            <li>The bristles are amazing, they dont fall out like some do</li>
            <li>I used this brush for blending on mineral powder foundation and it was simply amazing.</li>
            <li>amazing quality for the price, somewhere between 2 and 3 dollars.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing ,  I would recommend to others</li>
            <li>I use it with concealer and foundation and it works absolutely amazing, 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li>But it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Holds, applies and blends powder amazingly.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it&#x27;s a GOOD brush.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job of evenly distributing makeup and blending.</li>
            <li>I wore liquid foundation and it gives a nice finish...</li>
            <li>nice.  </li>
            <li>I figure at this price they have to be rejects of some kind.  </li>
            <li>This brush blends nicely.</li>
            <li>and it was nice,</li>
            <li>However, at this price, who honestly cares.  </li>
            <li>Loved it one of my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The material is so nice</li>
            <li>Very pleased I ordered 2 brushes they are very soft perfect for applying blush or bronzed.</li>
            <li>I tried it out right away and absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li>Quick shipment and great price.</li>
            <li>Very soft and applies powder makeup flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Omg I love this brush because it is so much better than the foundation sponge!</li>
            <li>The best brush I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li>Very soft and applies very nicely!</li>
            <li>Wow this brush is awesome!</li>
            <li>So soft and perfect !</li>
            <li>Really soft and applies wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This is the most AMAZING brush I have ever used for foundation.  </li>
            <li>the application was fast and easy and the result was flawless.</li>
            <li>Im happy that i bought it, ive always been very dedicated to a certain sponge for application, but not anymore, this brush makes for a faster more flawless finish than a sponge or finger tips and saves on the foundation as well.</li>
            <li>Great brushes easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li>The powder went on even, blended, and very smooth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush good quality &amp; the price is good :))))</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on okay product but very cheap</li>
            <li>and it is so soft and very good quality</li>
            <li>Very soft and good for blush!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it going to order another one</li>
            <li>I really love this brush.</li>
            <li>Would prob work much better with powder foundation.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love this brush, ordering 2 more</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a bit more density.  </li>
            <li>And the free shipping!</li>
            <li>My Mum fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>but to date I love it.</li>
            <li>I use this brush for my foundation and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used sponges or my hands to apply my foundation, but this brush is so much better.</li>
            <li>I just love this brush and how well it blends my makeup.</li>
            <li>Now when I apply the foundation it looked flawless on me, I loved how it had an airbrush look on me, in my opinion it was worth it especially for its price</li>
            <li>I love it, and just ordered more.</li>
            <li>A MUST BUY IT IS EVERYTHING AND MORE</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a good product for the price, especially if you have super glue laying around!</li>
            <li>This brush fits in your hand pretty well, the bristles are very soft on my skin (and it feels really good), its portable and cheap.</li>
            <li>; (hands are NOT petite) and these are wonderful and clearly I can be all up in my daughter&#x27;s personal space when applying her make-up so a shorter handle is a non-issue for me.</li>
            <li>I love it makes my makeup go on more natural</li>
            <li>love how soft the bristles are :)</li>
            <li>The price was also fantastic and a super speedy delivery.</li>

            <li>This brush is so soft and cute!</li>
            <li>so soft I love it !</li>
            <li>True, it comes all the way from China, which seems like forever...</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but to be fair</li>
            <li>at the price point, I figured I&#x27;d be able to try it without too much risk and worry.</li>
            <li>I love them sooooo much</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast. :)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-packed full of bristles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loving it and it has no shedding so far.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s actually soft and feels nice on skin.</li>
            <li>I love the size very compact to carry around in my make up bag.</li>
            <li>Came late but its perfect</li>
            <li>also it&#x27;s very soft and fits perfectly for my small hands : ))</li>
            <li>and the hairs are super soft and pick up nicely.  </li>
            <li>but its an easy fix with some hot glue</li>
            <li>There was no odd odor which is nice.</li>
            <li>Other than that great price.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and works well.</li>
            <li>i kind of just ordered this for the low price cuz i needed the 35$ to get free shipping.</li>
            <li>but handle needs super glue keeps trying to fall off</li>
            <li>and I received it fairly quick.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this brush to anyone, whether you are a beginner or a pro, you will LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li>I just have to clean it more often than usual but still a good buy.</li>
            <li>I was using foam sponges before and it wasnt applying right, i ordered this brush because it was cheap and it was well worth my money.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the products and look forward to ordering from them in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not terribly sad though because it was ridiculously cheap</li>
            <li>It could be good for people who like changing their brushes often, but you would have to be ordering them way ahead of time because the shipping takes so long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, but strong too!</li>
            <li>For the price this is a pretty good facial brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good brush, but it is SHORT (Palm size).</li>
            <li>My first and inexpensive foundation brush!</li>
            <li>Light weight, small so it fits perfect in any makeup bag and its so soft.</li>
            <li>Soft! does not absorb too much product and is easy to use, this product is worth the money and more</li>
            <li>Very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>so soft &amp; small but handy &amp; cute works amazing</li>

            <li>It wasn&#x27;t in any kind of special packaging, but that&#x27;s fine by me because that means less to recycle or throw away.</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait</li>
            <li>However it is well worth the wait.</li>

            <li>well :) the only problem I have is when I go to clean it with my brush cleanser</li>
            <li>And it looks pretty sturdy, with a nice, wooden handle and everything.</li>
            <li>This brush is soooo soft, it&#x27;s small but perfect to carry in your purse or to a trip.</li>

            <li>Great quality for this small brush.</li>

            <li>When i first opened it i thought &amp;#34;What in the world&amp;#34; because its small but that was my fault for not checking lol.</li>
            <li>Other than that its a very nice brush with very soft bristols .</li>

            <li>LOVE this little brush.</li>
            <li>I love this little brush.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and well made, it blends really well on your face.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using it some brissels have started to stick out and such but it is still very usable and applies foundation on my face pretty well.</li>
            <li>Although I wanted an economical option, I was a bit leery about this option since it not only was made in China</li>
            <li>The bristles are too soft to apply foundation that&#x27;s usually full coverage, so it comes out looking sheer.</li>
            <li>Just received it and will purchase a few more if it is not a &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34;....  </li>
            <li>I have only cleaned it once, but found that it cleaned easily and dried quickly.</li>
            <li>I was buying new make-up brushes because I&#x27;m doing my daughter&#x27;s make-up for prom.</li>
            <li>I was a bit shocked that this brush would be good for the cheap price I paid.</li>
            <li>It arrived towards the latter end of the delivery range, but that&#x27;s okay because it was still within the expected time frame.</li>
            <li>It took about 2 weeks to get here and it cane earlier than expected I love it</li>
            <li>Its really very soft and i like to use it every time.</li>
            <li>Brush bristles are very very soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all</li>
            <li>This brush was very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft and applies my foundation evenly.</li>
            <li>Brush is very soft</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>It is very soft.</li>
            <li>The brush is as soft as high quality brushes.</li>

            <li>no more sponges for me :)</li>
            <li>The bristles are so amazingly soft and do not shed!</li>
            <li>Soft brush that is affordable and works so well!</li>
            <li>it is worth it and especially if your starting off with makeup and just looking for a decent makeup brush.</li>
            <li>It has a nice wooden handle and is small and compact.</li>
            <li>They washed up well too-these flat ones seem to wash up better than the other foundation brushes.</li>
            <li>The actual bristles are very soft and my makeup goes on much smoother than it did when I used a sponge.</li>
            <li>Bristles are not stiff either.</li>
            <li>Super soft, some bristles were a bit longer than the other.</li>

            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>no shedding so far</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of beauty blenders nor foundations sponges because they leave your makeup looking superficial  and so much natural.</li>
            <li>Soft and helps with foundation applications.</li>
            <li>and it is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s probably because I lived near the person who did shipped it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft.</li>
            <li>It is so soft, I am not even joking.</li>
            <li>So, so soft.</li>
            <li>It provides complete coverage</li>
            <li>soft bristles that dont fall out.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really soft too.</li>
            <li>It had a bit of an odor (like manufactured goods often do), but it aired out and went away within a day.</li>
            <li>Its Soft</li>
            <li>it was soft and its compact</li>
            <li>This brush came way before it was estimated to come, and it is really soft</li>
            <li>but this is what my imagination developed.</li>
            <li>It is so soft too.</li>
            <li>Mines came in today and it so soft can&#x27;t wait to use is it..</li>
            <li>Soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Soft and blends my foundation well</li>
            <li>The bristles are sooo soft guys</li>
            <li>omg if you&#x27;ve guys ever tried the EcoTools makeup brushes, they&#x27;re as soft as that.</li>
            <li>But the hair is really soft.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s alright its really soft</li>
            <li>I just got it and the brush is extremely soft</li>
            <li>This brush is surprisingly soft and functional.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so soft and plush on my skin</li>
            <li>it is a soft brush, but it doesnt seem to shed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li>It is so soft on the skin and make applying Foundation wayyyyy easier.  </li>
            <li>and it is really really soft.  </li>
            <li>So I was surprised when it came to me.</li>
            <li>It was soooo dense, the bristles are so soft, and the brush all in all is so well made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sad, I loved it.</li>
            <li>quality was not too good, it is difficult to do make up with this brush..</li>
            <li>and if your just looking for a current foundation brush and don&#x27;t have the money for the high end brushes.</li>
            <li>However, after using it almost everyday for a month, it came apart and the bristles were much less effective.</li>
            <li>so it will fit in a small travel makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars only because I have to use a blending sponge to make it look smoother but other than that it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I actually had the opposite reaction to most of the reviewers - this brush was bigger than I expected!  </li>
            <li>but at the same time i don&#x27;t want to get the soft brush messed up!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to store easily</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth it for powder and foundation applications and rivals much more expensive brushes!</li>
            <li>This makeup brush arrived very soon, sooner that I expected</li>
            <li>but it was easily fixed for me and also some of the hair does fall out for mine to, but to me its not a big problem.</li>
            <li>but you could barely tell unless you put your nose against the bristles.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expected much from this brush, considering the price.</li>
            <li>the only thing was that it took way too long to get here but other than that its money well spent :)</li>
            <li>I seoperated the two pieces and put a few drops of super glue along the inside of the metal and stuck it back on.</li>
            <li>this brush definitely left my foundation even and smooth on my face compared to using a common foundation brush.</li>
            <li>; It looks EXACTLY as is does in the picture, its about 5.5 inches, maybe a little over</li>
            <li>It was a little hard to clean if the liquid foundation if it was deep into the brush at first, but then I made it to where I could get it off.</li>
            <li>works well for loose powder and is really soft</li>
            <li>It is small, and so its easy for me to use, as i have average length of palm.</li>

            <li> Im happy that i bought it, ive always been very dedicated to a certain sponge for application, but not anymore, this brush makes for a faster more flawless finish than a sponge or finger tips and saves on the foundation as well.</li>
            <li> Great brushes easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> The powder went on even, blended, and very smooth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush good quality &amp; the price is good :))))</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on okay product but very cheap</li>
            <li> and it is so soft and very good quality</li>
            <li> Very soft and good for blush!</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it going to order another one</li>
            <li> I really love this brush.</li>
            <li> Would prob work much better with powder foundation.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love this brush, ordering 2 more</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a bit more density.  </li>
            <li> And the free shipping!</li>
            <li> My Mum fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> but to date I love it.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for my foundation and love it.</li>

            <li> I just love this brush and how well it blends my makeup.</li>
            <li> Now when I apply the foundation it looked flawless on me, I loved how it had an airbrush look on me, in my opinion it was worth it especially for its price</li>
            <li> I love it, and just ordered more.</li>
            <li> A MUST BUY IT IS EVERYTHING AND MORE</li>

            <li> This brush fits in your hand pretty well, the bristles are very soft on my skin (and it feels really good), its portable and cheap.</li>
            <li> ; (hands are NOT petite) and these are wonderful and clearly I can be all up in my daughter&#x27;s personal space when applying her make-up so a shorter handle is a non-issue for me.</li>
            <li> I love it makes my makeup go on more natural</li>
            <li> love how soft the bristles are :)</li>

            <li> True, it comes all the way from China, which seems like forever...</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but to be fair</li>
            <li> at the price point, I figured I&#x27;d be able to try it without too much risk and worry.</li>
            <li> I love them sooooo much</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. :)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-packed full of bristles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving it and it has no shedding so far.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s actually soft and feels nice on skin.</li>
            <li> I love the size very compact to carry around in my make up bag.</li>
            <li> Came late but its perfect</li>
            <li> also it&#x27;s very soft and fits perfectly for my small hands : ))</li>
            <li> and the hairs are super soft and pick up nicely.  </li>
            <li> but its an easy fix with some hot glue</li>
            <li> There was no odd odor which is nice.</li>
            <li> Other than that great price.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> i kind of just ordered this for the low price cuz i needed the 35$ to get free shipping.</li>
            <li> but handle needs super glue keeps trying to fall off</li>
            <li> and I received it fairly quick.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this brush to anyone, whether you are a beginner or a pro, you will LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li> I just have to clean it more often than usual but still a good buy.</li>
            <li> I was using foam sponges before and it wasnt applying right, i ordered this brush because it was cheap and it was well worth my money.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the products and look forward to ordering from them in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not terribly sad though because it was ridiculously cheap</li>
            <li> It could be good for people who like changing their brushes often, but you would have to be ordering them way ahead of time because the shipping takes so long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft, but strong too!</li>
            <li> For the price this is a pretty good facial brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good brush, but it is SHORT (Palm size).</li>
            <li> My first and inexpensive foundation brush!</li>
            <li> Light weight, small so it fits perfect in any makeup bag and its so soft.</li>
            <li> Soft! does not absorb too much product and is easy to use, this product is worth the money and more</li>
            <li> Very soft and easy to clean.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because it is a great little makeup brush</li>
            <li> Great little brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend and I am absolutely purchasing! !! ! !</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t in any kind of special packaging, but that&#x27;s fine by me because that means less to recycle or throw away.</li>
            <li> but well worth the wait</li>
            <li> However it is well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> 100% worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>

            <li> Well worth the wait.</li>

            <li> Go ahead and get it its well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Do keep in mind the time it takes to arrive, so worth the wait if you don&#x27;t  need it right away.</li>
            <li> well :) the only problem I have is when I go to clean it with my brush cleanser</li>
            <li> And it looks pretty sturdy, with a nice, wooden handle and everything.</li>
            <li> This brush is soooo soft, it&#x27;s small but perfect to carry in your purse or to a trip.</li>
            <li> this brush is very dense and soft, great for those days when i need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> The price may be cheap but the brush is high quality.</li>
            <li> Make up looks a lot more natural and goes on a lot more smoother than before with a traditional brush</li>
            <li> Works great, too small though</li>
            <li> Great quality for this small brush.</li>
            <li> It was small, I was expecting a much bigger size but its wonderful because my makeup bag is not that big so its good that it does not take up too much space.</li>
            <li> exactly like the picture , it is small but it works great</li>
            <li> It works quite well VERY quickly, doesn&#x27;t really leave streaks, and is soft on the face comfortable to hold, with practically no shedding, and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb too much makeup.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> When i first opened it i thought &amp;#34;What in the world&amp;#34; because its small but that was my fault for not checking lol.</li>
            <li> Other than that its a very nice brush with very soft bristols .</li>
            <li> Served its purpose, but overall very cheap.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Soft and Fine bristles....washes well.</li>
            <li> Both the brushes are in good shape but did shed a lot at first and now a little bit on occasion</li>
            <li> SUCH a good price for such a great little tool!</li>
            <li> ,i super recommend,I&#x27;m ready to check if they have other kind of brushes too</li>
            <li> I first bought this brush because I wanted to use it for my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> An almost exact replica of Tarte&#x27;s brush.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more of these.</li>
            <li> but it was expected by the picture shown, nice item over all.</li>
            <li> I needed a brush for powdered/pressed makeup as my kiddo got mine pretty gunky.</li>
            <li> Brissles pretty much fell out as soon as I got it!</li>
            <li> This is a steal for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li> This brush is smaller than it looks,but it&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
            <li> only a couple dollars love this brush</li>
            <li> Broke in the first week i got it.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
            <li> The bristles are fairly soft and secure.</li>
            <li> When I first got this brush</li>
            <li> I love the brush only used it once</li>
            <li> I love this brush,  it arrived last week and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> For how cheap it is, and the fact that it is not &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; I&#x27;m truly surprised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Its too plastic like , cheap quality and not firm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but works great &amp; is super soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really fine and soft and the brush itself is very dense.</li>
            <li> I love the flat brush to apply liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I totally was not expecting the quality to be this great for the price I spent.  </li>
            <li> Super soft!</li>
            <li> Super soft!</li>
            <li> It is very small but it very handy on putting on your foundation.</li>
            <li> very soft a very nice foundation brush for such a low price</li>
            <li> It is small but really of a good quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size for my small hands.</li>
            <li> It has far more density than the standard low end brush but just for my preference I appreciate a bit more.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot since I only wear makeup on special occasions.</li>
            <li> Short, sweet, and to the point.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and small.</li>

            <li> but I actually like it better than my regular brush...</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be my number one choice for foundation, but it&#x27;s a decent brush nonetheless.</li>

            <li> Just received this cute little brush today, took about 3 weeks to arrive from China..</li>
            <li> LOVE this little brush.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and well made, it blends really well on your face.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it some brissels have started to stick out and such but it is still very usable and applies foundation on my face pretty well.</li>
            <li> Although I wanted an economical option, I was a bit leery about this option since it not only was made in China</li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft to apply foundation that&#x27;s usually full coverage, so it comes out looking sheer.</li>
            <li> Just received it and will purchase a few more if it is not a &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34;....  </li>
            <li> I have only cleaned it once, but found that it cleaned easily and dried quickly.</li>
            <li> I was buying new make-up brushes because I&#x27;m doing my daughter&#x27;s make-up for prom.</li>
            <li> I was a bit shocked that this brush would be good for the cheap price I paid.</li>
            <li> It arrived towards the latter end of the delivery range, but that&#x27;s okay because it was still within the expected time frame.</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks to get here and it cane earlier than expected I love it</li>

            <li> The quality of the hair was beyond my expectations, very very soft.</li>
            <li> I havent used it yet but its very soft.</li>

            <li> It is extremely user friendly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sooo soft!</li>
            <li> no more sponges for me :)</li>
            <li> The bristles are so amazingly soft and do not shed!</li>
            <li> Soft brush that is affordable and works so well!</li>
            <li> it is worth it and especially if your starting off with makeup and just looking for a decent makeup brush.</li>
            <li> It has a nice wooden handle and is small and compact.</li>
            <li> They washed up well too-these flat ones seem to wash up better than the other foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> The actual bristles are very soft and my makeup goes on much smoother than it did when I used a sponge.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not stiff either.</li>
            <li> Super soft, some bristles were a bit longer than the other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft but the bristles have a tendacy to fall out.</li>
            <li> The bristles are unbelievably soft as well.</li>
            <li> The fibers are soft but sturdy.</li>
            <li> The hairs are soft.</li>

            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> no shedding so far</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of beauty blenders nor foundations sponges because they leave your makeup looking superficial  and so much natural.</li>
            <li> Soft and helps with foundation applications.</li>
            <li> and it is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably because I lived near the person who did shipped it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft.</li>
            <li> It is so soft, I am not even joking.</li>
            <li> So, so soft.</li>
            <li> It provides complete coverage</li>
            <li> soft bristles that dont fall out.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft too.</li>
            <li> It had a bit of an odor (like manufactured goods often do), but it aired out and went away within a day.</li>
            <li> Its Soft</li>
            <li> it was soft and its compact</li>
            <li> This brush came way before it was estimated to come, and it is really soft</li>
            <li> but this is what my imagination developed.</li>
            <li> It is so soft too.</li>
            <li> Mines came in today and it so soft can&#x27;t wait to use is it..</li>
            <li> Soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Soft and blends my foundation well</li>
            <li> The bristles are sooo soft guys</li>
            <li> omg if you&#x27;ve guys ever tried the EcoTools makeup brushes, they&#x27;re as soft as that.</li>
            <li> But the hair is really soft.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s alright its really soft</li>
            <li> I just got it and the brush is extremely soft</li>
            <li> This brush is surprisingly soft and functional.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so soft and plush on my skin</li>
            <li> it is a soft brush, but it doesnt seem to shed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> It is so soft on the skin and make applying Foundation wayyyyy easier.  </li>
            <li> and it is really really soft.  </li>
            <li> So I was surprised when it came to me.</li>
            <li> It was soooo dense, the bristles are so soft, and the brush all in all is so well made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad, I loved it.</li>
            <li> quality was not too good, it is difficult to do make up with this brush..</li>
            <li> and if your just looking for a current foundation brush and don&#x27;t have the money for the high end brushes.</li>
            <li> However, after using it almost everyday for a month, it came apart and the bristles were much less effective.</li>
            <li> so it will fit in a small travel makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars only because I have to use a blending sponge to make it look smoother but other than that it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I actually had the opposite reaction to most of the reviewers - this brush was bigger than I expected!  </li>
            <li> but at the same time i don&#x27;t want to get the soft brush messed up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to store easily</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth it for powder and foundation applications and rivals much more expensive brushes!</li>
            <li> This makeup brush arrived very soon, sooner that I expected</li>
            <li> but it was easily fixed for me and also some of the hair does fall out for mine to, but to me its not a big problem.</li>
            <li> but you could barely tell unless you put your nose against the bristles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expected much from this brush, considering the price.</li>
            <li> the only thing was that it took way too long to get here but other than that its money well spent :)</li>
            <li> I seoperated the two pieces and put a few drops of super glue along the inside of the metal and stuck it back on.</li>
            <li> this brush definitely left my foundation even and smooth on my face compared to using a common foundation brush.</li>
            <li> ; It looks EXACTLY as is does in the picture, its about 5.5 inches, maybe a little over</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to clean if the liquid foundation if it was deep into the brush at first, but then I made it to where I could get it off.</li>
            <li> works well for loose powder and is really soft</li>
            <li> It is small, and so its easy for me to use, as i have average length of palm.</li>
            <li> It is ever so slightly softer than the really high end brushes you&#x27;d find in the shops or the stuff in Sephora.  </li>
            <li> When I first got the brush it was very fluffy.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 star is the brush had a slight smell to it, and a few shedding bristles from it right out the package before I even used it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the right size for my face: not too wide or too small</li>
            <li> Very soft and holds my foundation well :) has sort of a bad smell</li>
            <li> was not satisfied, took much longer than excpected and does not evenly apply foundation</li>
            <li> Before I used a flat foundation brush and my face always looks...streaky</li>
            <li> About 3 inches long in total.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very long, but the brush is terrific.</li>
            <li> The brush came earlier than I expected it to come and it even came with a personal note thanking me for my purchase</li>
            <li> The brush is soft but firm enough so</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about purchasing this brush because the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s about 4 inches long.</li>
            <li> and there was minor shedding</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried it with wet foundation, but will in the future.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brush like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> It took long to arrive.</li>
            <li> verrrrryyyy long shipping time though.</li>
            <li> somehow i have managed to put it together but don&#x27;t know how long it will stick.</li>
            <li> The shipping took forever I expected the brush to be bigger</li>
            <li> The brush arrived over a week earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars but took so long</li>
            <li> Its really soft but also firm.</li>
            <li> its small but very soft</li>
            <li> I bought two from two different sellers and one was nicer and fluffier than the other.</li>
            <li> Small soft brush.</li>
            <li> However, I did not like how it applied the liquid foundation, so instead I used it for my pressed and loose powder</li>
            <li> I use this with my make-up forever duo matte foundation (it&#x27;s powder form in a compact,not loose powder)</li>
            <li> Loose brushes with bristles falling out on arrival.</li>
            <li> I use it with wet and dry products.</li>
            <li> I use it to blend my foundation and you need less product than when you use a regular sponge.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase Bare Minerals brushes but I grew tired of paying so much for a makeup brush!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little bigger!</li>
            <li> i just wish it was a little bigger</li>
            <li> It sheds a little bit but no enough to stop me from using it.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s as expected for overseas orders.</li>
            <li> Got here faster than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> The ferl (metal part of brush) was very loose on the handle and wobbled when I used it.</li>
            <li> I cleaned it often and was careful with it</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail and it&#x27;s as expected.</li>
            <li> arrived about 2 weeks before expected.</li>
            <li> then I expected.  </li>
            <li> The brush is small and compact, yet the brush size is big and covers a lot.</li>
            <li> I will be checking out the other items this seller has.</li>
            <li> several fibers coming loose already, but at least they don&#x27;t shed onto my face.</li>
            <li> This brush your is very thick and soft.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, I used to use a typical face sponge and had had very minimal experience with makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something out that would cut down my makeup time and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m checking Amazon to see if this manufacturer makes other make-up brushes!</li>
            <li> the brush came waaay faster than expected !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so tickled that I took the leap of faith because it arrived to me in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Nifty little brush.</li>
            <li> The one thing I didn&#x27;t like is the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t stay in place and the brush ended up fanning out a ot and a lot of those little hairs started falling out.</li>
            <li> I have seen little to no fallout from this brush.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it literally everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it with liquid foundation and application takes probably less than 4 minutes!</li>
            <li> Very small not what I expected</li>
            <li> Too stiff for powder..</li>
            <li> A little small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to my friend who tried to sell me a Younique brush, but this little one is all I need and will likely buy going forward.</li>
            <li> I have a small face, but I still needed to blend the tight places with my fingers!  </li>
            <li> Its a small brush</li>
            <li> Quite small</li>
            <li> It is small, but defiantly does the job.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> Small</li>
            <li> Unbelievable....</li>
            <li> but it fits right in your hand so using it isn&#x27;t annoying or anything</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are so soft but they kinda have a unpleasant smell on them which makes me worry a bit.</li>
            <li> and im not sure what is bad about soft??</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting all the foundation off</li>
            <li> It gets hard</li>
            <li> It does shed a little but nothing too crazy.</li>
            <li> People who don&#x27;t want to spend money on buying expensive brushes can give a try to this one.</li>
            <li> The day i received it and opened the package brush was detached from the stick which made it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> and it does shed, but not too bad if it take care of it.</li>
            <li> For the price I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst brush ever!</li>

However, I did not like how it applied the liquid foundation, so instead I used it for my pressed and loose powder and I&#x27;m much happier. This brush fits in your hand pretty well, the bristles are very soft on my skin (and it feels really good), its portable and cheap. Overall I recommend this brush for powder makeup.</li>
            <li> Great product, nice, large, and soft. Highly satisfied!</li>
            <li> greate price, awesome product</li>
            <li> I like this brush. It&#x27;s really soft but the bristles have a tendacy to fall out.</li>
            <li> It blends my foundation out perfectly I love this brush!</li>
            <li> I really love this brush. Its really very soft and i like to use it every time. Thank you AMAZON for quick delivery ::))&lt;br /&gt;Iam happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> OMG I loveeee this brush I use it to apply my liquid foundation and I have never had such a great application.. It does shed a little but nothing too crazy. TOOK FOREVER TO GET HERE (NY) but well worth the wait</li>
            <li> I use this with liquid foundation and it goes on a bit streaky. Would prob work much better with powder foundation. Other than that great price.</li>
            <li> great fondation brush. Too stiff for powder..</li>
            <li> Very soft and applies powder makeup flawlessly. Love it</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I recently switched to MAC Face &amp; Body Foundation and this brush gives a smooth, flawless application. So much more affordable than department store brushes and really gets the job done! I have only cleaned it once, but found that it cleaned easily and dried quickly.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are so soft but they kinda have a unpleasant smell on them which makes me worry a bit. However, this brush seems to work well with my bobbi brown blush</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush, Im very satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup brush!!</li>
            <li> Omg I love this brush because it is so much better than the foundation sponge! This brush works well with liquid foundation, it has a clean finish on my face-flawless!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, ordering 2 more so I have them on hand when needed as shipping takes a while from over seas. Good for powder or liquid foundation. These rival what I buy in the mall!</li>
            <li> Brush is really tiny but that makes it easy to carry. For being inexpensive, it works very well. The bristles are unbelievably soft as well.</li>
            <li> Its perfect for powder but i got it for liquid foundation, not so much.</li>
            <li> Brush bristles are very very soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all</li>
            <li> exactly like the picture , it is small but it works great the only thing was that it took way too long to get here but other than that its money well spent :)</li>
            <li> For the price this is a pretty good facial brush. The handle is very nicely finished in person. It seems to be well made. The fibers are soft but sturdy. I just wish it had a bit more density.  It has far more density than the standard low end brush but just for my preference I appreciate a bit more. I have been using this brush daily for my powder foundation since it arrived.</li>
            <li> Nifty little brush. The hairs are soft. True, it comes all the way from China, which seems like forever...But the price! And the free shipping! And most importantly, it&#x27;s a GOOD brush. My Mum fell in love with it. She&#x27;s ordered one too.</li>
            <li> Great brush &amp; very good for compact powder</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and cute! The bristles seem sturdy and haven&#x27;t fallen out as of yet. It does a nice job of evenly distributing makeup and blending.</li>
            <li> This brush was very soft. I Use it for blending in my foundation and apply my powder</li>
            <li> LOVE this little brush. Applies foundation just like I hoped it would. Looks airbrushed!</li>
            <li> It came in faster than estimated! I thought it would be a little bigger but it&#x27;s fine! Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was a bit shocked that this brush would be good for the cheap price I paid. I washed it before i used it and there was minor shedding but to date I love it. Its a small brush that&#x27;s great for your makeup bag in your purse.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works well. Very soft and applies my foundation evenly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for about a week now and I really like this brush. Before I used a flat foundation brush and my face always looks...streaky and I had to blend with sponge after applying foundation to my face. Not with this brush.. The brush is soft and well made, it blends really well on your face. The only thing is it took a while for shipping. However it is well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well for the price. Since I&#x27;ve been using it some brissels have started to stick out and such but it is still very usable and applies foundation on my face pretty well. I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars only because I have to use a blending sponge to make it look smoother but other than that it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft! Great price. No shedding yet.</li>
            <li> When I first got the brush it was very fluffy. After a couple of uses it lost its fluffiness but it&#x27;s still as very great brush for the price</li>
            <li> Smooth and easy to carry</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!!! I just ordered last week, and it already here! It is PERFECT for blending my liquid foundation. Totally recommend!!</li>
            <li> Great value! I usually purchase Bare Minerals brushes but I grew tired of paying so much for a makeup brush! I use this brush for my foundation and love it.</li>
            <li> Wow this brush is awesome! So soft and the quality is unreal for the price.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Size great for travel.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought it would be but it works great!</li>
            <li> Awesome brush I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I actually had the opposite reaction to most of the reviewers - this brush was bigger than I expected!  I have a small face, but I still needed to blend the tight places with my fingers!  It works quite well VERY quickly, doesn&#x27;t really leave streaks, and is soft on the face comfortable to hold, with practically no shedding, and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb too much makeup.  SUCH a good price for such a great little tool!</li>
            <li> Came 2 weeks early than estimated delivery date! It&#x27;s small but works great &amp; is super soft. 100% worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth the price. Cute and compact but readily available in the hand. Bristles are not stiff either. I use this brush for applying liquid and or powder foundation</li>
            <li> Super soft! I washed it 7 times already and still in good condition and soft.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this brush, but kind of wary because our it&#x27;s price, but I absolutely love it!!! I&#x27;ve always used sponges or my hands to apply my foundation, but this brush is so much better.</li>
            <li> So soft. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive brush! Love this brush! I use daily and it looks and works great.</li>
            <li> My first stipple brush and I love it! Makes my makeup go on with an airbrush finish. Will be ordering another to use with my sfx makeup. Fits right into my hand, sturdy, soft and dense so the products stays on it. Used both liquid foundation, powder, and paints on it</li>
            <li> This brush your is very thick and soft. I have small hands so the small handle is perfect for me üëç üëç</li>
            <li> Suuuper soft! Lov it!</li>
            <li> Super soft, some bristles were a bit longer than the other. i just trimmed them. no shedding so far</li>
            <li> So soft and perfect ! Mine arrived 2 1/2 weeks early !</li>
            <li> Awesome brush! Make up looks a lot more natural and goes on a lot more smoother than before with a traditional brush only con is I thought the brush would be bigger but still a great product for the price</li>
            <li> this brush is great in many ways!! I use it with wet and dry products. It does better with pressed powder than loose powder. It is the PERFECT size for applying blush. It is also a great travel size. Has only shed a hair or two. Very soft!&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT** I have now owned the brush for about 8-9 months, and the shedding got unbearable so I threw it in the trash. It&#x27;s sad, I loved it. I will be ordering it again because of the great deal.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment and great price.</li>
            <li> JUST DID NOT WORK FOR ME</li>
            <li> For the price of this product, this brush is worth it. I have used it a couple times and it applies my foundation wonderful. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright for the price.</li>
            <li> good brush, prevent streaks across your face, first time i washed my brushes the handle broke off. but its an easy fix with some hot glue</li>
            <li> I am in love with this brush I spent about months looking for a foundation brush that can leave my foundation looking natural and matte. I am not a fan of beauty blenders nor foundations sponges because they leave your makeup looking superficial  and so much natural. Its is cheap but I have no problem with buying an item that is cheap jet efficient.</li>
            <li> An almost exact replica of Tarte&#x27;s brush. Super soft, no bristle loss, and works great for applying my foundation.  It does come from China so it takes 3-4 weeks to get to the U.S. but well worth the savings!</li>
            <li> This brush works very well with my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Great  product, waited longer for delivery because of USPS but extremely happy with brush its very soft and perfect travel size.</li>
            <li> excellent brush. Soft and helps with foundation applications. Will buy another.</li>
            <li> very soft bristles, amazing quality for the price! several fibers coming loose already, but at least they don&#x27;t shed onto my face.</li>
            <li> Worst brush ever! Hair fell out on first use!!</li>
            <li> super good! I just have to clean it more often than usual but still a good buy.</li>
            <li> Love this! I use this for my foundation and it&#x27;s wonderful! The brush is so soft too!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Works as well as my bare minerals full coverage brush and for a fraction of the price. I will definitely purchase more of these. Great size. Perfect for travel or everyday use! I use this with my make-up forever duo matte foundation (it&#x27;s powder form in a compact,not loose powder)</li>
            <li> I came across this brush on amazon. I had been looking for a good foundation brush. The price made me question the quality of the brush but im very happy to report its the best makeup brush i have ever owned. I love this brush so much. I was having proplems with my mineral makeup before i got this and it blends my makeup better than any other brush i have owned. It has a nice wooden handle and is small and compact. The bristles are amazing, they dont fall out like some do which was one thing i was worried about b/c it was so cheap. The price may be cheap but the brush is high quality. I just love this brush and how well it blends my makeup.</li>
            <li> I just received this brush two days ago but I&#x27;m already in love with it! The size is perfect. It&#x27;s small enough to store easily but it fits right in your hand so using it isn&#x27;t annoying or anything and it is incredibly soft. I&#x27;ve never used a brush like this and I really like the way it makes my makeup look. As for shipping, it took over a month but that&#x27;s as expected for overseas orders. For the price, its worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush arrived very soon, sooner that I expected but that&#x27;s probably because I lived near the person who did shipped it. The quality of the brush is pretty okay, for $2 it is worth it and especially if your starting off with makeup and just looking for a decent makeup brush. Some of the  hair on the foundation brush has some parts sticking together that was a downfall but it was easily fixed for me and also some of the hair does fall out for mine to, but to me its not a big problem. Now when I apply the foundation it looked flawless on me, I loved how it had an airbrush look on me, in my opinion it was worth it especially for its price and if your just looking for a current foundation brush and don&#x27;t have the money for the high end brushes.</li>
            <li> loved it no doubt its a great makeup brush and the price too!</li>
            <li> I used this brush for blending on mineral powder foundation and it was simply amazing. The powder went on even, blended, and very smooth. I love it, and just ordered more. I&#x27;ve never tried it with wet foundation, but will in the future. Right now I&#x27;m in love with the powder application.</li>
            <li> Very good, worth my five stars</li>
            <li> A little small but it was expected by the picture shown, nice item over all.</li>
            <li> Really liked this brush at first. It&#x27;s really soft. The one thing I didn&#x27;t like is the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t stay in place and the brush ended up fanning out a ot and a lot of those little hairs started falling out. So I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> A MUST BUY IT IS EVERYTHING AND MORE ONLY DISLIKE WOULD BE HOW SHORT THE HANDLE IS BUT I LOVE IT EASY TO CLEAN AND APPLY FOUNDATION ‚ô°</li>
            <li> Love this! Very nice, feels great in my face.</li>
            <li> amazing quality for the price, somewhere between 2 and 3 dollars. works well for loose powder and is really soft</li>
            <li> Really good quality and for the price it&#x27;s amazing ,  I would recommend to others</li>
            <li> Soft! does not absorb too much product and is easy to use, this product is worth the money and more</li>
            <li> Soft and Fine bristles....washes well.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever. Glides my foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Delivery was super fast. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Best blending brush I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> This is a great little Kabuki brush.  What a surprise for the price.  Washed it, used it and no hairs on my face. Bargain</li>
            <li> So easy to use....nice n cheap...</li>
            <li> cute makeup brushes looks like the photo. the price was a steal</li>
            <li> I have been so excited for this brush to arrive, and it finally did! It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but to be fair, I didn&#x27;t read the information thoroughly. This brush is probably the best brush I own. It is so soft, I am not even joking. So, so soft. And it looks pretty sturdy, with a nice, wooden handle and everything. I will recommend it to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> Great brush. I love using it to apply my liquid foundation. It provides complete coverage</li>
            <li> I like this product it seems like a high end bush</li>
            <li> Quite small but that dosent matter. Brush is very soft</li>
            <li> Love this brush!!! I use it for my cream foundation, and it works beautifully!!! Recommend on buying it and week but again!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this foundation brush. It helps blend my foundation really well.  The size is perfect to fit in my make up bag.</li>
            <li> With this cheap price this brush is awesome... I wore liquid foundation and it gives a nice finish... People who don&#x27;t want to spend money on buying expensive brushes can give a try to this one.</li>
            <li> Not for me, does not conceal my spots at all</li>
            <li> This is my favorite my brush for putting on foundation! It&#x27;s so soft and no hairs fall out!</li>
            <li> nice.  I like it. soft bristles that dont fall out.</li>
            <li> I was buying new make-up brushes because I&#x27;m doing my daughter&#x27;s make-up for prom. I purchased two of these for liquid and powder. I&#x27;d never used a brush for liquid foundation application before and I LOVE IT!! This brush works fantastic for applying liquid and powder. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. Yes the brushes are smaller but I&#x27;m 5&#x27;11&amp;#34; (hands are NOT petite) and these are wonderful and clearly I can be all up in my daughter&#x27;s personal space when applying her make-up so a shorter handle is a non-issue for me. I&#x27;m checking Amazon to see if this manufacturer makes other make-up brushes! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Thank you I love it very excited ‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> It is very small but it very handy on putting on your foundation. But if your a makeup styles and don&#x27;t like getting to close to your clients face than this should should by just for you. It came REALLY EARLIER so that was good</li>
            <li> I love it makes my makeup go on more natural</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about purchasing this brush because the price was so cheap. But I am amazed at how well this brush blends my make up. I use it every morning when doing my make up routine. It gives my face a flawless look. It is small, but defiantly does the job. The bristles are really soft too.</li>
            <li> Very soft. Came earlier than expected over all good</li>
            <li> The brush came earlier than I expected it to come and it even came with a personal note thanking me for my purchase I am very pleased with the products and look forward to ordering from them in the future.</li>
            <li> I needed a brush for powdered/pressed makeup as my kiddo got mine pretty gunky. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot since I only wear makeup on special occasions. Although I wanted an economical option, I was a bit leery about this option since it not only was made in China but it also was shipping from there, but at the price point, I figured I&#x27;d be able to try it without too much risk and worry. I&#x27;m so tickled that I took the leap of faith because it arrived to me in less than 2 weeks. It wasn&#x27;t in any kind of special packaging, but that&#x27;s fine by me because that means less to recycle or throw away. It had a bit of an odor (like manufactured goods often do), but it aired out and went away within a day. The bristles are soft and sturdy, I haven&#x27;t experienced any of them falling or pulling out. The application is terrific also. I&#x27;m sorry to my friend who tried to sell me a Younique brush, but this little one is all I need and will likely buy going forward.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this makeup brush.  It is small but really of a good quality and I only paid a couple of bucks for it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  Highly recommend.  It did take a while for it to ship from China but worth the wait.  Quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This brush is soooo soft, it&#x27;s small but perfect to carry in your purse or to a trip. I use it to blend my foundation and you need less product than when you use a regular sponge. PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Got here faster than I expected.  Really soft and applies wonderfully. Really like it</li>
            <li> Its Soft and it does its work. I do like it. I have been using it for a month now.</li>
            <li> makes foundation go on great</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush. I bought 2. Perfect to travel super soft. I use as a powder brush.</li>
            <li> I love love this brush. I do makeup every day and this brush is super soft and perfect  mini size to carry in a cluch, purse. Love it</li>
            <li> great powder and foundation brush</li>
            <li> I love this brush it was soft and its compact so I can carry it with me. I haven&#x27;t had any shedding from it. If needed I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This brush came way before it was estimated to come, and it is really soft I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for powdered foundation and blending contrast. Could also be great for blush or bronzer. It&#x27;s so soft, but strong too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given some time to try out my purchase and see if I like it. The product came as shown in the picture and considering the price, a very good buy! I use this almost every time I apply my makeup and it looks fairly good for the amount I paid. My skin isn&#x27;t the best, and does have minor flaws, but this gives a pretty good result when it comes to looking flawless/smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the flat brush to apply liquid foundation. I find that it&#x27;s applied more evenly and fills wrinkles and pores better. But keep in mind, these brushes are not created equal. What you&#x27;ll get depends on the seller. I bought two from two different sellers and one was nicer and fluffier than the other. Also, these took forever to get!  Almost two months. It&#x27;s almost like they had to wait for rejects to be delivered from the company then overseas shipped-I don&#x27;t know but this is what my imagination developed. I figure at this price they have to be rejects of some kind.  Both the brushes are in good shape but did shed a lot at first and now a little bit on occasion but I can&#x27;t easily pull out any bristles. They washed up well too-these flat ones seem to wash up better than the other foundation brushes. For the price under thee bucks-I would recommend and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation brush! It&#x27;s blends my foundation so well! It is so soft too. It is also very easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday! I love it! Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Oh I am so happy about these foundation brushes!!! I love them sooooo much</li>
            <li> Well Worth the money, very smooth, almost  feel like a brush from Mac...</li>
            <li> Brissles pretty much fell out as soon as I got it! Wouldn&#x27;t buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! It works the way I want it too and it&#x27;s really good at spreading the liquid foundation around. It even works good when I use powder foundation. It does leave lines on your face if you don&#x27;t blend it well, but it&#x27;s not that big a deal. I&#x27;ve had it for a while and it does shed, but not too bad if it take care of it. It was a little hard to clean if the liquid foundation if it was deep into the brush at first, but then I made it to where I could get it off. I would recommend this brush for sure!</li>
            <li> this brush is very dense and soft, great for those days when i need a little more coverage. Shipping was fast. :)</li>
            <li> Perfect travel size for the &amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34; make up bag but I actually like it better than my regular brush... it&#x27;s perfect and blends the (liquid)foundation so well. would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> I am a certified makeup artist and I think these brushes are a dream. I have one in each of my personal makeup bags for home and travel.&lt;br /&gt;They are:&lt;br /&gt;-soft&lt;br /&gt;-compact&lt;br /&gt;-easily washed&lt;br /&gt;-packed full of bristles&lt;br /&gt;-sturdy</li>
            <li> Love the brush!! Works great I wish it was a little bigger! The picture is it next to a regular sized brush</li>
            <li> the brush came waaay faster than expected !! also it&#x27;s very soft and fits perfectly for my small hands : ))</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love the brush i just wish it was a little bigger&lt;br /&gt;I definitely want another one for traveling. Ordering one for mom aswell</li>
            <li> I love it so much! Easy to blend and clean!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best foundation brushes I have ever used. So if you find reviews helpful like I do, I would get this brush. Short, sweet, and to the point.</li>
            <li> Really soft and nice brush great for powder foundation and blush</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price! I&#x27;ve been loving it and it has no shedding so far. I use it with concealer and foundation and it works absolutely amazing, 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> Came in on time and was beautiful. Very soft and effective for blending and applying powder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because it is a great little makeup brush but the shipping took over 3 weeks! I mention that because several reviews said shipping was super fast not in my case!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great but it took a light year to arrive.  Perhaps it&#x27;s made on mars.</li>
            <li> The best brush I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for the price. It is very soft. I am considering though that for some applications a more course brush is required. This is definitely worth it for powder and foundation applications and rivals much more expensive brushes!</li>
            <li> Love it&#x27;s traveling size</li>
            <li> This is a steal for such a cheap price! Super soft bristles and applies my foundation perfectly. It also arrived a lot earlier than I thought it would, so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and small. And it&#x27;s actually soft and feels nice on skin.</li>
            <li> I use this for applying liquid foundation. It works well. The size is great too. It fits in my hand perfectly. This brush blends nicely. Great little brush for the price.</li>
            <li> The brush is as soft as high quality brushes. Seems to be well put together, I only just got it so I&#x27;m not sure yet.</li>
            <li> All time favorite makeup brush. Have had the same one forever and is Still perfect</li>
            <li> Love this foundation brush :)</li>
            <li> Its okay, but feels weird once it&#x27;s cleaned .</li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft to apply foundation that&#x27;s usually full coverage, so it comes out looking sheer.</li>
            <li> Brush is very soft even after a couple of months of use</li>
            <li> this brush isnt the best, i would save my money to buy a better one , but it will do for now i guess</li>
            <li> Works well with mineral foundation powder</li>
            <li> Hi,,,&lt;br /&gt;My husband Kunj, bought for me. I have been looking for a brush like this for a long time. It is extremely user friendly. It spreads foundation, primer, concealer equally and smoothly. It is small, and so its easy for me to use, as i have average length of palm. It comes in great price.</li>
            <li> It is so amazing! It took long to arrive. But it is an amazing product. It gives me a very nice finish. I am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush is smaller than it looks,but it&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Great foundation brush, great fit for my hand.</li>
            <li> A great, affordable brush. I use it to apply my pressed powder after I&#x27;ve used foundation. It took awhile to arrive since it comes from China.</li>
            <li> Mines came in today and it so soft can&#x27;t wait to use is it..</li>
            <li> really soft nice little brush for foundation</li>
            <li> I love the size very compact to carry around in my make up bag. I&#x27;ve used a couple times it has shed about hair at a time every time I use it. At the price I dont mind evens out my foundation very compact and inexpensive. Overall great product.... verrrrryyyy long shipping time though.</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush. I&#x27;ve been using it for blush and it works well for that. I have seen little to no fallout from this brush. The handle seems a bit creaky, as if it may one day separate from the metallic part.</li>
            <li> A great brush, however there was one problem. The wooden part broke off in 2 days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and great quality!</li>
            <li> Amazing price and product!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good packaging. Soft bristles. About 3 inches long in total. Good product. I definetly recommend.</li>
            <li> Served its purpose, but overall very cheap.</li>
            <li> only a couple dollars love this brush I use it all the time it don&#x27;t shed at all</li>
            <li> This is such an awsome buy very cheap and very good quality so soft I love it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily since it came in the mail. Seems like excellent quality for the price. It&#x27;s blends my foundation beautifully and hasn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works great, too small though</li>
            <li> it does work really good. covers well though my only problem was with the stick. The day i received it and opened the package brush was detached from the stick which made it difficult to use. somehow i have managed to put it together but don&#x27;t know how long it will stick.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s small so it&#x27;s easy to work with and the hairs are super soft and pick up nicely.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> The actual bristles are very soft and my makeup goes on much smoother than it did when I used a sponge. It&#x27;s a good size for my small hands. The ferl (metal part of brush) was very loose on the handle and wobbled when I used it. I seoperated the two pieces and put a few drops of super glue along the inside of the metal and stuck it back on. Now, it works perfectly, wobble free. It&#x27;s a good product for the price, especially if you have super glue laying around!</li>
            <li> Flawless n I loved it !!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush good quality &amp; the price is good :))))</li>
            <li> Soft and blends my foundation well</li>
            <li> Super soft and works amazing with liquid foundation, making apply nicely and evenly</li>
            <li> Leaves Your face flawless love it.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! When I first opened my package I couldn&#x27;t stop touching the bristles! They&#x27;re sooo soft! I definitely recommend this brush</li>
            <li> Love it soft blends nicely distributes foundation well</li>
            <li> Soft and easy to use. Use as a Foundation and power brush</li>
            <li> Great quality for this small brush. I thought it would be of cheap quality and I had a big surprise. It&#x27;s one of the ones I use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but sooo soft and does a great job blendingüòÅüëå</li>
            <li> Super soft! Absolutely love it and makes my look flawless</li>
            <li> I was using foam sponges before and it wasnt applying right, i ordered this brush because it was cheap and it was well worth my money. It applies perfectly for a flawless look and feels great.</li>
            <li> Broke in the first week i got it.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
            <li> This is literally the softest brush (the softest anything) I have ever felt in my life. The wood handle &amp; metal are sturdy too. I use it to powder around my eyes and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on okay product but very cheap</li>
            <li> I Just got my bamboo brush , i order it Feb 27 and got it today. When i first opened it i thought &amp;#34;What in the world&amp;#34; because its small but that was my fault for not checking lol. The product it self is wonderful the hair on the brush are soooo soft and really hand to carry around in a mini makeup bag. Its really good to use for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> It arrived towards the latter end of the delivery range, but that&#x27;s okay because it was still within the expected time frame. The brush is small and compact, yet the brush size is big and covers a lot. The bristles are sooo soft guys omg if you&#x27;ve guys ever tried the EcoTools makeup brushes, they&#x27;re as soft as that. I used it for liquid foundation and it was nice, since it&#x27;s synthetic it didn&#x27;t absorb any product. It&#x27;s totally worth it because it&#x27;s not even $3 and even though the shipping is lengthy the brush is so soft and it feels like it&#x27;s good quality. I know ELF carries a similar brush for $3 but I think this one&#x27;s better because it&#x27;s a lot softer than the ELF one and it&#x27;s mini so it will fit in a small travel makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I had written a 1 star review for this item only because I had not received it in a timely manner but I understand the vendor is having shipping problems with her agent.  I finally received the item and find it to be be an excellent product as described and am very happy.</li>
            <li> It took 50 days for me to receive this.... But the hair is really soft. Good brush</li>
            <li> A month and a half to arrive, but a nice brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good brush, but it is SHORT (Palm size). Wooden handle and ferrule are secure, UNLIKE many of the more affordable brushes I have purchased here that fell apart soon after receiving them! The bristles are fairly soft and secure. Shipping did take five weeks. It won&#x27;t be my number one choice for foundation, but it&#x27;s a decent brush nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush! Blend my foundation well :) the only problem I have is when I go to clean it with my brush cleanser I have a hard time getting all the foundation off</li>
            <li> love it, so soft and the hairs do not fall out all over the place.  Im about to order another!</li>
            <li> Beautifully made make up brush!!! Sturdy wooden handle with nice strong yet soft bristles!!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Small but it works wonders....flawless application of my foundation üëçüëç</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush! Please buy!</li>
            <li> When I first got this brush I was so excited. It was soft and a great size and it worked really well with my foundation. However, after using it almost everyday for a month, it came apart and the bristles were much less effective. I cleaned it often and was careful with it but the wooden part separated and I was disappointed. I&#x27;m not terribly sad though because it was ridiculously cheap but I do wish it would have last longer. It could be good for people who like changing their brushes often, but you would have to be ordering them way ahead of time because the shipping takes so long.</li>
            <li> very soft a very nice foundation brush for such a low price</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly, reasonable price and this product works well I use it every time I use foundation!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!! Works perfectly for my foundation !!! Just used it minutes ago n I love it!!!!!!! No negative comments about it!!!!</li>
            <li> Good coverage.. Works good for powder. I think I&#x27;ll use it for shaving too.</li>
            <li> The shipping took forever I expected the brush to be bigger but it&#x27;s alright its really soft And it was cheap</li>
            <li> came today!! I just got it and the brush is extremely soft, cant wait to use it but at the same time i don&#x27;t want to get the soft brush messed up! &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; It looks EXACTLY as is does in the picture, its about 5.5 inches, maybe a little over *** i will write another review when i use it -- can&#x27;t wait  (THANKSGIVING IS SOON!)  ***</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought in length, but it&#x27;s wide and fluffy, perfect for travel. Does an awesome stippling job applying foundation.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shed and it&#x27;s SMOOTH and has fine hairs, LOTS of it. Volume and smoothness, that&#x27;s what u want in a stippling brush.&lt;br /&gt;Price-wise, it&#x27;s Fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I have a ton load of brushes, but I use this shortie one all the time for applying my liquid foundation. Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the right size for my face: not too wide or too small, the coverage is flawless when I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li> love how soft the bristles are :)</li>
            <li> i use this as a blush brush and i love it</li>
            <li> its small but very soft</li>
            <li> Great product, but I don&#x27;t think it works for liquids, unlike some people said</li>
            <li> Great brush for the dollar value</li>
            <li> I over love this brush.</li>
            <li> I totally was not expecting the quality to be this great for the price I spent.  Unbelievable....I would have purchased 3 or 4 had I known.  Just received it and will purchase a few more if it is not a &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34;....  Highly recommend.  You do have to wait awhile....but it was not a prime product.  Well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like about this brush is that the hairs on it become oily when blending creme contour shades. I suggest cleaning it with antibacterial soap every 3-5 days depending on how much you apply makeup with it. A side from that, the brush works good considering the cost.</li>
            <li> This brush is surprisingly soft and functional.  It is ever so slightly softer than the really high end brushes you&#x27;d find in the shops or the stuff in Sephora.  However, at this price, who honestly cares.  If you aren&#x27;t sure if you like using a foundation brush, I just get this one.</li>
            <li> Works well. Great price.</li>
            <li> Loved it one of my favorite.  I definitely recommend and I am absolutely purchasing! !! ! !</li>
            <li> Great brush! Very soft and good for blush!</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for, my makeup looks good but the bristles are already bent</li>
            <li> Very small not what I expected</li>
            <li> My first and inexpensive foundation brush! Very soft and applies very nicely!</li>
            <li> I am re-writing my review as I finally received the product &amp; it works well.</li>
            <li> dont like it, cause quality was not too good, it is difficult to do make up with this brush..</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. It sheds a little bit but no enough to stop me from using it. There was no odd odor which is nice. I would purchase this again for sure!</li>
            <li> product just as described!</li>
            <li> I love the brush only used it once and it&#x27;s so soft and plush on my skin I love the way it feels. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is the brush had a slight smell to it, and a few shedding bristles from it right out the package before I even used it. Great price and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. I think it works best for applying powders however, you can use it for liquid and powder.</li>
            <li> Best brush for powder!  I&#x27;ve reordered 4 more brushes to have on hand and give to friends.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Loose brushes with bristles falling out on arrival. Waste of money. Did not get a refund. Had to throw in garbage</li>
            <li> Small soft brush. Really like it.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Best buy I got on here! Works great, doesn&#x27;t shed and the foundation goes on flawless!</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush. I use it literally everyday.</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail and it&#x27;s as expected. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great brushes easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> arrived about 2 weeks before expected. I love it and im not sure what is bad about soft?? it is a soft brush, but it doesnt seem to shed. i used it to apply my bb cream which is the same consistency as any foundation. the application was fast and easy and the result was flawless. i kind of just ordered this for the low price cuz i needed the 35$ to get free shipping. Im happy that i bought it, ive always been very dedicated to a certain sponge for application, but not anymore, this brush makes for a faster more flawless finish than a sponge or finger tips and saves on the foundation as well. im going to get on for mom and sis too. its great. no more sponges for me :)</li>
            <li> It was great at the start. Then after washed it. It gets hard</li>
            <li> Really happy with the purchase. It&#x27;s pretty high quality.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, soft! ‚ô•</li>
            <li> The brush arrived over a week earlier than expected. I tried it out right away and absolutely loved it! It left my foundation looking flawless. this brush definitely left my foundation even and smooth on my face compared to using a common foundation brush. Its great for giving you a satin like finish no matter what type of foundation you use. I even use it to apply my powder. The bush itself is a perfect size and looks beautiful with its wooden handle. Some people may think its cheap because of the price but it surprisingly is a really good quality brush. Definitely buying again in the future.</li>
            <li> My foundation goes on so easily an plus it&#x27;s cheap!üòä</li>
            <li> This is great! I use it everyday. It&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> This is the most AMAZING brush I have ever used for foundation.  The price was also fantastic and a super speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Great for applying foundation all over definitely my favorite brush</li>
            <li> What can i say i like it its nice, soft, and cheap!! It arrived before it said it would so üëç</li>
            <li> Use it for powder and it works great.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet, but it looks and feels good.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but the britles are super soft.</li>
            <li> Good  but handle needs super glue keeps trying to fall off</li>
            <li> It works good I like it! Would give it 5 stars but took so long</li>
            <li> very soft brush, worth the purchase. It takes about 4 weeks to arrive though.</li>
            <li> I like this bush to put on foundation powder.  It is a very soft brush.  I love it.</li>
            <li> was not satisfied, took much longer than excpected and does not evenly apply foundation</li>
            <li> Very soft for my skin.</li>
            <li> Great lil brush, picks up well.</li>
            <li> I love this brush,  it arrived last week and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  I have had a cosmetology license for years now and from experience I can tell you that the tools (your brushes and/or applicators) can make a big difference in your makeup.  This brush is comparable to $50 brushes easily.  I use it with thenfinishing powder to blend. It does an excellent job.thebristles are so soft and the size is perfect.  I will be checking out the other items this seller has.</li>
            <li> This brush exceeded my expectations. For how cheap it is, and the fact that it is not &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; I&#x27;m truly surprised. The bristles are so amazingly soft and do not shed! Holds, applies and blends powder amazingly. I highly suggest this brush to anyone, whether you are a beginner or a pro, you will LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li> Brush isn&#x27;t as dense/thick as i thought it would be, but still like it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I thought it was going to be bigger but then I didn&#x27;t care because it is amazing!  It is so soft on the skin and make applying Foundation wayyyyy easier.  Also came way sooner then I expected.  Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I have used Kabuki brushes for years and was in need for a new one and skeptical of this one since it was so so inexpensive, well to my surprise, it is the best brush I have purchased thus far!!  This is brush just glides my mineral powder on perfectly and can&#x27;t believe I was paying almost $15-$20 for this type of brush to not even get these results!  The brush is soft but firm enough so no pressure to apply makeup is needed.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Came late but its perfect</li>
            <li> I bought this on jan 30th and revived it today feb 4th. I already tested it and I&#x27;m in love with it can&#x27;t wait to buy some different brushes. These will be great for my bridesmaids in July.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you guys</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome! The quality of the hair was beyond my expectations, very very soft. I use this brush to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> save your money t here are better brushes Out their like beauty junkees or  are minerals.  ment for light use</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely FANTASTIC. Before purchasing, I used to use a typical face sponge and had had very minimal experience with makeup brushes. I wanted to try something out that would cut down my makeup time and this was just what I needed!!!!! I use it with liquid foundation and application takes probably less than 4 minutes! And i enjoy a nice full coverage look. I have yet to use this with powder products, but I believe it would be wonderful! I have already ordered more for the girls in my family.</li>
            <li> This works wonders.  For the price I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it</li>
            <li> I love this little brush. I keep it with me as a backup foundation brush. Very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Honestly I love this brush so so so much! Light weight, small so it fits perfect in any makeup bag and its so soft. It does a great job at applying foundation..I recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a inexpensive brush like this!</li>
            <li> Great i love it ! Thanks</li>
            <li> In love with this brush, my absolute favorite and great quality for the price</li>
            <li> Its very good. But I thought that they were tow no just one, like in the pic. I was waiting two brushes. You have to specificate that its just one cuz can confiuse.</li>
            <li> A very good brush for a low price!</li>
            <li> I havent used it yet but its very soft. It was small, I was expecting a much bigger size but its wonderful because my makeup bag is not that big so its good that it does not take up too much space. Other than that its a very nice brush with very soft bristols .</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this brush. It did take about a month to arrive but it was within the estimated date of delivery. Can&#x27;t  beat the price. The bristles  have not fallen off, as you would normaly expect from inexpensive brushes. Do keep in mind the time it takes to arrive, so worth the wait if you don&#x27;t  need it right away.</li>
            <li> smaller than expectation, but nice quality.</li>
            <li> I loved it! And for that low price even better!! It feels soft on my skin and my make up looks good.</li>
            <li> Very soft and holds my foundation well :) has sort of a bad smell but you could barely tell unless you put your nose against the bristles. Maybe after I wash it It&#x27;d go away :)</li>
            <li> The makeup brush was actually worked well when I applied my foundation. The quality is good, soft bristles, and a sturdy handle.&lt;br /&gt;If I could, I&#x27;d give it two stars for shipping. I really wish they would state where the items are coming from so I could prepare myself to expect the time coming from China will be a wait time of up to 2 months. Almost all the time Amazon doesn&#x27;t give that information until after the done deed has been done (payment and confirmation email sent) I thought this makeup brush wasn&#x27;t going to make it on time before I was heading to my vacation. I&#x27;m glad I ordered this 7 weeks out before my trip abroad.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the price and the reviews so I went ahead one ordered myself one. I mean, if it doesn&#x27;t turn out as good as the reviews, well, it&#x27;s only 2 dollars. I used it the following day and I was amazed. The bristles are really fine and soft and the brush itself is very dense. It&#x27;s the perfect kabuki brush for the perfect price!!!</li>
            <li> Great make up brushes at a good price! Thank you.</li>
            <li> A great foundation brush for such a small price. Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> super awesome for the price</li>
            <li> Very pleased I ordered 2 brushes they are very soft perfect for applying blush or bronzed. I would order and recommend. Arrived on time</li>
            <li> Soooo soft and great quality. Perfect for travel or everyday use.</li>
            <li> A bit small, but overall a nice brush!</li>
            <li> Such a great foundation brush. My fav!</li>
            <li> so soft &amp; small but handy &amp; cute works amazing</li>
            <li> feels good on my skin</li>
            <li> Shipping was very long, but the brush is terrific. Plan to wait, but this is a bargain!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush it blend ms my makeup so well. It took about 2 weeks to get here and it cane earlier than expected I love it</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice brush. Its not to big and it is really really soft.  I use it for my foundation.  I feel that I can blend my make up way better with the softness of it.  Pretty good deal and I received it fairly quick.</li>
