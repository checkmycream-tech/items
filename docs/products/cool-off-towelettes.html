            <li>Love them but read the directions!!</li>
            <li>I love these!!</li>
            <li>and then I couldn&#x27;t decide if it was pleasant or not.</li>
            <li>This is quite good product, although it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>Good smell to them.</li>
            <li>They are quick cooling AND smell great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing after applying.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the smell, I thought it was kinda nice.</li>
            <li>nice citrus tingle, and you can reuse the sheet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the feeling</li>
            <li>During the day I liked the freshness of the smell.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have something you can carry in your purse or pocket that is soothing and cooling.</li>
            <li>make your own soke wipes in witch hazel and water</li>
            <li>they smell good and are refreshing.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s kind of nice and the effectiveness of the product</li>
            <li>When I was told about Cool Off&#x27;s, I purchased them immediately, through Amazon, and I&#x27;ve been telling all of the women I know about them and how great they are.  </li>
            <li>great for on the go when the temperature is hot!</li>
            <li>I love the product, handy to throw in a purse or backpack.</li>
            <li>They are also easy to share!</li>
            <li>Excellent not only to cool off when overheated, but are great when you have a severe headache.</li>
            <li>works great for hot flashes</li>
            <li>A great cooler offer for those hot times.</li>
            <li>At night, a quick wipe-down feels almost as good as taking a shower.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.  </li>
            <li>If you wipe your face with the towelette, YOU will be able to smell the witch-hazel, but no one else should.  </li>
            <li>I find myself to be much more warm-blooded than most people.</li>
            <li>Better then advertised.</li>
            <li>I felt so much better</li>
            <li>and I smelled better too.</li>
            <li>I am ordering more for myself and my golfing relatives.</li>
            <li>Much better than Stridex pads</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;m buying more to send to my mom in Arizona.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That will make you feel better</li>
            <li>They are so refreshing and cooling.  </li>
            <li>and yes, they smell ok.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more of these for sure.</li>
            <li>A cooling scarf would work better</li>
            <li>but i think they made me hotter more than anything.</li>
            <li>I hope you get the results I have as I have tried so many things to no avail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wear a suite jacket all the time to better condition</li>
            <li>email me if you want to know more.</li>
            <li>They kind of burn (not painful, kind of like a Bengay rub or something) at first, but very quickly make you more comfortable and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Very cool towelettes.</li>
            <li>Free ice water poured on your skin works better....</li>
            <li>I am at the age where I never know when I will get that fabulous flushed feeling creeping up my neck and the lovely glisten of sweat on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>The packets are  easy to carry.  </li>
            <li>Smell was too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>He used one pre-flight and the smell was so strong that we didn&#x27;t think he should use them on the plane out of consideration for everyone else.</li>
            <li>The do have a strong herbal scent</li>
            <li>The menthol was so strong.</li>
            <li>These wipes work quickly, smell nice, and the cool feeling lasts.</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to believe a moist towelette would really cool me off.  </li>
            <li>So, cooking yes, pain free no.</li>
            <li>It is important to read the directions.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Last night I tried one for the first time and I am absolutely thrilled to say they were telling the truth!!</li>
            <li>These really work for helping you to stay cool, especially in Hot Humid climates!  </li>
            <li>Helps with the Hot Flashes - I love the product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and for the first time can say this is by far the best product no need to search any further.</li>
            <li>A list of wonderful, natural ingredients....until you get the box a read further.</li>
            <li>Cool Off&#x27;s are very easy to carry around for use at anytime and can be used more than once if you&#x27;ve used very briefly.</li>
            <li>They do have a strong vapor kind of smell though, so I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep with it, but other people may not have a problem with it.</li>
            <li>This product s great when you have those times in the summer where you get hot outside and need to go indoors for a meeting or gathering.</li>
            <li>What ever happened to full discloser?</li>
            <li>They did cool you off, but the &amp;#34;lasting cool&amp;#34; takes a while to show up</li>
            <li>Cool Off Citrus Ice Towelette,  24-Count]]</li>
            <li>Kept us cool in 90 degree plus heat.</li>
            <li>now I wanna try putting them in the fridge... and the spritzing with cool water hint is something that I want to try.</li>
            <li>I tried the Cool Off Towelette.</li>
            <li>Keeps you cool when that heat hits.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>cool off wipe</li>
            <li>In full sun, it felt like they were burning my skin rather than cooling it.</li>
            <li>However, the cooling seems based on alcohol and it being spread over your skin to catch the air and cool you off.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to actually cool but makes the skin tingle..</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the smell of menthol or tea tree oil, then Cool Off is not for you.  </li>
            <li>There was a smell to it and it burned --- not bad, but</li>
            <li>They cool you quickly and help you look civil.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for anyone that gets hot easily.</li>
            <li>It works quickly.</li>
            <li>This product worked super well for us in Disney.</li>
            <li>I can keep these in the car for use when I need something that will work quickly.</li>
            <li>I definitely will not purchase these again because I think that I can find towelettes that will cool as/more effectively without the irritation.</li>
            <li>it really works!!</li>
            <li>towlettes smell fabulous and more importantly actually work to cool off the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be re ordering next spring for sure!</li>
            <li>If you are thinking about buying this for hot flashes,, Don&#x27;t waist your money!  </li>
            <li>and it really burns when your in the sun!!</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they say, they give you a tingly chill that also catch even the smallest breeze to help cool you off.</li>
            <li>Witch hazel, alcohol, and herbs are infused into a little towelette.&lt;br /&gt;They are nice for cooling, but I like them even better as a quick face-cleaning cloth for the end of hot summer days in Georgia on my oily skin.</li>
            <li>Love &#x27;em can&#x27;t live without.... hot flashes</li>
            <li>These cool my core temperature done very well.</li>
            <li>I love these refreshing little towelettes.</li>
            <li>Really did work well to cool your skin from being in the hot sun.  </li>
            <li>These do cool me down effectively.</li>
            <li>I could not get the renewed effect using water very much.</li>
            <li>The evaporation cools them down quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>I need to be able to cool down quickly in this summer heat.</li>
            <li>Does not really cool but is a nice refreshing feeling to wipe down with these,like touching up your hair and makeup.</li>
            <li>These really work!</li>
            <li>Took them on a missions trip to a hot climate.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t function well in hot weather</li>
            <li>Come on, summer, I&#x27;m ready!</li>
            <li>Just the thing for a hot, humid day.</li>
            <li>I thought these might help but the first time I used one, I assumed it was just a cooling cloth, but there is an ingredient I do not believe is intended for faces - too mentholy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always HOT and these helped when traveling</li>
            <li>Personally I found that these work better if you wipe them on while you are in the shade.</li>
            <li>Having suffered from hot flashes for a number of years, I was up to trying almost anything for relief.  </li>
            <li>so much cooler!</li>
            <li>and thats hot for hiking or gardening etc.  </li>
            <li>Be warned, the scent is intense!  </li>
            <li>I keep these wipes in my purse and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Okay so I am one of those blessed with severe facial sweating.</li>
            <li>It was absolutely incredidible!</li>
            <li>Wow, don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but these things really work!!!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that these kept me pretty cool while walking around in the hot Florida climate.</li>
            <li>With that said it would be nice if the makers of this product released some other scents.</li>
            <li>I have only used two of these so far, but they are nice.  </li>
            <li>the whirring was noticeable and I didn&#x27;t really want to call attention to my hot flashes.</li>
            <li>These work very well for hot flashes.</li>
            <li>Being able to cool down quickly is an absolute necessity.</li>
            <li>They do a nice job of cooling you down when you are out in the heat .</li>
            <li>These towelettes really work.</li>
            <li>They smell no worse than a baby wipe.</li>
            <li>(yes, even tho i am 55 i still have to deal with very oily</li>
            <li>They really do work.</li>
            <li>These are very cooling and work really well for outdoors in Georgia in the summer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now really rethinking giving it.</li>
            <li>so much heaper</li>
            <li>I also use them in the morning when getting ready.</li>
            <li>Gently shake the toilette when removing from the packet and PAT on the skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I picked up some great advise from another person that is to use it then put back into the pouch and reuse it same day or following day.</li>
            <li>hot flashes are not fun, but this made it so much better..</li>
            <li>Smells strong and felt like icy hot to me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always a challenge to try to stay cool here and these work much better than I thought they would - especially in the extreme summer heat of the southwest.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to keep the towelette on your neck, just a few wipes, and as it dries there&#x27;s a tingly cool feeling that really does cool you off a bit.  </li>
            <li>To put it on an injured ham string is much different than putting it around your neck to cool you off.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I appreciate any method to cool off when outside, or when we have power outages and the indoor temperature rises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought these to help keep my cool at universal orlando.</li>
            <li>It was pretty easy to discreetly slip a towelette out of my purse, open it under the table, rub my wrists a bit, then palm it and rub with back of my neck without anyone noticing.  </li>
            <li>The main ingredient seems to be menthol</li>
            <li>Decent concept that I used to use on my kids when they had fevers, put socks on their feet and douse them in alcohol.</li>
            <li>Not sure I would buy again, but will know better when it gets hot.  </li>
            <li>This is basically a wet wipe with a really strong citrus smell.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend them highly.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these hoping for a quick cool off during these long summer months, and I here&#x27;s a big ol Texas THANK</li>
            <li>Works well but may be too much for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and melt while putting on makeup and blowdrying my hair despite having the air at 75.</li>
            <li>He tried one and said it was like a cool burning, very similar to icy hot for his soccer injuries.</li>
            <li>This product came pretty beaten up and already opened (the tape seal had obviously been torn).</li>
            <li>I bought these nearly two months ago at a local Walgreen&#x27;s before vacation because one of my prescriptions gives me hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Folks it&#x27;s amazing how your confidence builds and the fear goes away now its all a game to me</li>
            <li>As far as the complaints about smell, I have a fairly sensitive nose</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with sensitive skin, although after 10 minutes or so, it quit feeling like my skin was burning and itt did feel cooler.</li>
            <li>These towelettes so far have been a help.  </li>
            <li>(I was worried it would have an overpowering citrus scent), but they did leave a burning sensation on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>One of the ingredients is witch hazel, a natural astringent, so those with sensitive skin may choose to avoid the face.</li>
            <li>FAR outweighs any aversion to the scent you may have.</li>
            <li>Yes, they cool you down</li>
            <li>Helps to cool you down by reducing the heat from your neck area</li>
            <li>Individual packets are easy to carry and towelettes provide a cooling effect that is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I am very easily overheated and my forehead likes to betray my anxiety by pouring out sweat and making me look dumb in front of people.</li>
            <li>You feel like you just got out of the shower, there is a slight spa/bubble bath cool feel and smell and feel to it after applying.</li>
            <li>, when you start sweating, just wipe your self where ever you need cooled down, your refreshed and it helps with the hotflashes, if you need added cool down, I highly recommened the spray called&lt;br /&gt;clearly natural hot flash relief.</li>
            <li>The little fan was fine for the plane trip, but I found that in social situations (for example, dinner out with companions)</li>
            <li>In either case, the sensation you get from the towelettes is akin to what you would get with Icy Hot - a cooling/burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>It feels like your putting Icy Hot on</li>
            <li>but they really do cool you down for a short while</li>
            <li>I get very hot doing house work etc,  I put these on my neck and wait a few minutes</li>
            <li>Fast and what was expected</li>
            <li>This has a long list of natural ingredients, but it reminded me of Icy Hot or Ben-Gay rather than something</li>
            <li>Not as good as a fan or sticking your head in the freezer of course, but when you&#x27;re desperate, it does help.  </li>
            <li>recently had a power failure during a thunderstorm, and I had an opportunity to test them, and they were remarkably able to give me a feeling of being cooled, especially, when used with a battery operated fan.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong but fades quickly down to a slightly cloying, perfumey smell.</li>
            <li>So, I would warn that if you have sensitive skin, go to a local store and get a small box (they do sell boxes of 4 towelettes at some Walgreen&#x27;s) to try them first.</li>
            <li>I just used them for the first time over Labor Day weekend, and I realized I was grateful they were on clearance and didn&#x27;t waste a lot of money.  </li>
            <li>They really cooled me down.</li>
            <li>I am glad they exist, and in the event of another power failure, I feel less panicky knowing they can help keep me sane.</li>

            <li> I liked the feeling</li>
            <li> During the day I liked the freshness of the smell.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have something you can carry in your purse or pocket that is soothing and cooling.</li>
            <li> make your own soke wipes in witch hazel and water</li>
            <li> they smell good and are refreshing.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s kind of nice and the effectiveness of the product</li>
            <li> When I was told about Cool Off&#x27;s, I purchased them immediately, through Amazon, and I&#x27;ve been telling all of the women I know about them and how great they are.  </li>

            <li> At night, a quick wipe-down feels almost as good as taking a shower.</li>
            <li> So glad I did.  </li>
            <li> If you wipe your face with the towelette, YOU will be able to smell the witch-hazel, but no one else should.  </li>
            <li> I find myself to be much more warm-blooded than most people.</li>
            <li> Better then advertised.</li>
            <li> I felt so much better</li>
            <li> and I smelled better too.</li>
            <li> I am ordering more for myself and my golfing relatives.</li>
            <li> Much better than Stridex pads</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;m buying more to send to my mom in Arizona.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That will make you feel better</li>
            <li> They are so refreshing and cooling.  </li>
            <li> and yes, they smell ok.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more of these for sure.</li>
            <li> A cooling scarf would work better</li>
            <li> but i think they made me hotter more than anything.</li>
            <li> I hope you get the results I have as I have tried so many things to no avail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear a suite jacket all the time to better condition</li>
            <li> email me if you want to know more.</li>
            <li> They kind of burn (not painful, kind of like a Bengay rub or something) at first, but very quickly make you more comfortable and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Very cool towelettes.</li>
            <li> Free ice water poured on your skin works better....</li>
            <li> I am at the age where I never know when I will get that fabulous flushed feeling creeping up my neck and the lovely glisten of sweat on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> The packets are  easy to carry.  </li>
            <li> Smell was too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> He used one pre-flight and the smell was so strong that we didn&#x27;t think he should use them on the plane out of consideration for everyone else.</li>
            <li> The do have a strong herbal scent</li>
            <li> The menthol was so strong.</li>
            <li> These wipes work quickly, smell nice, and the cool feeling lasts.</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to believe a moist towelette would really cool me off.  </li>
            <li> So, cooking yes, pain free no.</li>
            <li> It is important to read the directions.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Last night I tried one for the first time and I am absolutely thrilled to say they were telling the truth!!</li>
            <li> These really work for helping you to stay cool, especially in Hot Humid climates!  </li>
            <li> Helps with the Hot Flashes - I love the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and for the first time can say this is by far the best product no need to search any further.</li>
            <li> A list of wonderful, natural ingredients....until you get the box a read further.</li>
            <li> Cool Off&#x27;s are very easy to carry around for use at anytime and can be used more than once if you&#x27;ve used very briefly.</li>
            <li> They do have a strong vapor kind of smell though, so I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep with it, but other people may not have a problem with it.</li>
            <li> This product s great when you have those times in the summer where you get hot outside and need to go indoors for a meeting or gathering.</li>
            <li> What ever happened to full discloser?</li>
            <li> They did cool you off, but the &amp;#34;lasting cool&amp;#34; takes a while to show up</li>
            <li> Cool Off Citrus Ice Towelette,  24-Count]]</li>
            <li> Kept us cool in 90 degree plus heat.</li>
            <li> now I wanna try putting them in the fridge... and the spritzing with cool water hint is something that I want to try.</li>
            <li> I tried the Cool Off Towelette.</li>
            <li> Keeps you cool when that heat hits.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> cool off wipe</li>
            <li> In full sun, it felt like they were burning my skin rather than cooling it.</li>
            <li> However, the cooling seems based on alcohol and it being spread over your skin to catch the air and cool you off.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to actually cool but makes the skin tingle..</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the smell of menthol or tea tree oil, then Cool Off is not for you.  </li>
            <li> There was a smell to it and it burned --- not bad, but</li>
            <li> They cool you quickly and help you look civil.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for anyone that gets hot easily.</li>
            <li> It works quickly.</li>
            <li> This product worked super well for us in Disney.</li>
            <li> I can keep these in the car for use when I need something that will work quickly.</li>
            <li> I definitely will not purchase these again because I think that I can find towelettes that will cool as/more effectively without the irritation.</li>
            <li> it really works!!</li>
            <li> towlettes smell fabulous and more importantly actually work to cool off the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be re ordering next spring for sure!</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about buying this for hot flashes,, Don&#x27;t waist your money!  </li>
            <li> and it really burns when your in the sun!!</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they say, they give you a tingly chill that also catch even the smallest breeze to help cool you off.</li>
            <li> Witch hazel, alcohol, and herbs are infused into a little towelette.&lt;br /&gt;They are nice for cooling, but I like them even better as a quick face-cleaning cloth for the end of hot summer days in Georgia on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love &#x27;em can&#x27;t live without.... hot flashes</li>
            <li> These cool my core temperature done very well.</li>
            <li> I love these refreshing little towelettes.</li>
            <li> Really did work well to cool your skin from being in the hot sun.  </li>
            <li> These do cool me down effectively.</li>
            <li> I could not get the renewed effect using water very much.</li>
            <li> The evaporation cools them down quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> I need to be able to cool down quickly in this summer heat.</li>
            <li> Does not really cool but is a nice refreshing feeling to wipe down with these,like touching up your hair and makeup.</li>
            <li> These really work!</li>
            <li> Took them on a missions trip to a hot climate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t function well in hot weather</li>
            <li> Come on, summer, I&#x27;m ready!</li>
            <li> Just the thing for a hot, humid day.</li>
            <li> I thought these might help but the first time I used one, I assumed it was just a cooling cloth, but there is an ingredient I do not believe is intended for faces - too mentholy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always HOT and these helped when traveling</li>
            <li> Personally I found that these work better if you wipe them on while you are in the shade.</li>
            <li> Having suffered from hot flashes for a number of years, I was up to trying almost anything for relief.  </li>
            <li> so much cooler!</li>
            <li> and thats hot for hiking or gardening etc.  </li>
            <li> Be warned, the scent is intense!  </li>
            <li> I keep these wipes in my purse and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Okay so I am one of those blessed with severe facial sweating.</li>
            <li> It was absolutely incredidible!</li>
            <li> Wow, don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but these things really work!!!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that these kept me pretty cool while walking around in the hot Florida climate.</li>
            <li> With that said it would be nice if the makers of this product released some other scents.</li>
            <li> I have only used two of these so far, but they are nice.  </li>
            <li> the whirring was noticeable and I didn&#x27;t really want to call attention to my hot flashes.</li>
            <li> These work very well for hot flashes.</li>
            <li> Being able to cool down quickly is an absolute necessity.</li>
            <li> They do a nice job of cooling you down when you are out in the heat .</li>
            <li> These towelettes really work.</li>
            <li> They smell no worse than a baby wipe.</li>
            <li> (yes, even tho i am 55 i still have to deal with very oily</li>
            <li> They really do work.</li>
            <li> These are very cooling and work really well for outdoors in Georgia in the summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now really rethinking giving it.</li>
            <li> so much heaper</li>
            <li> I also use them in the morning when getting ready.</li>
            <li> Gently shake the toilette when removing from the packet and PAT on the skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I picked up some great advise from another person that is to use it then put back into the pouch and reuse it same day or following day.</li>
            <li> hot flashes are not fun, but this made it so much better..</li>
            <li> Smells strong and felt like icy hot to me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a challenge to try to stay cool here and these work much better than I thought they would - especially in the extreme summer heat of the southwest.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to keep the towelette on your neck, just a few wipes, and as it dries there&#x27;s a tingly cool feeling that really does cool you off a bit.  </li>
            <li> To put it on an injured ham string is much different than putting it around your neck to cool you off.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I appreciate any method to cool off when outside, or when we have power outages and the indoor temperature rises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought these to help keep my cool at universal orlando.</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy to discreetly slip a towelette out of my purse, open it under the table, rub my wrists a bit, then palm it and rub with back of my neck without anyone noticing.  </li>
            <li> The main ingredient seems to be menthol</li>
            <li> Decent concept that I used to use on my kids when they had fevers, put socks on their feet and douse them in alcohol.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would buy again, but will know better when it gets hot.  </li>
            <li> This is basically a wet wipe with a really strong citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend them highly.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these hoping for a quick cool off during these long summer months, and I here&#x27;s a big ol Texas THANK</li>
            <li> Works well but may be too much for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and melt while putting on makeup and blowdrying my hair despite having the air at 75.</li>
            <li> He tried one and said it was like a cool burning, very similar to icy hot for his soccer injuries.</li>
            <li> This product came pretty beaten up and already opened (the tape seal had obviously been torn).</li>
            <li> I bought these nearly two months ago at a local Walgreen&#x27;s before vacation because one of my prescriptions gives me hot flashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Folks it&#x27;s amazing how your confidence builds and the fear goes away now its all a game to me</li>
            <li> As far as the complaints about smell, I have a fairly sensitive nose</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with sensitive skin, although after 10 minutes or so, it quit feeling like my skin was burning and itt did feel cooler.</li>
            <li> These towelettes so far have been a help.  </li>
            <li> (I was worried it would have an overpowering citrus scent), but they did leave a burning sensation on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> One of the ingredients is witch hazel, a natural astringent, so those with sensitive skin may choose to avoid the face.</li>
            <li> FAR outweighs any aversion to the scent you may have.</li>
            <li> Yes, they cool you down</li>
            <li> Helps to cool you down by reducing the heat from your neck area</li>
            <li> Individual packets are easy to carry and towelettes provide a cooling effect that is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I am very easily overheated and my forehead likes to betray my anxiety by pouring out sweat and making me look dumb in front of people.</li>
            <li> You feel like you just got out of the shower, there is a slight spa/bubble bath cool feel and smell and feel to it after applying.</li>
            <li> , when you start sweating, just wipe your self where ever you need cooled down, your refreshed and it helps with the hotflashes, if you need added cool down, I highly recommened the spray called&lt;br /&gt;clearly natural hot flash relief.</li>
            <li> The little fan was fine for the plane trip, but I found that in social situations (for example, dinner out with companions)</li>
            <li> In either case, the sensation you get from the towelettes is akin to what you would get with Icy Hot - a cooling/burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> It feels like your putting Icy Hot on</li>
            <li> but they really do cool you down for a short while</li>
            <li> I get very hot doing house work etc,  I put these on my neck and wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> Fast and what was expected</li>
            <li> This has a long list of natural ingredients, but it reminded me of Icy Hot or Ben-Gay rather than something</li>
            <li> Not as good as a fan or sticking your head in the freezer of course, but when you&#x27;re desperate, it does help.  </li>
            <li> recently had a power failure during a thunderstorm, and I had an opportunity to test them, and they were remarkably able to give me a feeling of being cooled, especially, when used with a battery operated fan.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong but fades quickly down to a slightly cloying, perfumey smell.</li>
            <li> So, I would warn that if you have sensitive skin, go to a local store and get a small box (they do sell boxes of 4 towelettes at some Walgreen&#x27;s) to try them first.</li>
            <li> I just used them for the first time over Labor Day weekend, and I realized I was grateful they were on clearance and didn&#x27;t waste a lot of money.  </li>
            <li> They really cooled me down.</li>
            <li> I am glad they exist, and in the event of another power failure, I feel less panicky knowing they can help keep me sane.</li>
            <li> These wipes really do give you a cool sensation after a long walk, working in garden, or just plain hard work.</li>
            <li> The cloth cools your skin but does not last long enough.</li>
            <li> I shared the towelettes at a football game when it was very hot.  </li>
            <li> smells way better ...and stays cold longer............</li>
            <li> Now I keep a few of these in my purse, &amp; it really helps me feel cooled down.</li>
            <li> Other female family members of all ages (not just those in our 40&#x27;s) were amazed and wanting to use them while at a summer outing where lots of walking in the heat was required.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last for a real long time but enough to get me cooled down before I am dripping wet.</li>
            <li> As an experiment, I tried the Cool Off towelettes both at room temperature and ice cold from the freezer, and I like them better when they&#x27;re ice cold.  </li>
            <li> you get the same result with a little witch hazel and water.</li>
            <li> I ordered a small personal fan for use on a long plane trip.  </li>
            <li> I got these because I have MS and have trouble regulating my internal thermometer.</li>
            <li> It has a really strong, unpleasant menthol type smell.  </li>
            <li> Just buy some baby wipes, throw them in a ziplock, and you&#x27;ll get the same effect for less money and less smell.</li>
            <li> These cooling towelettes are convenient and small enough to tuck into a purse (or wallet for you fellas).</li>
            <li> Small enough to carry in a purse or pocket and do the trick.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed as I planned to give these as a gift (ok, partly as a gag for my mother in law).</li>
            <li> it gets hot here in the summer, not as bad as the last place we lived where it got up to 120 in the summer</li>
            <li> When that uncomfortable boiling-from-the-inside feeling starts, these wipes bring fast relief.</li>
            <li> This product will not cool you off.  </li>
            <li> No shade and little wind.</li>
            <li> I admit, I was skeptical about these towelettes actually doing what the manufacturer and other reviewers say they do, but I am desperate for anything that will help me cope with chemo-induced hot flashes</li>
            <li> I always keep a few packets in my purse now, and even stick one in my pocket if I head into a meeting at work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
            <li> As a resident of Florida, it&#x27;s not a stretch of the imagination to get overheated from the heat and humidity, year round.</li>
            <li> so I opened a packet and wiped the back of my neck and behind my ears and the heat stopped almost instantaneously.</li>
            <li> You can refresh the feeling by sprinkling a small amount of water on the ares where you previously applied.</li>
            <li> I took a chance when buying these towelettes not really sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> For relief from my personal tropical vacations, I would tolerate MUCH worse!</li>
            <li> WHY DID I SPEND HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT?  </li>
            <li> Last night we had a heavy rain and today everything is very muggy and</li>
            <li> Sorry to give this a thumbs down but had purchased it for my son who was in Hong Kong in June &amp; July for an internship to hopefully combat some of the 90% humidity.</li>
            <li> I know how serious this is in fact I was going to quite my job because I had to wear a suite jacket all the time.</li>
            <li> Sadly, these little towelettes contain chemicals that should not be put on your skin.</li>
            <li> I am always embarrassed that I have horrible hot flashes and have for yrs.</li>
            <li> but my 15 year old son hated it.</li>
            <li> , sometimes worse...</li>
            <li> I like the smell of both menthol and tea tree oil, and still found them irritating to my eyes and nostrils in these towelettes.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a very bad burning sensation, but it was enough to be uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Both are useless.</li>
            <li> That was lame, but these towelettes are not.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, using these is an act of desperation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to explain</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> bottle of cold water&lt;</li>
            <li> Afraid to use again.</li>
            <li> It was a burning cold sensation.</li>
            <li> They dont&#x27; solve the unbearable problem of heat, humidity and sun coming together in bad ways....</li>
            <li> For me, the smell wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking :(</li>
            <li> The kids hated them too.  </li>
            <li> Burned my face awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well but may be too much for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product s great when you have those times in the summer where you get hot outside and need to go indoors for a meeting or gathering. They cool you quickly and help you look civil.</li>
            <li> These sparked my interest when I read what &amp;#34;Cool Off&amp;#34; contains. A list of wonderful, natural ingredients....until you get the box a read further. Sadly, these little towelettes contain chemicals that should not be put on your skin. What ever happened to full discloser? Back to the spray bottle!</li>
            <li> Great product!  It works quickly.</li>
            <li> These towelettes really work.</li>
            <li> This product definitely does not work!  This product will not cool you off.  I would not recommend you purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Smell was too strong for me.  I gave it to my son-in-law.  He was happy</li>
            <li> I ordered a small personal fan for use on a long plane trip.  These towelettes were suggested as an add-on item, so I though what the heck and ordered them, So glad I did.  The little fan was fine for the plane trip, but I found that in social situations (for example, dinner out with companions) the whirring was noticeable and I didn&#x27;t really want to call attention to my hot flashes. It was pretty easy to discreetly slip a towelette out of my purse, open it under the table, rub my wrists a bit, then palm it and rub with back of my neck without anyone noticing.  You don&#x27;t have to keep the towelette on your neck, just a few wipes, and as it dries there&#x27;s a tingly cool feeling that really does cool you off a bit.  Not as good as a fan or sticking your head in the freezer of course, but when you&#x27;re desperate, it does help.  I always keep a few packets in my purse now, and even stick one in my pocket if I head into a meeting at work.</li>
            <li> This is quite good product, although it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I took a chance when buying these towelettes not really sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised that these kept me pretty cool while walking around in the hot Florida climate. My husband thought they were great too. I would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> These really work! Took them on a missions trip to a hot climate. They really cooled me down. People were asking for them during the trip and they helped! All the menopausal women were raving about them.</li>
            <li> Got this along with the hand held fan. Both are useless. Don&#x27;t waste money. The fan leaks and this citrus will make your eyes water.</li>
            <li> Fast and what was expected</li>
            <li> I can feel it coming in the heat tonight...  That was lame, but these towelettes are not. I am very easily overheated and my forehead likes to betray my anxiety by pouring out sweat and making me look dumb in front of people. I have tried everything to try to rectify this embarrassing problem, but nothing works as well as these towelettes. They do exactly what they say, they give you a tingly chill that also catch even the smallest breeze to help cool you off. I carry one of these in my pocket at all times now.  As far as the complaints about smell, I have a fairly sensitive nose and I don&#x27;t find these to be all that offensive. They smell no worse than a baby wipe. My wife has told me that standing next to me, she detects no smell from the wipes. If you wipe your face with the towelette, YOU will be able to smell the witch-hazel, but no one else should.  With that said it would be nice if the makers of this product released some other scents. Lavender would be soothing.</li>
            <li> Excellent not only to cool off when overheated, but are great when you have a severe headache. Between the citrus smell and the cooling effect it gives almost immediate relief to a migraine or severe headache. Best product out there. I would highly recommend. I never leave home without a couple in my purse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t function well in hot weather so I was looking for cooling options for summer vacation. I thought of witch hazel but that was not convenient until I discovered these cooling towelettes. Individual packets are easy to carry and towelettes provide a cooling effect that is long lasting. Come on, summer, I&#x27;m ready!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the smell, I thought it was kinda nice. They did cool you off, but the &amp;#34;lasting cool&amp;#34; takes a while to show up and then I couldn&#x27;t decide if it was pleasant or not. Felt kinda like bengay.</li>
            <li> These cooling towelettes are convenient and small enough to tuck into a purse (or wallet for you fellas). They do a nice job of cooling you down when you are out in the heat . I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> This product worked super well for us in Disney. We bought them for a trip in August with 98 degree days.  You actually feel semi-refreshed for a bit after use of these towelettes.  They dont&#x27; solve the unbearable problem of heat, humidity and sun coming together in bad ways....but they offer a bit of respite!</li>
            <li> These wipes work quickly, smell nice, and the cool feeling lasts. The packets are  easy to carry.  They are also easy to share!</li>
            <li> I love these refreshing little towelettes. Just the thing for a hot, humid day. Refreshes and gives you a lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003IU8KLU Cool Off Citrus Ice Towelette,  24-Count]]</li>
            <li> I find myself to be much more warm-blooded than most people. I thought these might help but the first time I used one, I assumed it was just a cooling cloth, but there is an ingredient I do not believe is intended for faces - too mentholy. Love them but read the directions!!</li>
            <li> WHY DID I SPEND HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT?  Free ice water poured on your skin works better....smells way better ...and stays cold longer............</li>
            <li> The main ingredient seems to be menthol so you smell like liniment and there is a burning feeling. Definitely not cooling.</li>
            <li> might as well just get some witch hazel and tissues.</li>
            <li> I love the product, handy to throw in a purse or backpack. I gave it 4 stars as I  thought it was a bit spend for the amount of packets.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with sensitive skin, although after 10 minutes or so, it quit feeling like my skin was burning and itt did feel cooler.</li>
            <li> Better then advertised. Kept us cool in 90 degree plus heat.</li>
            <li> Sorry to give this a thumbs down but had purchased it for my son who was in Hong Kong in June &amp; July for an internship to hopefully combat some of the 90% humidity. He tried one and said it was like a cool burning, very similar to icy hot for his soccer injuries. To put it on an injured ham string is much different than putting it around your neck to cool you off.</li>
            <li> awesomeness... it really works!! hot flashes are not fun, but this made it so much better.. only keep in mind not to put this on chapped lips.. it hurts... now I wanna try putting them in the fridge... and the spritzing with cool water hint is something that I want to try.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my husband for a recent flight.  He tends to get nervous and sweats a lot, so I thought these would be perfect. He used one pre-flight and the smell was so strong that we didn&#x27;t think he should use them on the plane out of consideration for everyone else.</li>
            <li> I just tried these towelettes today. Last night we had a heavy rain and today everything is very muggy and about 85 degrees. I take the bus, and I have about a 20 minute wait at my transfer point. No shade and little wind. I was dripping (literally) with sweat. I tried the Cool Off Towelette. IT WORKS. Shortly after I applied it to my neck, chest, anterior side of my elbows, and posterior side of my knees I did feel cooler.&lt;br /&gt;Call it psychological or the placebo effect --- I don&#x27;t care --- it works. I was no longer &amp;#34;dripping&amp;#34;. I felt so much better and I smelled better too. I am ordering more for myself and my golfing relatives.</li>
            <li> These things are great! Witch hazel, alcohol, and herbs are infused into a little towelette.&lt;br /&gt;They are nice for cooling, but I like them even better as a quick face-cleaning cloth for the end of hot summer days in Georgia on my oily skin. Much better than Stridex pads (yes, even tho i am 55 i still have to deal with very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m buying more to send to my mom in Arizona.</li>
            <li> They really do work. I thought it was all snake oil but they really do cool you down for a short while</li>
            <li> As a resident of Florida, it&#x27;s not a stretch of the imagination to get overheated from the heat and humidity, year round. That&#x27;s why I appreciate any method to cool off when outside, or when we have power outages and the indoor temperature rises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These towlettes smell fabulous and more importantly actually work to cool off the skin.&lt;br /&gt;We recently had a power failure during a thunderstorm, and I had an opportunity to test them, and they were remarkably able to give me a feeling of being cooled, especially, when used with a battery operated fan. I am glad they exist, and in the event of another power failure, I feel less panicky knowing they can help keep me sane.</li>
            <li> Keeps you cool when that heat hits.&lt;br /&gt;A nice citrus tingle, and you can reuse the sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bottle of cold water&lt;br /&gt;A cool off wipe&lt;br /&gt;That will make you feel better&lt;br /&gt;and that&#x27;s no hype</li>
            <li> They are so refreshing and cooling.  great for on the go when the temperature is hot!</li>
            <li> Smells strong and felt like icy hot to me.  The kids hated them too.  We threw them away.</li>
            <li> Does a great job cooling off parts of the skin that get too hot.​​​​ Good smell to them.</li>
            <li> These things do have a cooling feeling but they stink</li>
            <li> These work very well for hot flashes. Especially when I am at work or out in public. Small enough to carry in a purse or pocket and do the trick. They don&#x27;t last for a real long time but enough to get me cooled down before I am dripping wet.</li>
            <li> This is basically a wet wipe with a really strong citrus smell. Just buy some baby wipes, throw them in a ziplock, and you&#x27;ll get the same effect for less money and less smell.</li>
            <li> These are very cooling and work really well for outdoors in Georgia in the summer.</li>
            <li> There was a smell to it and it burned --- not bad, but not something I want on my skin</li>
            <li> works great for hot flashes</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for anyone that gets hot easily. These cool my core temperature done very well. I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> These wipes really do give you a cool sensation after a long walk, working in garden, or just plain hard work.</li>
            <li> Burned my face awful.  Witch Hazel is the ingredient.  Afraid to use again.</li>
            <li> This product came pretty beaten up and already opened (the tape seal had obviously been torn). I was really disappointed as I planned to give these as a gift (ok, partly as a gag for my mother in law). I&#x27;m now really rethinking giving it. Thank goodness they are individually wrapped. That&#x27;s about the only thing that&#x27;s saving it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always HOT and these helped when traveling</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking :( don&#x27;t even have used it lying in my drawer</li>
            <li> Personally I found that these work better if you wipe them on while you are in the shade. In full sun, it felt like they were burning my skin rather than cooling it. I liked the feeling but my 15 year old son hated it. Maybe it&#x27;s a personal thing. Sort of the feeling of Max Freeze of BioFreeze (used for muscle aches). I did feel that I was cooler after using these in the Bahamas.</li>
            <li> I got these because I have MS and have trouble regulating my internal thermometer. I need to be able to cool down quickly in this summer heat. Unfortunately, using these is an act of desperation. Yes, they cool you down and yes, they smell ok. However, the cooling seems based on alcohol and it being spread over your skin to catch the air and cool you off. Decent concept that I used to use on my kids when they had fevers, put socks on their feet and douse them in alcohol. The evaporation cools them down quickly and effectively. However, if you have been sweating a lot and your pores are open, these sting like hell. So, cooking yes, pain free no.</li>
            <li> Having suffered from hot flashes for a number of years, I was up to trying almost anything for relief.  When I was told about Cool Off&#x27;s, I purchased them immediately, through Amazon, and I&#x27;ve been telling all of the women I know about them and how great they are.  I recommend them highly.  Cool Off&#x27;s are very easy to carry around for use at anytime and can be used more than once if you&#x27;ve used very briefly.</li>
            <li> Wow, don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but these things really work!!! I took them on a desert trip and would flatten one out below my clothes on my back or chest and voila! so much cooler! They do have a strong vapor kind of smell though, so I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep with it, but other people may not have a problem with it. During the day I liked the freshness of the smell.</li>
            <li> Very cool towelettes. It is nice to have something you can carry in your purse or pocket that is soothing and cooling. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Does feel minty on skin</li>
            <li> Helps with the Hot Flashes - I love the product. Helps to cool you down by reducing the heat from your neck area</li>
            <li> Does not really cool but is a nice refreshing feeling to wipe down with these,like touching up your hair and makeup.</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied Customer! PLUS.. these wipes are a life saver!&lt;br /&gt;  Living in FL, you can’t step outside &amp; not be slapped by heat &amp; humidity 10 out of 12 months a year.&lt;br /&gt;  Now I keep a few of these in my purse, &amp; it really helps me feel cooled down. Especially if there is a breeze...,</li>
            <li> A great cooler offer for those hot times.</li>
            <li> you get the same result with a little witch hazel and water. make your own soke wipes in witch hazel and water so much heaper</li>
            <li> I have only used two of these so far, but they are nice.  they smell good and are refreshing.  I will be keeping some in my back pack when out wandering in the desert and in my pockets when working in the garden.  it gets hot here in the summer, not as bad as the last place we lived where it got up to 120 in the summer, sometimes worse...but it will go over 100 some days and thats hot for hiking or gardening etc.  These towelettes so far have been a help.  I will be re ordering next spring for sure!</li>
            <li> I have MS. Being able to cool down quickly is an absolute necessity. I can keep these in the car for use when I need something that will work quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought these nearly two months ago at a local Walgreen&#x27;s before vacation because one of my prescriptions gives me hot flashes.  I just used them for the first time over Labor Day weekend, and I realized I was grateful they were on clearance and didn&#x27;t waste a lot of money.  For me, the smell wasn&#x27;t too bad (I was worried it would have an overpowering citrus scent), but they did leave a burning sensation on my sensitive skin.  It wasn&#x27;t a very bad burning sensation, but it was enough to be uncomfortable.  So, I would warn that if you have sensitive skin, go to a local store and get a small box (they do sell boxes of 4 towelettes at some Walgreen&#x27;s) to try them first.</li>
            <li> What a great product. I am at the age where I never know when I will get that fabulous flushed feeling creeping up my neck and the lovely glisten of sweat on my face and neck. It is often when I am seeing patients (for some reason during the male patients visits and they don&#x27;t get it). . I can keep these in my pocket for instant relief. I also use them in the morning when getting ready. I live in Florida and melt while putting on makeup and blowdrying my hair despite having the air at 75. It is important to read the directions. Gently shake the toilette when removing from the packet and PAT on the skin. It actually gives me goosebumps. You can refresh the feeling by sprinkling a small amount of water on the ares where you previously applied. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It has a really strong, unpleasant menthol type smell.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to actually cool but makes the skin tingle.. it&#x27;s difficult to explain but I wouldn&#x27;t order them again.</li>
            <li> As an experiment, I tried the Cool Off towelettes both at room temperature and ice cold from the freezer, and I like them better when they&#x27;re ice cold.  In either case, the sensation you get from the towelettes is akin to what you would get with Icy Hot - a cooling/burning sensation.  Be warned, the scent is intense!  If you don&#x27;t like the smell of menthol or tea tree oil, then Cool Off is not for you.  I like the smell of both menthol and tea tree oil, and still found them irritating to my eyes and nostrils in these towelettes.  I definitely will not purchase these again because I think that I can find towelettes that will cool as/more effectively without the irritation.</li>
            <li> When that uncomfortable boiling-from-the-inside feeling starts, these wipes bring fast relief. Neck, chest, wrists, elbows, backs of knees--try to hit the spots where blood vessels are closest to the surface of the skin. At night, a quick wipe-down feels almost as good as taking a shower. The tingly cooling sensation lasts 15-20 minutes.  One of the ingredients is witch hazel, a natural astringent, so those with sensitive skin may choose to avoid the face. I keep these wipes in my purse and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I am always embarrassed that I have horrible hot flashes and have for yrs. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of pills ect. and to no avail. I even carry a battery operated fan everywhere I go. These are so great, when you start sweating, just wipe your self where ever you need cooled down, your refreshed and it helps with the hotflashes, if you need added cool down, I highly recommened the spray called&lt;br /&gt;clearly natural hot flash relief.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about buying this for hot flashes,, Don&#x27;t waist your money!  This does not work, it gives you that icy/hot feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a challenge to try to stay cool here and these work much better than I thought they would - especially in the extreme summer heat of the southwest. The only drawback is the (initial) overly-strong citrus scent but it does eventually dissipate.</li>
            <li> These do cool me down effectively. I could not get the renewed effect using water very much. The smell is a bit strong but fades quickly down to a slightly cloying, perfumey smell. For relief from my personal tropical vacations, I would tolerate MUCH worse! Will be buying more of these for sure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, could be witchcraft for all I know. But it does work. Quite well.</li>
            <li> A cooling scarf would work better</li>
            <li> I bought these to help keep my cool at universal orlando. It feels like your putting Icy Hot on and it really burns when your in the sun!! I even had fans to blow in my face after using these but i think they made me hotter more than anything.</li>
            <li> Okay so I am one of those blessed with severe facial sweating. This product was on my list to try so I did. I have tried many products and for the first time can say this is by far the best product no need to search any further. It&#x27;s very refreshing after applying. I have to wear a suite at all times in hi humidity and temps at times and of course we know what that means TERROR!!!&lt;br /&gt;At a 102 f. this product held me together I&#x27;m actually stunned at how well it works. It is expensive so I carry them with me and only use if I expect conditions are going to be such that I need to use it and apply in the restroom if and when temperatures start to soar. You feel like you just got out of the shower, there is a slight spa/bubble bath cool feel and smell and feel to it after applying. I picked up some great advise from another person that is to use it then put back into the pouch and reuse it same day or following day. Give it a try I hope you get the results I have as I have tried so many things to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;Folks it&#x27;s amazing how your confidence builds and the fear goes away now its all a game to me I wear a suite jacket all the time to better condition myself psychologically cause sometimes the fear turns up the internal heat even though you may not think so. I encourage you to try the same and before you know it you won&#x27;t believe how you unlocked your mind and fear of sweating it takes discipline because eventually you will become so used to the temperatures you&#x27;ll no longer be in fear  it will just happen! I know how serious this is in fact I was going to quite my job because I had to wear a suite jacket all the time. DO THE THINGS YOU FEAR AND THE FEAR (AND SWEAT) WILL GO AWAY. No need to by fancy books or programs you can do it. email me if you want to know more.</li>
            <li> I shared the towelettes at a football game when it was very hot.  Nobody understood how it worked- but it did work great!</li>
            <li> I get very hot doing house work etc,  I put these on my neck and wait a few minutes and it cools me off.  I love these!!</li>
            <li> I admit, I was skeptical about these towelettes actually doing what the manufacturer and other reviewers say they do, but I am desperate for anything that will help me cope with chemo-induced hot flashes so I bought a box. Last night I tried one for the first time and I am absolutely thrilled to say they were telling the truth!! I felt a flash coming on so I opened a packet and wiped the back of my neck and behind my ears and the heat stopped almost instantaneously. It was absolutely incredidible! The do have a strong herbal scent but it&#x27;s kind of nice and the effectiveness of the product FAR outweighs any aversion to the scent you may have. I will definitely be carrying these things with me everywhere from now on!</li>
            <li> This is basically a alcohol wipe. It was a burning cold sensation. I only used 1 wipe and did not like it. I got it to use in a outdoor stadium setting.</li>
            <li> I work in an event venue in beautiful downtown San Antonio. Part of my job is taking folks on site visits and tours around our beautiful outdoor plazas  - even in the sweltering Texas heat! I purchased these hoping for a quick cool off during these long summer months, and I here&#x27;s a big ol Texas THANK YOU - they work wonderfully! They are quick cooling AND smell great!</li>
            <li> Burned my skin!  The menthol was so strong.</li>
            <li> The cloth cools your skin but does not last long enough.</li>
            <li> Love &#x27;em can&#x27;t live without.... hot flashes but great for desert living.... boyfriend uses too... no menthol smell, reactivates with a bit of water... waves of cooling....</li>
            <li> These really work for helping you to stay cool, especially in Hot Humid climates!  I used them on my face and neck and it worked like a miracle!</li>
            <li> Took these on a camping trip.  Really did work well to cool your skin from being in the hot sun.  One word of caution…keep your eyes shut for a bit after you use them on your face…the vapors from them stings the eyes a bit for a while.  They do keep giving a cooling sensation for about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic. They kind of burn (not painful, kind of like a Bengay rub or something) at first, but very quickly make you more comfortable and the smell is pleasant. Other female family members of all ages (not just those in our 40&#x27;s) were amazed and wanting to use them while at a summer outing where lots of walking in the heat was required.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would buy again, but will know better when it gets hot.  Ample moisture on cloth for arms, back of neck, calves.  Don&#x27;t use on your face as it made my eyes water until it evaporated some</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to believe a moist towelette would really cool me off.  This has a long list of natural ingredients, but it reminded me of Icy Hot or Ben-Gay rather than something soothing.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my arms, back of neck, and cheeks.  A friend tried it, and felt &#x27;burnt&#x27; as well.</li>
