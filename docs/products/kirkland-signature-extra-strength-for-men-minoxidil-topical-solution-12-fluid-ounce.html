            <li>Works best for more recent hair loss</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you whether Kirkland brand is better than others.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It took about 6 months before I could for sure see the results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure, because I&#x27;ve never used them.</li>
            <li>It might work even better for some people.</li>
            <li>satisfied customer</li>
            <li>I was losing more hair using this product.</li>
            <li>Most people give up to soon.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I like the Foam better</li>
            <li>The product has a 2014 expiration date which shows it was recently produced for best quality results.</li>
            <li>I was able to better shopping</li>
            <li>This is a great product, cheap and it really works, I would rate it better if it makes growth more hair</li>
            <li>good price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Ive been using kirkland for 1 year with good results when using this batch of it, my hair started to really fall out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>For me, its an easy desicion</li>
            <li>I too have used Kirkland before and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>cheap alternative to the name brand product, looks and smells like the name brand Minoxidil sold at a premium price.</li>
            <li>I bought this product without great expectations, a last minute resort to stave off my growing baldness..</li>
            <li>Great comparable value for the generic form of Rogain.</li>
            <li>I used the 2.5 mg Rogaine to start but saw Kirkland&#x27;s Minoxidil 5 mg topical at a great price</li>
            <li>Second dropper would be nice to store product in more than one place and not have to transport it around.  </li>
            <li>Priced much better than any generic products of its kind in the drugstores.  </li>
            <li>so you apply just the right amount every time, and it&#x27;s a brand you can trust!</li>
            <li>Application is not bad</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I did use it diligently and he was right.</li>
            <li>I have grown very fine hairs over that period but hardly noticeable to be honest.</li>
            <li>* Do not be alarmed if you notice an increase in hair loss in the first month or so of treatment.</li>
            <li>***)    </li>
            <li>I was so worried that I looked online (should have done that first)</li>
            <li>many people have had the same reaction.</li>
            <li>Started using this new batch about 45 days ago and the shower drain is full of hair.  </li>
            <li>I certainly hope so.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to deliver medication to the scalp compared to the foam as a majority of it</li>
            <li>Seems to work as well as the brand product, but at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really do get what you pay for.....</li>
            <li>Currently trying to re-grow some back with Hair Viamin and Vitamin E oil from Puritan.com so far the results are good.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it doesn&#x27;t happen over night and the product is not very expensive.</li>
            <li>They say that if you quit using it, your hair will revert back to it&#x27;s original condition</li>
            <li>/&gt;And just to be clear - if it&#x27;s your first time using minoxidil</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s quite clear it made a positive difference and stopped the thinning.</li>
            <li>That makes it worth wile to keep using it especially if you buy the 4 or 5 pack.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sure you can save a few bucks, but you will pay for it with hair loss.</li>
            <li>My barber also commented that she say new hair growth</li>
            <li>But I can live with that.</li>
            <li>Price is the ultimate goal since it is most likely made by the same company that makes Rogaine.  </li>
            <li>This is a result of the medication stimulating new hair growth and causing old hairs to fall out.</li>
            <li>BUY DIRECT:</li>
            <li>(I was hoping I could get them from Amazon directly)    </li>
            <li>Grows hair on my old head.  </li>
            <li>My husband used this product and his face swelled so much that his eye were just slits and his face was burning and red.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if these are really true Kirkland or some fake products out there as they smell just like straight alcohol!!!</li>
            <li>It will only be harder the later you start and the more hair you need to grow back.  </li>

            <li> It will only be harder the later you start and the more hair you need to grow back.  </li>
            <li> Works best if you put it in a small spray bottle instead of using the stupid eye dropper that tends have the liquid running everywhere.</li>
            <li> My scalp has become so dry and itchy that I can&#x27;t use it daily.  </li>
            <li> but this was just bad also very strong alcohol smell not like the last batch of kirkland i used.</li>
            <li> With the name brand you are paying for their marketing but the active ingredient is the same.  </li>
            <li> I used to loose hair every time I used a comb</li>
            <li> Wanna loose all your hair??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether the alcohol content in this topical is the problem, or the increase in minoxidil dosage, but I&#x27;ll go back to the name brand at a 2.5 mg dosage and see if I can use it.</li>
            <li> They will come back and will be thicker than before in as little as 3 months.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that my scalp itches all the time, and it is dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works extremely well.</li>
            <li> other people</li>
            <li> Leaves your scalp itchy due to the alcohol in the product.</li>
            <li> Lost tons of hair due to this product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve used this product for the past several months.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is either expired or fake because it smells and feels like straight alcohol.</li>
            <li> have bought  this product befoe,good buy.does keep down one&#x27;s dht levels even in the over 65&#x27;s.will buy again.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t let it run down your face or back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I read these ridiculous reviews just like you did and my initial feeling was that they were written  by reps of competing</li>
            <li> There is no where else you can purchase this product for less on a 6 month supply.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the name brand for a lot less money, per my husband.</li>
            <li> Apply up to twice a day and you will may see results in as little as 3 months.</li>
            <li> A little known fact - NON-Members can purchase prescriptions from the pharmacy at any Costco.  </li>
            <li> My doctor said to use minoxidil for men and use it 2 times a day for 3 months and I would feel little whiskers coming through.</li>
            <li> several years ago my hair started to thin, minoxidel 5% solution stopped the thinning and also made it a little bit thicker, I have pictures from before and now</li>
            <li> so I use it everyday as instructed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, I had a noticeable growth of hair on my bald spot.</li>
            <li> I had to destroy all of these bottles after using &lt;2 weeks.</li>
            <li> you can miss a few treatments and you won&#x27;t see any changes.  </li>
            <li> use the dropper that comes with, then a few drops on the scalp all over..reach under your hair and rub into scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have used Kirkland brand for a few years and will continue to do so.  </li>
            <li> Junk, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It is so much more expensive and a bad value to be labeled Kirkland.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this also means items and overthecounter stuff or if Non-members can buy online.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product will work.  </li>
            <li> Have purchased in the past and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time and find that it does retain my hair and gives me a small amount of regrowth.</li>
            <li> Comparing this to Rogaine, it&#x27;s a SMALL fraction of the cost of the name-brand, and delivers something that I feel is easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> I seriously doubt there is a influx of fake Kirkland Minoxidil, counterfeiters would rather do actual Rogaine, so buy it where you can get it.  </li>
            <li> Hair has continued to grow and my bald spot is slowly filling out.</li>
            <li> I have medium thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Terrible stuff,&lt;br /&gt;I switched from the more expensive branded stuff to this</li>
            <li> the women&#x27;s is to weak</li>
            <li> but it is very slow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned my lesson about getting fake products like this.</li>
            <li> As for these Amazon (possibly fake)</li>
            <li> I had a hysterectomy 20 years ago and my hair got very thin.  </li>
            <li> also started to have bad dandruff.</li>
            <li> It is frightening and is very painful and horrible looking.</li>
            <li> Bad batch!!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great price for minoxidil and I love that it comes with a dropper. Much easier to deliver medication to the scalp compared to the foam as a majority of it will end up in your hair instead of your scalp. Apply up to twice a day and you will may see results in as little as 3 months. Works best for more recent hair loss ie receding hair line or start of a bald spot on your crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Important** Do not be alarmed if you notice an increase in hair loss in the first month or so of treatment. This is a result of the medication stimulating new hair growth and causing old hairs to fall out. They will come back and will be thicker than before in as little as 3 months. Best</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been losing hair at the rate I was before, so it&#x27;s working. Part of the problem is that I keep forgetting to use it.</li>
            <li> quick delivery, good price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you whether Kirkland brand is better than others.  I certainly hope so.  However, I know that if I stop using minoxidil, my hair starts to fall out.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as well as the brand product, but at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Helps keep the hair you have from falling out prematurely.  The best price I have found.  Works best if you put it in a small spray bottle instead of using the stupid eye dropper that tends have the liquid running everywhere.</li>
            <li> Ive been using kirkland for 1 year with good results when using this batch of it, my hair started to really fall out also started to have bad dandruff. Ive had some dandruff before with kirkland but this was just bad also very strong alcohol smell not like the last batch of kirkland i used. You no the saying if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck nuff said.  DONT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> cheap alternative to the name brand product, looks and smells like the name brand Minoxidil sold at a premium price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year not. They say that if you quit using it, your hair will revert back to it&#x27;s original condition so I use it everyday as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;It took about 6 months before I could for sure see the results. My barber also commented that she say new hair growth but it is very slow. My hair seems to be fuller than it used to and there are not receding hair lines. I used to loose hair every time I used a comb but that doens&#x27;t happen anymore. I think it is a good product and works for me. Like I said, it doesn&#x27;t happen over night and the product is not very expensive. That makes it worth wile to keep using it especially if you buy the 4 or 5 pack.&lt;br /&gt;I am a believer.&lt;br /&gt;Frank</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned my lesson about getting fake products like this. Sure you can save a few bucks, but you will pay for it with hair loss. My hair started falling out about a week after using this snake oil. When I switched back to Rogaine brand, it stopped, and has been getting thicker ever since.</li>
            <li> .  I&#x27;ve been using the Costco (Kirkland Signature) Minoxidil for 15 years now, And had great success!    BUY DIRECT: The only sure way you won&#x27;t get a fake.    Costco has this product online, but seems to only carry the foam version in the stores. (I dont like the foam, I just want liquid drug on my scalp.. not drug/foam in hair) Im upset Costco switched to the foam in the stores. Now I have to go to Costco.com to get my s***)    A little known fact - NON-Members can purchase prescriptions from the pharmacy at any Costco.  I am not sure if this also means items and overthecounter stuff or if Non-members can buy online.  As for these Amazon (possibly fake) Kirkland Signature versions 2nd party suppliers I can&#x27;t be sure, because I&#x27;ve never used them. (I was hoping I could get them from Amazon directly)    Once again, try to go to the source. Kirkland is the in-house brand of Costco.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I hear it does for others.</li>
            <li> good price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Completed as promised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product will work.  I just started taken it and it takes a couple of months for it to work</li>
            <li> I bought this product without great expectations, a last minute resort to stave off my growing baldness.. Within a few weeks, I had a noticeable growth of hair on my bald spot. Hair has continued to grow and my bald spot is slowly filling out. I&#x27;m delighted with the results. The only negative is that my scalp itches all the time, and it is dry and flaky. But I can live with that.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, cheap and it really works, I would rate it better if it makes growth more hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Minoxdil for almost a year now so obviously I have some belief in it. I have grown very fine hairs over that period but hardly noticeable to be honest. I&#x27;ll keep using it. It&#x27;s affordable and easy to use. It might work even better for some people.</li>
            <li> Terrible stuff,&lt;br /&gt;I switched from the more expensive branded stuff to this and my hair got noticeably thinner in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;You really do get what you pay for.....</li>
            <li> Product fully met my expectations.  Great comparable value for the generic form of Rogain. Have purchased in the past and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> have bought  this product befoe,good buy.does keep down one&#x27;s dht levels even in the over 65&#x27;s.will buy again. satisfied customer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Kirkland before and noticed an increase in hair growth and my scalp felt stimulated. This stuff is either expired or fake because it smells and feels like straight alcohol.</li>
            <li> I read these ridiculous reviews just like you did and my initial feeling was that they were written  by reps of competing brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this anyway and, as it would happen, my suspicions seem to have been proven true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works extremely well. It&#x27;s a very good price. The bottle states &#x27;Unscented&#x27; and it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would even say it&#x27;s much less oily than the older version as it dries rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, that&#x27;s just my two cents. I just felt compelled to write a review to counter some of the nonsense other people posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just to be clear - if it&#x27;s your first time using minoxidil you may experience some shedding. I know it&#x27;s discouraging, but just stick with it.</li>
            <li> my scalp never get oily after just one application, my fine hair is happy .me too. no odors or stains in clothes</li>
            <li> Leaves your scalp itchy due to the alcohol in the product. Application is not bad but I feel like this product does nothing.</li>
            <li> Wanna loose all your hair?? This will wipe out all your hair. Lost tons of hair due to this product. Currently trying to re-grow some back with Hair Viamin and Vitamin E oil from Puritan.com so far the results are good.</li>
            <li> It works.  Grows hair on my old head.  Use it with hair dye and you can still get the gal.</li>
            <li> I have used Minoxidil for almost 23 years. It works. However, I do suggest that vitamin Biotin will help reduce the falling of hair.</li>
            <li> I used the 2.5 mg Rogaine to start but saw Kirkland&#x27;s Minoxidil 5 mg topical at a great price so I&#x27;ve used this product for the past several months.  My scalp has become so dry and itchy that I can&#x27;t use it daily.  I&#x27;m not sure whether the alcohol content in this topical is the problem, or the increase in minoxidil dosage, but I&#x27;ll go back to the name brand at a 2.5 mg dosage and see if I can use it.</li>
            <li> several years ago my hair started to thin, minoxidel 5% solution stopped the thinning and also made it a little bit thicker, I have pictures from before and now and it&#x27;s quite clear it made a positive difference and stopped the thinning.</li>
            <li> Product is stated to work on 80% of men. I haven&#x27;t seen any signs it is working but I will continue to try till the supply expires.</li>
            <li> Would like to say either Minoxidil will work for you or it will not.  If it does work the Kirkland brand is the cheapest around.  Price is the ultimate goal since it is most likely made by the same company that makes Rogaine.  I seriously doubt there is a influx of fake Kirkland Minoxidil, counterfeiters would rather do actual Rogaine, so buy it where you can get it.  It does suck that the Costco warehouse only has the foam stuff.  It is so much more expensive and a bad value to be labeled Kirkland.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time and find that it does retain my hair and gives me a small amount of regrowth. I would like to know up to what age it is still effective though. Any answers?</li>
            <li> I too have used Kirkland before and it worked fine.  Started using this new batch about 45 days ago and the shower drain is full of hair.  Bad batch!!</li>
            <li> I had to destroy all of these bottles after using &lt;2 weeks. I was losing more hair using this product. I don&#x27;t know if these are really true Kirkland or some fake products out there as they smell just like straight alcohol!!! BTW, I&#x27;ve been using Kirkland for years and I know what I&#x27;m talking about. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> There is no where else you can purchase this product for less on a 6 month supply. Good product to buy</li>
            <li> Comparing this to Rogaine, it&#x27;s a SMALL fraction of the cost of the name-brand, and delivers something that I feel is easier to apply.  The dropped makes it so you apply just the right amount every time, and it&#x27;s a brand you can trust!</li>
            <li> I have been using Kirkland extra strength 5% for men for 18 years. I have medium thick curly hair.  I had a hysterectomy 20 years ago and my hair got very thin.  My doctor said to use minoxidil for men and use it 2 times a day for 3 months and I would feel little whiskers coming through. I did use it diligently and he was right. I could see the hair 4 to 5 months later. Most people give up to soon.  If you stop within 3 months the follicles that were tricked will start dropping your hair and you will have to wait 3 months for those hairs to grow back.  You have to keep using it like you brush your teeth. you can miss a few treatments and you won&#x27;t see any changes.  I love this stuff.  Hope you try for the 3 months....the women&#x27;s is to weak just don&#x27;t let it run down your face or back.&lt;br /&gt;I use the dropper that comes with, then a few drops on the scalp all over..reach under your hair and rub into scalp.  that&#x27;s it and wash your hands.. DON&#x27;T GIVE UP it&#x27;s well worth it.  no side effects</li>
            <li> Kirkland Rogain is good, no doubt about it. I like the Foam better but it costs twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;Rogain is best used before you have patches, it will regrow hair but does a better job of stopping hair loss than restoration.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted. Seems to be working</li>
            <li> Second dropper would be nice to store product in more than one place and not have to transport it around.  Ex.  One at home.  One at work.</li>
            <li> Product came in good condition and the shipping time was a quick turn around.  The product has a 2014 expiration date which shows it was recently produced for best quality results.</li>
            <li> I have used Kirkland brand for a few years and will continue to do so.  Minoxidil is Minoxidil if it&#x27;s with an off brand or Rogaine.  Its like buying generic ibuprofin instead of advil.  With the name brand you are paying for their marketing but the active ingredient is the same.  I am not a doctor by any stretch of the imagination but if you are thinking about using a hair product I say do it. It will only be harder the later you start and the more hair you need to grow back.  But be prepared to do it for ever moving forward, if you stop, the hair you regrew will be lost.  For me, its an easy desicion</li>
            <li> Priced much better than any generic products of its kind in the drugstores.  This is a must buy for men with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I am not blaming the person selling this as I realize it has nothing to do with them. My husband used this product and his face swelled so much that his eye were just slits and his face was burning and red. I was so worried that I looked online (should have done that first) Soooo....many people have had the same reaction. It is frightening and is very painful and horrible looking.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work!!!! Junk, don&#x27;t waste your money. I shaved my head,lol everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> I was able to better shopping</li>
            <li> Works as well as the name brand for a lot less money, per my husband.</li>
            <li> I am not rated this product based on effectiveness because results vary from individual to individual but what I am rated this product on is the price. A 6 month supply at this price is outstanding!</li>
