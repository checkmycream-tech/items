            <li>I love the vinylux polishes.</li>

            <li>love love love this polish</li>
            <li>I love the durability I have experienced because I have one sensitive nail that always breaks and it hasn&#x27;t since I started wearing this!  Ordering another color!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing... keeps my nails looking good for about ten days.</li>
            <li>This product dries up quickly!</li>
            <li>Very much like a gel manicure except it is easily removed!</li>
            <li>and though I personally do not go overboard it did look amazing on her.</li>
            <li>I had read about it in  oprahs&#x27; January issue ,that they had tried it and found it to be true to its claims.  </li>
            <li>Lasts almost a full week.</li>
            <li>this lasts a full week before showing wear.  </li>
            <li>comes of pretty easy with100% acetone</li>
            <li>Nice color, almost a burgundy red.  </li>
            <li>Stays very long - for pedi - more than three weeks, for mani - easily two weeks.</li>
            <li>If you have a dark red velvet gown this will compliment it perfectly.</li>
            <li>Thought it too red when I first put it on, but it darkens up nicely.</li>
            <li>The shine lasts and the polish does last a full week with the Vinylux Weekly Top Coat.</li>
            <li>This color has great coverage and is a deep red with one coat and a burgundy with two coats.  </li>
            <li>What a beautiful dark true red color.  </li>
            <li>I love the extended wear that I get and the lasting shine.</li>
            <li>I love this color, it is what the name implies, blood red.</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t last 7days - more like 2 days as with a darker color like this</li>
            <li>And to top all that off, it only lasts a day on me before chipping.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to be able to make it a full chip free week, but I am hard on my nails.</li>
            <li>it is the perfect deep dark red.</li>
            <li>This color stayed on very well for 7 days.</li>
            <li>I am ready to change the color</li>
            <li>Very vampy.</li>
            <li>I have received this Nail coat Manicure a time ago and it really don&#x27;t have scratches for a period of a 1 week.</li>
            <li>The color was not quite what I expected but I love the polish.</li>
            <li>Love the dark blood like color.</li>
            <li>A classic color.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a step up from normal polish.</li>
            <li>I bought a few of the Vinylux nail polishes and top coat after a friend of mine raved about them on Facebook.  </li>
            <li>people have had complaints with CND Vinylux polish, but the secret is to put a good topcoat/gloss after you finish.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the polishes I got were old, or what, but they go on kind of thick and goopy,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use thin layers, including the top coat I don&#x27;t think I can stress that enough.</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised when this polish lasted over two weeks without chipping.</li>
            <li>Vinylux polish does last a whole week.</li>
            <li>They last much longer than the regular polish and are much easier to take off.</li>
            <li>Nice color deep red but chipped in a few days</li>
            <li>I have never been able to sit long enough for any nail polish to dry- until this &amp;#34;weekly polish&amp;#34; !  </li>
            <li>Dark polish wears quickly - on me within two days.  </li>
            <li>Polish usually doesn&#x27;t last more than a day or two without chipping...</li>
            <li>When the bottle is new, 3 coats are needed for coverage, then 2 only once the polish gets thicker.</li>
            <li>I use Seche-Vite topcoat fast dry.  </li>
            <li>Dry time is fast though</li>
            <li>You have to put a couple coats on because it&#x27;s so thin and even with a clear top coat</li>
            <li>it does come off harder, so you really have to wrap the nail in a soaked cotton ball.  </li>
            <li>Very let down.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was skeptical at first how this would wear compared to shellac.  </li>
            <li> Product last at least a week</li>
            <li> I also advise wearing heavy duty furniture stain gloves when washing dishes by hand.  </li>
            <li> I have gone 10 days before I had one little chip off at a tip, but I think was my error in gardening!  </li>
            <li> I wear it for dinner dates with hubby or late fall - winter.</li>
            <li> So sorry I wasted all that money!</li>
            <li> no matter how thin you try to get it,</li>
            <li> and I am used to doing thin, I also do gel nails on myself.  </li>
            <li> Thin layers!!</li>
            <li> but I hated the color.  </li>

            <li> It does not do what it says! You have to put a couple coats on because it&#x27;s so thin and even with a clear top coat it really only lasted a couple of days. Very let down.</li>
            <li> Nice color deep red but chipped in a few days</li>
            <li> not a fan of the color at all.  Bloodline is a good name but I hated the color.  Traded with a friend for a CND color she wasn&#x27;t a fan of.</li>
            <li> What a beautiful dark true red color.  If you have a dark red velvet gown this will compliment it perfectly.</li>
            <li> Vinylux polish does last a whole week. When the bottle is new, 3 coats are needed for coverage, then 2 only once the polish gets thicker.</li>
            <li> love vinylux and I love this color. it is the perfect deep dark red. A classic color.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Color is perfect. Product last at least a week and I have to wash my hands a lot. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I love the vinylux polishes. They last much longer than the regular polish and are much easier to take off. This color stayed on very well for 7 days. Sometimes the polish will wear at the tips and very rarely have a small chip at the tips but usually by that time I am ready to change the color anyway.&lt;br /&gt;This color is a dark red. Very vampy. Great for winter. I am partial to dark colors though.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, very happy with purchase. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Vinylux ! finally a product that acts and follows through on its promises! I have never been able to sit long enough for any nail polish to dry- until this &amp;#34;weekly polish&amp;#34; !  I had read about it in  oprahs&#x27; January issue ,that they had tried it and found it to be true to its claims.  the price is great!!!!!!!!!!!!  it allowed me to try it - and order more- after trying it loving it  :) !!!!  It&#x27;s a great polish! oh and don&#x27;t forget that top coat !!  kl</li>
            <li> Nice color, almost a burgundy red.  Lasts almost a full week. 4 stars, a little stain left on nails when removed.</li>
            <li> Wearing this color while I am writing this review 5/15/2014.  It seems to compliment the jewelry I am wearing and it has lasted since I applied it on 5/10/2014 without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have had complaints with CND Vinylux polish, but the secret is to put a good topcoat/gloss after you finish.  I use Seche-Vite topcoat fast dry.  I also advise wearing heavy duty furniture stain gloves when washing dishes by hand.  This helps your polish also last for 10 days.  Let me know if you need some other DIY comments.</li>
            <li> I have received this Nail coat Manicure a time ago and it really don&#x27;t have scratches for a period of a 1 week.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first how this would wear compared to shellac.  O.M.G.  I am thrilled!  I have gone 10 days before I had one little chip off at a tip, but I think was my error in gardening!  I am removing it today only because it&#x27;s time to change colors and my nails are just growing.  I love the durability I have experienced because I have one sensitive nail that always breaks and it hasn&#x27;t since I started wearing this!  Ordering another color!</li>
            <li> This product dries up quickly! However since im a mom and spend time in the kitchen regularly, it doesn&#x27;t last up to 7 days. Good thing is, u don&#x27;t need UV lamp drying process and taking it off is also quick.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing... keeps my nails looking good for about ten days. and the price is great compared to the salon. Got it in all my favorite colors ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> This polish resists chipping... nice!  Nice color too... Thought it too red when I first put it on, but it darkens up nicely.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this product and have purchased several of their colors. I love the extended wear that I get and the lasting shine. I have yet to be able to make it a full chip free week, but I am hard on my nails. It&#x27;s important to use thin layers, including the top coat I don&#x27;t think I can stress that enough. I love this color, it is what the name implies, blood red. I wear it for dinner dates with hubby or late fall - winter. I will continue to purchase, use and recommend. Thin layers!!</li>
            <li> This nail Polish is great  It stays on for a week and it is very easy to put on  and to take off.</li>
            <li> I had gone Monday to get a manicure and decided to try this color. It looks amazing on my skin color. The color does stand out. I saw another girl get it but she topped it off with glitter and though I personally do not go overboard it did look amazing on her.</li>
            <li> My wife liked it. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> It looks great but stains my nails after removing</li>
            <li> A really great color that lasts.</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to last a week without chipping. I applied it one evening and it chipped off the next morning</li>
            <li> Did not last any longer than OPI.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish! Stays very long - for pedi - more than three weeks, for mani - easily two weeks.</li>
            <li> This color has great coverage and is a deep red with one coat and a burgundy with two coats.  The shine lasts and the polish does last a full week with the Vinylux Weekly Top Coat.</li>
            <li> after washing the dishes, the polish start to chip away. it last for  two days max! at the 3rd day it looks like any other regular nail polish that chipped.</li>
            <li> Love the dark blood like color. Nice for fall or winter.</li>
            <li> it is certainly different from other polishes and stays on longer.  it does come off harder, so you really have to wrap the nail in a soaked cotton ball.  But isn&#x27;t that the reason for buying it?  You want something to stand up to the daily wear and tear without chipping a lot and this does.</li>
            <li> Nice color but doesn&#x27;t last 7days - more like 2 days as with a darker color like this any tiny chip will show.  Dry time is fast though and it&#x27;s a step up from normal polish.</li>
            <li> love love love this polish..stays on remarkably well even after dishes laundry and yard work...comes of pretty easy with100% acetone</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Just as pictured.</li>
            <li> The color was not quite what I expected but I love the polish.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of the Vinylux nail polishes and top coat after a friend of mine raved about them on Facebook.  Let me tell you, not a fan.  I don&#x27;t know if the polishes I got were old, or what, but they go on kind of thick and goopy, no matter how thin you try to get it, and I am used to doing thin, I also do gel nails on myself.
