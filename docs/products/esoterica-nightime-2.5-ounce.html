            <li>Good for your complexion with blemish, help fade brown spots</li>
            <li>This is not an overnight process which again is a good thing</li>
            <li>i know this product cointain controversial hydroquinone ingriedient, but i do think its a great bleaching agent.</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Warm skin tones.</li>
            <li>Many people had good things to say about it, so I figured I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li>It works perfect for me and I am sure, it can work very well for you too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great economical face cream to fade sun spots</li>
            <li>This cream has been great to my skin when applied as directed (twice daily) and I would recommend Esot√©rica to anyone who has skin spots to be lightened with an added bonus of a great fragrance and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Just be safe, and make an educated descision.</li>
            <li>hope that helps    love   J.</li>
            <li>Since I am brown skin, I have purchase many fade creams but none work.</li>
            <li>okay, not as well as some bleaching creams I have used before.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The smell is not that appealing either.  </li>
            <li>Most fade creams contain sunscreens which dilute the hydroquinone content.</li>
            <li>SURE HOW THEY ARE SELLING IT ON HERE.</li>
            <li>Like most skin lightening products their ingredients include hydroquinone.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am now 63 if it has been around that many years, there must be something to it.</li>
            <li>I wish we could find it more easily in San Antonio.</li>
            <li>Was shipped very quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>Now I have moved on to another product, hoping I will find the cheap and easy solution.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t the most pleasant as others have mentioned but this actually does not alarm me because products with flagrant smells tend to irritate the skin which is counterproductive.</li>
            <li>also the smell of the product was kind of intense.   </li>
            <li>Again I picked up a cheap one from Swiss Ives (apricot scrub).</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>bought this on the recommendation of an online store that recommended this for the most nether regions (*).  </li>
            <li>I have no major complaints and will start to use this product again, this time more diligently!!  </li>
            <li>Amazing how our grandma probably used this type of cream (remember gramma&#x27;s soft, milky skin?)    </li>
            <li>it really works, love it</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin, and once I exfoliated with a moisture rich product my skin was better.</li>
            <li>I know it goes to your bloodstream so dont use it when you are pregnant.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get this product locally any more and am glad it can be purchased on the internet.</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit of time, but it works great.</li>
            <li>texture was light and you dont need much</li>
            <li>But most importantly, the HUGE dark patch on my cheek is almost gone.</li>
            <li>They do not even list Esoterica as one of their products - yet the Medicis name is printed right on the box.  </li>
            <li>The single most important ingredient you need to watch out for when deciding on a skin bleaching cream is Hydroquinone.</li>
            <li>Brown spots on hands very much evened out or some gone.</li>
            <li>Because I am a skeptic by nature, I had not purchased it until now, even though it is NOT expensive.</li>
            <li>While billed as a creme safe for private areas,</li>
            <li>The stubborn blemishes on my face have not only begun to gradually disappear, but my skin is brighter and more radiant.</li>
            <li>I got it for my sister and she is really liking it!</li>
            <li>I can only hope!! :)</li>
            <li>Safe to use on your armpit, inside tights and even private areas.&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
            <li>Must use consistently. .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it&#x27;s recommended to use this nightly, using it every 2 nights is a better choice with EVERY product like this only because you need to give your skin a break.</li>
            <li>I never understood why they stopped selling it in the stores in the first place.</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect anything magic like, you have to use it for a long time before you notice anything</li>
            <li>I picked it up at Walmart for $6.99 and CVS carries it for a little more, not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I only found the night cream which suits me just fine.     </li>
            <li>I used it religiously for 3months didn&#x27;t work cheap product,nothing faded it just didn&#x27;t do what it says it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this cream for everybody.</li>
            <li>It took using it every night for about a week to see results, but they were VERY noticeable results.</li>
            <li>For the price it works very well.  </li>
            <li>This will work if you use it continuously for about four months, then you will really start to notice the lack of color pigment on sun spots, etc.  </li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really work, used it till gone, didn&#x27;t notice any change</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to use under make up or just &#x27;go natural&#x27; in the mornings for a quick &#x27;glow&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other fading cream products and this one smells the best so far.</li>
            <li>This product is one of the best on the market to even out brown spots, dark spots from pimples, and other various skin discolorations.  </li>
            <li>The cream is light, non-oily and has a slight pleasant fragrance that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Compliments are coming left and right!</li>
            <li>Most of my dark spots have cleared up.</li>
            <li>However, the main \\&quot;bleaching\\&quot; ingredient on this cream is HYDROQUINONE.</li>
            <li>Two consecutive nights of Esoterica night creme caused the same prominent blister-like rash on 3 different people we shared it with.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work quick enough for me, so I moved on to another product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Esoterica Fade Cream for hands and face.</li>
            <li>Exfoliate the dry skin on my face with a rich face scrub.</li>
            <li>I bought to lighten a dark sun spot that I&#x27;ve had for years on my face, it is slowly becoming lighter.</li>
            <li>it makes my crows feet and smile lines look younger.  </li>
            <li>It works great to remove scarring from blemishes, dark spots, uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>After learning of this new research, our team concludes that you should avoid any product which containsHydroquinone and instead use products which include the safer lightening agent: Alpha Arbutin.</li>
            <li>I got is almost completely gone too!     </li>
            <li>With that being said, hyrdoquinone is used in many medicines for excessive acne, skin discolorations and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Esoterica Fade Cream product, when purchased new at a store, has a shelf life of nearly three years.  </li>
            <li>Guess if I sold a product which consistently caused bright red, blistered skin irritation and poor quality I would try to hide too!</li>
            <li>By eliminating the flowery scents most products use Esoterica is less likely to cause a rash or worsen acne.</li>
            <li>young</li>
            <li>I am 36 and look relatively young.</li>
            <li>The stain has been reduced to nearly invisible in just a week.</li>
            <li>all are the most common opinions of this</li>
            <li>I like to use mine at night and my skin is so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>The one sent to me expires in 8 months, which means it&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf for nearly two years.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a big difference under my arms and a mild change on my elbows, but havent been diligent enough to see major results elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We would NOT recommend this product to anyone and we should have simply searched the net first.</li>
            <li>If you are unfamiliar with hydroquinone it has potentially harmful effects when used in high percentage HOWEVER, their formula only uses 2% of hyrdoquinone which is the suggested amount for over the counter products by the FDA.</li>
            <li>I was 16 yrs old and it has done wonders for my skin to keep it the same.</li>
            <li>so i belive its going to last a long time since the jar is pretty big.   </li>
            <li>The acne scars were pretty dark too.</li>
            <li>For me, this product was worth the few dollars I paid for it, and has done the job.</li>
            <li>Before you buy this, I highly recommend you do some research on its active ingredient, hydroquinone.</li>

            <li> The stain has been reduced to nearly invisible in just a week.</li>
            <li> all are the most common opinions of this</li>
            <li> I like to use mine at night and my skin is so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> The one sent to me expires in 8 months, which means it&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf for nearly two years.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a big difference under my arms and a mild change on my elbows, but havent been diligent enough to see major results elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We would NOT recommend this product to anyone and we should have simply searched the net first.</li>
            <li> If you are unfamiliar with hydroquinone it has potentially harmful effects when used in high percentage HOWEVER, their formula only uses 2% of hyrdoquinone which is the suggested amount for over the counter products by the FDA.</li>
            <li> I was 16 yrs old and it has done wonders for my skin to keep it the same.</li>
            <li> so i belive its going to last a long time since the jar is pretty big.   </li>
            <li> The acne scars were pretty dark too.</li>
            <li> For me, this product was worth the few dollars I paid for it, and has done the job.</li>
            <li> Before you buy this, I highly recommend you do some research on its active ingredient, hydroquinone.</li>
            <li> Their web site&#x27;s contact forms are completely non-functional (apparently intentionally so), and 30 days later there is no answer to postal mail sent to their Arizona address; much less from their webmaster.  </li>
            <li> I use it to help clear up brown spots and other imperfections.</li>
            <li> I decide to try this Esoterica Fade cream it take only three week to clear up the dark spot.</li>
            <li> Ok so it really does work, but the smell, in my opinion, stinks!</li>
            <li> IT IS ILLEGAL IN THE US AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES TO HAVE AND SELL THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> I will warn you, this may dry your skin out.     </li>
            <li> My only problem with this product was that after few days of using it left me with dry patches all over, i was really really dry.  </li>
            <li> Basically they would give you a prescription strength fade cream with the same active ingredient as Esoterica (hydroquinone) at 4% (maximum allowed by FDA in the US).     </li>
            <li> The main ingredient is the one that&#x27;s recommended for use after laser treatments (hydroquinone) to prevent the reoccurrence of brown spots, to slow pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> I use every night and after 30 days, my skin is almost all even, I could nor believe specially since it&#x27;s not an expensive item.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and have used this product for about 20 years; not only does it fade my dark marks</li>
            <li> I am a medium dark african american girl, but my arms and shoulders are dark chocolate.</li>
            <li> I was told to continue using it, to prevent for getting dark again, which I definitely will.</li>
            <li> It definitely fades dark marks keeps skin even toned.  </li>
            <li> After several months of use, the area has lightened a bit, but I&#x27;m sad that there&#x27;s still really noticeable discoloration.</li>
            <li> But the one at the laser center was 7x</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now putting A&amp;D ointment on the rough spot to try to heal it.</li>
            <li> after getting into an accident and scarring my face up pretty bad back in 2004 it has literally faded the entire brown marks ive had since then....</li>
            <li> It did nothing to one of them and made the other one rough and raised.</li>
            <li> Esoterica can and will cause serious skin irritation if used on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have not used other fade cream products, so I do not have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> We would have found that the only reviews of this product outside Amazon are all very negative.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of dark spot on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been thinking about buying something to lighten a dark spot on my skin but never got around to it.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face in hopes of fading some dark spots.</li>
            <li> and you have to keep using it, but it will lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 3 weeks at night, and see no difference in my slight dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that the dark spots on my face began to slightly lighten.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use other brands when Esoterica was not available and they seem to do nothing compared to Esoterica.</li>
            <li> did see a slight difference</li>
            <li> (slight cause</li>
            <li> It was just a little dry and itchy, but nothing you cannot avoid by doing a patch test a few days in a row!    </li>
            <li> few dark spots I have on my face</li>
            <li> THATS how dark that thing was!    </li>
            <li> This is a dangerous chemical proven to be carcinogen or cancer causing product on mice, reason why I am giving it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have distant relatives that have used creams with this ingredient before tests were done and they eventually developed skin caner in their face.</li>
            <li> Again, I had been asked if I hurt myself, had been punched, burned, or was CRYING (patch ran toward my EYES and looked like I cried while wearing mascara)</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> &quot; for advice is a waste of time.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this cream to anyone with trouble with pigmentation.</li>
            <li> A waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Had results a few years ago.</li>
            <li> The smell was harsh and I felt like I needed to wash it off of my face and hands.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble, greasy and not very effective.</li>
            <li> My dark spots have already cleared up except for a couple of stubborn ones and they are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> You use very little product twice a day.</li>
            <li> It is a little thick for my comfort, you have to rub in well</li>
            <li> hmm not sure,   </li>
            <li> I have had a stain on my face from Birth Control for the past 3 or 4 years.</li>
            <li> I usually do it when I wash my face when I get home from being out, and before bed.</li>
            <li> Use sunscreen during the day, drink excess water, and apply a small amount to blemished skin after cleansing the face before bed every night.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on two small sun spots on my face.</li>
            <li> so commit to using it at least three-four months</li>
            <li> A small price to pay in my opinion!</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT SAFE!</li>
            <li> Use common sense, exfoliate, moisturize, wear sunscreen during the day!</li>
            <li> Fades sunspots without the sunscreen which is unnecessary at night.</li>
            <li> This is because Hydroquinone is extremely dangerous and may lead to the development of cancer.</li>
            <li> product has a very faint smell of nair which dries to the smell of tissue paper.  </li>
            <li> I still get carded when I go out and this THING on my face had me feeling very insecure, undesirable, and unattractive.     </li>
            <li> Bad smell.</li>
            <li> I got this for a really bad surgery scar.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Talk about vicious cycle.     </li>
            <li> I would have horrible looking hands if not for this product.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble, greasy and not very effective. Bad smell.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously for 3months didn&#x27;t work cheap product,nothing faded it just didn&#x27;t do what it says it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> I had been using Esoterica for over 50 years.  I thought it had been discontinued until I researched and found it here on Amazon.com.    It&#x27;s a great economical face cream to fade sun spots and it smoothes and lifts up and tightens your skin.  I highly recommend Esoterica Fade Cream for hands and face.</li>
            <li> I have used this product sence I was 16 yrs old and it has done wonders for my skin to keep it the same. If your lookin for something that will keep ur complection the same n keep you lookin young this is a great idea.</li>
            <li> Before you buy this, I highly recommend you do some research on its active ingredient, hydroquinone. Although the FDA claims there is insufficent evidence to link hydroquinone to cancer, Japan, the European Union, and Australia have already banned it from their products.     Just be safe, and make an educated descision.</li>
            <li> go find the skin lightener at Walmart</li>
            <li> hmm not sure,   i know this product cointain controversial hydroquinone ingriedient, but i do think its a great bleaching agent. if you are scared to use it do your research! I found that it was only tested on rats and they fed them with the hydroquinone..well a lot of staff we eat is cancerous. I know it goes to your bloodstream so dont use it when you are pregnant. My only problem with this product was that after few days of using it left me with dry patches all over, i was really really dry.  did see a slight difference (slight cause it was short time)   Stop using it and switch to Ambi we will see how it goes. also the smell of the product was kind of intense.   texture was light and you dont need much so i belive its going to last a long time since the jar is pretty big.   hope that helps    love   J.</li>
            <li> The single most important ingredient you need to watch out for when deciding on a skin bleaching cream is Hydroquinone. This is because Hydroquinone is extremely dangerous and may lead to the development of cancer. It has already been banned in countries like the U.K. and France, and Dr. Jacobs of the F.D.A. has concluded that Hydroquinone is mutagenic, clastogenic, and immunotoxic. After learning of this new research, our team concludes that you should avoid any product which containsHydroquinone and instead use products which include the safer lightening agent: Alpha Arbutin.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this cream for everybody. It works perfect for me and I am sure, it can work very well for you too.</li>
            <li> Great service and product!!</li>
            <li> I did not realize this was a fade cream and not just a moisturizer. I&#x27;m not looking to fade anything just wanted a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders. It took using it every night for about a week to see results, but they were VERY noticeable results. Very very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and had family members use this cream over the years and I can say it definitely works as advertised. However, the main \\&quot;bleaching\\&quot; ingredient on this cream is HYDROQUINONE. This is a dangerous chemical proven to be carcinogen or cancer causing product on mice, reason why I am giving it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have distant relatives that have used creams with this ingredient before tests were done and they eventually developed skin caner in their face. Please weight the pros and cons of using it before you buy.</li>
            <li> Esoterica is the only brand I will use.  I have tried to use other brands when Esoterica was not available and they seem to do nothing compared to Esoterica. I am in my 50&#x27;s and have used this product for about 20 years; not only does it fade my dark marks it makes my crows feet and smile lines look younger.  I can&#x27;t get this product locally any more and am glad it can be purchased on the internet.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of dark spot on my face. Since I am brown skin, I have purchase many fade creams but none work. I decide to try this Esoterica Fade cream it take only three week to clear up the dark spot. I have been searching from drugstore to pharmacy for fade cream but decide to try online. Only Amazon website is selling this product. Thank you Amazon/AmericaRX.com</li>
            <li> The main ingredient is the one that&#x27;s recommended for use after laser treatments (hydroquinone) to prevent the reoccurrence of brown spots, to slow pigmentation.  But the one at the laser center was 7x the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on the recommendation of an online store that recommended this for the most nether regions (*).  I have noticed a big difference under my arms and a mild change on my elbows, but havent been diligent enough to see major results elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a very faint smell of nair which dries to the smell of tissue paper.  While not repulsive, it was definitely not the flowery, milky white smell I was hoping for.  It also has a bit of an oily/waxy feel, that makes you cling to your clothes for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have no major complaints and will start to use this product again, this time more diligently!!  (Recommended 2x a day, per the product directions.)</li>
            <li> This stuff works !!  Most of my dark spots have cleared up. It takes a little bit of time, but it works great. Plus it&#x27;s an awesome moisturizer and  smells good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have had a stain on my face from Birth Control for the past 3 or 4 years. I dont have alot of money for a dermatologist and I have read alot about what an actual Dr. would prescribe even if I did go to one.     Basically they would give you a prescription strength fade cream with the same active ingredient as Esoterica (hydroquinone) at 4% (maximum allowed by FDA in the US).     Esoterica is 2%.     Because I am a skeptic by nature, I had not purchased it until now, even though it is NOT expensive. I picked it up at Walmart for $6.99 and CVS carries it for a little more, not bad at all. I only found the night cream which suits me just fine.     People would tell me that the stain on my face made me look as if someone punched me! It was blackish/greyish/purplish. HORRIBLE. I am 36 and look relatively young. I still get carded when I go out and this THING on my face had me feeling very insecure, undesirable, and unattractive.     I would not leave my house without GLOBS of makeup that wound up clogging my pores and causing breakouts. Talk about vicious cycle.     So about a week ago I pick this up and decided to give it a go.     AMAZING. Within ONE DAY I noticed a difference. Now I am fair yellow/ivory complected. Warm skin tones. I have freckles and some acne scarring. Age and abuse from sun as well. This stuff is clearing it all up!    The stain has been reduced to nearly invisible in just a week. You use very little product twice a day. I usually do it when I wash my face when I get home from being out, and before bed. Thats it.     The acne scars were pretty dark too. They are almost gone. As a matter of fact, my overall facial texture appears brighter and younger.     I will warn you, this may dry your skin out.     What I had to do is take a day off. Exfoliate the dry skin on my face with a rich face scrub. Again I picked up a cheap one from Swiss Ives (apricot scrub). It left my skin feeling like a babies butt.     Use common sense, exfoliate, moisturize, wear sunscreen during the day! You are treating your skin! Help the fade cream do its job! All of these help the overall polish of your skin in conjunction with the cream!    I have VERY sensitive skin, and once I exfoliated with a moisture rich product my skin was better. I did let my skin repair for a day and overcome the dryness. A small price to pay in my opinion! It was just a little dry and itchy, but nothing you cannot avoid by doing a patch test a few days in a row!    The sun damage on my forehead from the summer sun burn I got is almost completely gone too!     But most importantly, the HUGE dark patch on my cheek is almost gone. Again, I had been asked if I hurt myself, had been punched, burned, or was CRYING (patch ran toward my EYES and looked like I cried while wearing mascara) THATS how dark that thing was!    I could not be HAPPIER and I had to let everyone know. I havent even made a DENT in the small container of this product, you apply very sparingly!     By the way, the acne stopped too! I have GREAT glowing baby skin and now I am wearing almost ZERO foundation. Compliments are coming left and right! I am also using it on my neck too to have uniform color and to get rid of darker patches of skin where I scratch when I get allergies.    For those of you using it once a day or sporadically, step it up! Do it twice a day, you will be SO happy with the results! My self esteem is back and I will ALWAYS thank Esoterica, and teach my daughter the beauties of fade cream! Amazing how our grandma probably used this type of cream (remember gramma&#x27;s soft, milky skin?)    Thank you for reading this and I hope you try Esoterica and have the SUCCESS I have had with it!!!!!!      Good Luck!!!!!</li>
            <li> This item did not work, it didn&#x27;t lighten my skin at all. I would not buy this product again. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> While billed as a creme safe for private areas, Esoterica can and will cause serious skin irritation if used on sensitive skin.  Two consecutive nights of Esoterica night creme caused the same prominent blister-like rash on 3 different people we shared it with.  We would NOT recommend this product to anyone and we should have simply searched the net first. We would have found that the only reviews of this product outside Amazon are all very negative.  Zero results, skin rashes and blister irritations, extremely short shortlife - all are the most common opinions of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to reach the distributor \\&quot;Medicis\\&quot; for advice is a waste of time.  Their web site&#x27;s contact forms are completely non-functional (apparently intentionally so), and 30 days later there is no answer to postal mail sent to their Arizona address; much less from their webmaster.  They do not even list Esoterica as one of their products - yet the Medicis name is printed right on the box.  Guess if I sold a product which consistently caused bright red, blistered skin irritation and poor quality I would try to hide too!</li>
            <li> Was shipped very quickly and packaged well.  For the price it works very well.  It took a week or so and results were already showing.</li>
            <li> Nice product smell great.</li>
            <li> I started using it two weeks ago and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference. The stubborn blemishes on my face have not only begun to gradually disappear, but my skin is brighter and more radiant. Like any skin care product, you have to help the product help you. Use sunscreen during the day, drink excess water, and apply a small amount to blemished skin after cleansing the face before bed every night.</li>
            <li> Ok so it really does work, but the smell, in my opinion, stinks! It gives me a head ache!!! I would return it but throw away receipt... Ugh</li>
            <li> I like it, it works to a degree, so I am not giving it 5 stars. I have not used other fade cream products, so I do not have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> This product works okay, not as well as some bleaching creams I have used before.  It came on time, was a bit pricey for the amount of product received.</li>
            <li> This fade cream works incredibly well! I use it to help clear up brown spots and other imperfections. I would recommend this cream to anyone with trouble with pigmentation. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product and my skin look great,help me a lot and also was able to used the products in others parts of my body to fade it</li>
            <li> I have been thinking about buying something to lighten a dark spot on my skin but never got around to it. Finally bought this. It worked within 2 weeks with me applying generously 2 times a day! Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 3 weeks at night, and see no difference in my slight dark spots.  The smell is not that appealing either.  I&#x27;ll use the entire jar, but probably will not purchase again, unless I see some results that were promised.</li>
            <li> I got this for a really bad surgery scar. After several months of use, the area has lightened a bit, but I&#x27;m sad that there&#x27;s still really noticeable discoloration. Its not a miracle product, but if you&#x27;re diligent you&#x27;ll get some results.</li>
            <li> This will work if you use it continuously for about four months, then you will really start to notice the lack of color pigment on sun spots, etc.  It is a little thick for my comfort, you have to rub in well or you just leave in on your clothing or sheets.  I like to use mine at night and my skin is so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is very good stuff. I got it for my sister and she is really liking it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! Worked great on the areas i wanted it for! Already ordering my second one!</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best on the market to even out brown spots, dark spots from pimples, and other various skin discolorations.  I have a history with the product and have never been dissatisfied with the results.  Highly recommend to use under make up or just &#x27;go natural&#x27; in the mornings for a quick &#x27;glow&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on two small sun spots on my face. It did nothing to one of them and made the other one rough and raised. I&#x27;m now putting A&amp;D ointment on the rough spot to try to heal it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again or recommend it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work quick enough for me, so I moved on to another product. You can stick with it and see if it works.  I prefer Ambi cream.</li>
            <li> ordered 4 things from Amazon.com at the same time and this was the only thing that ever showed up. been using it for a week and it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> started lightening my skin in a matter of 2 days. Really works. Use it on my chest, shoulders and arms because for some reason they are lighter than the rest of me. I am a medium dark african american girl, but my arms and shoulders are dark chocolate. The only this is it comes smaller than you&#x27;d think, I wish I could find a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> it really works, love it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any changes. A waste of money for me. Formula must have changed. Had results a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Product has worked wonders for me in a very short time, lightening spots that I didn&#x27;t even think could be lightened. This cream has been great to my skin when applied as directed (twice daily) and I would recommend Esot√©rica to anyone who has skin spots to be lightened with an added bonus of a great fragrance and moisturizer. I&#x27;ll have to get some more of this stuff, because I introduced it to my mom and friends and they have stolen a bunch of it from me already!</li>
            <li> I bought this item from a retail store a while back after reading online reviews. Many people had good things to say about it, so I figured I&#x27;d try it. I used it on my face in hopes of fading some dark spots. I used it twice a day for a month and never saw a noticeable change. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my skin type or what, but this product has not worked for me at all. Now I have moved on to another product, hoping I will find the cheap and easy solution. I can only hope!! :)</li>
            <li> Fades sunspots without the sunscreen which is unnecessary at night. Most fade creams contain sunscreens which dilute the hydroquinone content.</li>
            <li> I started using this product since I was 17 yrs. old-35 years ago. It works great to remove scarring from blemishes, dark spots, uneven skin tone. I recommend it 100 percent!  I wish we could find it more easily in San Antonio.</li>
            <li> Safe to use on your armpit, inside tights and even private areas.&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Use always after shower, when your pores are open, wait 30 to 40 days to see results. I use every night and after 30 days, my skin is almost all even, I could nor believe specially since it&#x27;s not an expensive item. I was told to continue using it, to prevent for getting dark again, which I definitely will.</li>
            <li> Awesome been using this product for many years.  It definitely fades dark marks keeps skin even toned.  Must use consistently. .</li>
            <li> Great results. I&#x27;ve been using it daily. Brown spots on hands very much evened out or some gone. few dark spots I have on my face, They&#x27;re noticeably lighter and I no longer have to cover them with an additional layer  foundation stick. For me, this product was worth the few dollars I paid for it, and has done the job. I will be repurchasing. I will continue to use This product.</li>
            <li> after getting into an accident and scarring my face up pretty bad back in 2004 it has literally faded the entire brown marks ive had since then....nobody can even tell i had anything on my face...i have been using it for 9 years straight...definately reccomend it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my face using this. The smell was harsh and I felt like I needed to wash it off of my face and hands. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> It does work. It takes a while and you have to keep using it, but it will lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really work, used it till gone, didn&#x27;t notice any change</li>
            <li> THIS CONTAINS hydroquinone, WHICH CAN AND WILL GIVE YOU CANCER. ITS ALL OVER THE INTERNET IF YOU GOOGLE IT IT SAYS TO STAY AWAY FROM ANY PRODUCTS THAT HAVE THIS CHEMICAL IN IT. IT IS ILLEGAL IN THE US AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES TO HAVE AND SELL THIS ITEM SO IM NOT EVEN SURE HOW THEY ARE SELLING IT ON HERE. BUT IF YOU GOOLE ESOSTERICA IT WILL SHOW YOU THE INGREDIENTS AND hydroquinone IS IN FACT IN THIS CREAM. IT IS NOT SAFE! BECAREFULL IF YOU DO END UP BEING FOOLISH ENOUGH TO TRY THIS.</li>
            <li> Good for your complexion with blemish, help fade brown spots</li>
            <li> I like the way it goes on and stays on. Pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect anything magic like, you have to use it for a long time before you notice anything so commit to using it at least three-four months otherwise don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> I would have horrible looking hands if not for this product.  It is also great at eliminating those wrinkles you get on your chest, and it does wonders for your face too...A must have.</li>
            <li> Like most skin lightening products their ingredients include hydroquinone. If you are unfamiliar with hydroquinone it has potentially harmful effects when used in high percentage HOWEVER, their formula only uses 2% of hyrdoquinone which is the suggested amount for over the counter products by the FDA. With that being said, hyrdoquinone is used in many medicines for excessive acne, skin discolorations and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s recommended to use this nightly, using it every 2 nights is a better choice with EVERY product like this only because you need to give your skin a break. The smell isn&#x27;t the most pleasant as others have mentioned but this actually does not alarm me because products with flagrant smells tend to irritate the skin which is counterproductive. By eliminating the flowery scents most products use Esoterica is less likely to cause a rash or worsen acne. This is not an overnight process which again is a good thing it means it&#x27;s not putting stress on your skin. Overall, I give it a five.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I will definitely order again, and I would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> The Esoterica Fade Cream product, when purchased new at a store, has a shelf life of nearly three years.  The one sent to me expires in 8 months, which means it&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf for nearly two years. I will never buy from AmericanWholesale again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I purchased this nighttime cream because I remember my mother using is when I was a child. I bought to lighten a dark sun spot that I&#x27;ve had for years on my face, it is slowly becoming lighter.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was a teenager.  I love it.  It does takes time to work...but it works!</li>
            <li> Used the Esoterica Fade Cream, on my face once a day before going to bed and noticed improvements on smoothness and softness on my skin. I also noticed that the dark spots on my face began to slightly lighten. The cream is light, non-oily and has a slight pleasant fragrance that is not overwhelming. I will continue to use this cream, great purchase.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere else. Thanks...love it.</li>
            <li> Love it! My dark spots have already cleared up except for a couple of stubborn ones and they are slowly fading. I never understood why they stopped selling it in the stores in the first place. Maybe the younger generation didn&#x27;t want to use what their mother and grandmothers used, but, hell, it works. I will continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other fading cream products and this one smells the best so far. I have been using for about 3 weeks and it seems to do the job. I will most likely buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/30/2013 Update - Still using this product and will continue to use it as it works great... My areas are really white now</li>
            <li> My mother use to use this when I was a child. I am now 63 if it has been around that many years, there must be something to it.</li>
