            <li>what she liked the best was the price. :)</li>
            <li>Good starter set of brushes.</li>
            <li>the case is nice though lol</li>
            <li>It also has a lot of variety of brushes, and they are of good quality - it feels sturdy, and the hairs don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re going to fall off</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t give a good assessment on the use of the brushes.  </li>
            <li>well when i got my brushes i loved them, the packaging and everything</li>
            <li>For the price the brushes are good.</li>
            <li>My wife loved it.</li>
            <li>Seem to be a good quality.  </li>
            <li>It is a good set of brushes.</li>
            <li>Good for a tween girl but would never work for a woman.</li>
            <li>I just do at home make-up but good for business too</li>
            <li>I thought I would be getting, but everything else is good.</li>
            <li>These brushes were good fro what you pay I guess.</li>
            <li>it Dosent apply the blush good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made!</li>
            <li>So many brushes, I don&#x27;t know what to do with them all !  </li>
            <li>Love the leather case they come in!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love em!</li>
            <li>Great assortment of brushes at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this product, it&#x27;s amazing if you want to be a pro putting makeup.</li>
            <li>but they are nice.</li>
            <li>but they are really nice brushes.</li>
            <li>This brushes aren&#x27;t professional at all because if you want good or best quality and a brushes that works for you don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>I love them, they are good quality brushes, for the price.</li>
            <li>The case is also nice.</li>
            <li>Considering the price, I liked the brushes.</li>
            <li>She wanted a set for travel and she was thrilled when she got them.  </li>
            <li>The pouch is great, and the variety is cool, but I don&#x27;t recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>and its easy to keep them together with the lil pouch they come in!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for really nice brushes, &amp;#34;MAC&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Bare Essentials&amp;#34; make awesome brushes that last forever.</li>
            <li>It is very cheaply made but if you&#x27;re not looking to spend a lot</li>
            <li>This brush set is fine is you are into doing makeup every once in a while, and on your own face.</li>
            <li>I think they work ok</li>
            <li>It is great for people like me who does not wear makeup very often.</li>
            <li>a well satisfied customer</li>
            <li>then that i love them...</li>
            <li>Probably will have to label each brush, there are so many</li>
            <li>, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>These brushes are ok for the price.</li>
            <li>Love the case that they come in</li>
            <li>If you do order these, make sure to wash them before using them because you do not want to rub that into your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love them .</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The eyebrow brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I had to throw away the case &amp; most of the brushes</li>
            <li>but since I tossed most of them I cannot attest to their durability.</li>
            <li>but if you have no sense of smell it may be an ok starter set.</li>
            <li>For the price, the brushes were okay.</li>
            <li>I love this brush set...</li>
            <li>You are just going to have to buy more anyway.</li>
            <li>This brush set is of  good quality and the assortment is of just the right sizes and shapes to be versatile for all makeup needs</li>
            <li>and it would be nice if I didn&#x27;t have to clean the brush</li>
            <li>For $10, this is a pretty good purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, pretty good.</li>
            <li>its worth the price, the brushes are somewhat soft but great to use!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will be fine</li>
            <li>If the smell wasn&#x27;t an issue, the quality of this set seemed appropriate for the price (cheaply made)which</li>
            <li>Very nice all black and all the brushes work extremely good.</li>
            <li>They came very quickly and I began using them immediately.</li>
            <li>although there are a couple brushes that look use able and I am wanting to try them out of course after I clean</li>
            <li>I bought these for a gift but the smell of plastic was so strong</li>
            <li>The smell was so strong I put it in my garage</li>
            <li>I am very happy that Amazon makes it easy for returns, because this is going right back.</li>
            <li>when I first got this package in the mail, it was packaged really nice&amp; securely.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are fine</li>
            <li>And I love my new make-up brushes they are spectacular</li>
            <li>I like these because they were cheap</li>
            <li>Are so cheap.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy using them.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are light weight.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The variety of brushes is fantastic.</li>
            <li>They are cheaply made and I&#x27;ve had issues with the falling apart and the bristles coming out.</li>
            <li>The brushes don&#x27;t seem to hold the shadow and goes on too light.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m used to the Mary Kay brushes, but I got it for the smaller ones and they work great</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and there is a good selection.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very cheaply put together and they fell apart the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>The case these makeup brushes came in is very stylish and looks like a professional set.</li>
            <li>I found for something like this it was better for me to buy in person rather than site unseen so that I could find exactly what I was looking for, quality.</li>
            <li>It keeps makeup brushes clean and organized.</li>
            <li>When I tried to really clean them the bristles would fall off.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super cheap.  </li>
            <li>My favorite dirt-cheap brushes are &amp;#34;ELF&amp;#34; and are $1 a pop at Target, and they are pretty good overall.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m certain they&#x27;re not) and seem to be ok for me as a novice.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving it two stars is the eyebrow brush is good.</li>
            <li>These are good if your buying them for a kid who is just starting with makeup but not a pro</li>
            <li>I love these brushes so much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really had too many hairs come off the brushes, just a couple here</li>
            <li>full haired  brushes..</li>
            <li>Not bad at all but can improve.</li>
            <li>but I am super happy with the 15 I spent on these</li>
            <li>I mean, its not the BEST quality, but it does its job.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice set of brushes, carefully enclosed in a leather(pleather?) case.</li>
            <li>I do professional make up and bought these just for the case but actually these brushes are great and work just as good as brushes I&#x27;ve spent 100s on and the case is ok</li>
            <li>but I bought these for my daughter as she&#x27;s getting older and needs more quality items.</li>
            <li>arrived quick too</li>
            <li>Its best to spend a few extra bucks and get a better product.</li>
            <li>If fash has what your looking for I recommend ordering with them their fast easy and effient with their merchandise!Im</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a full set of eye make-up brushes, this is a decent cheap set for that</li>
            <li>Very good quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li>this item is amazing especially for the price!</li>
            <li>The whole set looks good with different kinds of brushes.</li>
            <li>i guess i got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>The case is soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I have not yet had the pleasure of using these brushes, but they look like they are good quality for the price and have a wide variety of brushes for any make up</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to having a nice gift for a white elephant party</li>
            <li>These brushes are worth the money, I love the case makes me feel like a professional, although it did not come with a blending brush</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>The hairs come right off these brushes.</li>
            <li>An Okay product but definitely not worth more than $8.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that they lose their fibers very easily.</li>
            <li>these brushes are amazing for their price, but they are NOT professional quality.</li>
            <li>it is good but do not be surprise if you see some strings falls down while using it</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived right on time exactly as they were described on amazon.</li>
            <li>The bristle brushes are not as soft and some are easily released.</li>
            <li>because it was the first time use.</li>
            <li>One bush kept leaving hairs all over my face and the eyeshadow applicator broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed, I&#x27;m a beginner with makeup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not professional quality for sure, but they&#x27;re perfect for any average person who wants it for themselves to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>they are also pretty harsh/rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>The pouch is the only redeeming factor.</li>
            <li>First off, they tell you to wash them when you get them, so I did.</li>
            <li>I am really into my make-up right now.  </li>
            <li>You can find something better on the same price, really.</li>
            <li>the smell of the leather pouch is pretty strong once you open it.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I washed them, I still had grey bubbles.</li>
            <li>One other thing I noticed was that the brush set had a very strong odor.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a cheap set, the &amp;#34;Sonia Kashuk&amp;#34; kits at Target are much higher quality and are a similarly priced.</li>
            <li>The large blush brush came apart when I took it out of the stinky (understatement)case.</li>
            <li>One thing I really like about the brushes is that the handles are very long, which gives me better control.</li>
            <li>The hair becomes very dry and sheds more.</li>
            <li>and I think they really make a difference.</li>
            <li>you are going to get a whole kit of brushes like ones from mac or sephora.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>well i dont really have much to say about these brushes</li>
            <li>I threw the whole thing away</li>
            <li>they drop much hair, make-up like this</li>
            <li>I really like the case</li>
            <li>The brushes work really well for its price.</li>
            <li>This works very well with my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy that one of my brushes arrived broken.</li>
            <li>although the brushes were inexpensive, they do not transfer pigment very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and there when I&#x27;m cleaning them but nothing to really complain about.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect</li>
            <li>/&gt;I should have looked closer, since I was surprised to see that there is no foundation brush, and most of the kit are similar brushes for eye make-up.</li>
            <li>Its been advertised as professional brushes but you can buy better quality at Walmart or target for same price.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t high-quality or professional grade but they&#x27;re good for everyday use of work makeup.</li>
            <li>You basically get what you pay for here, the brushes are soft and easy enough to use but as soon as I dipped the first one in my shadow the bristles started falling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i honestly dont know how i ever used just plain sponge applicators when it came to my makeup.</li>
            <li>I have other brushes that I use which work way better.</li>
            <li>These brushes are good, and cost much less!!!</li>
            <li>also the case they come in is super cute too late.</li>
            <li>Bristles are not as soft as I thought they would be, but they work pretty well for eyes.</li>
            <li>very cheaply made brushes are not full and some fell out when i used them</li>
            <li>I mainly used the largest one.</li>
            <li>I mainly ordered this for the concealer and eye shadow brushes and think maybe I may purchase another brand just to compare.</li>
            <li>But overall I feel they will get me by until I am able to afford different brushes</li>
            <li>I love this set and went back online and bought my daughter something similar.  </li>
            <li>I havent used all the brushes yet,but from what I can tell they&#x27;re  decent.</li>
            <li>If you have more money to spend, but the nicer, more expensive products.</li>
            <li>I would recommend pending a little more money.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;leather\\&quot; pouch is not of good quality, it&#x27;s flimsy, poorly made, lopsided and doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;velvet lining\\&quot; as it says in the description of the product.  </li>
            <li>Other than that the brushes work fine.</li>
            <li>There are a few good brushes at the very least in this package but when washed  the hairs came out of the bristles easily &#x3D;</li>
            <li>First time you open, you get a plastic smell.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>The funny smell of the package goes away if you leave it open.  </li>
            <li>The only suggestion was to include maybe a couple more smaller brushes (I use different color eyeshadow</li>
            <li>I will probably end up buying some for myself in the near future ;)</li>
            <li>I always thought they would be hard to use but they are better than any spongy brush I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>These look and feel professional</li>
            <li>those brushes are about 25 bucks EACH, you&#x27;ll never find them at a price ANYWHERE NEAR THIS.</li>
            <li>The shape of the bristles of the brushes weren&#x27;t very defined, but they were bought for my personal use.   </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes for professional use.</li>
            <li>They have arent dense enough to really help you apply makeup</li>
            <li>The brushes constantly shed and who wants to pick off brush hairs when you just applied eye concealer.</li>
            <li>I use only two from the whole pack the rest is garbage.</li>
            <li>Brushes are of professional quality.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m not putting them on my face, let alone near my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent set of brushes, I don&#x27;t like the bigger ones (the blush brush)</li>
            <li>On the down side, they shed more than I expected</li>
            <li>The only thing that I noticed that I disliked was the fact the case it came in smelt like paint or some type of fumes that was strong.  </li>
            <li>She still uses her old brushes because she thinks they&#x27;re too pretty and soft to mess up.</li>
            <li>pretty flimsy and probably wont last long.</li>
            <li>Theirs a lot of brushes for less.. sooo worth it..</li>
            <li>I recommend these for personal every day use, not a set for professional use.</li>
            <li>and I barely use them anymore...</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes weren&#x27;t super defined, but they&#x27;re for personal use so not a huge issue either.</li>
            <li>you, these are fantastic and you&#x27;d be dumb to pass them up.</li>

            <li> A great selection o brushes</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> And guess what she&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> The assortment of brushes is great to work with.</li>
            <li> Great brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the price, the hairs do fall out of the brush when using it.</li>
            <li> The pouch ,the brushes, come is very nice too.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes they are great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very nice product for its price!</li>
            <li> Its a great set to start with and the quality is good too.</li>
            <li> what she liked the best was the price. :)</li>
            <li> Good starter set of brushes.</li>
            <li> the case is nice though lol</li>
            <li> It also has a lot of variety of brushes, and they are of good quality - it feels sturdy, and the hairs don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re going to fall off</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t give a good assessment on the use of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> well when i got my brushes i loved them, the packaging and everything</li>
            <li> For the price the brushes are good.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it.</li>
            <li> Seem to be a good quality.  </li>
            <li> It is a good set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Good for a tween girl but would never work for a woman.</li>
            <li> I just do at home make-up but good for business too</li>
            <li> I thought I would be getting, but everything else is good.</li>
            <li> These brushes were good fro what you pay I guess.</li>
            <li> it Dosent apply the blush good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made!</li>
            <li> So many brushes, I don&#x27;t know what to do with them all !  </li>
            <li> Love the leather case they come in!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love em!</li>
            <li> Great assortment of brushes at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product, it&#x27;s amazing if you want to be a pro putting makeup.</li>
            <li> but they are nice.</li>
            <li> but they are really nice brushes.</li>
            <li> This brushes aren&#x27;t professional at all because if you want good or best quality and a brushes that works for you don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I love them, they are good quality brushes, for the price.</li>
            <li> The case is also nice.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, I liked the brushes.</li>
            <li> She wanted a set for travel and she was thrilled when she got them.  </li>
            <li> The pouch is great, and the variety is cool, but I don&#x27;t recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> and its easy to keep them together with the lil pouch they come in!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for really nice brushes, &amp;#34;MAC&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Bare Essentials&amp;#34; make awesome brushes that last forever.</li>
            <li> It is very cheaply made but if you&#x27;re not looking to spend a lot</li>
            <li> This brush set is fine is you are into doing makeup every once in a while, and on your own face.</li>
            <li> I think they work ok</li>
            <li> It is great for people like me who does not wear makeup very often.</li>
            <li> a well satisfied customer</li>
            <li> then that i love them...</li>
            <li> Probably will have to label each brush, there are so many</li>
            <li> , I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These brushes are ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Love the case that they come in</li>
            <li> If you do order these, make sure to wash them before using them because you do not want to rub that into your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love them .</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I had to throw away the case &amp; most of the brushes</li>
            <li> but since I tossed most of them I cannot attest to their durability.</li>
            <li> but if you have no sense of smell it may be an ok starter set.</li>
            <li> For the price, the brushes were okay.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set...</li>
            <li> You are just going to have to buy more anyway.</li>
            <li> This brush set is of  good quality and the assortment is of just the right sizes and shapes to be versatile for all makeup needs</li>
            <li> and it would be nice if I didn&#x27;t have to clean the brush</li>
            <li> For $10, this is a pretty good purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all, pretty good.</li>
            <li> its worth the price, the brushes are somewhat soft but great to use!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will be fine</li>
            <li> If the smell wasn&#x27;t an issue, the quality of this set seemed appropriate for the price (cheaply made)which</li>
            <li> Very nice all black and all the brushes work extremely good.</li>
            <li> They came very quickly and I began using them immediately.</li>
            <li> although there are a couple brushes that look use able and I am wanting to try them out of course after I clean</li>
            <li> I bought these for a gift but the smell of plastic was so strong</li>
            <li> The smell was so strong I put it in my garage</li>
            <li> I am very happy that Amazon makes it easy for returns, because this is going right back.</li>
            <li> when I first got this package in the mail, it was packaged really nice&amp; securely.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are fine</li>
            <li> And I love my new make-up brushes they are spectacular</li>
            <li> I like these because they were cheap</li>
            <li> Are so cheap.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy using them.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are light weight.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The variety of brushes is fantastic.</li>
            <li> They are cheaply made and I&#x27;ve had issues with the falling apart and the bristles coming out.</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t seem to hold the shadow and goes on too light.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m used to the Mary Kay brushes, but I got it for the smaller ones and they work great</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and there is a good selection.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very cheaply put together and they fell apart the first time I used them.</li>
            <li> The case these makeup brushes came in is very stylish and looks like a professional set.</li>
            <li> I found for something like this it was better for me to buy in person rather than site unseen so that I could find exactly what I was looking for, quality.</li>
            <li> It keeps makeup brushes clean and organized.</li>
            <li> When I tried to really clean them the bristles would fall off.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super cheap.  </li>
            <li> My favorite dirt-cheap brushes are &amp;#34;ELF&amp;#34; and are $1 a pop at Target, and they are pretty good overall.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m certain they&#x27;re not) and seem to be ok for me as a novice.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it two stars is the eyebrow brush is good.</li>
            <li> These are good if your buying them for a kid who is just starting with makeup but not a pro</li>
            <li> I love these brushes so much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had too many hairs come off the brushes, just a couple here</li>
            <li> full haired  brushes..</li>
            <li> Not bad at all but can improve.</li>
            <li> but I am super happy with the 15 I spent on these</li>
            <li> I mean, its not the BEST quality, but it does its job.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice set of brushes, carefully enclosed in a leather(pleather?) case.</li>
            <li> I do professional make up and bought these just for the case but actually these brushes are great and work just as good as brushes I&#x27;ve spent 100s on and the case is ok</li>
            <li> but I bought these for my daughter as she&#x27;s getting older and needs more quality items.</li>
            <li> arrived quick too</li>
            <li> Its best to spend a few extra bucks and get a better product.</li>
            <li> If fash has what your looking for I recommend ordering with them their fast easy and effient with their merchandise!Im</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a full set of eye make-up brushes, this is a decent cheap set for that</li>
            <li> Very good quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li> this item is amazing especially for the price!</li>
            <li> The whole set looks good with different kinds of brushes.</li>
            <li> i guess i got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> The case is soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have not yet had the pleasure of using these brushes, but they look like they are good quality for the price and have a wide variety of brushes for any make up</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to having a nice gift for a white elephant party</li>
            <li> These brushes are worth the money, I love the case makes me feel like a professional, although it did not come with a blending brush</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> The hairs come right off these brushes.</li>
            <li> An Okay product but definitely not worth more than $8.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that they lose their fibers very easily.</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazing for their price, but they are NOT professional quality.</li>
            <li> it is good but do not be surprise if you see some strings falls down while using it</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived right on time exactly as they were described on amazon.</li>
            <li> The bristle brushes are not as soft and some are easily released.</li>
            <li> because it was the first time use.</li>
            <li> One bush kept leaving hairs all over my face and the eyeshadow applicator broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed, I&#x27;m a beginner with makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not professional quality for sure, but they&#x27;re perfect for any average person who wants it for themselves to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> they are also pretty harsh/rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> The pouch is the only redeeming factor.</li>
            <li> First off, they tell you to wash them when you get them, so I did.</li>
            <li> I am really into my make-up right now.  </li>
            <li> You can find something better on the same price, really.</li>
            <li> the smell of the leather pouch is pretty strong once you open it.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I washed them, I still had grey bubbles.</li>
            <li> One other thing I noticed was that the brush set had a very strong odor.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cheap set, the &amp;#34;Sonia Kashuk&amp;#34; kits at Target are much higher quality and are a similarly priced.</li>
            <li> The large blush brush came apart when I took it out of the stinky (understatement)case.</li>
            <li> One thing I really like about the brushes is that the handles are very long, which gives me better control.</li>
            <li> The hair becomes very dry and sheds more.</li>
            <li> and I think they really make a difference.</li>
            <li> you are going to get a whole kit of brushes like ones from mac or sephora.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> well i dont really have much to say about these brushes</li>
            <li> I threw the whole thing away</li>
            <li> they drop much hair, make-up like this</li>
            <li> I really like the case</li>
            <li> The brushes work really well for its price.</li>
            <li> This works very well with my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy that one of my brushes arrived broken.</li>
            <li> although the brushes were inexpensive, they do not transfer pigment very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and there when I&#x27;m cleaning them but nothing to really complain about.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect</li>
            <li> /&gt;I should have looked closer, since I was surprised to see that there is no foundation brush, and most of the kit are similar brushes for eye make-up.</li>
            <li> Its been advertised as professional brushes but you can buy better quality at Walmart or target for same price.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t high-quality or professional grade but they&#x27;re good for everyday use of work makeup.</li>
            <li> You basically get what you pay for here, the brushes are soft and easy enough to use but as soon as I dipped the first one in my shadow the bristles started falling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i honestly dont know how i ever used just plain sponge applicators when it came to my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have other brushes that I use which work way better.</li>
            <li> These brushes are good, and cost much less!!!</li>
            <li> also the case they come in is super cute too late.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not as soft as I thought they would be, but they work pretty well for eyes.</li>
            <li> very cheaply made brushes are not full and some fell out when i used them</li>
            <li> I mainly used the largest one.</li>
            <li> I mainly ordered this for the concealer and eye shadow brushes and think maybe I may purchase another brand just to compare.</li>
            <li> But overall I feel they will get me by until I am able to afford different brushes</li>
            <li> I love this set and went back online and bought my daughter something similar.  </li>
            <li> I havent used all the brushes yet,but from what I can tell they&#x27;re  decent.</li>
            <li> If you have more money to spend, but the nicer, more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I would recommend pending a little more money.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;leather\\&quot; pouch is not of good quality, it&#x27;s flimsy, poorly made, lopsided and doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;velvet lining\\&quot; as it says in the description of the product.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the brushes work fine.</li>
            <li> There are a few good brushes at the very least in this package but when washed  the hairs came out of the bristles easily &#x3D;</li>
            <li> First time you open, you get a plastic smell.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> The funny smell of the package goes away if you leave it open.  </li>
            <li> The only suggestion was to include maybe a couple more smaller brushes (I use different color eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I will probably end up buying some for myself in the near future ;)</li>
            <li> I always thought they would be hard to use but they are better than any spongy brush I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> These look and feel professional</li>
            <li> those brushes are about 25 bucks EACH, you&#x27;ll never find them at a price ANYWHERE NEAR THIS.</li>
            <li> The shape of the bristles of the brushes weren&#x27;t very defined, but they were bought for my personal use.   </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes for professional use.</li>
            <li> They have arent dense enough to really help you apply makeup</li>
            <li> The brushes constantly shed and who wants to pick off brush hairs when you just applied eye concealer.</li>
            <li> I use only two from the whole pack the rest is garbage.</li>
            <li> Brushes are of professional quality.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m not putting them on my face, let alone near my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent set of brushes, I don&#x27;t like the bigger ones (the blush brush)</li>
            <li> On the down side, they shed more than I expected</li>
            <li> The only thing that I noticed that I disliked was the fact the case it came in smelt like paint or some type of fumes that was strong.  </li>
            <li> She still uses her old brushes because she thinks they&#x27;re too pretty and soft to mess up.</li>
            <li> pretty flimsy and probably wont last long.</li>
            <li> Theirs a lot of brushes for less.. sooo worth it..</li>
            <li> I recommend these for personal every day use, not a set for professional use.</li>
            <li> and I barely use them anymore...</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes weren&#x27;t super defined, but they&#x27;re for personal use so not a huge issue either.</li>
            <li> you, these are fantastic and you&#x27;d be dumb to pass them up.</li>
            <li> and they do not last very long for the daily user.</li>
            <li> The case is big as the brushes are long and convenient to handle.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> On all of the smaller brushes, this dye kept coming off and making the bubbles grey.</li>
            <li> The brushes were complete black , not as in the picture shown.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only thing is, the bristles seem loose and often get on my face.</li>
            <li> Recently it&#x27;s been starting again, but I&#x27;ve had them nearly half a year and use them multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> I do on the other hand use 4 of all the brushes daily that&#x27;s why I decided not to return or spend money on shipping it back to the seller</li>
            <li> Personally, I think this is a bad set for a starter kit, since it doesn&#x27;t have most of the key brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace some brushes that I had in my make-up bag for way too long.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used every single brush yet</li>
            <li> I think there were a couple of loose ones.</li>
            <li> and I still use it almost every single day!</li>
            <li> , I use it with other brushes I bought, but these really are not good.</li>
            <li> Only cons: the case is a little on the cheaper side, but for the price not an issue at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s fine for someone who doesn&#x27;t wear markup everyday or doesn&#x27;t mind hair all over their face, but not great for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big makeup person, I use mascara, lipgloss and maybe under eye concealer when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, which is a lot lately since deploying to Afghanistan.</li>
            <li> really gross had for a few days and its still there othewr</li>
            <li> These brushes are not very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I expected</li>
            <li> did like that the case stays closed magnetically.</li>
            <li> Other brushes were fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> However, outside of that I have not one complaint.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the case smells like paint when ever it is opened.</li>
            <li> it was a let down..</li>
            <li> Received this product in about a week or less through the postal service.   </li>
            <li> I washed them as soon as I got them and a bunch of black ink kept washing out, some of the brushes took 3 or 4 washes to stop bleeding black ink.</li>
            <li> they broke to quickly i do not recoment</li>
            <li> I am giving this 2 stars because I was able to use 3 of the utensils once I removed the awful smell by leaving them outside for a week and disinfectant spray.</li>
            <li> Could happen less with time, but who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad enough for me to get upset about, it&#x27;s really just one or two little fibers.</li>
            <li> It results I&#x27;m a hairy mess</li>
            <li> The eyebrow brush/comb already broke after only using it 3 times ... Not good.</li>
            <li> The flat brush is not good, bristles were coming off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did have a little but of an odor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably keep a few items and throw the rest away.</li>
            <li> Got these a few days ago, came in 2days after ordering.</li>
            <li> I did notice a few bristles falling out from the beginning, but after a week of use it stopped.</li>
            <li> I have brushes from 7 other brands as well, and these are my least favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this product and was aware that it might smell bad, like chemicals, but I was in no way prepared for it.</li>
            <li> The bristles were shedding pretty bad on this set as well.</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t want to be doing someone&#x27;s makeup and a bristle from the brush is on someone&#x27;s face, that&#x27;s not okay at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ll shed a lot or anything because they are a gift</li>
            <li> There were a few negative reviews about this set</li>
            <li> The package the brushes came in smells horrible, is cheap and I threw it away!</li>
            <li> cause I was not able to remove the stench.</li>
            <li> I mean the nasty smell was so potent that it stunk up any room</li>
            <li> Sucks, sucks, sucks.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I know that this is not the most expensive brush set out there, but there is no reason that is should smell so horrible.</li>
            <li> I have never seen such a bad quality, the hair of the brushes fall as you touch it and it smells so bed like someone took paint and painted the brush in black.&lt;br /&gt;The leather pouch smell</li>
            <li> The brushes shed and not good quality at all ....</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Would diffidently purchase again for a  gift !!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister because I hated her old brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are poor quality (losing bristles) and also smell because of the leather pouch they were in.</li>
            <li> the rest are shedding and thin brushes looks nothing like the picture,</li>
            <li> Its not great but at the same time its not the worst set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> They stick on my face, and it is a little annoying...</li>
            <li> It sheds like crazy, and once you washed it then things gets worse.</li>
            <li> but ill let it air out</li>
            <li> Quality of brushes are extremely poor!</li>
            <li> So not only do I have a product that is horrible</li>
            <li> The brushes look like the photo, but the quality of the brushes are very poor.</li>
            <li> They shed like crazy, and linger on your face after applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to use crazy glue to put it back.on.</li>
            <li> I was so mad</li>
            <li> The list price is very unrealistic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with these brushes.. the smell of the product is terrible.</li>
            <li> they arent bad</li>
            <li> Should have guessed that for this price I would get bad quality.</li>
            <li> For a supposedly $59 retail item, these things are a bad deal even at $16.95.</li>
            <li> so bad</li>
            <li> I removed all of the brushes and put just the pouch to air out and found that the brushes smelled just as bad.</li>
            <li> It smells of bad plastic and gas.</li>
            <li> Disappointing!</li>
            <li> This product is the worse!!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with Amazon on this product.</li>
            <li> The brushes are as advertised, there are lots of them but they smell terrible!</li>
            <li> and they shed horribly.</li>
            <li> The leather pouch these brushes came in smells beyond horrible!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes smelt terrible on arrival.</li>
            <li> The brushes are terrible</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought these for my sister because I hated her old brushes. She loves them! She still uses her old brushes because she thinks they&#x27;re too pretty and soft to mess up. lol  Great buy! I will probably end up buying some for myself in the near future ;)</li>
            <li> The whole set looks good with different kinds of brushes. I mainly used the largest one. The problem is that the hairs of the brush start to fall after several uses. They stick on my face, and it is a little annoying...</li>
            <li> This brush set is fine is you are into doing makeup every once in a while, and on your own face. Pros-it&#x27;s affordable, comes with lots of brushes. Cons-it sheds that&#x27;s a biggie for me, you don&#x27;t want to be doing someone&#x27;s makeup and a bristle from the brush is on someone&#x27;s face, that&#x27;s not okay at all. However, outside of that I have not one complaint.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace some brushes that I had in my make-up bag for way too long. These look and feel professional and I think they really make a difference. Great price, great product!</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived right on time exactly as they were described on amazon. I love the brushes they are great! I will abdolutely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the quality and price of the makeup brushes. My daughter ordered these and she is very happy with them.</li>
            <li> This brush set is of  good quality and the assortment is of just the right sizes and shapes to be versatile for all makeup needs</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazing for their price, but they are NOT professional quality. do not buy this thinking you are going to get a whole kit of brushes like ones from mac or sephora. those brushes are about 25 bucks EACH, you&#x27;ll never find them at a price ANYWHERE NEAR THIS.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to get my package two days after I placed my order. I am a beginner when it comes to using brushes. I cleaned them before use. I think they work ok, there was a lot of shedding but maybe its because it was the first time use. I mainly ordered this for the concealer and eye shadow brushes and think maybe I may purchase another brand just to compare. Just remember you get what you pay for. But overall I feel they will get me by until I am able to afford different brushes</li>
            <li> The bristle brushes are not as soft and some are easily released. Not bad at all but can improve. Thanks</li>
            <li> Received this product in about a week or less through the postal service.   The shape of the bristles of the brushes weren&#x27;t very defined, but they were bought for my personal use.   One other thing I noticed was that the brush set had a very strong odor. It seems as though the smell was from the plastic &amp; the leather case that the brushes are stored in. I ended up leaving them open for a couple of days to \\&quot;air\\&quot; them out to get rid of the smell. Good starter set of brushes. Hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> awesome price for quality brushes!!!!!!! no if, ands, or buts about it! would buy them again in a heartbeat and i honestly dont know how i ever used just plain sponge applicators when it came to my makeup. dnt let the price and none big name label fool you, these are fantastic and you&#x27;d be dumb to pass them up.</li>
            <li> It is great for people like me who does not wear makeup very often. It&#x27;s simple, but it has everything I need. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Sucks, sucks, sucks. The brushes shed and I&#x27;ve had to pick the hairs off my makeup. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it two stars is the eyebrow brush is good.</li>
            <li> If fash has what your looking for I recommend ordering with them their fast easy and effient with their merchandise!Im a well satisfied customer and I approve this comment!</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone they are great and i like them it you are looking for a set  of make up brushes i would say these are the ones</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift and didn&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars for great brushes. I like these because they were cheap but they are nice. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ll shed a lot or anything because they are a gift but they are really nice brushes.</li>
            <li> it is good but do not be surprise if you see some strings falls down while using it</li>
            <li> well i dont really have much to say about these brushes i guess i got my moneys worth. they arent bad but they arent the best. pretty flimsy and probably wont last long. the case is nice though lol</li>
            <li> This is a very nice set of brushes, carefully enclosed in a leather(pleather?) case. It keeps makeup brushes clean and organized. It also has a lot of variety of brushes, and they are of good quality - it feels sturdy, and the hairs don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re going to fall off right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product for its price!</li>
            <li> The brushes smelled and they all broke on the second day of use. I was so mad I threw the whole thing away</li>
            <li> This brushes aren&#x27;t professional at all because if you want good or best quality and a brushes that works for you don&#x27;t buy this. Are so cheap.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use these brushes yet so I can&#x27;t give a good assessment on the use of the brushes.  The \\&quot;leather\\&quot; pouch is not of good quality, it&#x27;s flimsy, poorly made, lopsided and doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;velvet lining\\&quot; as it says in the description of the product.  That said I don&#x27;t mind the pouch because I purchased the product for the brushes.  They have the look and feel of sable (I&#x27;m certain they&#x27;re not) and seem to be ok for me as a novice.</li>
            <li> A great selection o brushes and I enjoy using them.  On the down side, they shed more than I expected and I don&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> The brushes are as advertised, there are lots of them but they smell terrible! I am hoping if I take them out of the case that will help but the case is part of the appeal.    We&#x27;ll see if I keep them...</li>
            <li> well when i got my brushes i loved them, the packaging and everything i opened them and i can smell like a paint fume... really gross had for a few days and its still there othewr then that i love them...</li>
            <li> they drop much hair, make-up like this and you need to be removing the hairs. I really like the case, I use it with other brushes I bought, but these really are not good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece, who is aspiring to be a makeup artist, and she loves the set. Its a great set to start with and the quality is good too.</li>
            <li> For the price the brushes are good. The brushes are soft and there is a good selection. The case is soft and easy to clean. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The set has 12 brushes. First time you open, you get a plastic smell.&lt;br /&gt;1. The brushes are light weight.&lt;br /&gt;2. The case is big as the brushes are long and convenient to handle.&lt;br /&gt;3. The brushes were complete black , not as in the picture shown.&lt;br /&gt;4. The mascara brush was bent&lt;br /&gt;5. The flat brush is not good, bristles were coming off.&lt;br /&gt;6. Other brushes were fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: An Okay product but definitely not worth more than $8.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! Especially since they are a fraction of the price that you would find a similar set in department or retail stores. One thing I really like about the brushes is that the handles are very long, which gives me better control. I would definitely recommend these brushes. As for the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; issue, when you get the brushes they are all individually wrapped in plastic, and once you take out the plastic out it doesn&#x27;t smell anymore.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this product. One bush kept leaving hairs all over my face and the eyeshadow applicator broke the first time I used it. I&#x27;ll probably keep a few items and throw the rest away. You get what pay for!</li>
            <li> You basically get what you pay for here, the brushes are soft and easy enough to use but as soon as I dipped the first one in my shadow the bristles started falling out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fine for someone who doesn&#x27;t wear markup everyday or doesn&#x27;t mind hair all over their face, but not great for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT use these brushes in any sort of cream or makeup! It results I&#x27;m a hairy mess</li>
            <li> This Product is very good. I bought it for my wife. And guess what she&#x27;s happy. My wife loved it. It has everything and what she liked the best was the price. :)</li>
            <li> The brushes look like the photo, but the quality of the brushes are very poor. They shed like crazy, and linger on your face after applying makeup. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these brushes for professional use.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed, I&#x27;m a beginner with makeup but this gives me the tools I need. Probably will have to label each brush, there are so many</li>
            <li> Got these a few days ago, came in 2days after ordering. I love them, they are good quality brushes, for the price. The case is also nice. Only cons: the case is a little on the cheaper side, but for the price not an issue at all. The eyeshadow brushes weren&#x27;t super defined, but they&#x27;re for personal use so not a huge issue either. I recommend these for personal every day use, not a set for professional use. *update* the brush part of the largest brush (powder brush) just fell off the stick. I&#x27;ve never used it. I&#x27;ll have to use crazy glue to put it back.on.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a joke. They have arent dense enough to really help you apply makeup and they shed horribly. The brush used for your eyebrows broke just after I started using it. I would not recommend this set to even a beginner.</li>
            <li> Should have guessed that for this price I would get bad quality. The brushes&#x27;s bristles come off. I would recommend pending a little more money.</li>
            <li> The leather pouch these brushes came in smells beyond horrible!!! I had to get it out of the house. The brushes are poor quality (losing bristles) and also smell because of the leather pouch they were in. I have them outside &amp;#34;airing out&amp;#34; hoping that the smell will go away. If not, I will be returning them. For a supposedly $59 retail item, these things are a bad deal even at $16.95.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, I liked the brushes. They aren&#x27;t high-quality or professional grade but they&#x27;re good for everyday use of work makeup.</li>
            <li> You can find something better on the same price, really. It sheds like crazy, and once you washed it then things gets worse. The hair becomes very dry and sheds more. Save your money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> when I first got this package in the mail, it was packaged really nice&amp; securely. The brushes work really well for its price. I mean, its not the BEST quality, but it does its job.</li>
            <li> I thought that the bristles were going to be smoother but they are not so sometimes I do not like to use them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very cheaply put together and they fell apart the first time I used them. The Brussels fall out every time I use them.</li>
            <li> This works very well with my makeup.  Works so well I bought a set for my mother.</li>
            <li> I have not yet had the pleasure of using these brushes, but they look like they are good quality for the price and have a wide variety of brushes for any make up I need to apply.  The only thing that I noticed that I disliked was the fact the case it came in smelt like paint or some type of fumes that was strong.  Other than that, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> So many brushes, I don&#x27;t know what to do with them all !  Seem to be a good quality.  The funny smell of the package goes away if you leave it open.  Buy one and share with your friends.</li>
            <li> Great assortment of brushes at a fantastic price. Have used for over a month and no loss of bristles.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> These brushes are ok for the price. They arrived within the time frame but it seemed like forever since they had to travel the distance. I wasn&#x27;t happy that one of my brushes arrived broken. It wasn&#x27;t glued properly. Haven&#x27;t used every single brush yet but the ones I have have been doing the job. Love the case that they come in</li>
            <li> I do professional make up and bought these just for the case but actually these brushes are great and work just as good as brushes I&#x27;ve spent 100s on and the case is ok smells like paint but ill let it air out and I&#x27;m sure it will be fine but I am super happy with the 15 I spent on these and it only took 3 days to get it I got the gold set</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with Amazon on this product. The list price is very unrealistic. You could purchase a similar set for about $10 at Target or Walmart. I would not consider the quality of these brushes to be &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;. I have brushes from 7 other brands as well, and these are my least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes smelt terrible on arrival. I washed them as soon as I got them and a bunch of black ink kept washing out, some of the brushes took 3 or 4 washes to stop bleeding black ink. If you do order these, make sure to wash them before using them because you do not want to rub that into your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have looked closer, since I was surprised to see that there is no foundation brush, and most of the kit are similar brushes for eye make-up. Personally, I think this is a bad set for a starter kit, since it doesn&#x27;t have most of the key brushes. If you are looking for a full set of eye make-up brushes, this is a decent cheap set for that if you wash the brushes thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely NOT recommend this product. If you are looking for a cheap set, the &amp;#34;Sonia Kashuk&amp;#34; kits at Target are much higher quality and are a similarly priced. My favorite dirt-cheap brushes are &amp;#34;ELF&amp;#34; and are $1 a pop at Target, and they are pretty good overall. If you are looking for really nice brushes, &amp;#34;MAC&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Bare Essentials&amp;#34; make awesome brushes that last forever.</li>
            <li> There were a few negative reviews about this set so I was hesitant. They came very quickly and I began using them immediately. The variety of brushes is fantastic. I did notice a few bristles falling out from the beginning, but after a week of use it stopped. I think there were a couple of loose ones. Recently it&#x27;s been starting again, but I&#x27;ve had them nearly half a year and use them multiple times a day. It isn&#x27;t bad enough for me to get upset about, it&#x27;s really just one or two little fibers. It&#x27;s not professional quality for sure, but they&#x27;re perfect for any average person who wants it for themselves to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> they broke to quickly i do not recoment</li>
            <li> Bristles are not as soft as I thought they would be, but they work pretty well for eyes. No hairs falling out or anything.</li>
            <li> It is a good set of brushes. They shed a bit but the blending and softness of them are great!</li>
            <li> although the brushes were inexpensive, they do not transfer pigment very well. they are also pretty harsh/rough on the skin. and they do not last very long for the daily user. I personally am not very fond of them, but they were affordable and the sellers were professional and punctual.</li>
            <li> The brushes are terrible I have never seen such a bad quality, the hair of the brushes fall as you touch it and it smells so bed like someone took paint and painted the brush in black.&lt;br /&gt;The leather pouch smell so bad I think I will have to throw it out. Its been advertised as professional brushes but you can buy better quality at Walmart or target for same price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are not very satisfactory. They are cheaply made and I&#x27;ve had issues with the falling apart and the bristles coming out. The pouch is the only redeeming factor.</li>
            <li> The case these makeup brushes came in is very stylish and looks like a professional set. It did have a little but of an odor but I don&#x27;t even notice it anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these brushes for over a month now and I barely use them anymore... Once I used a brush once I couldn&#x27;t get the eyeshadow off of it. When I tried to really clean them the bristles would fall off. These are good if your buying them for a kid who is just starting with makeup but not a pro</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made! Have had to glue brush heads back on. Good for a tween girl but would never work for a woman.</li>
            <li> Quality of brushes are extremely poor! The smell of the brushes does not go away even after you wash them! The package the brushes came in smells horrible, is cheap and I threw it away! Also one of the brushes came apart when I was washing it. There are a few good brushes at the very least in this package but when washed  the hairs came out of the bristles easily &#x3D;[. DON&#x27;T waste your money!!</li>
            <li> good seller very good product</li>
            <li> its worth the price, the brushes are somewhat soft but great to use! the smell of the leather pouch is pretty strong once you open it.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes so much. The assortment of brushes is great to work with. The pouch ,the brushes, come is very nice too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup but I bought these for my daughter as she&#x27;s getting older and needs more quality items.</li>
            <li> El envío fue en el tiempo esperado y el producto llegó completo. No me gustó mucho la calidad de las brochas por lo que creo que fueron costosas para lo que realmente deberían valer por el material.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. I love them . You won&#x27;t regret buying them. Theirs a lot of brushes for less.. sooo worth it..</li>
            <li> I bought these for a gift but the smell of plastic was so strong, I didn&#x27;t dare give it. I tried to air it out, wash it, spray deoderizer on it but couldn&#x27;t get that plastic smell out. The brushes themselves are fine but I&#x27;d trash the case.</li>
            <li> I have never used brushes before this set.  I always thought they would be hard to use but they are better than any spongy brush I&#x27;ve tried.  I love this set and went back online and bought my daughter something similar.  Love this!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> very cheaply made brushes are not full and some fell out when i used them</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this product and was aware that it might smell bad, like chemicals, but I was in no way prepared for it. The smell was so strong I put it in my garage and it didn&#x27;t even touch the smell. I removed all of the brushes and put just the pouch to air out and found that the brushes smelled just as bad. The quality of the brushes is very low, bristles came off just from flicking them around with my fingers. They are flimsy and I cannot see how they would hold any makeup for applications. I am very happy that Amazon makes it easy for returns, because this is going right back. I found for something like this it was better for me to buy in person rather than site unseen so that I could find exactly what I was looking for, quality.</li>
            <li> Love the leather case they come in! Brushes work well. The only downfall is that they lose their fibers very easily.</li>
            <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;does not shed&lt;br /&gt;very soft&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;worth the price&lt;br /&gt;would buy them again and reccomend to others :D</li>
            <li> Good product for the price! The only suggestion was to include maybe a couple more smaller brushes (I use different color eyeshadow and it would be nice if I didn&#x27;t have to clean the brush everytime.</li>
            <li> Product came in all wrap up. Very nice all black and all the brushes work extremely good. I just do at home make-up but good for business too</li>
            <li> this item is amazing especially for the price! the quality is great! definitely recommend. also the case they come in is super cute too late. arrived quick too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product, it&#x27;s amazing if you want to be a pro putting makeup. Only thing is some of the brushes came detached from the post.</li>
            <li> I know that this is not the most expensive brush set out there, but there is no reason that is should smell so horrible. It smells of bad plastic and gas. I was looking forward to having a nice gift for a white elephant party but I am embarrassed to give this product.  Disappointing!</li>
            <li> These brushes are super cheap.  The &amp;#34;Leather Pouch&amp;#34; was peeling.  The brushes shed and not good quality at all ....</li>
            <li> I am really into my make-up right now.  And I love my new make-up brushes they are spectacular and I love it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are worth the money, I love the case makes me feel like a professional, although it did not come with a blending brush I thought I would be getting, but everything else is good.</li>
            <li> This product is the worse!!! I thought you know what let me get a set of brushes. I&#x27;m not a big makeup person, I use mascara, lipgloss and maybe under eye concealer when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, which is a lot lately since deploying to Afghanistan. The brushes constantly shed and who wants to pick off brush hairs when you just applied eye concealer. I have to start over each time because I&#x27;m constantly wiping off the concealer trying to get the brush hairs off. So not only do I have a product that is horrible I&#x27;m wasting money reapplying my concealer. I&#x27;m back to using my fingers until I actually find another brush set. It gets one star for the pouch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the price, the hairs do fall out of the brush when using it. However it works well. It is very cheaply made but if you&#x27;re not looking to spend a lot this is the kit to buy.</li>
            <li> I chose these brushes for the variety of brushes and for the price.  The eyebrow brush is my favorite. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Its not great but at the same time its not the worst set of brushes. I havent used all the brushes yet,but from what I can tell they&#x27;re  decent.</li>
            <li> The hairs come right off these brushes. I use only two from the whole pack the rest is garbage. Its best to spend a few extra bucks and get a better product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for well over 6 months and I still use it almost every single day! I haven&#x27;t really had too many hairs come off the brushes, just a couple here and there when I&#x27;m cleaning them but nothing to really complain about.</li>
            <li> I am giving this 2 stars because I was able to use 3 of the utensils once I removed the awful smell by leaving them outside for a week and disinfectant spray. The large blush brush came apart when I took it out of the stinky (understatement)case. I had to throw away the case &amp; most of the brushes cause I was not able to remove the stench. I mean the nasty smell was so potent that it stunk up any room it was in and even my garage. If the smell wasn&#x27;t an issue, the quality of this set seemed appropriate for the price (cheaply made)which I expected but since I tossed most of them I cannot attest to their durability. I would not reccommend this to anyone with a nose but if you have no sense of smell it may be an ok starter set.</li>
            <li> For $10, this is a pretty good purchase. There are a lot of brushes to choose from. Only thing is, the bristles seem loose and often get on my face. Could happen less with time, but who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with these brushes.. the smell of the product is terrible. I&#x27;ve had now for a week and they still smell I have to keep them in a box so I can&#x27;t smell them .. gives me a headache!  I would return them but I didn&#x27;t get a receipt with my package.. although there are a couple brushes that look use able and I am wanting to try them out of course after I clean then.(I&#x27;d say 3 brushes) the rest are shedding and thin brushes looks nothing like the picture, full haired  brushes.. it was a let down.. Im  stick with eco.</li>
            <li> These brushes are good, and cost much less!!! I like this brand FASH, recomend 100%!!!!! Note: the pouch Is not leather, but is a good material!!</li>
            <li> I like the pouch they came in and do use three of the brushes. The brushes don&#x27;t seem to hold the shadow and goes on too light. I have other brushes that I use which work way better. The pouch is great, and the variety is cool, but I don&#x27;t recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> This was one of my gifts that I send my daughter for her Birthday. She wanted a set for travel and she was thrilled when she got them.  Very good quality for such a low price. Would diffidently purchase again for a  gift !!!</li>
            <li> These brushes were good fro what you pay I guess. I am no expert but the hairs on the brush fall out on your face which is a pain to pick off but nothing you can&#x27;t deal with. If you have more money to spend, but the nicer, more expensive products.</li>
            <li> For the price, the brushes were okay. I didn&#x27;t really expect much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like that the case stays closed magnetically.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package it had a foul smell, I immediately had to wash the brushes just to remove the smell ... Not good. The eyebrow brush/comb already broke after only using it 3 times ... Not good. I do on the other hand use 4 of all the brushes daily that&#x27;s why I decided not to return or spend money on shipping it back to the seller</li>
            <li> Brushes are of professional quality. My only complaint is the case smells like paint when ever it is opened. Other than that the brushes work fine.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set...I also got a kit for doing smokey eyes and this eye brush set helps me do the job just perfectly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent set of brushes, I don&#x27;t like the bigger ones (the blush brush) it Dosent apply the blush good I guess I&#x27;m used to the Mary Kay brushes, but I got it for the smaller ones and they work great</li>
            <li> Absolutely love em! i bought these along with a NYX eyeshadow pallet and they work great! and its easy to keep them together with the lil pouch they come in!</li>
            <li> First off, they tell you to wash them when you get them, so I did. On all of the smaller brushes, this dye kept coming off and making the bubbles grey. No matter how many times I washed them, I still had grey bubbles. The sponge applicator one came apart in my hand. The bristles were shedding pretty bad on this set as well. You are saving no money whatsoever buying these brushes. You are just going to have to buy more anyway. I know I&#x27;m not putting them on my face, let alone near my eyes.</li>
