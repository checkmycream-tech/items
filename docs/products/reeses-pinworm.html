            <li>/&gt;Update: I took a second dose since this review and have been worm free ever since!</li>
            <li>It worked find the first time</li>
            <li>At first I thought I was having an allergic reaction to wipes.  </li>
            <li>Next, it was time to tell the sexual partner.  </li>
            <li>cured it fast!</li>
            <li>Also be careful what meat you eat make sure food is always fresh.</li>
            <li>After becoming OCD about my cleanliness and not making any progress to returning to normality, I began researching human worms.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t phase me to much because the actual thing I wanted was just fine.</li>
            <li>so we thought he had pin worms, so we treated the whole family.</li>
            <li>thank you for the fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it was really chalky</li>
            <li>The product came really dent up</li>
            <li>&amp; I still feel very itchy &amp;</li>
            <li>Product worked very well.  </li>
            <li>They went straight into the washing machine after use.  </li>
            <li>The witch hazel really helped soothe in the meantime.  </li>

            <li>The witch hazel really helped soothe in the meantime.  </li>
            <li>The Vaseline only relieved the itch and confirmed my suspicion that I&#x27;m one of the \\&quot;rare\\&quot; cases that has to deal with retroinfection.</li>
            <li>Very helpful during parasites detox.</li>
            <li>I guess the only good thing is that it&#x27;s decreased the total number of worms, but I want them gone for good.</li>
            <li>This product effectively removed all symptoms of worms within 24 hours with very little side effects.</li>
            <li>but I am going to buy a few more to keep in my cabinet.  </li>
            <li>And I live in Utah which doesn&#x27;t have a high cost of living</li>
            <li>I discovered we had them on new years day.</li>
            <li>But I believe it&#x27;s due to this place a had to clean and watch their animals</li>
            <li>But I would like to say that my local drug store charged TWICE as much as this amazon price for the exact same product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get two boxes, though, as there is only enough medicine to do one full adult dose</li>
            <li>I just wish the bottle were bigger, I have a large family and had to order a couple of bottles for one treatment.</li>
            <li>24 hours after taking it and only a little bit better.</li>
            <li>My 4 yr old was itching his butt for weeks</li>
            <li>i noticed results nearly immediately.</li>
            <li>Underwear was worn 24 hours a day and changed every morning and night and placed directly into washing machine.  </li>

            <li>I had seen doctors for this for my young daughter and son, and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li>a few hours later he felt better.</li>
            <li>The product itself works pretty good, taste wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This provides decent treatment at a low cost without the embarrassment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;For the Entire Family&amp;#34; clause on the box is a little misleading, as the included dose would not be enough for more than 1 or 2 people.</li>
            <li>Had for a long time  years really didn&#x27;t realize there was something for it bumped into this product by mistake</li>
            <li>Might sound gross but no more annoying nightly butt itch for me :D</li>
            <li>In another week (two weeks after my initial dose) I will take another dose to kill any new hatchlings.  </li>
            <li>In another week (two weeks after my initial dose) I will take another dose to kill any new hatchlings.  </li>
            <li>my mother was suffer on the worm for few month, and she want something mild.</li>
            <li>but I had no other symptoms and everything I found online</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t disappoint in the slightest bit - the effects were not immediate, but after 24 hours, and about five days since the initial dosage, the itching had completely subsided and there has been no sight of any parasites.</li>
            <li>Not great, not horrible.  </li>
            <li>(my second dose was a little more than a half dose).</li>
            <li>I believe I got pinworms from work, and not long after taking this medication, they were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a glass of water ready to chase it down with.  </li>
            <li>While I took Reese&#x27;s Pinworm Medicine, I would still see at least one or two pinworms daily, and then, they would come back in full force.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a little over 2 weeks now, and it really seems to be working.</li>

            <li> I believe I got pinworms from work, and not long after taking this medication, they were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a glass of water ready to chase it down with.  </li>
            <li> While I took Reese&#x27;s Pinworm Medicine, I would still see at least one or two pinworms daily, and then, they would come back in full force.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little over 2 weeks now, and it really seems to be working.</li>
            <li> And no one in my family has them, so it&#x27;s pretty hard to believe that I am reinfecting myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how fast it&#x27;s supposed to work</li>
            <li> Then I added a bidet attachment to my toilet.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know how long I have to do this, because all the sources online seem to disagree on how long pinworms actually survive in the gut.</li>
            <li> For the next week, towels and wash clothes became single use items.  </li>
            <li> For the next week, towels and wash clothes became single use items.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend taking a second dose after the first week to ensure no eggs are left behind.</li>
            <li> It did not completely resolve the problem though it did help.</li>
            <li> Pin X gave me some relief of Pinworms symptoms, even though it did not completely get rid of the problem either.</li>
            <li> Might work for small children who have much shorter digestive tract or few parasites.</li>
            <li> (But I also have a weak stomach and can&#x27;t take much nastiness)</li>
            <li> This product is not effective, do not waste your money on buying this item.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no way to be discreet, but I was NOT waiting for USPS to bring me relief.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to look elsewhere for other means of treatment.</li>
            <li> Since I rely so heavily on other people&#x27;s reviews when I&#x27;m shopping, I decided to help others by writing a review about this product.</li>
            <li> included other visible symptoms that I did not have.  </li>
            <li> I c live wiggly worms on the toilet tissue (sorry for tmi).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually afraid that the test will come up negative, and I won&#x27;t be able to get medication to eradicate the pinworms permanently.</li>
            <li> , I guess it works when you are just a little bit sick, because it did make me feel better</li>
            <li> and its gotten worse do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Doctor was closed!!</li>
            <li> I took this product in this middle of the night out of pure anger because i couldnt sleep, because of the non stop itching the pinworms caused me.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight aftertaste but is otherwise palatable.</li>
            <li> He was a little nausea but</li>
            <li> I was a little jittery afterwards, but I think that was just my nerves.  </li>
            <li> This ensured that the hatched eggs were killed.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> So, the itch was still present but steadily decreased and was gone in about 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> So, the itch was still present but steadily decreased and was gone in about 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> I had that uncomfortable feeling of the slight itchy stuff, so I looked around at different pinworm treatments and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> I even increased my intake of raw garlic and roasted pumpkin seeds during that time.</li>
            <li> I was having a real hard time because it got to the point that I could not use toilet paper.  </li>
            <li> The worms are small white/clear in color.</li>
            <li> Still not sure if he had them or not</li>
            <li> Well I had pin worms for years, because I&#x27;m one of those people too shy to go to anyone, even a doctor, for such an embarrassing problem.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it has worked yet or not but will update.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it says pinworms in big letters displayed across the box.  </li>
            <li> the important thing is killing these evil gals.</li>
            <li> i had no side effects, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you wont.</li>
            <li> Gave 2 stars only cuz the flavor wasnt that bad</li>
            <li> react  approximately 2 hours after we drink.&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read online that pinworms can be incredibly difficult for adults to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Tried that for over a month, had it on 24/7, and that did nothing for me (sadly).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but since I was desperate</li>
            <li> Wasted $14 buying this product to still have the disgusting wriggling . .</li>
            <li> a week itching like crazy thinking it was a rash.</li>
            <li> I thought that was crazy, but not as crazy as sticking a clove of garlic up your butt.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that Noxzema would burn or irritate my skin, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The stuff didn&#x27;t taste awful, but it&#x27;s one small dosage</li>
            <li> Made us feel sick to our stomach.</li>
            <li> All seven of us took it and none of us got sick from it.</li>
            <li> but I guess it was because I was really sick</li>
            <li> I went to the pharmacy and they were very expensive!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> worst ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It was OK taste good but really did nothing for me I still itch maybe it&#x27;ll work for someone else</li>
            <li> Ships quickly and works well. Change sheets when taking initial dose to maximize effectiveness, and keep the leftovers just in case symptoms return within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> never know what kids bring home nowadays</li>
            <li> It worked! Took in the morning around 10 a.m. and didn&#x27;t see them ever again. I&#x27;m not sure how fast it&#x27;s supposed to work but I didn&#x27;t seem to have a problem that night getting to sleep. It&#x27;s been 2 or 3 weeks and they haven&#x27;t been back. Didn&#x27;t taste too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Pinworms came back after this review BUT I took another dose and now they&#x27;ve been gone for months. I&#x27;d recommend taking a second dose after the first week to ensure no eggs are left behind.</li>
            <li> This medicine did what it was supposed to do. The whole family is now worm free. We&#x27;re really happy with that...</li>
            <li> Had for a long time  years really didn&#x27;t realize there was something for it bumped into this product by mistake glad I did.</li>
            <li> I researched online best possible cures for pinworms and Reeses was one of the Meds that was posted. This product is not effective, do not waste your money on buying this item. I&#x27;ve had to look elsewhere for other means of treatment.</li>
            <li> Took it in the moring by the afternoon it was working. Keep in mine// its better to take when your home, it will make you use the restroom alot /:  but it works.</li>
            <li> So interesting what came out of me the day after I used this. In combination with threelac, I am feeling better and better.</li>
            <li> This product worked well. However witch hazel is a good product to use for worms, just pour it all over body in the tub and the worms will start jumping from skin. I did this to my son and i couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. I had to go online and research what he had. He is a child and didn&#x27;t wipe his ass properly so pin worms came about. Now I make sure ass is wipe after taking a number 2. Also be careful what meat you eat make sure food is always fresh. The worms are small white/clear in color. Also drink DE powder food grade, it work well for cleansing the body.</li>
            <li> my mother was suffer on the worm for few month, and she want something mild. and it works great. we even recommend to all our friends.</li>
            <li> try one week, and get the second dose, wait for several days, still have a lot of problem.  does not work, would like my money back.  Called the doctor for prescription, works the same day</li>
            <li> Wasted $14 buying this product to still have the disgusting wriggling . . and its gotten worse do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it....it&#x27;s embarrassing to go to the doctor with your kids...with PINWORMS.  GROSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This provides decent treatment at a low cost without the embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did it three times, separated by 2 weeks each time.  This ensured that the hatched eggs were killed.  It worked.  We haven&#x27;t had any in 6 months.  Thank GOD!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blech.  So gross.</li>
            <li> I had that uncomfortable feeling of the slight itchy stuff, so I looked around at different pinworm treatments and decided on this one.  After two doses, it seems to have done the trick!  I&#x27;d get two boxes, though, as there is only enough medicine to do one full adult dose (my second dose was a little more than a half dose).</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Didn&#x27;t do the job. Might work for small children who have much shorter digestive tract or few parasites. Do not recommend for adults.</li>
            <li> It made me puke but it worked so I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> Made us feel sick to our stomach. My 4 yr old was itching his butt for weeks so we thought he had pin worms, so we treated the whole family. Still not sure if he had them or not but he still itches occasionally.</li>
            <li> Reese Chemical is a very caring company!  Thank you very much for your concern and working with me.  I really appreciate all your assistance!</li>
            <li> thank you for the fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I let my family drink it.&lt;br /&gt;i feel such drinking a laxative.&lt;br /&gt;it react  approximately 2 hours after we drink.&lt;br /&gt;we are not diagnose to have a pinworm, but this step is only a prevention we do each year.</li>
            <li> I took my first dosage yesterday and today I seen progress when I went to restroom, I&#x27;m glad I chose this product it works like a charm.....</li>
            <li> Might sound gross but no more annoying nightly butt itch for me :D This product kicked those pin worms butt right out of my butt and I can now sleep at night without that crawling sensation around my anus. Alot of people think only kids can get pin worms but if your eating pork, fastfood, or any sort of meat thats either undercooked or YOU didnt cook it and your butt itches ESPECIALLY at night after a shower GRAB THIS PRODUCT IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> It worked well for my son. He was a little nausea but a few hours later he felt better.</li>
            <li> this product might probably be effective when used by kids,the worms disappeared for a while but after some time i noticed them again.</li>
            <li> followed instructions, did not work for me.</li>
            <li> 24 hours after taking it and only a little bit better. I&#x27;m going to go to the dr in the morning.</li>
            <li> Well I had pin worms for years, because I&#x27;m one of those people too shy to go to anyone, even a doctor, for such an embarrassing problem. So I looked online and found this stuff so I gave it a try. I did one dose and I was pin worm free for months. Today I learned I have them again! Nooo! But I believe it&#x27;s due to this place a had to clean and watch their animals so I do believe this stuff works. I took another dose today and am sure it will work again as it did the first time. So if you&#x27;re having this problem, I do recommend this product! The medication tastes like Bananas Lol but after about 30mins to an hour I start to get a little queezy. It works though so I can deal with that. I&#x27;m for sure going to make sure I have this stuff on hand for any time I happen to get these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I took a second dose since this review and have been worm free ever since! So, yes, I do recommend this product. It&#x27;s easy to use, cheap, and works great.</li>
            <li> My kids got pin worm&#x27;s and this was recommended from the dr. I went to the pharmacy and they were very expensive! This was a great price and worked right away! Seller got it to us quick.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product last night from my local Walgreens so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works. But I would like to say that my local drug store charged TWICE as much as this amazon price for the exact same product.  And I live in Utah which doesn&#x27;t have a high cost of living (might be a different thing in NY or Alaska).  So if you&#x27;re thinking about picking it up locally, this might be a cheaper option.</li>
            <li> Works great but takes a few days.</li>
            <li> Product as described shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Since I rely so heavily on other people&#x27;s reviews when I&#x27;m shopping, I decided to help others by writing a review about this product. I self-diagnosed myself with pinworms and tried to get my doctor to prescribe Vermox without me going in for a visit but she wouldn&#x27;t do it. So I had to settle for Reese&#x27;s Pinworm Medicine since it&#x27;s an OTC drug. It was amazing! I took one dose as directed and within about 48 hours, my symptoms were all gone! I will spare everyone the gorey details but bottom-line (get it bottom), my itching has ended! Awesome product, came sooner than I expected it to, five stars to Reese&#x27;s and to Mr. Medical!!!</li>
            <li> bless u, reese&#x27;s. BLESS YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;went a week itching like crazy thinking it was a rash. finally ~investigated~ (i&#x27;ll spare you the details) and uh, yeah. it was worms. harmless, ITCHY worms. did some research and thankfully discovered i could bypass the doctor and just scoop up a box of this stuff. one walgreens was out, but they called and found one nearby that had it. bought it. drank it. i noticed results nearly immediately. those worms have finally been evicted. i had no side effects, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you wont. we&#x27;re all different. the important thing is killing these evil gals. the box didn&#x27;t say to, but i know i need to take another dose in two weeks to kill any remaining hatchlings. in the meantime, i&#x27;ll be cleaning my house obsessively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for an effective over the counter product, reese&#x27;s! xoxoxo</li>
            <li> Ive had pinworms for about 4 years up until a month ago. i purchased this product just hoping i could get rid of these things. I took this product in this middle of the night out of pure anger because i couldnt sleep, because of the non stop itching the pinworms caused me. In the next 2 days i found no traces of them at all. Since then i have been pinworm free and i am super happy!!</li>
            <li> I have five kids..so there was seven of us with it at once..worst ever. I bought this cause I discovered we had them on new years day. Doctor was closed!! Worked! Pulse I cleaned every thing I could get my hands one. Now I can sleep knowing there&#x27;s nothing crawling around. All seven of us took it and none of us got sick from it. We all felt fine.</li>
            <li> I took the recommended dosage of this product and it worked great. I believe I got pinworms from work, and not long after taking this medication, they were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone who has pinworms.</li>
            <li> It worked find the first time but I am going to buy a few more to keep in my cabinet.  I believe I may take one more treatment to make for sure and than may once a year or once every 6 months I will be cleaning me out from the inside out.  I took this over a month ago.</li>
            <li> Hi,  I have a child who itches at night and giving him one dose made him sleep through the night.</li>
            <li> The taste was unbearable. (But I also have a weak stomach and can&#x27;t take much nastiness) it was really chalky but oh well its medicine not cake. The product came really dent up but it didn&#x27;t phase me to much because the actual thing I wanted was just fine. Not sure if it has worked yet or not but will update.</li>
            <li> Gave 2 stars only cuz the flavor wasnt that bad so it made it easier to consume.. But it&#x27;s now almost 36 hrs later &amp; I still feel very itchy &amp; I c live wiggly worms on the toilet tissue (sorry for tmi). It says dont take another dose only if told by dr. I wonder if pin-x works better</li>
            <li> The product itself took over two weeks to arrive. It did not completely resolve the problem though it did help. The directions say not to take a second dose without the consent of a doctor but I don&#x27;t see any way around it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t enough for even one person, yet it says it&#x27;s for the entire family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who was too embarrassed to go to my Doctor about this issue, so I finally just decided to order this based on recommendations. It didn&#x27;t disappoint in the slightest bit - the effects were not immediate, but after 24 hours, and about five days since the initial dosage, the itching had completely subsided and there has been no sight of any parasites. The stuff didn&#x27;t taste awful, but it&#x27;s one small dosage so that is a pretty small gripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue was with this seller, not the product. For some reason on the front of the package \\&quot;CONDOMS\\&quot; was written on the front. Kind of awkward when you&#x27;re trying to be discreet as possible about this and a package arrives with that plastered on the front...</li>
            <li> Worked great for me in only about 2 days.  (There&#x27;s nothing else to say, but since there is a word minimum here......)</li>
            <li> Excellent product, arrived before expected. very fast shipping. product was as described..</li>
            <li> The product itself works pretty good, taste wasn&#x27;t too bad. Kinda like a chalky banana? Anyways four stars because the package came beat up. Although that could have also been from who ever was handling it. Oh and make sure you only use it when you&#x27;re at home, lol your butt will be a cannon.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed. Worked only partly. Still have lingering pinworms a month later. Will need to try another brand.</li>
            <li> works great and is fast working. we travel and my kids are on farms a lot, this works great and is cheap.</li>
            <li> This product effectively removed all symptoms of worms within 24 hours with very little side effects. It does have a slight aftertaste but is otherwise palatable.</li>
            <li> I did not see any proof of having eliminated worms, but the one symptom I was experiencing was resolved after taking the treatment.  The &amp;#34;For the Entire Family&amp;#34; clause on the box is a little misleading, as the included dose would not be enough for more than 1 or 2 people.</li>
            <li> Product worked very well.  I do think it should be mandatory for kids to repeat the dose after 2 weeks though.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work that well but I guess it was because I was really sick, I guess it works when you are just a little bit sick, because it did make me feel better but after a while I got the symptoms again...</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this product, however, the sellers were very fast in replying to me and sorting out any issues I had. I&#x27;m sure their product is as good as their service.</li>
            <li> The statement on the package \\&quot;For The Entire Family\\&quot; was misleading me to think it would last me for the two weeks I was recommended to try it. I should have looked up the usage instructions and bottle size and do the math before I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is quite pleasant - banana. I expected something with a bitter after-taste, but it really tastes like banana milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure it helped over the three days the medicine lasted.</li>
            <li> If you are researching this product, then you probably have those undesirable symptoms causing you to wonder if you have pinworms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffered through these symptoms for several months too embarrassed to say anything to anyone.  At first I thought I was having an allergic reaction to wipes.  I changed brands, then tried baby wipes, then quit them all together.  Next, I changed my soap.  Then I changed to soap free, dye free, fragrance free wash.  Then I added a bidet attachment to my toilet.  I was having a real hard time because it got to the point that I could not use toilet paper.  I jumped in the shower several times a day.  Starting using Neosporin and lotion to try to soothe.  NOTHING WAS WORKING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started searching STD&#x27;s but I had no other symptoms and everything I found online included other visible symptoms that I did not have.  It was only by chance that I came across a comment where someone was brave enough to post that they had worms.  After becoming OCD about my cleanliness and not making any progress to returning to normality, I began researching human worms.  Very quickly I came across the symptoms of pinworms and realized, OMG, I have worms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to my local pharmacy to see if they had this product.  Thankfully, they did.  Unfortunately, it says pinworms in big letters displayed across the box.  Absolutely no way to be discreet, but I was NOT waiting for USPS to bring me relief.  I sucked up my pride and bought it from the store along with some witch hazel.  (Reese&#x27;s Pinworms was located next to the stuff for lice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a dose as soon as I got back home.  The taste was okay.  Not great, not horrible.  I had a glass of water ready to chase it down with.  I was a little jittery afterwards, but I think that was just my nerves.  Next, it was time to tell the sexual partner.  How do you tell someone you have worms?  LOL  Thank god he took it in stride and just asked what did he need to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVERYTHING in my house was cleaned.  All linen, blankets, towels, clothes.  Hell, I needed to do laundry anyways.  For the next week, towels and wash clothes became single use items.  They went straight into the washing machine after use.  Underwear was worn 24 hours a day and changed every morning and night and placed directly into washing machine.  Clean pants and clean pajama bottoms everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did this product work?  YOU BET IT DID!  This product does not help with the symptoms of pinworms, just the cause of the symptoms, the worms.  So, the itch was still present but steadily decreased and was gone in about 48 hours.  The witch hazel really helped soothe in the meantime.  It&#x27;s been a week, and I am happy to say, I am finally normal again.  In another week (two weeks after my initial dose) I will take another dose to kill any new hatchlings.  I&#x27;m taking no chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was only enough to treat one man and one woman one dose each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WASH YOUR HANDS PEOPLE!  I really hope I picked this up from a child and not an adult who should know better.  So gross.  I have become paranoid about germs now.  I always laughed at the people who used paper towels to open the bathroom door to leave after they washed their hands.  I won&#x27;t be laughing any more!!!HING in my house was cleaned.

            <li> My daughter  had pin worms and this cured it fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product twice from my local Walgreens; 4 doses in total, each dose two weeks apart. I still can&#x27;t get rid of the pinworms! And no one in my family has them, so it&#x27;s pretty hard to believe that I am reinfecting myself. I think they&#x27;re just staying in my gut and refusing to leave. I have no idea where I even got them from. (I assume I got it from some restaurant.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this was a total waste of money. I guess the only good thing is that it&#x27;s decreased the total number of worms, but I want them gone for good. I&#x27;ve read online that pinworms can be incredibly difficult for adults to get rid of. Maybe next time, I&#x27;ll chug the entire bottle. That or I&#x27;ll have to wait until I can afford healthcare and get a prescription.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. This is such an annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;TMI update 8/7/2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R.R.G. suggested that I use Vaseline. Tried that for over a month, had it on 24/7, and that did nothing for me (sadly). I even increased my intake of raw garlic and roasted pumpkin seeds during that time. It was... ineffective. The Vaseline only relieved the itch and confirmed my suspicion that I&#x27;m one of the \\&quot;rare\\&quot; cases that has to deal with retroinfection. I take showers in the morning (which doctors highly recommend for people who are infected) to make sure I get rid of any eggs. But, that&#x27;s also ineffective for those of us who deal with retroinfection, considering that the eggs hatch after 4-6 hours, which means you&#x27;d still be asleep when you get reinfected! Anyway, I saw that some people online used Noxzema (or Vicks) instead. I thought that was crazy, but not as crazy as sticking a clove of garlic up your butt. So, I tried it, putting it on only at night. I was afraid that Noxzema would burn or irritate my skin, but it didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s been a little over 2 weeks now, and it really seems to be working. Now, I very rarely see pinworms. While I took Reese&#x27;s Pinworm Medicine, I would still see at least one or two pinworms daily, and then, they would come back in full force. But now, I see none most of the time. Hopefully, it stays that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a doctor, and she required me to take a stool sample. I&#x27;m actually afraid that the test will come up negative, and I won&#x27;t be able to get medication to eradicate the pinworms permanently. Maybe Noxzema is effective enough for me. I just don&#x27;t know how long I have to do this, because all the sources online seem to disagree on how long pinworms actually survive in the gut. I&#x27;ll update again in the future.</li>
            <li> I took this product, and it was like I had not taken anything at all, because nothing had changed. Pin X gave me some relief of Pinworms symptoms, even though it did not completely get rid of the problem either.</li>
            <li> Its an acquired taste,but worked great.</li>
            <li> I just wish the bottle were bigger, I have a large family and had to order a couple of bottles for one treatment. Pinworms can actually cause rashes. I had seen doctors for this for my young daughter and son, and nothing seemed to work. Once I gave them this pinworm medicine, the rashes around there nose/mouth went away. Would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Very helpful during parasites detox.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but since I was desperate I thought I would try it and boy did it work!  It was probably within 24 hours and all the symptoms of the pinworms were gone.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  It&#x27;s been about two months and they have not come back.  I bought an extra box just in case.</li>
