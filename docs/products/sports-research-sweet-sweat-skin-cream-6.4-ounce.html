            <li>This product smells good.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m seeing good results.</li>

            <li>It does smell nice though.</li>
            <li>and absolutely I was impressed, results every time</li>
            <li>You burn energy, you get warm, your body senses the temperature and fires up the cooling system.</li>
            <li>A person with a sedentary job in Antarctica burns 8,000 calories a day just to stay warm.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, it really does increase the amount of sweat you lose during workouts in fact</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s effective and works.</li>
            <li>This product is very helpful is very easy to remove and SMELLS DELICIOUS!!!</li>
            <li>Maybe if I was doing a vigorous workout it would be more effective.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was pleasant, smelled good, easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great and works exactly as its supposed to.</li>
            <li>Does the job it says, for a cheap price, it does the work and make you sweat way more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Reccomend!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff..</li>
            <li>I love this product, I use it on my midsection and then wrap it up with my neoprene waist trainer.</li>
            <li>This seems more like a luxory to me.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not quite sure why.</li>
            <li>Interesting.</li>
            <li>I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love how it isolates and makes your muscles work.</li>
            <li>My plans are buy more of this product when my rans out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not pouring sweat like many people do, but I am sweating again, so I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>expect more of the product by what he read in every place.</li>
            <li>i love to eat</li>
            <li>THIS IS A MUST FOR WORKOUTS MOSTLY FOR PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF WEIGHT LIKE ME</li>
            <li>If you want to sweat with your work out, this is the product to buy, love the stick vs the jar product, dont have to worry about getting the cream off your hands</li>
            <li>I do notice that I sweat significantly more.  </li>
            <li>love love love this product</li>
            <li>I am using and loving the product, it makes a huge difference on my progress.</li>
            <li>great product, really makes me sweat in places ive never sweat before.</li>
            <li>I will update my review in a month or two to report the more long-term results.</li>
            <li>You would then burn more energy.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Makes me sweat more.</li>
            <li>I Am using the product more than 2 weeks ago</li>
            <li>and I needed something to help me to sweat to have better results.</li>
            <li>but you have to give it a chance to work after more than one use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this made you sweat more</li>
            <li>Used for a great work out you can feel the blood flow on the areas used recommended for a straight on your work out</li>
            <li>This will always be my favorite product</li>
            <li>It does make you sweat a lot more compared to have nothing on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>There is no additional &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; or anything of that matter in the areas I used this (abs and legs mostly).</li>
            <li>The reason for the 4 stars instead of the 5 is because it says cream and its more grease than cream</li>
            <li>I use it every day for my workouts and it really makes me sweat!!!!</li>
            <li>It does warm you up and helps to sweat more, but the best quality I find is less injury wear</li>
            <li>I got Sweet Sweat after reading about it on a fitness page I liked on Facebook.</li>
            <li>I did have a pleasant smell but nothing to really brag about.</li>
            <li>Is very good to enhance you&#x27;re workout and in a short time you start noticing the results!!!!!</li>
            <li>The reason i purchase this one was because you can apply it Hands free, but after using it I fell in love all over again</li>
            <li>and i will constantly buy more and more because of its great results.</li>
            <li>It smells nice n fresh too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very good, easy and simple to use.</li>
            <li>The muscles feel more ready and more worked when I finish my workout!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it made me sweat more than I originally would</li>
            <li>Such good product !</li>
            <li>Other than that, it was great!</li>
            <li>i lost my belly fat very quick in about 1 week</li>
            <li>It melts easily</li>
            <li>Sweet sweat has helped me sweat more when i work out</li>
            <li>enjoy it how we use, it&#x27;s easy and simple.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>You will see a huge difference using this with any work outs.</li>
            <li>I currently use it with the waist trimmer and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It also has a very distinct smell.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant results.</li>
            <li>I will let you know how great it is fir home use in a few weeks :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my tummy feels a lot tighter and looks smoother after a workout with Sweet Sweat and my belt.</li>
            <li>When I perform my exercises I realize that my transpiration increases in regions that I pass the sweet sweat.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several weeks now along with a good amount of running and eating healthier</li>
            <li>and I can tell the difference in how much I sweat more around the waistline.</li>
            <li>I also recommend the sweet sweat waist trimmer.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and goes on clear.</li>
            <li>and he had a sweet sweat stick and said he&#x27;s been using it for years</li>
            <li>Just cool one side of the body then take the sweatshirt off and take the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the sweet wear stick every time I work out.</li>
            <li>I used the sweet sweat 2 days</li>
            <li>Sweet Sweat did the job for me though.</li>
            <li>Sweet Sweat will make you sweat.</li>
            <li>I rub it on mybelly and wear a slimming belt over it, go for a five mile run and am drenched where iI applied the Sweet Sweat.  </li>
            <li>Sweet sweat.....</li>
            <li>Sweet sweat does what it is says, it makes you sweat.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of reviews criticizing the product claiming that the &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; experienced was due to the fact that the product &amp;#34;melted away&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I hope that amazon does not continue to disappoint since they have been so good for so long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having great results!!!&lt;br /&gt;Everything that i expected about the product i&#x27;m getting!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>this product really works!!</li>
            <li>This definitely made me sweat more in the areas I applied it, and the smell is fine.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff and my only beef was trying get it off my hands after applying, problem solved!!</li>
            <li>, i actually felt my tummy getting warm with in one minute after applying it to the skin, so i dance a couple Merengue and salsa songs</li>
            <li>Honestly, you can&#x27;t lose weight only by sweating.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked was the smell of the product.</li>
            <li>When i first started using sweet sweat</li>
            <li>This Sweet Sweat Stick is easy to use and is not messy at all.  </li>
            <li>I instantly start sweating and I love the fresh smell!</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve noticed that it gets used pretty quick just applying it to my midsection.</li>
            <li>I notice that I do sweat more than I used to (usually I barely sweat.)</li>
            <li>I has use this before and it work as long as you  run or do any kind of exercise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy apply, but you burn through it pretty fast haha</li>
            <li>Great stuff really works i use it everyday at the gym and inside the sauna</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sweet Sweat for about 3 months while I was doing a 90 day high intensity workout.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li>It really makes the difference!  </li>
            <li>it definitely helps make you sweat more, but it makes me itch dont know why</li>
            <li>I used this as described and did absolutely NOTHING for me!  </li>
            <li>Ok, so i got this in the mail 2 days after i ordered, but i didn&#x27;t try it on until today, i was amazed with the results, i have tried different products before that felt like vicks or a mint feeling on your skin, but this one didn&#x27;t do that</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fitness rat, just a regular woman whose metabolism is at a speed of 5mph :).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally found a product that works.</li>
            <li>Ha it was so funny dudes.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I purchased this product for</li>
            <li>Really Sweating!</li>
            <li>I have tried using this cream several times and kept it on for many hours at a time.</li>
            <li>Helps me shed water weight, I find its pretty pricey though.</li>
            <li>Product does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>But pleased overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just used in a few days, but feeling good.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t really tell if I sweat more or the same using this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time that I use sweet sweat, and it really surprised me,</li>
            <li>Great product sweet sweat really helps you slim down and push harder in your workouts</li>
            <li>it is the right range for my height, and my legs and upper torso are find, but I have a belly that makes me look pregnant</li>
            <li>Until then, I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to sweat ;)</li>
            <li>Wife absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li>It does feel very sticky after wearing it so my shirt was sticking to my chest.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>And it really makes a difference in the amount of sweat that I produce.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this products because you can feel the difference it makes in a workout.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think its all that and a bag of chips don&#x27;t really recommend to spend cash on this one.</li>
            <li>However, I researched and read a lot of reviews from real users and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>This product really just helps with muscle fatigue and soreness.</li>
            <li>If I use it before a lot of weight training, I find that my muscles don&#x27;t really get sore.</li>
            <li>and I get really sore</li>
            <li>product really helps with your fatigue and can help prevent injuries.</li>
            <li>and she loves how much quicker</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing intense workouts and with this include</li>
            <li>:  Does absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>but thought this might help me sweat since for some reason I just don&#x27;t sweat much.  </li>
            <li>Really could&#x27;ve used this when I used to cut weight for sports.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never sweat that much before just from walking.</li>
            <li>This product works very well with a vigorous workout.  </li>
            <li>nothing much is happening with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Finally got this, was really excited to receive it.</li>
            <li>, my body is so much more active.  </li>
            <li>I have only used sweet sweat roll on for a week</li>
            <li>I kid you not, i struggled getting that waist trimmer on because it run kind of small.  </li>
            <li>but it does not make me sweat any more or any less than before.</li>
            <li>Mainly put on my core and thighs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just been doing my normal routines</li>
            <li>, i figured it could be a good secret for workouts</li>
            <li>you want to make you skin temperature higher to promote heat loss then slather yourself in something like Icy Hot, or TAKE SOME ECERCISE.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t beat the nice stick application is easy and less is likely to be wasted.</li>
            <li>I just ordered my second helping of this stuff as well as some other goodies :)</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on, upper arm, I kept looking at my arms while working out to see if anything was happening.</li>
            <li>I paired it with the waist trainer &amp; I was surprised at how sweaty I became!</li>
            <li>The first time I poured sweat and left the gym soaked.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of reviews claiming that it does not work and it seems that these opinions were based after only one use instead of consistent use.</li>
            <li>Ruins your work out clothes and makes you smell like a cheap hooker.</li>
            <li>So much better than the jar, that was a very messy situation and</li>
            <li>I used just the belt the next day and achieved the same results for $12 without the Sweet Sweat.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is that I think the stick is going finish too quick, so maybe next time I will try the jar.</li>
            <li>Stick form 6.4 oz, is not messy and does not stain clothes at all.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s water weight, and only a short-term result, but my point is that I have NEVER sweat that much in a workout (not even after running 5 miles).</li>
            <li>I showed my daughter it (21 yr old in Navy)</li>
            <li>most women have trouble with (lower abs, inner thighs, and triceps).</li>
            <li>and when i come back in the house I feel like a NEW person!</li>
            <li>the only issue I had was its so damn hot that when I opened it, it was melted, have to put it in the fridge to get it solid.</li>
            <li>If you could artificially induce sweating you would just cool yourself more than you need to.</li>
            <li>but so far this item has been a major pain to receive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally buy items like these because I&#x27;m not a big proponent of assistance in the gym</li>
            <li>It has a minimal scent, very easy to apply, but just don&#x27;t use too much, A LITTLE goes a long way or it feels &#x27;goopy&#x27; under your clothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far.</li>
            <li>The whole description is bogus, like someone saying a plane flies because it doesn&#x27;t like being on the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweating is closed loop body temperature control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used about a ten times since receiving it, and so far it seems to work.</li>
            <li>I did get the second order today but even though the first was a week late using prime and clearly lost I was not given overnight shipping for the replacement.</li>

            <li> and absolutely I was impressed, results every time</li>
            <li> You burn energy, you get warm, your body senses the temperature and fires up the cooling system.</li>
            <li> A person with a sedentary job in Antarctica burns 8,000 calories a day just to stay warm.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, it really does increase the amount of sweat you lose during workouts in fact</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s effective and works.</li>
            <li> This product is very helpful is very easy to remove and SMELLS DELICIOUS!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe if I was doing a vigorous workout it would be more effective.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was pleasant, smelled good, easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great and works exactly as its supposed to.</li>
            <li> Does the job it says, for a cheap price, it does the work and make you sweat way more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Reccomend!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff..</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it on my midsection and then wrap it up with my neoprene waist trainer.</li>
            <li> This seems more like a luxory to me.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not quite sure why.</li>
            <li> Interesting.</li>
            <li> I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love how it isolates and makes your muscles work.</li>
            <li> My plans are buy more of this product when my rans out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pouring sweat like many people do, but I am sweating again, so I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> expect more of the product by what he read in every place.</li>
            <li> i love to eat</li>
            <li> THIS IS A MUST FOR WORKOUTS MOSTLY FOR PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF WEIGHT LIKE ME</li>
            <li> If you want to sweat with your work out, this is the product to buy, love the stick vs the jar product, dont have to worry about getting the cream off your hands</li>
            <li> I do notice that I sweat significantly more.  </li>
            <li> love love love this product</li>
            <li> I am using and loving the product, it makes a huge difference on my progress.</li>
            <li> great product, really makes me sweat in places ive never sweat before.</li>
            <li> I will update my review in a month or two to report the more long-term results.</li>
            <li> You would then burn more energy.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Makes me sweat more.</li>
            <li> I Am using the product more than 2 weeks ago</li>
            <li> and I needed something to help me to sweat to have better results.</li>
            <li> but you have to give it a chance to work after more than one use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this made you sweat more</li>
            <li> Used for a great work out you can feel the blood flow on the areas used recommended for a straight on your work out</li>
            <li> This will always be my favorite product</li>
            <li> It does make you sweat a lot more compared to have nothing on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> There is no additional &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; or anything of that matter in the areas I used this (abs and legs mostly).</li>
            <li> The reason for the 4 stars instead of the 5 is because it says cream and its more grease than cream</li>
            <li> I use it every day for my workouts and it really makes me sweat!!!!</li>
            <li> It does warm you up and helps to sweat more, but the best quality I find is less injury wear</li>
            <li> I got Sweet Sweat after reading about it on a fitness page I liked on Facebook.</li>
            <li> I did have a pleasant smell but nothing to really brag about.</li>
            <li> Is very good to enhance you&#x27;re workout and in a short time you start noticing the results!!!!!</li>
            <li> The reason i purchase this one was because you can apply it Hands free, but after using it I fell in love all over again</li>
            <li> and i will constantly buy more and more because of its great results.</li>
            <li> It smells nice n fresh too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good, easy and simple to use.</li>
            <li> The muscles feel more ready and more worked when I finish my workout!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it made me sweat more than I originally would</li>
            <li> Such good product !</li>
            <li> Other than that, it was great!</li>
            <li> i lost my belly fat very quick in about 1 week</li>
            <li> It melts easily</li>
            <li> Sweet sweat has helped me sweat more when i work out</li>
            <li> enjoy it how we use, it&#x27;s easy and simple.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> You will see a huge difference using this with any work outs.</li>
            <li> I currently use it with the waist trimmer and it works great.  </li>
            <li> It also has a very distinct smell.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant results.</li>
            <li> I will let you know how great it is fir home use in a few weeks :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my tummy feels a lot tighter and looks smoother after a workout with Sweet Sweat and my belt.</li>
            <li> When I perform my exercises I realize that my transpiration increases in regions that I pass the sweet sweat.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks now along with a good amount of running and eating healthier</li>
            <li> and I can tell the difference in how much I sweat more around the waistline.</li>
            <li> I also recommend the sweet sweat waist trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and goes on clear.</li>
            <li> and he had a sweet sweat stick and said he&#x27;s been using it for years</li>
            <li> Just cool one side of the body then take the sweatshirt off and take the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the sweet wear stick every time I work out.</li>
            <li> I used the sweet sweat 2 days</li>
            <li> Sweet Sweat did the job for me though.</li>
            <li> Sweet Sweat will make you sweat.</li>
            <li> I rub it on mybelly and wear a slimming belt over it, go for a five mile run and am drenched where iI applied the Sweet Sweat.  </li>
            <li> Sweet sweat.....</li>
            <li> Sweet sweat does what it is says, it makes you sweat.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of reviews criticizing the product claiming that the &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; experienced was due to the fact that the product &amp;#34;melted away&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I hope that amazon does not continue to disappoint since they have been so good for so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having great results!!!&lt;br /&gt;Everything that i expected about the product i&#x27;m getting!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> this product really works!!</li>
            <li> This definitely made me sweat more in the areas I applied it, and the smell is fine.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff and my only beef was trying get it off my hands after applying, problem solved!!</li>
            <li> , i actually felt my tummy getting warm with in one minute after applying it to the skin, so i dance a couple Merengue and salsa songs</li>
            <li> Honestly, you can&#x27;t lose weight only by sweating.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked was the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> When i first started using sweet sweat</li>
            <li> This Sweet Sweat Stick is easy to use and is not messy at all.  </li>
            <li> I instantly start sweating and I love the fresh smell!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve noticed that it gets used pretty quick just applying it to my midsection.</li>
            <li> I notice that I do sweat more than I used to (usually I barely sweat.)</li>
            <li> I has use this before and it work as long as you  run or do any kind of exercise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy apply, but you burn through it pretty fast haha</li>
            <li> Great stuff really works i use it everyday at the gym and inside the sauna</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sweet Sweat for about 3 months while I was doing a 90 day high intensity workout.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> It really makes the difference!  </li>
            <li> it definitely helps make you sweat more, but it makes me itch dont know why</li>
            <li> I used this as described and did absolutely NOTHING for me!  </li>
            <li> Ok, so i got this in the mail 2 days after i ordered, but i didn&#x27;t try it on until today, i was amazed with the results, i have tried different products before that felt like vicks or a mint feeling on your skin, but this one didn&#x27;t do that</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fitness rat, just a regular woman whose metabolism is at a speed of 5mph :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally found a product that works.</li>
            <li> Ha it was so funny dudes.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I purchased this product for</li>
            <li> Really Sweating!</li>
            <li> I have tried using this cream several times and kept it on for many hours at a time.</li>
            <li> Helps me shed water weight, I find its pretty pricey though.</li>
            <li> Product does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> But pleased overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used in a few days, but feeling good.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t really tell if I sweat more or the same using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time that I use sweet sweat, and it really surprised me,</li>
            <li> Great product sweet sweat really helps you slim down and push harder in your workouts</li>
            <li> it is the right range for my height, and my legs and upper torso are find, but I have a belly that makes me look pregnant</li>
            <li> Until then, I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to sweat ;)</li>
            <li> Wife absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li> It does feel very sticky after wearing it so my shirt was sticking to my chest.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> And it really makes a difference in the amount of sweat that I produce.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this products because you can feel the difference it makes in a workout.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think its all that and a bag of chips don&#x27;t really recommend to spend cash on this one.</li>
            <li> However, I researched and read a lot of reviews from real users and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This product really just helps with muscle fatigue and soreness.</li>
            <li> If I use it before a lot of weight training, I find that my muscles don&#x27;t really get sore.</li>
            <li> and I get really sore</li>
            <li> product really helps with your fatigue and can help prevent injuries.</li>
            <li> and she loves how much quicker</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing intense workouts and with this include</li>
            <li> :  Does absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> but thought this might help me sweat since for some reason I just don&#x27;t sweat much.  </li>
            <li> Really could&#x27;ve used this when I used to cut weight for sports.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never sweat that much before just from walking.</li>
            <li> This product works very well with a vigorous workout.  </li>
            <li> nothing much is happening with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Finally got this, was really excited to receive it.</li>
            <li> , my body is so much more active.  </li>
            <li> I have only used sweet sweat roll on for a week</li>
            <li> I kid you not, i struggled getting that waist trimmer on because it run kind of small.  </li>
            <li> but it does not make me sweat any more or any less than before.</li>
            <li> Mainly put on my core and thighs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been doing my normal routines</li>
            <li> , i figured it could be a good secret for workouts</li>
            <li> you want to make you skin temperature higher to promote heat loss then slather yourself in something like Icy Hot, or TAKE SOME ECERCISE.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t beat the nice stick application is easy and less is likely to be wasted.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second helping of this stuff as well as some other goodies :)</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on, upper arm, I kept looking at my arms while working out to see if anything was happening.</li>
            <li> I paired it with the waist trainer &amp; I was surprised at how sweaty I became!</li>
            <li> The first time I poured sweat and left the gym soaked.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of reviews claiming that it does not work and it seems that these opinions were based after only one use instead of consistent use.</li>
            <li> Ruins your work out clothes and makes you smell like a cheap hooker.</li>
            <li> So much better than the jar, that was a very messy situation and</li>
            <li> I used just the belt the next day and achieved the same results for $12 without the Sweet Sweat.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that I think the stick is going finish too quick, so maybe next time I will try the jar.</li>
            <li> Stick form 6.4 oz, is not messy and does not stain clothes at all.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s water weight, and only a short-term result, but my point is that I have NEVER sweat that much in a workout (not even after running 5 miles).</li>
            <li> I showed my daughter it (21 yr old in Navy)</li>
            <li> most women have trouble with (lower abs, inner thighs, and triceps).</li>
            <li> and when i come back in the house I feel like a NEW person!</li>
            <li> the only issue I had was its so damn hot that when I opened it, it was melted, have to put it in the fridge to get it solid.</li>
            <li> If you could artificially induce sweating you would just cool yourself more than you need to.</li>
            <li> but so far this item has been a major pain to receive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy items like these because I&#x27;m not a big proponent of assistance in the gym</li>
            <li> It has a minimal scent, very easy to apply, but just don&#x27;t use too much, A LITTLE goes a long way or it feels &#x27;goopy&#x27; under your clothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far.</li>
            <li> The whole description is bogus, like someone saying a plane flies because it doesn&#x27;t like being on the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweating is closed loop body temperature control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used about a ten times since receiving it, and so far it seems to work.</li>
            <li> I did get the second order today but even though the first was a week late using prime and clearly lost I was not given overnight shipping for the replacement.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not good.</li>
            <li> I cant see why anyone would right a negative review.</li>
            <li> More Trouble Zones\\&quot;), without a cardio workout, I lost a pound and a half in sweat!!!</li>
            <li> First I will admit I don&#x27;t work out hard.</li>
            <li> While wearing the trimmer with this product I was pouring sweat, but the other areas the Sweet Sweat was applied to were dry as usual.  </li>
            <li> sweat dripped down the middle of my back into the toilet.  </li>
            <li> I love how it makes me sweat like crazy.</li>
            <li> I could run for really long times and would not sweat a bit.</li>
            <li> It totally melted and oozed through the tightly closed cap.</li>
            <li> and i could feel the sweat dripping down my back and tummy (gross i know)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a cream.&amp;#34; This cream definitely creats a heating sensation upon application, the tube version makes application easier than the open container, and has a scent so you must wash your workout clothes following application, and I don&#x27;t leave it on my skin for long periods of time usually showering after working out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working out for 3 years and finally got down to those last few pounds that just wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what in the areas</li>
            <li> and I felt energize to workout longer and harder.</li>
            <li> Felt very loose while using product</li>
            <li> No real results so for but will update on results.</li>
            <li> I am still using it just out of bitterness that I spent money on this thing</li>
            <li> so be careful if you leave your gym bag in the car ...</li>
            <li> Really like the product and would recommend it to anyone who is serious about sheading cellulite!</li>
            <li> 😜 will never use anything other</li>
            <li> I usually do HIIT and this product does help greatly not only during cardio but also during weight lifting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put a price tag on the ability to regulate one&#x27;s internal temp...</li>
            <li> If you workout daily, I could see you having to purchase this at least monthly.</li>
            <li> , that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Unless you are messing with your hypothalamus you can&#x27;t mess with temperature control.</li>
            <li> then this little guy</li>
            <li> Not many other things in this class of exercise enhancers</li>
            <li> Another incorrect observation, this product is oily/greasy and this substance will not turn into liquid causing you to believe that a thin layer turned into several ounces of &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34;.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff..awesome</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it on my midsection and then wrap it up with my neoprene waist trainer. Together, I sweat like a beast. I&#x27;ve noticed that my tummy feels a lot tighter and looks smoother after a workout with Sweet Sweat and my belt. I also don&#x27;t store water as much as I used to because I sweat so heavily.</li>
            <li> Wife absolutely loves this product. She does notice an increase of sweat. Will be buying more of this product in the future. Happy wife happy life!</li>
            <li> This item was alright, I couldn&#x27;t really tell if I sweat more or the same using this product. It does feel very sticky after wearing it so my shirt was sticking to my chest. I am not sure I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Finally got this, was really excited to receive it. Used t today and it did what it said it would..... the only issue I had was its so damn hot that when I opened it, it was melted, have to put it in the fridge to get it solid.</li>
            <li> This definitely made me sweat more in the areas I applied it, and the smell is fine. However, I&#x27;ve noticed that it gets used pretty quick just applying it to my midsection. If you workout daily, I could see you having to purchase this at least monthly. This seems more like a luxory to me. I&#x27;m going to sweat either way and I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant results.</li>
            <li> It really works.  I use it every day for my workouts and it really makes me sweat!!!! It&#x27;s the 3rd time that I bought this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time that I use sweet sweat, and it really surprised me, it&#x27;s amazing, who is trying to lose some located fat should buy it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and it does make you sweat more.  I like the stick form because you don&#x27;t have to use your fingers to slather the cream on your body.</li>
            <li> Works well, causes a lot of sweat but I&#x27;m not quite sure why. It also has a very distinct smell. Not bad but not good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!! I love how it makes me sweat like crazy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream under my sweat belt while going to the gym.. And it really makes a difference in the amount of sweat that I produce.  Since using I have lost four inches off my waist!  It really makes the difference!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I think it works, if used as directed. I just haven&#x27;t been as diligent lately.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I feel about this. It smells great, my gym buddy always says she smells it. It does warm you up and helps to sweat more, but the best quality I find is less injury wear I apply it. I use it on my calves and never have problems with cramps or Charlie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Interesting. Not sure if it has worked.</li>
            <li> it definitely helps make you sweat more, but it makes me itch dont know why</li>
            <li> I used this as described and did absolutely NOTHING for me!  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Ok, so i got this in the mail 2 days after i ordered, but i didn&#x27;t try it on until today, i was amazed with the results, i have tried different products before that felt like vicks or a mint feeling on your skin, but this one didn&#x27;t do that, i actually felt my tummy getting warm with in one minute after applying it to the skin, so i dance a couple Merengue and salsa songs and i could feel the sweat dripping down my back and tummy (gross i know) but isn&#x27;t that what we want lol.! I added some pictures so that you can see for yourself.. I LOVE IT!!! The reason i purchase this one was because you can apply it Hands free, but after using it I fell in love all over again hehe😜 will never use anything other then this little guy 😌☺️😉</li>
            <li> I recommend that you buy this item somewhere else. while I have had really good luck with amazon. For some reason this order is still not here and it appears that I am still being charged for it. I hope this is not the case but so far this item has been a major pain to receive. I did get the second order today but even though the first was a week late using prime and clearly lost I was not given overnight shipping for the replacement. In addition I am a prime member. I hope that amazon does not continue to disappoint since they have been so good for so long. My review of the item is somewhat unfair and is more of a delivery issue but would give item perhaps a 3 star. Not many other things in this class of exercise enhancers so I still use it.</li>
            <li> I went and got a detox about a year ago and they used this to help with &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; I thought it worked great so I purchased it for home use... I just opened it and started using it 2 days ago. I will let you know how great it is fir home use in a few weeks :)</li>
            <li> I really like this products because you can feel the difference it makes in a workout. It&#x27;s easy apply, but you burn through it pretty fast haha</li>
            <li> This product smells good. It makes me sweat but I don&#x27;t think its all that and a bag of chips don&#x27;t really recommend to spend cash on this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I just ordered my second helping of this stuff as well as some other goodies :)</li>
            <li> I did have a pleasant smell but nothing to really brag about. I don&#x27;t think it made me sweat more than I originally would, I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m your custumer and i wonder if i but 26 units of Sweat Sweat SKIN crream you could tive some discount</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product only 4 stars out of 5 because of the stain from the oil. However, I researched and read a lot of reviews from real users and decided to give it a try. The first time I put it on, upper arm, I kept looking at my arms while working out to see if anything was happening. To my surprise the sweat started coming out and I felt energize to workout longer and harder. I usually do HIIT and this product does help greatly not only during cardio but also during weight lifting. It&#x27;s amazing how it helps me lift heavier weights and or do another set. I&#x27;ve used a lot of thermogenics products out there and I hope this product continues to work for me because I don&#x27;t want to take any thermogenic pills anymore. I&#x27;m not a fitness rat, just a regular woman whose metabolism is at a speed of 5mph :).</li>
            <li> I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell it&#x27;s very good, easy and simple to use. I&#x27;m having great results!!!&lt;br /&gt;Everything that i expected about the product i&#x27;m getting!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, you can&#x27;t lose weight only by sweating. This product really just helps with muscle fatigue and soreness. If I use it before a lot of weight training, I find that my muscles don&#x27;t really get sore. However, I ran out of it recently and stopped using it for almost 3 weeks (I go to the gym every morning). I&#x27;ve just been doing my normal routines and I get really sore now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really helps with your fatigue and can help prevent injuries. And the plus side is that it has a great scent and will not make your sweat stink!!!!</li>
            <li> I love how it isolates and makes your muscles work. I instantly start sweating and I love the fresh smell! I like that it comes in a roll up bottle too so you don&#x27;t have oily hands after applying it. I&#x27;ve even had my mom apply it for her cardio and she loves how much quicker she breaks a sweat!</li>
            <li> I love the product! All my expectations were exceed. My plans are buy more of this product when my rans out.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy it how we use, it&#x27;s easy and simple.&lt;br /&gt;And the smell it&#x27;s very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great product sweet sweat really helps you slim down and push harder in your workouts I&#x27;m glad I finally found a product that works.</li>
            <li> Good product, delivers what it promises! When I perform my exercises I realize that my transpiration increases in regions that I pass the sweet sweat.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks now along with a good amount of running and eating healthier and I can tell the difference in how much I sweat more around the waistline. Just bought another bottle to continue use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish I had known it stains clothing as a couple gym shirts I have now darkened. Now I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend use</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy items like these because I&#x27;m not a big proponent of assistance in the gym but this item is amazing. I paired it with the waist trainer &amp; I was surprised at how sweaty I became! I sweat a lot to begin with &amp; this legitimately made puddles! Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used about a ten times since receiving it, and so far it seems to work. I notice that I do sweat more than I used to (usually I barely sweat.) It&#x27;s hard to put a price tag on the ability to regulate one&#x27;s internal temp... I&#x27;m not pouring sweat like many people do, but I am sweating again, so I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I train in MMA 6 days a week. Mainly put on my core and thighs. I did notice I lost 5 lbs. Didn&#x27;t change anything in my diet. Felt very loose while using product and yes I did sweat a lot.  I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> expect more of the product by what he read in every place. but not seen it all. not recommend. Dislike</li>
            <li> this item is a GOD send u hear me i lost my belly fat very quick in about 1 week my belly shrank but no because the product i gained it back i love to eat lol but if i did not eat and still used this product my belly would be all the way gone 2 1/2 weeks trust me i will buy again and again and again and be foreal this time around lol will buy again.THIS IS A MUST FOR WORKOUTS MOSTLY FOR PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF WEIGHT LIKE ME</li>
            <li> Can I use it on arms?</li>
            <li> Been using this for months now...I definitely see results! It smells nice n fresh too. I cant see why anyone would right a negative review. Luv luv luv it</li>
            <li> Great ! Help me a lot in my cardio everyday ! Such good product ! Sweet sweat definitely is a good choice !</li>
            <li> I has use this before and it work as long as you  run or do any kind of exercise.</li>
            <li> It is an Amazing product!!! Enhanced my work out. I also recommend the sweet sweat waist trimmer. Both together are amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sweet Sweat for about 3 months while I was doing a 90 day high intensity workout. Despite some of the negative reviews that I&#x27;ve read, this works for me!!! I&#x27;m doing intense workouts and with this include, I&#x27;m seeing good results. I plan to keep using this for the rest of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric Bonner</li>
            <li> Pro:  Stick form 6.4 oz, is not messy and does not stain clothes at all.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Does absolutely nothing for me.  I bought this with a waist trimmer to try despite knowing there is no miracle out there but thought this might help me sweat since for some reason I just don&#x27;t sweat much.  While wearing the trimmer with this product I was pouring sweat, but the other areas the Sweet Sweat was applied to were dry as usual.  I used just the belt the next day and achieved the same results for $12 without the Sweet Sweat.  If I could return it I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to help get a good sweat on, try the Bracoo Adjustable Waist Trimmer Belt.  Works great and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> If you want to sweat with your work out, this is the product to buy, love the stick vs the jar product, dont have to worry about getting the cream off your hands</li>
            <li> Does the job it says, for a cheap price, it does the work and make you sweat way more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Reccomend!</li>
            <li> I disguised this as a tube or antiperspirant and put it in my friends medicine cabinet and when he used if on a blind date his pits were flowing like the Mississippi river...Ha Ha Ha Ha it was so funny dudes. Then he didn&#x27;t catch on and used it again before going on a job interview and once again his pits were flowing dudes...Ha Ha Ha Ha he didn&#x27;t get the job.</li>
            <li> This Sweet Sweat Stick is easy to use and is not messy at all.  I currently use it with the waist trimmer and it works great.  I do notice that I sweat significantly more.  This is exactly what I purchased this product for so I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> love love love this product, it&#x27;s great and works exactly as its supposed to.</li>
            <li> I am using and loving the product, it makes a huge difference on my progress. Amazing Product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> great product, really makes me sweat in places ive never sweat before. i put this on while im doing HIIT and its amazingggggggggggggg</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used in a few days, but feeling good. Hope it could help me build 6-pack abs</li>
            <li> Nice scent and goes on clear.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff and my only beef was trying get it off my hands after applying, problem solved!! Will buy more!</li>
            <li> Really Sweating! I am drenched by the end of my workout. No real results so for but will update on results.</li>
            <li> This product is great. You will see a huge difference using this with any work outs. Definitely a great but and great product. Plus it smells great!</li>
            <li> First I will admit I don&#x27;t work out hard. That being said my weight it is the right range for my height, and my legs and upper torso are find, but I have a belly that makes me look pregnant (family trait). I have tried using this cream several times and kept it on for many hours at a time. I put it on thick and wrap myself in plastic wrap to keep in there. It just makes my belly itchy. I have had no reduction of belly fat. It does smell nice though. Maybe if I was doing a vigorous workout it would be more effective.</li>
            <li> I saw a video on youtube that the rapper/actor Tyrese made and he was talking about his workout and he had a sweet sweat stick and said he&#x27;s been using it for years, i figured it could be a good secret for workouts and absolutely I was impressed, results every time, my body is so much more active.  Really could&#x27;ve used this when I used to cut weight for sports.</li>
            <li> I got Sweet Sweat after reading about it on a fitness page I liked on Facebook. A woman who had posted a picture of her transformation swore by it. I&#x27;ve been working out for 3 years and finally got down to those last few pounds that just wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what in the areas most women have trouble with (lower abs, inner thighs, and triceps). I would do cardio for hours and weights as well... but I had hit a plateau. I figured I&#x27;d try this after reading about the science on the product&#x27;s website. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far. The first time I poured sweat and left the gym soaked. This past time I weighed myself before and after my workout, and even though I just did strength training (Jillian Michaels \\&quot;No More Trouble Zones\\&quot;), without a cardio workout, I lost a pound and a half in sweat!!! I know it&#x27;s water weight, and only a short-term result, but my point is that I have NEVER sweat that much in a workout (not even after running 5 miles). It definitely works as they advertise and I will continue to use this. I will update my review in a month or two to report the more long-term results. Until then, I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to sweat ;)</li>
            <li> Even if something could make you sweat that does not produce energy. The whole description is bogus, like someone saying a plane flies because it doesn&#x27;t like being on the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweating is closed loop body temperature control. You burn energy, you get warm, your body senses the temperature and fires up the cooling system. The hypothalamus in your brain is where your thermostat lives, it senses your blood temperature. Unless you are messing with your hypothalamus you can&#x27;t mess with temperature control. If you could artificially induce sweating you would just cool yourself more than you need to. You would then burn more energy. If you want to get cold and burn more energy then work out somewhere cold. A person with a sedentary job in Antarctica burns 8,000 calories a day just to stay warm. Take a job in Antarctica with the USGS or become an ice road trucker or move to Alaska. Painting some bogus crud on your skin is not going to help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thermographic? A thermal picture? What the heck do you believe that has to do with anything. If you want to get pictures like those in the adverts you need a thermal camera and a fan, or a cold day and half a sweat shirt. Just cool one side of the body then take the sweatshirt off and take the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to make you skin temperature higher to promote heat loss then slather yourself in something like Icy Hot, or TAKE SOME ECERCISE.</li>
            <li> Helps me shed water weight, I find its pretty pricey though.</li>
            <li> I use the sweet wear stick every time I work out. I have all my friends using it too. this product really works!!</li>
            <li> Makes you sweat and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars only because I was a slacker and didn&#x27;t  use it every day when I worked out; BUT when I did apply it, it made the area feel \\&quot;warmer\\&quot; and I started sweating! No joke, it was weird.  It has a minimal scent, very easy to apply, but just don&#x27;t use too much, A LITTLE goes a long way or it feels &#x27;goopy&#x27; under your clothing. It didn&#x27;t stain my clothing and seemed to absorb into my skin throughout the day(Yes, I didn&#x27;t just apply before work outs - I figured if I walked during the day, why not burn extra fat with this stuff?). So much better than the jar, that was a very messy situation and a bother to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it across my lower belly, hips, inside of my thighs and under arms - I&#x27;ll follow up on this review now that I&#x27;m back on track and applying it before workouts.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! You want a great sweat when you work out. THIS IS IT!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I put this on with a Waist Trimmer Belt before I go walking or jogging and when i come back in the house I feel like a NEW person! I am always drenched in sweat so I know it is doing the trick. I am very pleased with this product and I noticed a change in my waist line almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes me sweat more.</li>
            <li> this product realy works i use it every day i will be buying it again and telling my friends thank you</li>
            <li> I Am using the product more than 2 weeks ago and I could not see the difference in my body</li>
            <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with a waist cincher to maximize weight loss through sweating excess fluids in my waist.  The first time I used it was pleasant, smelled good, easy to apply.  I walked my mile, then stopped to get rid of some fluids...sweat dripped down the middle of my back into the toilet.  I think this stuff is going to work.  I&#x27;ve never sweat that much before just from walking.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time  sweating and I needed something to help me to sweat to have better results. Good product.</li>
            <li> This product is great in terms of efficacy and does what it claims. There are a lot of reviews claiming that it does not work and it seems that these opinions were based after only one use instead of consistent use. There are a lot of reviews criticizing the product claiming that the &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; experienced was due to the fact that the product &amp;#34;melted away&amp;#34;. Another incorrect observation, this product is oily/greasy and this substance will not turn into liquid causing you to believe that a thin layer turned into several ounces of &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34;. It may not work for everybody body chemistry, it works for me and is great as described but you have to give it a chance to work after more than one use.</li>
            <li> This product is not all that and it was a waste of my money. The only thing I liked was the smell of the product. Otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I don&#x27;t believe this made you sweat more it have the image of sweat.</li>
            <li> I have only used sweet sweat roll on for a week and I am soooo impressed.  I&#x27;ve only used it on my abs/waist, thighs and arms. I used it with the Vive adjustable waist trimmer.  I kid you not, i struggled getting that waist trimmer on because it run kind of small.  I used the sweet sweat 2 days and I can get it on a lot easier.  the amount of sweat that came off of my body was crazy.  I will use a tape measure this week and post my results.  Also, I love that it has a very pleasant smell.  My only problem is that I think the stick is going finish too quick, so maybe next time I will try the jar. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, it really does increase the amount of sweat you lose during workouts in fact it makes it easier to break a sweat period. Now I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a lotion on days you put this on, it will affect the results you have when using this product. I also used a long-sleeve compression shirt and was truly amazed how soaked it became! You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I have vitamin D deficiency. Those who have it would know that it is difficult to sweat. I could run for really long times and would not sweat a bit. Sweet Sweat did the job for me though. After working out, I actually feel like it was a productive workout from the sweat.</li>
            <li> I know I know...&amp;#34;but it&#x27;s a cream.&amp;#34; This cream definitely creats a heating sensation upon application, the tube version makes application easier than the open container, and has a scent so you must wash your workout clothes following application, and I don&#x27;t leave it on my skin for long periods of time usually showering after working out.  I&#x27;ve noticed results the day after workout allowing the thermogenic agents to work.  Best used during workouts. You will  not get the same results applying during a resting state like while you&#x27;re sleeping for instance.</li>
            <li> Every place that I put it on I sweat in minutes.  The muscles feel more ready and more worked when I finish my workout!</li>
            <li> Great product it works!!!</li>
            <li> Sweet Sweat will make you sweat. I rub it on mybelly and wear a slimming belt over it, go for a five mile run and am drenched where iI applied the Sweet Sweat.  Now, does this mean I have blasted fat in this area? No, it doesn&#x27;t. It means I have lost some water weight, that will be gained back when I rehydrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff is messy as well. I don&#x27;t wear a shirt when running, and can&#x27;t imagine wearing a shirtover this stuff. You WILL need a shower after exercising with this stuff, both from the sweat and the greasy film.</li>
            <li> Great stuff really works i use it everyday at the gym and inside the sauna makes me sweat alot greT</li>
            <li> This product works very well with a vigorous workout.  Really like the product and would recommend it to anyone who is serious about sheading cellulite!</li>
            <li> I love the stuff! it works great! you can&#x27;t beat the nice stick application is easy and less is likely to be wasted. I showed my daughter it (21 yr old in Navy) she works out often and loves it as well we will both continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Used for a great work out you can feel the blood flow on the areas used recommended for a straight on your work out</li>
            <li> PRODUCT DID NOT PERFORM AS DESCRIBED, DID NOTHING FOR ME.... WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
            <li> Product does exactly what it is suppose to do. Works wonderful; however, when I recieved this item it looked like it had been opened. Package was ripping apart and product&#x27;s cap was not on correctly. Other than that, it was great!</li>
            <li> Product does increase the amount of sweat produced on the are it&#x27;s applied to. Don&#x27;t know what else it does but did notice that difference.</li>
            <li> I think this does a good job. I lost 2 lbs in the past few weeks with eating well, same amount of exercising &amp; using this. I think it&#x27;s effective and works. I&#x27;ve never tried to isolate just using this without diet control. But pleased overall.</li>
            <li> If you want to lose fat or water weight or just shred up, THIS is the product for you. I cannot stress enough the fact that i cannot go a day at the gym without using this product. This will always be my favorite product and i will constantly buy more and more because of its great results. I recommend this to anyone who want to see results!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now. Don&#x27;t see any effect on my tummy though during exercise it does contribute to sweating with the help of rubber tummy wrap. Without the wrap, this is just some greasy and yucky cream underneath your work out shirt.</li>
            <li> it was a gift to my friend and he did not comment about it</li>
            <li> Sweet sweat..... this one works !! It does make you sweat a lot more compared to have nothing on. You have to see it to believe it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied! recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK. Frankly it seems to be just overrated petroleum jelly. There is no additional &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; or anything of that matter in the areas I used this (abs and legs mostly). I am still using it just out of bitterness that I spent money on this thing but it does not make me sweat any more or any less than before. It only seems to work in the sauna .... but when I am doing cardio, lifting, or training ... nothing much is happening with this stuff. It melts easily so be careful if you leave your gym bag in the car ... this stuff got all over everything! It totally melted and oozed through the tightly closed cap.</li>
            <li> This product is very helpful is very easy to remove and SMELLS DELICIOUS!!! Is very good to enhance you&#x27;re workout and in a short time you start noticing the results!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells like a horrible cheap air freshner. Makes me nauseous. It&#x27;s basically petroleum cream. Completely greasy and disgusting. Ruins your work out clothes and makes you smell like a cheap hooker.</li>
            <li> Sweet sweat does what it is says, it makes you sweat. The reason for the 4 stars instead of the 5 is because it says cream and its more grease than cream, that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Sweet sweat has helped me sweat more when i work out and plus i wear it when I&#x27;m going to work. When i first started using sweet sweat i was 236 pound now in 195 pounds.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works great!!</li>
