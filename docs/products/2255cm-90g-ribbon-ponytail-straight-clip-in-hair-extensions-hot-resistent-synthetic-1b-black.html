            <li> Horrible product!! Looks good one day, then the next day u can see it tangling! Do not purchase this!!</li>
            <li> i dont know if i going to use it.</li>
            <li> I love the items. I will buy from them again.&lt;br /&gt;The items were as described and they seem like they will hold up for awhile.</li>
            <li> On the day my ponytail arrived, I tried it on immediately. I looked amazing with it, and took plenty of selfies. I was so happy and thought nothing of the bad reviews...until now. The first day I wore it out, it tangled so quickly. I tried to brush it through out the day, but eventually I forgot. I can&#x27;t untangle it now, this is something NO brush can fix. I&#x27;ve tried straightening it, brushing, washing, nothing worked. I&#x27;m so sad I had to throw it away, but you really do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros- •very cute&lt;br /&gt;  •blends well with my hair&lt;br /&gt;  •got plenty of compliments&lt;br /&gt;  •fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons- •literally lasted one day</li>
            <li> This is actually a great product. Looks very real. I can brush it and no hair falls out. My sisters are ordering it too because it looks great.</li>
