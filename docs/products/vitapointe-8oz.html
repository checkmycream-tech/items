            <li>Looks like Amazon is either out of it or doesn&#x27;t carry it any more so</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have used Vitapointe for a number of years and find it an appropriate hairdressing between hair washings.</li>
            <li>Great shipping and fast service.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 50 years and have had so many compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li>More.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, I PURCHASED AN ADDITION ONE AFTER THE 2</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE</li>
            <li>IT MAKES MY HAIRR LOOK HEALTHY.</li>
            <li>Now I am  completely  \\&quot;gray\\&quot; and still find that using Vitapointe is still doing the the great job as it has for years.  </li>
            <li>It has a good texture and works for older people whose hair thins.</li>
            <li>Vitapointe is an excellent product for your hair to make it lay down and shinny.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>and it work fine.</li>
            <li>Product arrived really quick!  </li>
            <li>I use the smallest amount on the palms of my hands and lightly disperse through the hair.</li>
            <li>And the smell brings back some great memeories too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily and my hair feels and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>I have tried newer ones, but this old standby is by far still the best.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and it is so much easier to use from the jar rather than a tube&lt;br /&gt;Gives a lovely shine to the hair without making it greasy</li>
            <li>Then I remembered that my mother had some of the original</li>
            <li>(not at all the original vitapointe )</li>
            <li>The Vitapointe product does not seem to be the same as the product I used and loved years</li>
            <li>Great for my hair... not to light and not to heavy.</li>
            <li>Excellent product only if the second ingredients is water and it is.</li>
            <li>THIS ORIGINALLY VERY FINE FORMULA SHOULD SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE HOW SOMEONE CAN PURCHASE A RIGHT TO PRODUCE A QUALITY PRODUCT &amp; SCREW IT UP COMPLETELY!</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy/curly hair and have tried almost every product on the market to calm frizz, add shine, make my curls beautiful, and make it smooth when I want to blow it out/flat iron it.</li>
            <li>guess I will have to pay much more attention to what I buy,although surprised that Clairol would  allow its signature markings to be so</li>
            <li>I bought 4 jars,and when I received it found that it did not feel quite right.</li>
            <li>There is no feeling of greasiness or stickiness and there is only a beautiful shine left for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Make your hair shine, soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for and met all expectations.</li>
            <li>In my teens I  had blonde hair and found this provided a lovely sheen without any greasy  coating which brought out the highlights in my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I finally found it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the company was sold to another vendor, but the formulation and scent has definitely changed to a more petroleum, weighted consistency.</li>
            <li>The first time I thought the lack in quality was just a fluke and then once I received it again I realized that it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I FIRST BOUGHT</li>
            <li>The color was always a bright white but this has a yellow tint.</li>
            <li>So when I want to use a more modern product, I always come back to Vitapointe.</li>
            <li>I have been using the  original Clairol vitapointe for many  years , when I  found out it had been discontinued I was disappointed and then delighted when I saw it on Amazon .</li>
            <li>What i received was very greasy like vasolne.  </li>
            <li>ago&#x3D;&#x3D;not as much shine and heavier</li>
            <li>I have an 8 year old daughter who struggled with breakage right after her hair would grow.  </li>
            <li>Either this product is counterfeit or it&#x27;s just a low grade knock-off of the original Vitapointe.</li>
            <li>The original liquefied instantly the new just sat as a cream.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>the cream is ok if somewhat heavy</li>
            <li>I create new hairstyles for  myself and always recommend Vitapointe to friends and family.</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have used Vitapointe  for years before it wen t off the regular market and became available only on line.</li>
            <li>so I ran a test in one hand the original in the other this new product.</li>
            <li>I have tried countless other products that promise to keep my hair looking shiny and healthy, but they always disappoint.  </li>
            <li>Love this it is so hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li>I took her to a professional stylist who told me to mix an ample amount of vaseline into the vitapointe jar.  </li>
            <li>I would say that the 8oz container is pretty big for putting just a small amount in your hand and applying it to your hair, a little heavy, but the shine is great.</li>
            <li>This product moisturizes my hair, keeps it from flying away, and provides a shine that no other product has come close.  </li>
            <li>The item is not I expected</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The item is not I expected</li>
            <li> Her stylist still washes and conditions her hair at least biweekly, and I maintain it right after swimming, etc.  </li>
            <li> have no problem with a manufacturer making a similar product, but to use the same signature tub ,same colors, same design and same name  while not delivering the same product is in my opinion dishonest .</li>
            <li> Just wonder if it was on the shelf way too long.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair every day.  </li>
            <li> Without this product my hair becomes dry looking and brittle.</li>
            <li> The trick is to use just a little, say the size of a pea on shoulder length hair and less, of course, if your hair is short.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitapoint since I was a little girl, when my mother used it on my long hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> later I&#x27;m very disappointed that it has changed from the soft, smooth cream it always was, to a thicker, stickier one.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount of this product is needed on your hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never needed any other product to supplement or use along with</li>
            <li> I would now want to use any other product.</li>
            <li> I use only small amounts and the result is quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected delivery!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I still find it useful while a little bit disappointing.  </li>
            <li> and I use about a dime size or less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the greasy side and tends to weigh my hair down...</li>
            <li> A little rubbed into the just washed hair will convince you to use this product.  </li>
            <li> just a little bit of the product and my hair was manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gummy, oily or heavy and it helps reduce electricity and dryness</li>
            <li> Not sure how i came across this product</li>
            <li> It also reduces breakage with just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Thought i did not sure made by clairol any.</li>
            <li> It is sometimes hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s not easily found in the stores despite the fact that Clairol&#x27;s other products are well distributed</li>
            <li> Actually quite disappointed and somewhat feeling deceived .</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have thin hair.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find at drug stores.</li>
            <li> They are unable to wear their hair out because it usuaally end up puffy by the end of the day.  </li>

            <li> I like that the jar was sealed but didnt like the yellow tinted color. I have purchased the product for years at Sallys until the y discontinued.  The color was always a bright white but this has a yellow tint. Just wonder if it was on the shelf way too long.</li>
            <li> The delivery was good. The item is not I expected but it&#x27;s fine.  I have been using Vitapointe for ages. The price is ok .Thanks</li>
            <li> Product arrived really quick!  It was exactly what I was looking for and met all expectations.</li>
            <li> Not sure how i came across this product but simply it is the best (for me). I use the smallest amount on the palms of my hands and lightly disperse through the hair. There is no feeling of greasiness or stickiness and there is only a beautiful shine left for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I agree with comment from customer who stated this product has changed! And not for the better! I have been using Vitapoint since I was a little girl, when my mother used it on my long hair. Now over 45 yrs. later I&#x27;m very disappointed that it has changed from the soft, smooth cream it always was, to a thicker, stickier one.</li>
            <li> Vitapointe is an excellent product for your hair to make it lay down and shinny.  Only a small amount of this product is needed on your hair. I have used Vitapointe for years.  It is difficult to find at drug stores.</li>
            <li> Actually quite disappointed and somewhat feeling deceived .

I bought 4 jars,and when I received it found that it did not feel quite right. Then I remembered that my mother had some of the original Clairol so I ran a test in one hand the original in the other this new product. The original liquefied instantly the new just sat as a cream. (not at all the original vitapointe )&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem with a manufacturer making a similar product, but to use the same signature tub ,same colors, same design and same name  while not delivering the same product is in my opinion dishonest . the cream is ok if somewhat heavy and it does not melt into t hair but sits on top making it somewhat greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will have to pay much more attention to what I buy,although surprised that Clairol would  allow its signature markings to be so duplicated.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware is no truer than in this case.</li>
            <li> I would say that the 8oz container is pretty big for putting just a small amount in your hand and applying it to your hair, a little heavy, but the shine is great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It&#x27;s great for calming the frizzees and I love the shine.  It also reduces breakage with just a small amount.  It is hard to find in local stores.  Glad to know Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and delighted it is still on the market.  Moving to a rural area I had to find another source for Vitapointe and found it on Amazon. .[[ASIN:B0009R5BZS Clairol Vitapoint Jar 8 oz.]]  In my teens I  had blonde hair and found this provided a lovely sheen without any greasy  coating which brought out the highlights in my hair.  Now I am  completely  \\&quot;gray\\&quot; and still find that using Vitapointe is still doing the the great job as it has for years.  I still get compliments on my hair as it still has that lovely sheen.  I would recommend Vitapointe to anyone who has not had satisfaction from any of  the many products now on the market.  A little rubbed into the just washed hair will convince you to use this product.  Thanks to Clairol for keeping an excellent product available.</li>
            <li> My mother used this product on our hair when we were growing up.  I wanted to use it on my girls hair but couldnt find it in local stores anywhere by me. I was very happy when I found it on Amazon.  Both of my daughters hair texture is light, wavy, and thin.  They are unable to wear their hair out because it usuaally end up puffy by the end of the day.  I find that Vitapointe keeps their hair under control and not so puffy.  Their hair looks so beautiful after it is washed and i apply the vitampoint.  The shine stayed even after swimming.  And the smell brings back some great memeories too. Great stuff, and I am glad I finally found it. They need to make it availabe in local stores again.</li>
            <li> just a little bit of the product and my hair was manageable. great price and I recommend to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> My Grandma used this on me when I was a kid, it is still the best!  I have tried newer ones, but this old standby is by far still the best. This jar will last me forever.. a great buy!</li>
            <li> This is a good product but I wish it was lighter. It&#x27;s a little on the greasy side and tends to weigh my hair down...and I don&#x27;t have thin hair. Use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> Trust and Believe, vitapointe is where it&#x27;s at.  I have an 8 year old daughter who struggled with breakage right after her hair would grow.  This occured about five times until I had enough!  I took her to a professional stylist who told me to mix an ample amount of vaseline into the vitapointe jar.  Trust me when I say it has only been three months, and my daughter&#x27;s hair has grown 3 inches.  Her stylist still washes and conditions her hair at least biweekly, and I maintain it right after swimming, etc.  Vitapointe is where it&#x27;s at...Trust and Believe!!!</li>
            <li> Vitapointe is a hairdress that my mother used.  I have tried countless other products that promise to keep my hair looking shiny and healthy, but they always disappoint.  I blow dry my hair every day.  Without this product my hair becomes dry looking and brittle. This product moisturizes my hair, keeps it from flying away, and provides a shine that no other product has come close.  So when I want to use a more modern product, I always come back to Vitapointe.</li>
            <li> I use this product almost on a daily basis. It takes the tangles out of my hair and leaves it shiny and curly. I create new hairstyles for  myself and always recommend Vitapointe to friends and family. Even while shopping at any store women ask me what I use to make my hair look so good. I even lead them to  your website. Years ago, my mom suggested I use Vitapointe and I&#x27;ve never needed any other product to supplement or use along with it.&lt;br /&gt;Muriel V.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My mother used it years ago and her hair always looked so healthy with a beautiful shine. It&#x27;s not gummy, oily or heavy and it helps reduce electricity and dryness The trick is to use just a little, say the size of a pea on shoulder length hair and less, of course, if your hair is short. I always get compliments on my hair which is short and blonde. Looks like Amazon is either out of it or doesn&#x27;t carry it any more so try this:  [[ASIN:B00066MI0S Vitapointe Cr?me Hairdress and Conditioner, 3.25 Ounce Tube]]</li>
            <li> had already used the product and so i knew what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;they delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> This is not the same creamy white product that I am accustomed to buying in Vitapointe.  Perhaps the company was sold to another vendor, but the formulation and scent has definitely changed to a more petroleum, weighted consistency.</li>
            <li> I always buy this product since it agrees with my hair type. But I will disontinue ordering it if this practice is not corrected</li>
            <li> WONDERFULL HAIR PRODUCT, Not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Have used product for years.</li>
            <li> THIS ORIGINALLY VERY FINE FORMULA SHOULD SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE HOW SOMEONE CAN PURCHASE A RIGHT TO PRODUCE A QUALITY PRODUCT &amp; SCREW IT UP COMPLETELY!</li>
            <li> Good as they advertised the product, good seal to preserved the gel inside and it work fine.</li>
            <li> Use it for years as a hair dressing. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair. I would now want to use any other product. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily and my hair feels and looks fantastic. I want to say &#x27;Thank You&#x27; to the makers of Vitapoint. My daughter uses it, too.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it family and friends.</li>
            <li> My mother has course hair and uses this stuff daily.  She can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I love it. It moisturizes my hair without making it feel greasy.  It also gives a nice shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy/curly hair and have tried almost every product on the market to calm frizz, add shine, make my curls beautiful, and make it smooth when I want to blow it out/flat iron it. This product does it all! Then one day, it disappeared off the shelves in the stores. I am so grateful to have found it on Amazon. Nothing compares to it. Nothing at all. If you have tried it all, give this a chance. It&#x27;s fabulous. A little goes a long way. I have medium length hair and I use about a dime size or less. Yay Vitapointe!</li>
            <li> I have used Vitapointe for a number of years and find it an appropriate hairdressing between hair washings. I use only small amounts and the result is quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for year and just love it! Great price for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Make your hair shine, soft and easy to manage. I have been using it for years and always get compliments on my permed hair. It is sometimes hard to find in stores and I don&#x27;t know why but maybe because a lot of people were weaves now.</li>
            <li> This is NOT what&#x27;s sold in brick and mortar stores.  This product has an almost lotion-like consistency which results in it flaking up on your scalp.  I&#x27;ve ordered this twice.  The first time I thought the lack in quality was just a fluke and then once I received it again I realized that it wasn&#x27;t.  Either this product is counterfeit or it&#x27;s just a low grade knock-off of the original Vitapointe.</li>
            <li> Love this it is so hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> Excellent product only if the second ingredients is water and it is. Great shipping and fast service. This is the second time I ordered it and will order it again. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have used Vitapointe  for years before it wen t off the regular market and became available only on line. It has a good texture and works for older people whose hair thins.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my family for more than 10 years. My girls hair varies from 3b - 4b/c and it moisturizers perfectly. My husband and son use as well. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Is what I&#x27;m used to using from well know store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 50 years and have had so many compliments on my hair.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Thought i did not sure made by clairol any. More.  What i received was very greasy like vasolne.  Not quality i have been using for 20 years made by clairol</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrific.  Too bad it&#x27;s not easily found in the stores despite the fact that Clairol&#x27;s other products are well distributed</li>
            <li> The person that I ordered it for is very pleased</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, I PURCHASED AN ADDITION ONE AFTER THE 2 I FIRST BOUGHT NOW I HAVE 3 PLUS 2 TUBES OF IT. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOLVE IT!!! IT MAKES MY HAIRR LOOK HEALTHY.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected delivery! Used this stuff many years ago and so happy to see that it is still made and available!</li>
            <li> I love this product, and it is so much easier to use from the jar rather than a tube&lt;br /&gt;Gives a lovely shine to the hair without making it greasy&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 30 years and it is perfect as it always has been. Great for my hair... not to light and not to heavy. I use it daily.. a little goes a long way. Product arrived on time.</li>
            <li> The Vitapointe product does not seem to be the same as the product I used and loved years ago&#x3D;&#x3D;not as much shine and heavier texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I still find it useful while a little bit disappointing.  It was shipped promptly and arrived in good condition.</li>
