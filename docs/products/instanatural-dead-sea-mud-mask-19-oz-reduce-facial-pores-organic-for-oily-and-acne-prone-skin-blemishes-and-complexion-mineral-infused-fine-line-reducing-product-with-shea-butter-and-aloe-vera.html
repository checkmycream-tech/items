            <li>I love face masks and this is one of the best!</li>
            <li>HAPPY customer here!! :)</li>
            <li>What I honestly can say is that  I loved it!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes odor, even pleasant, can deter me from using something if it aggravates my nose or my asthma.</li>
            <li>Great product, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with this marvelous natural product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had it feel this good.</li>
            <li>Fairly good mask to use on your face once a week or so.</li>
            <li>so you can get a ton of masks out of one jar and that is ALWAYS a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a fairly rigid skin care routine.</li>
            <li>This one is just as good as the rest of them.</li>
            <li>Good smell, you can use it just about anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my sister and she loved the product.  </li>
            <li>It s really good mask.</li>
            <li>but I loved the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and best of all no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>My mom loved this mask.</li>
            <li>But that is a good thing because that is the mask pulling out the toxins.  </li>
            <li>I have another mud masque that smells like camphor and is not as good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Good  </li>
            <li>However good the product is, the customer service was what won me over.</li>
            <li>I really loved this product .</li>
            <li>Seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>They did not pay me for a good review.</li>
            <li>I loved how my skin feels after I use it.</li>
            <li>I loved this it made my skin look brighter.</li>

            <li>it does a good job</li>
            <li>Which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li>In the moment it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>And it feels good for days afterwards.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about that yet, since I am not experiencing muscle aches, but that&#x27;s good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>bought this because of all the good reviews,&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I did this mask with my boyfriends daughter, and we loved it.</li>

            <li>And my skin feels sooooooooooooo good.</li>
            <li>Nice texture and smoothes on well and feels great while on the skin.  </li>

            <li>Once I took it off my face felt tingly all over in a good way, like when you wash your face and you can feel your pores tingling.</li>

            <li>When its time to wash off the product you will need to use warm water and move in circular motions to get it off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this mask, I liked how my skin looked and felt.</li>
            <li>Product was provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li>I then put on warm clothes and went and watched TV for 2hrs.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin, so this is perfect for absorbing excess oil.</li>
            <li>Although the mask dries on your face once it&#x27;s off, feels nice and moist.</li>
            <li>Use warm water and circular motions to remove the mask from the skin.</li>

            <li>, I wipe away the mask with warm water and a washcloth, then wash my face one</li>
            <li>It is kind of a slimy, murky mud</li>

            <li>Regardless of being given the product, my opinion is my own and no one else&#x27;s.  </li>

            <li>You really do get a fair amount of product in this container making a body mask a very feasible option.</li>
            <li>and I think its a good product for SKINCARE maintenance but not so much as curing any real problems.</li>
            <li>amazing so far!</li>
            <li>I honestly have no complaints so far!</li>
            <li>This mask works so great on my dry skin!</li>

            <li>Well, They were right!  </li>
            <li>, right!  </li>
            <li>The best thing is that you hardly need to put a lot on your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a mask that you can feel and see a difference and plus this is a great price!</li>
            <li>i make sure my face is freshly washed first, than i apply the mud mask.</li>
            <li>and it does not burn my face or leave it bright red or break me out  </li>

            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>To read a full review you can check it out HERE.</li>
            <li>I loved it, very soothing and instantly refreshes my skin :)</li>
            <li>You can really feel it tighten as it dries, I love using this</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>my skin was nice as soft.</li>
            <li>You could use it for full body mud mask treatments.</li>
            <li>It felt cool going on, but no burning sensation like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It can be used anywhere on the body as a detoxifying mask, which is really cool.</li>
            <li>It also irritated my skin, and when i washed it off with cool water, i felt like i had a sunburn</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second I love how much you get in this container.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on nicely and you can feel it working, it U clogs your pours and leaves soft</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a massive jar, you can use it all over your body, and it still lasts for ages, making it a good deal to boot.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt smoother--it&#x27;s a true luxury</li>
            <li>A facial mask is a good way to relax and unwind.</li>
            <li>so you are going to get more than just two or three masks out of there because even when you smear it on and cover your face, you haven&#x27;t used a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a full on spa treatment</li>
            <li>I really really wanted to love this</li>
            <li>I applied this product on my face, it felt like cool lotion</li>
            <li>I also loved the glow and blush it brought back into my cheeks!</li>
            <li>Paid full price and would do so again.</li>
            <li>I bought this awhile ago and still have a good amount left in the jar.</li>
            <li>- We love this stuff so much that with all the girls at my house we are using a container a month.</li>
            <li>I love it so much in fact, that I purchased another for my mother for Valentine&#x27;s Day just a week after I bought mine.</li>
            <li>What I love about this is that you&#x27;re really getting a bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>and it feels cool.  </li>
            <li>I full expecting some sort of funky smell when I opened it but that wasn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved how this not only opened my pores but added moisture to my face!</li>
            <li>My skin looks clearer and refreshed after I use this and feels super clean.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good because some facial stuff is overpowering.</li>
            <li>Very comforting especially in hot weather.</li>
            <li>I have good skin but get the occasional unwanted eruption.  </li>
            <li>And with having sensitive skin, warm instead of burning means everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love a mud mask for really clarifying my skin, but sometimes they can be a bit drying.</li>
            <li>I have posted a full review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li>My skin had no bad reaction to this product whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I have tried many masks and I enjoy trying new ones.</li>
            <li>Our skin feels smooth and healthy, almost new.</li>
            <li>Its moisturizes your skin to prevent intra-cellular water loss ,so its a perfect treatment for dry mature skin, but I would not use it if I had oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>After getting all of it off, I quickly washed my face with gentle cleansing soap to be sure I had gotten all of it off.</li>
            <li>Once completely dry, I was easily able to remove the mask with warm water.  </li>
            <li>My niece is a redhead and has very sensitive skin and this product gave her zero problems --- no rashes, nothing but a healthy glow and smooth cheeks.</li>
            <li>I might avoid it if you have dry skin, but it would be amazing for body and spot treatments!</li>
            <li>First mask that I have tried that clears my skin, tightens, and is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>first I was a bit red but that quickly went away and my face felt tighter, very smooth and had a nice glow to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I slather this on clean skin then crawl into a hot tub!</li>
            <li>My face was so remarkably smooth after the first treatment with no oily residue anywhere and no irritation occurred which is amazing since my skin is sensitive to almost everything man made.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my skin feels like new skin!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>This mask makes my face feel so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Leaving my skin feeling clean and fresh, no minty smell</li>
            <li>My teenagers have been using this mask &amp; their skin has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li>Super luxurious.  </li>
            <li>It dries it up quick.</li>
            <li>You then pat dry with a clean cloth and apply a good moisturizer to start nourishing the skin.</li>
            <li>But that foes away quickly.</li>
            <li>This mud mask is extraordinary at clearing up breakouts and purifying your skin.</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s helped zap a couple blemishes quickly.</li>
            <li>Received quickly from seller.</li>
            <li>It started drying up quick</li>
            <li>It started drying up quick</li>
            <li>I was impressed by this mask and it would definitely be added to my facial routine.</li>
            <li>and my face seems more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>dead sea mud mask is the absolute best!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I removed the Mud Mask from my face, I noticed my face felt super smoother and softer than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>mmmm.... super soothing.</li>
            <li>I have heard so much about the wonderful results from going to the dead sea and dipping into the waters, and how it heals.</li>
            <li>Ok I am still testing this mask but so far i think it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I would call this mask a very gentle mask with gentle and clean refreshing results.</li>
            <li>Since it is only recommended that you use this once a week you will have months worth of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, its made in the USA and it really works great.</li>
            <li>However, this mask made my skin feel cool and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fun to horrify the family with the reptile greenish-black full mask.</li>
            <li>after wiping it off my face, my skin got super smooth and feels clear and clean!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really moisturizing, but it does leave my skin feeling smooth and clean after use.</li>
            <li>Hands down, great product.</li>
            <li>However, the tub is very large and reasonably priced, so I still feel that this is a great value for overall masks.</li>
            <li>Other than that your face will look more healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love clay masks and wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I love how fresh and clean this makes my face feel and how it feels so exfoliated and soft</li>
            <li>I really like this product, for it doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell like most mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the fence on recommending this to anyone who has dry skin, but any one with fair or oily skin, go for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen first hand the benefits of how much better their skin looks and feels after a mud mask, and I really wanted something like that I could use on myself at home.</li>
            <li>When I first applied this, I wasn&#x27;t too sure how much you needed, if I had to mix it together</li>
            <li>I am in love with this mask and I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well!</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS MUD MASK!!</li>
            <li>After washing the mask off the first time I used it, I saw all of the dirt unclogged from my pores!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>Definitely way better than the aztec healing clay!</li>
            <li>It looks pretty gooey, not going to lie!</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say this scrub is my favorite!</li>
            <li>You get so much product! !</li>
            <li>I have problems with acne deep under the skin, and using this twice a week after washing my face has made most of my acne go away!</li>
            <li>i would absolutely recommend this to others!!</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, skin is tighter, and m face glows too, which I love!</li>
            <li>She loved how soft and new it made her skin feel even after just one use.</li>
            <li>The mask goes on easy and leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It was soft and smooth, almost slimy feeling, making it easy to apply and spread out over my face.</li>
            <li>My skin felt super soft after I took it out with water. :)</li>

            <li>I use several InstaNatural products and honestly love them all.</li>
            <li>First, I don&#x27;t like the gummy texture.</li>

            <li>skin first before applying the mud mask.</li>
            <li>(Ignore the funny look, something about mud on my face spurred funny</li>
            <li>While the jar does say discontinue if redness or irritation occurs, I feel like there could have been more information regarding potential ingredients that people may react to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made me feel like there was no way to be 100% sure that this item hadn&#x27;t been used and returned or tampered with prior to receiving it.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products but this mud mask beats them all.</li>
            <li>I burned my thumb on hot metal, and out of curiosity I applied the mud.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it i broke out afterwards, but I think that it just brought a lot of impurities to the surface of my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I was a bit hesitant at first to purchase this product because of the price.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face soft and smooth.</li>

            <li>and that was just the first use</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I wash my face first and then applied on my face.</li>
            <li>I wash my face first and then applied on my face.</li>
            <li>I love every second of using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s funny cause</li>
            <li>I love beauty products, especially face masks.  </li>
            <li>To make the mud more pliable, several organic ingredients like Shea Butter,  Sunflower Oil , Aloe Vera juice, Vegetable Glycerin, Jojoba Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, Calendula Oil and filtered Water have been added.</li>
            <li>When you first apply the mask it feels like applying pudding.</li>

            <li>After the first use I noticed my skin hlowing and pores were tighter..</li>
            <li>first use and it reduced the sprouting of my acne</li>
            <li>I now use it weekly, wish I could use it more often but the instructions say only use once a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many masks from different companies.</li>
            <li>It did make my face a bit red for a bit, but I think that had more to do with the hot water and scrubbing it off.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>and I wanted to try on my face first),</li>

            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try it again and see how it does with consistent use.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I have to say, I&#x27;ve been using the entire line of InstaNatural beauty products, and I love them all.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth after I use this mask.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I used it on my chest and shoulders first.</li>
            <li>(oil first then my cera ve).</li>
            <li>I used this mask and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>no further this will make you love your skin again</li>
            <li>After ONLY 2 weeks, my acnes have reduced and my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>Most things make me break out, even when you would think there is no possible way for it to cause a reaction.</li>
            <li>Also putting it on is easier still and no weird smell.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling, soft, smooth, and even coloring.</li>
            <li>My face overall looked and felt better</li>
            <li>This seller did something none has done before and that is send an email PRIOR to the product coming explaining a bit more about it.</li>
            <li>I felt an immediate cooling sensation by the time I was putting the top back on and putting it away.</li>
            <li>and this was my first one.</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time I saw a drastic change in the size of my pimples.</li>
            <li>I really think it removed some of the toxens from my skin!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I use this mask twice per week and it makes my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask let me reset the clock and pretend I was a good girl about my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask let me reset the clock and pretend I was a good girl about my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>This dead sea mask is every bit as good as the masks I give in the spa.</li>
            <li>I find my face feeling very soft, clean and radiant after the mask and have been receiving compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>good stuff it performs as stated and this amount with only having to use once a week should last a very long time unless you use fore body as well of course,when it drys it kind of stiffen which can be a little mildly itchy kind of the effect of when your nose itches at the dentist because you can&#x27;t touch it but</li>
            <li>My skin tone was clearing up, blackheads less noticeable, and most important my skin feels hydrated duringthese colder months.</li>
            <li>When it starts to dry, it tightens so much your face kind of hurts.  </li>
            <li>It is a jelly consistency, a little cool on the skin at first, but very easy to apply and cover.</li>
            <li>the service is really great,even the product is not excellent for my face ,but the seller are so sweet and responsibility ,giving me full refund .i use five times not as good as i image,but just for me,maybe i am so special.</li>
            <li>But, overall it&#x27;s just a nice simple clean mask.</li>
            <li>When I found Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask at and exceptional price I had to jump on the offer, and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>The first time after leaving the Dead Sea Mud Mask for 20 minutes, I was left with a nice clean surface that was not over dry but had a nice clean sheen.</li>
            <li>Any ways other than that its amazing.</li>
            <li>The directions say to use this only once per week, so I might change my opinion of this the next time I use this, but I do feel like it absorbs the excess oil in the face, although there were no radical changes (my skin had been pretty good anyway when I was using the mask.)</li>
            <li>I am convinced this is going to last me for a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am completely satisfied and couple of my girlfriends who tried it LOVE it as well.</li>
            <li>Your skin will look very nice afterwards though, very dewy and new looking and your pores will be shrunken and less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much all of their products and they&#x27;re all super high quality.</li>
            <li>My skin looked so clean and clear when I washed it off.</li>
            <li>I applied the mask using an old brush, to get the perfect thin application.</li>
            <li>Clean, clear skin after using this product once a week.</li>
            <li>This product really makes my face feel extremely smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel soft and clean after using.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling SO clean and soft.</li>
            <li>This makes me feel so clean and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel so soft, clean and refreshed without stripping away everything or leaving a film.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face clean and soft.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed it off I was amazed how soft my skin was, and how clean it felt.</li>
            <li>It was interesting and actually made spreading the mask onto my face much easier.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is 100% natural because i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite of the entire product line.</li>
            <li>It works just as good or better than the expensive stuff that you can get in the mall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the mud mask only once  but really liked the results so far.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was how much product you received and you don&#x27;t use much in every application,I am pretty sure it will last me the 12 months of shelf</li>
            <li>I was fairly intrigued as I’ve never actually used a proper mud mask.  </li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Mud Mask is renowned the world over as the most effective, all natural, skin-reviving facial mask available.</li>
            <li>It definitely left my face feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li>Makes my face super soft!</li>
            <li>After applying, skin feels super soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>I have dry skin in the winter and more oils during the hot humid months.</li>
            <li>I only use it once a week since it is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>This mask is the first mask I have ever been able to use that doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to erupt the day after use and doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li>When we used it not only was the aroma a very sweet smell but</li>
            <li>Before receiving this product to review, I already had a positive opinion about the InstaNatural brand.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>What I love about InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask: It makes a great gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a gift for my wife, and here&#x27;s what she had to say about this Dead Sea Mud Mask:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed when I opened up the tub, there wasn&#x27;t any real smell to it.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the amount that you get and the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use much which makes it quite a deal!  </li>
            <li>: Yes, it tightens up the skin and there is some itchiness and when it dries it looks pretty much as expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really feel like with a consistent use of this product they will be gone forever.</li>
            <li>but it went away pretty fast.</li>
            <li>A couple of weeks ago, I was given InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Natural Mineral Infused Dead Sea Mud Mask to try out for free in exchange for my 100% honest, unbiased opinion of the product.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on the whole time I am soaking in the tub then rinse it off when  I am ready to get out!</li>
            <li>It is a charcoal gray (not black or brown) color and smells unbelievably clean, considering it is made from earth.  </li>
            <li>Surprised to see full sized product.</li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN (like me) THEN DO NOT USE AS SPOT TREATMENT ONE DAY, AND FULL MASK</li>
            <li>As it is drying, I can visual it is pulling impurities from my skin, leaving me with a clean, fresh feel.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling soft and clean and really minimizes my pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be wind down in the evening with a mask without having to set foot in spa.</li>
            <li>My pores were much smaller and my skin was definitely more vibrant.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of removing the old dull tissue and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I heard dead sea products was good to use, but this is my 2nd dead sea product I&#x27;ve used and was not at all happy with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you are looking for something new to try, this might be worth it for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you are looking for something new to try, this might be worth it for you.</li>
            <li>and my skin feel super soft and glowy.</li>
            <li>The container is easy to open</li>
            <li>The thicker the application, the longer it takes to dry and the more effect it will have on your skin.  </li>
            <li>The mask will dry in about 10-15 minutes, do not leave it on more than that</li>
            <li>Because of it&#x27;s more watery consistency, I would say it takes closer to 15-20 minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li>i make sure it is dry</li>
            <li>but when all was said done my felt good, felt clean, but didn&#x27;t look red nor did it feel like it had been given harsh treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it once a week (mostly Fridays after a long work week to unwind haha).</li>
            <li>My super sensitive skin was not irritated at all in any area.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t sting or leave your face dry yet my oily skin has been much more manageable since I started using the product.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling smooth and refreshed after the first use.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sometimes dry and flaky but my skin feels more hydrated then before.</li>
            <li>I  had mine on for more than 10 minutes so that it could completely dry.</li>
            <li>and I have super sensitive skin and psoriasis.</li>
            <li>These ingredients make for a mud mask that has no smell and feels super soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy enough (for a mud mask).  </li>
            <li>If you have a pimple, this mask will dry it out for sure.</li>
            <li>it gets the more it &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; from your pores and can dry your face out a bit leaving it flushed.</li>
            <li>I think if you used it more, it might dry out your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) Not to be graphic, but I had an under the skin things which normally lasts a while.</li>
            <li>Made in the USA no animal testing and pure ingredients.</li>
            <li>This certainly takes the cake.</li>
            <li>I know for a fact that it has certainly tightened the skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>Because this is a large jar, I will not be needing to re-order for awhile.  </li>
            <li>It certainly does not.</li>
            <li>Have noticed my pores are not as large as before.</li>
            <li>GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;The container is a large 16 ounces</li>
            <li>this is certainly the one to choose.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Dead Sea Mud Mask and I love it!  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the less than $25 with FREE amazon shipping price tag!</li>
            <li>The jar is fine enough and large</li>
            <li>so it will last long, easy to apply and after it &#x27;s removed the skin feels really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I have used this mask 2 times now, and I can confidently say that this will really dry up that excess oil!</li>
            <li>It also claims to improve fine lines and wrinkles when used on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>First, I liked that this Insta Natural Dead Sea Mask only has about 10 ingredients and most of them are organic.</li>
            <li>I will use this for the next 2 weeks and see what results I get and am pretty hopeful AND excited because I KNOW the outcome is going to be</li>
            <li>Afterwards I found my face to be soft &amp; smooth &amp; clear!  </li>
            <li>It left my skin super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>You can use it on just your face or your entire body, and it&#x27;s supposed to help with blemishes or to reduce the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>Over all decent!</li>
            <li>This product reminds me of a trip to the spa - a very high end one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask rinsed off easily leaving my skin feeling refeshed, tight and clean.</li>
            <li>And this one left it feeling pretty clean.</li>
            <li>When I first opened up the jar, I didn&#x27;t have high hopes.</li>
            <li>It is good, but really hard to take off.</li>
            <li>In spite of that, it feels good going on, seems hard to get off</li>
            <li>I use the mask once a week as directed, but it feels so good when I use it that I can hardly wait for the week to go by so that I can use it again.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the mask I was surprised!!</li>
            <li>It did get a little warm and back to cool in the first 10 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>, This tells me at best, it surfaced off a few dead cells and just brighten my skin  up a touch.</li>
            <li>My skin felt amazing with it on, while it dried and after I took it off.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a huge bottle so it will last forever.</li>
            <li>and I actually didn’t need that much to get a smooth coverage.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in how it looked the next day.</li>
            <li>Being a person who uses mask regularly, this 100% natural-InstaNatural Dead Sea Mask is a welcome addition to my skin care arsenal.</li>
            <li>a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is calmed, soothed skin that&#x27;s ready to drink up any serum or moisturizer you use afterward.</li>
            <li>The InstaNatural line is proving very</li>
            <li>I am not a mask expert, so I can&#x27;t really compare this to others.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>really sticky</li>
            <li>The mask works on absorbing toxins, excess oil, and dirt.</li>
            <li>The texture is very thickâ€”and can be messyâ€”but</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the size of the jar (16 oz.) is very generous</li>
            <li>I think I was expecting a really think clay type consistency</li>
            <li>You get so much in the jar</li>
            <li>so you get plenty of product and you do not need to use much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with mud masks</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very moist mask, in this</li>
            <li>It gives me a clean yet not dry after mask feel to my skin.</li>
            <li>I tend to get a bunch of cystic acne when I eat to much diary</li>
            <li>Also, my skin felt very itchy while it was drying.  </li>
            <li>there is really not any sent to it which i love about it</li>
            <li>After using this product, I continued on with my regular nighttime skincare routine, and my skin did not feel any drier or more irritated than before.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after washing the mask off and drying my face, I could feel and see my skin was more firm.</li>
            <li>It really rehabs my skin.</li>
            <li>It really cleans your pores.</li>
            <li>(It doesn&#x27;t take much.)</li>
            <li>Although the directions said that I could wear the mask for 10-15 minutes, I was ready to get it off after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this because of the oils in it (jojoba, etc), and to my surprise this works really well.</li>
            <li>If you purchase it, you really won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>It really tightens up your skin as it dries.</li>
            <li>received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li>received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li>I really like how it leaves my skin feeling after I use it.  </li>
            <li>but there is an unusual texture.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really  invigorating to the skin.</li>
            <li>Once a week application is what is recommended, and that really seems sufficient.  </li>
            <li>This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t feel drying.  </li>
            <li>Left my skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother, make up glides in without gooping into my poors etc.</li>
            <li>I expected it to have more salt in it.  </li>
            <li>which  now I don’t use as much makeup as before.</li>
            <li>Dont see much effects</li>
            <li>It really cleaned my skin and made it feel softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I really like this product it works.  </li>
            <li>I am still learning what this product is capable of.  </li>
            <li>and then  I can&#x27;t really tell that it did anything.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Very comparable to the products sold in the Malls here in the National Capital Region</li>
            <li>High recommendation from me!</li>
            <li>Anyways, I really wanted to treat my skin to something</li>
            <li>have started using it once a week, makes my skin feeling fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have really oily acne prone skin, but this has cured me of breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Actually I don&#x27;t really smell anything.</li>
            <li>Really wanted this to work with my skin.</li>
            <li>It rinses off really well with almost no traces on a toner pad.  </li>
            <li>It might be a bit too much for those skin types to handle.</li>
            <li>really irritate either,</li>
            <li>When I use to do a weekly mask, my skin didn&#x27;t break out as much.</li>
            <li>and it really cleans the pores.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It really does feel like impurities are being drawn out of the skin.  </li>
            <li>Wearing masks make me feel like I&#x27;m at the spa, but this mask really resembles the ones at the spa.</li>
            <li>it means there are no irritating perfumes added.</li>
            <li>all the dirt, gunk was washed off and my face was squeaky clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>Really looks like mud, but has no smell.  </li>
            <li>It is a real winner.</li>
            <li>it really improved my skin.</li>
            <li>My acne and blemishes has really disappeared.</li>
            <li>I really did like the texture and that it had no smell</li>
            <li>I CAN SEE SO MUCH DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN.</li>
            <li>And I really like how they keep in touch with you giving advice etc</li>
            <li>It has a really creamy texture while your putting it on, then once it starts to harden on your face, you can really feel it going to work.</li>
            <li>but there is no odor really at all.  </li>
            <li>I am not one to use masks much - just once and awhile, but I like this one.  </li>
            <li>The directions say to use it once a week to keep from drying out your face; however, I have found that using the mud on my blemishes (no matter their cause) dries them up much faster.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product weekly now for a month and really like its effect on my face.</li>
            <li>I was very ezcited to recieve this product for review.</li>
            <li>I am very happu</li>
            <li>so my skin takes a real beating, and this product is on my must-have list now.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t believe I paid so much money for a mask that has something like that in it.</li>
            <li>It really looks like mud.  </li>
            <li>I really want to like it..</li>
            <li>It was not irritating at all to my skin.</li>
            <li>This really pulls out the impurities.</li>
            <li>Skin definitely feels smooth after use.</li>
            <li>and when it was drying I noticed it was really working on my pores as I could see them all.  </li>
            <li>When I heard about this promotion the mask sounded promising.  </li>
            <li>A bonus was that the mask really didn&#x27;t have a smell, and the consistency was gel-like.</li>
            <li>I always use sebum absorbing paper to deal with it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li>but I think the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>There is so much product in the container,</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re really rubbing it in while also washing it off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and my skin looked brighter and softer after I took it off.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>thank you so much for it guys</li>
            <li>Works very well and tightens up the face.</li>
            <li>I really like this product a lot.</li>
            <li>It really helps keeping the breakout in control and helps prevent scarring.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>This mask was... intense.</li>
            <li>The InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask - Skin Cleaner is one of the better Mask I have ever used I just just love the way</li>
            <li>The consistency almost reminds me of a really dense chocolate pudding.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It had the same smooth moisturizing feel as Aloe Vera gel.</li>
            <li>and this really helps with the irritation from it.</li>
            <li>If you do that I would advise using a loffa to help rinse it off rather than a white or light colored wash cloth like it did.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>face feeling very soft&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take much to take it off</li>
            <li>Well you really don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li>It didn’t really have too much of a smell  to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I appreciate the short, pronounceable ingredient list, and that it is free of parabens.</li>
            <li>Nothing to bragg about really.</li>
            <li>My skin feels SO much softer after I use this mask.</li>
            <li>I have used several different brands and I have liked them all.</li>
            <li>Omg this mask left my skin so soft, I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use, apply, let dry completely and rinse off.</li>
            <li>Only tried it twice and so far, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Once dried, remove the mud mask by using warm water and circular motions.</li>
            <li>I put a thin layer over my skin per the directions, putting some more around my nose area, since I have more oil there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product complementary, but this is 100% my honest opinion and that in no way changed my opinion about the product (I have been a blogger for 2 yrs now, and have given good reviews &amp; bad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m basically workin with one wrinkle, right smack dab in the middle of my forehead, so I&#x27;ll be sure to update readers should the tone and texture show improvement from regular use of this mask.</li>
            <li>All natural defiantly a plus!!!</li>
            <li>But most of us don&#x27;t have the time or funds to go lay around a spa a few times a week, right?</li>
            <li>The reviews listed have clearly demonstrated how effective this mask can be for some people, however, they don&#x27;t showcase the other side of it as much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always willing to try a new product and when a friend recommended this to me, I thought hey, why not.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the mask starts to hurt if you leave it on too long which i love to do lol.</li>
            <li>Right after the first use I could see that areas with large pores looked slightly smaller in size.</li>
            <li>I definitely think this product is worth investing in!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other acne treatments and home remedies that didn&#x27;t give me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other masks that are more drying for this purpose, and I&#x27;d hoped this would be a replacement.  </li>
            <li>but I tough it out and the results seem pretty good.</li>
            <li>I really liked the Dead Sea Mud Mask, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Was refreshing untill 5 minutes later when it became to itchy to bare.</li>
            <li>It actually refined skin&#x27;s texture and leaves it hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li>it left my skin feeling amasing, clean and</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older, any blemish takes SO much longer to heal....</li>
            <li>It moisturized where I needed to moisturize, and I felt clean and refreshed where it was normally extra oily.</li>
            <li>You do not use a large amount each time so the Insta Natural Dead Sea Mud Mask is worth way more than priced.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s dried, it&#x27;s very easy to rinse away.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin that is also severely dry and sensitive to most products.</li>
            <li>After I washed this off it did leave my skin feeling dry, but I used the retinol serum from the same company after and the dryness went away so had no problem with that as everyone should put on a nice moisturizer after a mask anyways.  </li>
            <li>What I love about this mask is that it&#x27;s natural, dries up acne and oil, but doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry afterwards.</li>
            <li>The wonderful thing, is that you can feel the mask working its magic -- thanks to the tightening (and I mean tight) action it has when its dry.</li>
            <li>It is easy to spread and feels cool on your face, I used only two times so far since use only once a week.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing, just don&#x27;t overuse or it will cause excessive drying.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin, so it makes me wonder what exactly is in this.</li>
            <li>It never fails to leave my skin so soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>This product was sent to me for review purposes, as usual, I promise to give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Natural product that I don&#x27;t have to worry about on my skin or in the environment, thanks InstaNatrual!</li>
            <li>I first opened the jar, I was surprised at what the texture was.  </li>
            <li>It honestly looked like a  slick mud consistency.  </li>
            <li>This is my first mud mask and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t have a scent at all.</li>
            <li>The product comes in a rather large jar, so you are definitely getting your moneys  worth when you purchase from</li>
            <li>Much better than the $65 little jars from the high end beauty store!</li>
            <li>Leave skin feeling new!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a full facial cleanse and exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other mud masks that burn, but this one feels more gentle and did not burn my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While my experience with this mask was a good one, I do think people with dry skin need to be very careful when using this product.</li>
            <li>I love being able to bring the spa home to me since it&#x27;s so expensive to go.</li>
            <li>Just enough to open the top layer and pore and eliminate the dirt and oil improving your skin tone and leaving it smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>really enjoyed using the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask and really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older now</li>
            <li>I started by washing my face with mild soap or a simple face wash.</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s a main stay and a must have).</li>
            <li>the redness has only mildly subsided.</li>
            <li>Being able to actually like the skin on my face has been a big life changer for me.  </li>
            <li>I have to use a decent amount to get what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommended, make sure to tone after because there&#x27;s still some mud left after.</li>
            <li>The product dries quickly, and you definitely feel a pulling sensation as it does.  </li>
            <li>I just waited for the next week and applied it as a regular mask, and no problem! :)  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get a discount, but I stand by my review!</li>
            <li>It is really easy to apply, at first you will feel a little itchy but once its starts to harden it goes away.</li>
            <li>The results come down to a cool, fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin really soft, but be sure to moisturize after or you&#x27;ll feel dry because the clay is pulling the natural oils (and junk!)</li>
            <li>Immediately afterwards I ran my fingers over my face to find that every  single inch of my  skin was silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This mud mask contains Pure Dead Sea Mud, which has numerous minerals which are beneficial for our skin, especially magnesium which is a great anti-inflammatory.</li>
            <li>It is much better than trying to deal with the mess and rinsing in the sink.</li>
            <li>My skin is absolutely glowing and feels so soft!</li>
            <li>(Just make sure you screw the lid on really tight between uses to avoid drying it out.)</li>
            <li>I really like the way my skin feels after this mask - its leaves it very smooth and soft but does not feel too tight like when I used the bentonite clay mask.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend there  products...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you treat yourself.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>to the high concentration of minerals, we recommend using the mud mask once a week.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>If you have not tried InstaNatural products I highly recommend you do.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead with moderately sensitive  to sensitive olive fair to pale skin.</li>
            <li>It dries on pretty stiff but was easy to work with and wash off.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed it off, my skin was so soft!!</li>
            <li>(I mean, hey, there is A LOT in this jar) and they absolutely love it as well!</li>
            <li>My 2 daughters that suffer from a little acne use it and love it.</li>
            <li>Of course, like most mask, it did itch a little while it was drying.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin feel extra clean and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>This mask is used like any other- applied to clean skin and left for 10-15 minutes to dry, then rinsed off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how much stuff was coming out.</li>
            <li>Really cleared my skin, which is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I love this 100% natural face cleansing product made from real mud from the sacred Dead Sea.</li>
            <li>This mud mask really tightens up your skin and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>real action starts when it begin drying.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t over dry my face, it just leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>i have a sensitive skin but this really works well for me.</li>
            <li>The product does tends to settle but I would considered this normal, so</li>
            <li>After few use I&#x27;m able to see results.</li>
            <li>Wow, far better than expected</li>
            <li>this is not my favorite InstNatural product, and I have tried a few.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update this after a few more uses.</li>
            <li>I read on InstaNatural&#x27;s site, that they do not recommend using the Dead Sea Mud Mask more than once a week........</li>
            <li>That is normal, and is where the mask got deeper into the skin pulling impurities out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Mud Mask is virtually the same...and at a much better price point.  </li>
            <li>my oily acne prone skin feels fresh, my t-zone pores are noticeably smaller</li>
            <li>email instructions on how to use it, which I found to be very helpful, more so than trying to read the small texts off the jar</li>
            <li>so many of the masks that had heavy perfumes bother my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are better Dead Sea Masks out there.</li>
            <li>It was definitely a foreign feeling since it has been so long since I did one, but when I took it off, my face looked 100x better!</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using it, i feel it does help my face glow with a better complexion.</li>
            <li>I love this dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li>removing the Dead Sea Mud Mask which I love.</li>
            <li>For thousands of years the Dead Sea has attracted visitors who love to bathe in this salt lake, which is known for</li>
            <li>The face section dried faster, since it was a thinner layer, but the area around my noise took longer, since I put more there.</li>
            <li>I love this dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li>This product last a while so it worth it the money.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got this Dead Sea mud.</li>
            <li>The latest item is the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Must try the Dead Sea Mud Mask... :)</li>
            <li>I love my Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>You get a 1lb tub of the Dead Sea Mud Mask and it&#x27;s filled to the brim!</li>
            <li>Have only had this product a short time, but I love the results thus far.  </li>
            <li>I seen this product while browsing one day and figured what&#x27;s one more thing to waste money on at this point</li>
            <li>Although its recommend for acne to detoxify, it leaves a good film of oil behind.</li>
            <li>Rinses well, not hard to remove.  </li>
            <li>It is always nice to have skin especially my nose with out black heads.</li>
            <li>and I have developed mild acne in the last year.</li>
            <li>It brings deep blackheads to the surface for easy extraction, even the ones that will challenge an esthetician during a facial.  </li>
            <li>it left it super soft.  </li>
            <li>Drying time is quick, and my face is left soft and smoothe.</li>
            <li>Left my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>was very excited to try this mud mask because it contains Dead Sea minerals.</li>
            <li>I actually like this mask, it was just right for me.</li>
            <li>The container states that it will take up to 15 minutes to dry- which is true.</li>
            <li>Make sure it&#x27;s dried completely before washing it off!</li>
            <li>It does get really tight on the skin, so make sure you don&#x27;t put it along the sensitive parts of your skin like under your eyes.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes of it on my face, it dried nicely and was quick to wash off without a mess.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a fantastic treat for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I also like to use a little dab of it more frequently on that dreaded acne.  </li>
            <li>Also my makeup looks a lot better since my acne is becoming less noticeable since using Insta Natural dead sea mud mask.  </li>
            <li>and I new that it was working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live the MUD</li>
            <li>I found a new friend for my face.</li>
            <li>&amp; so I am sometimes reluctant to try new products.  </li>
            <li>I live in humid and tropical weather.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, when I see a new breakout, I apply the mask on the spot overnight.  </li>
            <li>I am new to using mud masks</li>
            <li>I use face mask, but it&#x27;s really hard to find one you really can love.</li>
            <li>With such a HUGE tub I&#x27;m not surprise if this mask will last for months.</li>
            <li>The container is huge and will last me forever, but I&#x27;d definitely repurchase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge promoter of this mud mask, and will likely give it to several of my friends for upcoming birthdays.</li>
            <li>I do think that if I hadn&#x27;t continued on with my product routine, my skin probably would have felt super dry.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish were different is the cruelty free part of this product.</li>
            <li>We used this mud mask on his entire face and like me, his skin was left smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>30 minutes later I had lovely pink skin.</li>
            <li>It starts to dry quickly and pulls the oil and dirt out of your skin.  </li>
            <li>and I think that it&#x27;s the next step in my beauty regime to keeping my face looking fresh and young.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling very soft, and new.</li>
            <li>My complexion is more radiant; in fact, I might even say it glows a little bit!  </li>
            <li>unlike most mud masks this one is very unusual where a tiny bit goes a long long way</li>
            <li>and it is something that does not need to be used very frequently.  </li>
            <li>but I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>With this mask, my skin was very soft and it didn&#x27;t leave my face shiny like some others.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It feels amazingly smooth and cooling and hydrating on your skin and can be easily smoothed over the face, neck, decolletage, upper back, shoulders - wherever you need a little help on your body.</li>
            <li>you should really give this a try, especially if you have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use many other products!</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no mixing, or any type of special prep before applying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually wearing this mask right now, and I happened to get an email asking how I like the mud so far.</li>
            <li>For $25, you get a GIANT 16 oz jar - made from pure dead sea mud, organic shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera, and more.  </li>
            <li>It also makes your skin super soft and in the long run helps to restore an even skin tone for a smoother complexion.</li>
            <li>That is a weird combination of issues, so it is amazing that one product works well for all!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Have been using this for almost 3 months now (2 times/week for the first month and 1 time/week for the next 2 months)</li>
            <li>I have some first trimester of pregnancy acne, so I used this mask and the next morning</li>
            <li>All natural and organic!</li>
            <li>Love Dead Sea Minerals, always do wonders for my skin!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>It works on the really small blackheads and prevents more from forming.</li>
            <li>My blackheads are pretty deep, they are not the ones that can be pulled off with those nose strips</li>
            <li>My face is soft and supple after using it!</li>
            <li>Now you exactly can tell where I put the product on my face as all the edges are red...</li>
            <li>I am not sure why, but I find rubbing mud or clay on my face than washing it off strangely satisfying.</li>
            <li>When I first opened up the jar, I was like gross...</li>
            <li>It is all natural, which is something I look for in skincare, but also helps maintain the clarity and clearness of my skin!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>So far, I like it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty big jar, 16 oz.  </li>
            <li>; it is 100% natural, it is infused with minerals and it detoxifies &amp; purifies your skin!  </li>
            <li>I find that it brings the product back into the first start where you put it on</li>
            <li>Be aware that when this mask dries, you can definitely feel a pulling sensation on your skin.</li>
            <li>However, I encourage being aware that this product is not for daily use, as it may dry/irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a pretty bid tub; bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed is that my pores looked smaller.</li>
            <li>I almost felt that l wasn’t getting enough all over my face at first.  </li>
            <li>The first two times I used this I left it on longer than I should have</li>
            <li>I used this last night for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This mask is a natural and effective facial skin treatment formulated with Dead Sea Mud.</li>
            <li>So , the only thing I can tell in terms of skin improvement would just be the overall clean skin feeling after removing it</li>
            <li>and I still like a mud pack a few times a year as it really does make your skin feel clean.</li>
            <li>It does work, my pores have shrinks down a lot, my face feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t get this if you have very dry skin, as it really pulls the skin pretty taught when you have it on.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in my skin overall as I use other facial masks during the week, but it feels amazing when applied.</li>
            <li>Also, make super sure you have a really good moisturizer on afterwards and this will dry you out extremely badly!</li>
            <li>, this is huge size and will last long time.</li>
            <li>I now use just one layer that dries in less than 15 minutes and does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Mud Mask was easy to spread over my face.</li>
            <li>I feel like after the first treatment that my pores were smaller and skin firmer, and I&#x27;m in my early fifties, with aging skin problems.</li>
            <li>Finally, at 37 years old, I&#x27;ve found something that really works on my break outs!  </li>
            <li>the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask goes a long way and let&#x27;s you treat your skin to some nice pampering.</li>
            <li>the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask goes a long way and let&#x27;s you treat your skin to some nice pampering.</li>
            <li>The product is good but it dried my face and created  dark patches on my face.</li>
            <li>The size is very large so it lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels so soft and looks so clear, almost glowing afterwards!  </li>
            <li>Helped my 10 year old out with some minor blemished skin and left our faces smooth.</li>
            <li>mud mask should feel cooling and soothing to the skin at first, but should then quickly start to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;Allow the mud mask to dry for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I live in an area that is very humid in the summer, makes me feel oil and greasy on nose and upper cheeks.</li>
            <li>This is a huge jar so it will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I applied this amazing Dead Sea Mud Mask to my face, I let is sit on my face for 15 minutes so it would dry.</li>
            <li>and I find that InstaNaturals price gives you more product for the same or less.  </li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for a dollar or less using amazingdealsgroup.com.</li>
            <li>Instead of making their faces softer and have less acne, like the product reviews had mentioned, it made both of them break out and have rougher more red skin.</li>
            <li>mud mask is green, soft and easy to apply to your face.</li>
            <li>I typically dry out on my cheeks, leaving my T zone oily, but this mask helped to even it out slowly, but with good improvement after three uses.  </li>
            <li>It looks fine because its dead sea mud</li>
            <li>it is a large quantity that will last quite a while for the price.  </li>
            <li>Large container, enough to share and still have plenty.  </li>
            <li>It certainly isn’t a one use mask, in fact I think that this will probably last me all year.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a large jar that will easily last over 6 months.</li>
            <li>The large jar should last quite a while!</li>
            <li>and you can see it come right back to live mix or well mixed mask for application.</li>
            <li>Very thick, but works nice</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was a reaction to the mask, but more of a reaction to being scrubbed since I gave myself a facial while testing this product and the exfoliant may have irritated my skin a little.</li>
            <li>It has served me well for many years, but now, in my mid-thirties, my skin is looking a bit dull.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure my skin has felt that smooth since before pre-teen acne hit me in Jr. High.  </li>
            <li>and I can clearly say that my skin has improved.</li>
            <li>Not messy comes already mixed and ready to use.</li>
            <li>The pores on my nose were less noticeable, and the surface of my skin felt soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use it to spot it on pimples and this helps clear it within a day.</li>
            <li>It was clear from how it felt after the 15 minutes that it was time to wash it off.</li>
            <li>The directions aren&#x27;t clear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After washing the Dead Sea mud mask from my face, it felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and after you take it off your face appears clear.</li>
            <li>It also helps to clear pimples and blackheads, and restore an even skin tone and smoother skin.</li>
            <li>It has also helped clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li>So far I have no complaints about any of their skin care products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very emollient, if there is such a thing, for a clay mask.</li>
            <li>Once I cleansed my face, it felt soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>So far, I have had no issues with any of the InstaNatural products that I have reviewed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steven opted not to try it with me one night off, I&#x27;m still going to see if he will after I&#x27;ve posted this review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve talked to him about the benefits of it, but he&#x27;s shied away so far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but this mud mask did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>The smell is none existent, so if your sensitive to smell this factor would be in your favor.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I have a natural pink/red undertone to my skin as well as acne prone.</li>
            <li>It does not have a scent at all as far as what I can tell.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in my face.</li>
            <li>After I wash this off my face, my skin looks brighter and feels really soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when does mud ever look good?&lt;br /&gt;The mask is an all natural detoxifier.</li>
            <li>I have a spa night 2 or 3 times a week with my 75 year old grandma.</li>
            <li>i think my skin is just to sensitive for this.</li>
            <li>Makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li>I have only done my face but will be doing my whole body</li>
            <li>I may add to this review later to let you all know if it really is helping with the acne.</li>
            <li>So far my skin looks healthier and feels softer.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any real changes in my skin or anything substantially different from any drug store face mask.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of natural ingredience.</li>
            <li>so far so will continue to do my once a week treatment to see if there is any difference.</li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>I went through two washcloths to get it completely off.  </li>
            <li>MY SKIN FEELS SO SOFT AND</li>
            <li>My face and neck feel so soft after using this.  </li>
            <li>The color completely changed after applying the mask.</li>
            <li>It also seems to leave my face feeling soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin -</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients soften my skin and leave it feeling refreshed and my pores tightened.</li>
            <li>My face feels wicked soft for hours after I use</li>
            <li>The mask is 100% Natural and infused with minerals.</li>
            <li>If applying on the face, avoid the eye and lip areas and any areas you may be sensitive to over-drying.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin, so I left the mask on for about 15 - 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels baby soft and looks rejuvenated after each use.</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s too early to make a comment if it&#x27;s working or not</li>
            <li>I even use it on my arthritic shoulder to naturally help pull out toxins and sooth that area.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and refreshed like nothing else.</li>
            <li>Soft natural smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to see any results</li>
            <li>(I have really sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need all that much for your entire face.</li>
            <li>The mud is soft and non-gritty.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and refreshed afterward.</li>
            <li>I also wouldn&#x27;t have considered myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>and i have to say that i am completely amazed with this mask.</li>
            <li>For the record, I have 31 year old skin</li>

            <li>Although i do not like the feeling mud masks give my face, it really surprised me how well it took to my skin type.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made100% Natural in a 16 oz.</li>
            <li>I used Insta Natural serum afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>

            <li>Yes, for one I like spa time at home, because I never have enough time to make an appointment at a real spa.</li>
            <li>Also, I had the piece of mind of knowing that I was putting all natural ingredients into my skin.</li>
            <li>I wouldn’t recommend it to people with sensitive skin, but I would recommend it to LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE.</li>
            <li>Although, you do not have to apply it under your nose and it is advised to not get this anywhere near your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it dries, the color changes to a light green and does not fall off your face either.</li>
            <li>and once I was it off, my face is so soft.</li>
            <li>SO MOISTURE AND SOFT AFTER USE IT.</li>
            <li>Not harsh on the skin</li>
            <li>This mask has changed my face completely.</li>

            <li>I have semi sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with eczema problems</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin stay away from it.</li>

            <li>and I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and did not have any reactions to it.</li>
            <li>Jar was filled to the top so it will last you quite some time as you will only need a thin layer for an application.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my face was soft and smoother than what it was before.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell of it, and it works sufficiently so far.</li>
            <li>I could feel my face firming, and my pore tightening up before the mask had completely</li>
            <li>AND it surprised me.</li>

            <li>so my 15 year old doesn&#x27;t swipe it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice so far in the two weeks since it arrived in the mail.</li>
            <li>So far, I like this.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels so soft once the mask  is used.  </li>
            <li>My sister is now ordering some because of how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, which is a must in my book.</li>
            <li>face felt really soft and supple after the mask.</li>
            <li>Moist and soft.</li>
            <li>I use this mask once a week for 15-20 minutes and it leaves my skin feeling extremely soft.</li>
            <li>After I use it on my face, it makes my face feel soft.</li>

            <li>My skin feels really soft after I&#x27;ve taken it off as well.</li>
            <li>I really love the dead sea mud facial masks.</li>
            <li>I love all that dead sea minerals do for my skin, and will definitely be keeping some of this mud mask on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love anything dead sea mud related.</li>
            <li>Fun to use with the &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; big enough you can use with others.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS INSTANATURAL DEAD SEA MUD FACIAL MASK.  </li>
            <li>InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is like having your own private spa at home!</li>
            <li>The fact, this mud comes from the Dead Sea with all its therapeutic properties entices me even more to incorporate it into my regular skin regiment.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea contains many minerals beneficial to the skin, such as magnesium, sodium, bromine, potassium and calcium.</li>
            <li>I used this once a week for the last few weeks and have felt my skin get a better complexion.</li>
            <li>I will update after a few more uses since you can only use it once</li>
            <li>not as thick as we expected but seem good.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my two daughters did not have a good experience and they will no longer use it.</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t muddy, it&#x27;s kind thin.</li>
            <li>It dries better if you don&#x27;t put it on too thick.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Mud Mask is very easy to apply, not too dry or sandy.</li>
            <li>It also takes very little to cover my whole face, so this jar should last a nice long time!</li>
            <li>I mean that it contains a great deal of moisture for in the short time leaving it on my shin, it does not harden or become a shell whatsoever, wet mask.</li>
            <li>This mask definitely feels like it cleans my pores, but it is very itchy and leaves my skin pretty dry once I near the end of the 10-15 minutes that I have it on.</li>
            <li>Scared to use it as lid had been placed back on w an apparent attempt to real seal product to look new</li>
            <li>My skin felt tight and clean.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and tight.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin pretty dry</li>
            <li>Not to mention it gets the bathtub full of black when you are rinsing it off.  </li>
            <li>you might have a little bit more of a hard time removing it, but once you do make sure to moisturize your face after because this product does tend to dry out your face.</li>
            <li>It came off easily with water but was very messy.</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommended, especially for anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS EASY TO USE MASK AND VERY FIRM.  </li>
            <li>The only that I didn&#x27;t like was that since I have more dry skin then oily my face felt very dry.</li>
            <li>For those with dry skin, I would be a bit careful because of the salt in the product, but it has many beneficial factors that are worth looking into, and purchasing the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful, just tight.</li>
            <li>the directions only suggest 1 time a week because I want to live in this stuff!</li>
            <li>I am so serious when I tell you this mask is outstanding.</li>
            <li>A serious favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking locally for a decent mud mask for me</li>
            <li>After the first use, I noticed my skin was a bit softer than prior to using, but it was after the third application that I truly noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I definitely suggest doing it only once a week, as its pretty drying for your skin.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty big container and it seems to last for quite a bit of uses.</li>
            <li>Like other InstaNatural products, it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful toxins like so many other companies use.</li>
            <li>I used this last night for the first time and it left my face radiant and clearer from blemishes and blackheads as soon as I wiped it off.</li>
            <li>First of all I barely ever write reviews especially when products just meet expectations or a little under, but this product is worth the time as it exceed way beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a new addition to your facial routine and are looking for an all natural face mask</li>
            <li>Pat dry with clean, dry cloth.</li>
            <li>I now can wear less makeup and even feel comfortable wearing my hair out of my face on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Well now, with this Dead Sea Mud Mask, in less than 15 minutes, you can do your own mud mask spa day at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This very large container will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>My face is so smooth afterwards - no more blackheads.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much - and often go long periods of time without using it.</li>
            <li>With some other mud mask products on the market, you can see the excess oil drawn out from the wet-looking spots on your pores when the mask has tried to a light grey color on the rest of your face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t leave it on long as it would be very over drying.</li>
            <li>It really made my chin break out into really strange bumps.</li>
            <li>Sensation is soothing and cool, I have noticed a difference in just a few uses in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>One full sized mask contains 16 ounces of the Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>I liked that it didnt make my skin feel tight when it dried.</li>
            <li>It is a very large jar that will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>This 16 oz jar is a great value due to the fact that you only need to use a thin coat per application.</li>
            <li>Very shortly after my review was posted I heard from the vendor who apologized and is sending me a new jar to replace the damaged one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li>I am such a fan of InstaNatural and will continue using and trying out new products.</li>
            <li>Ended up giving me 4 new zits on my forehead the next day.</li>
            <li>Tried it to compare to the borghese fango mask, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast.</li>
            <li>But you can really feel it when it starts to dry and tighten the skin..</li>
            <li>I find that if you put too much on, it will not fully dry in the time that it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem like it could even dry out if it wanted to - there is something really moisture-rich and hydrating about the mask consistency.  </li>
            <li>My cheek looked promising initially as my pores appeared smaller.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Mask is intense, almost too intense for my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very generous amout and I would say that it will last two to three months because you only use it about once  a week.</li>
            <li>When I opened the item it doesn&#x27;t appear to be completely filled, about 1/3 of the facial mask was missing.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin incredibly soft immediately after use, and it has helped clear up my horrible pregnancy breakouts :) love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool because it&#x27;s almost like a gel infused with mud that goes on clear and looks like dried mud after it dries!</li>
            <li>I am African-American, have sensitive skin, and I am 36 years old next week.  </li>
            <li>InstaNatural Dead Sea mask is a worthy entry into the clay mask line.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask arrived quickly and packaged well to prevent damage.</li>
            <li>It dried quickly on my face</li>
            <li>The creamy mask is thick, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I always have a small pimple or little blackhead that is trying to become more than what it really is</li>
            <li>I always have a small pimple or little blackhead that is trying to become more than what it really is</li>
            <li>My pores were noticeably smaller and my skin was very soft after using.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve only used it once as once a week is what was recommended) and my very sensitive skin reacted well to Insta Naturals Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>but this disappeared within 10 minutes and it left me with very soft skin.  </li>
            <li>it left my skin feeling very soft after I had it on there for about 10/13 mins.</li>
            <li>It left my skin very soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li>This product (alongside with other products from InstaNatural) was my first purchase ever</li>
            <li>I mean what can I say other than I love it?!?</li>
            <li>I was asked to try out the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Musk, I was very interested to see for myself</li>
            <li>I’ve only ever done the peel off cucumber style masks before and the oatmeal one from Lush!  </li>
            <li>have very sensitive, dry to combo skin, and I&#x27;m starting to get older, so if that sounds like you, this will help a lot.</li>
            <li>i have occasional breakouts around period time, but for the most part, it&#x27;s prettly subtle.</li>
            <li>Received this product very quickly and am very anxious to use it.</li>
            <li>The mud is not too hard to smooth over your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it’s really hard to fit spa time in let alone</li>
            <li>Plus the tub is huge, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not suppose to touch your skin in general but after I use the mask all I want to do</li>
            <li>- I personally use it to help restore moisture and at times, clear up acne.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any long lasting effects as a bought it for pore shrinkage.</li>
            <li>only used it once so far.  </li>
            <li>My face feels really soft the next day after I apply lotion.</li>
            <li>Try it and you will thank me in the near future!</li>
            <li>Since I have a sensitive skin, I only leave it on for 10 minutes before rinsing it</li>
            <li>The mud mask seems to restore moisture naturally without actually drying your skin out.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin deep- cleansed and feeling soft and</li>
            <li>Not only was it gental enough for her skin, but it left mine feeling smoother, softer, and so much healthier.</li>
            <li>and it left it feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>Pores being smaller is a plus for me as I am at he 40 year old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>She said it definitely reduced redness and made her skin soft.</li>
            <li>Indulge your skin with the proper natural care that&#x27;s my motto</li>
            <li>I avoid any sensitive area such as my eye one.</li>
            <li>Makes my fave soft and looks like I just rexived a facial.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling soft and</li>
            <li>Not only is this an all natural product, but they use organic sources of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>It has all natural ingredients and you get a really big tub of it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apply the mud mask to your whole face, being careful not to get it in your eyes or lips.  </li>
            <li>It takes roughly 10 - 15 minutes and you can feel it really tightening during that</li>
            <li>I have only used this product once so far.  </li>
            <li>My skin becomes soft and radiated and remains that way until the next use.</li>
            <li>I am quite surprised at how big the tub is compared to masks that I’ve bought before.  </li>
            <li>Apply it to your whole face (be careful of your eyes/lips) and leave it on for 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>I have only done one treatment, but had no adverse reactions, and I have fairly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My face actually feels soft and tingly</li>
            <li>My daughters and I added this to our skincare regimine and have noticed a marked changed in our skin with only two applications.</li>
            <li>not only was my skin soft and supple</li>
            <li>The size of the container really surprised me, I was expecting the container to be smaller.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and my pores appeared smaller.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin on my face seem fresh and firm after using.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I glopped on two layers because the first layer didn&#x27;t seem to be thick enough to work well.</li>
            <li>Right after applying it I can feel the cooling sensation and little tingling on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy who had mild acne when younger and used to use inexpensive mud packs (not the expensive Dead Sea brands) and liked the way they work.</li>
            <li>firmed the skin which helps withe large pores looseness and other problems.</li>
            <li>Do make sure to use a thin layer otherwise it may not dry as it should.</li>
            <li>You just apply a thin layer, let dry for 10-15 minutes and rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>I search for products made with all natural ingredients and with the absence of ingredients that I can&#x27;t even pronounce.</li>
            <li>My pores are a lot smaller, my skin is looking younger and my acne is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>Removes dull looking texture to reveal clean pores and brighter looking skin.</li>
            <li>I actually sent it back because the jar was only half full.</li>
            <li>but I tend to do one weekly incorporating all my skin and not limited to just the face.</li>
            <li>Plus, the jar is large enough to last a really long time!!</li>
            <li>This really is the holy grail of all masks, and the massive jar will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I survived, and the picture shows how the dry part is a light gray, while the wet part looks like the wet product before application.</li>
            <li>This has helped relieve the red, irritated blemishes my teen has developed.</li>
            <li>It works well enough that you would only need to use it once maybe twice per week depending on how sensitive and oily your skin is.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the mask seems pretty thin when it&#x27;s first applied.</li>
            <li>The only thing that drove me over the edge was the itching, but as a weekly or bi-weekly treatment, the benefit is worth the few minutes of itching.</li>
            <li>This particular mask is a wet mask, as opposed to others that are powdery and have to mix with water.  </li>
            <li>When I first put this on, I thought it was really thin and wasn&#x27;t going to do much, but it tightened my face like you wouldn&#x27;t believe!  </li>
            <li>It has a natural dark mud color, thanks to the pure dead sea mud, and it also contains organic Shea butter, sunflower oil, Aloe Vera juice, and jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I look like I&#x27;ve gone outside for too long with sunglasses on as there&#x27;s a distinct line around where I stopped the product under my eyes and other areas.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, it began to tingle a little</li>
            <li>and I find it to not be nearly as good as other Dead Sea mask that I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>Only a thin layer of this very unique textured mud does the trick.</li>
            <li>It is a very light mask - swipes on skin smoothly and easily - not your typical thick, dry, cakey mud mask.  </li>
            <li>This time though, i put way too much on my face and it took a long time to dry out.</li>
            <li>I was slightly worried at first as my face was quite red</li>
            <li>The next morning the bumps I had were barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>My daily facial care routine is simple; Dove sensitive skin soap and a moisturizer with SPF.  </li>
            <li>damaged seal..appears to have been used prior to shipping hole punctured torn open in middle directly in seal inside under lid w some leakage all around inside of jar.</li>
            <li>I just received my package a few days ago and had to try it the first night.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this product, is it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of weird smell like some mud masks I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no icky mud smell, just be really careful to keep it out of your eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>My ideal Friday night: glass of wine, InstaNatural Dead Sea mask, and a cheesy celeb magazine!</li>
            <li>It was less muddy and more gelatinous, which was slightly strange, but it made application a little bit easier.</li>
            <li>This does not smell bad though and feels pretty good on your face its just the odd hand feel that gets to me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out the face too much and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>was a little skeptical at first, very light, water based..</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in a very long time.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t dry my face out and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>caused me to break out, I have dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Not recommend for dry skins and patch test on sensitive skins to prevent irritation.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive or dry skin, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>would not, however, recommend this product to someone with naturally dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mask about three times over the past week and my skin has really started to clear up.</li>
            <li>Made my face itch the first few times but after several uses the itching stopped.  </li>
            <li>I felt so pampered the first time I used InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask.  </li>
            <li>I have compared InstaNaturals price line on different all natural facial products to other all natural products I have tried</li>
            <li>and I may have put a little much on because it took a while to dry completely;</li>
            <li>the 15 minutes was over and the mud was dry and cracking, I grabbed a wet wash cloth and gently rubbed off the mud.</li>
            <li>One tip I can give you, is if you have sensitive skin, to let the mask only partially dry before removing as the drier</li>
            <li>My skin feels super soft after using it and I don&#x27;t find that it&#x27;s irritating at all</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far, but just after a single use I notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I started using this line of products a few months ago after reading several positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This Dead Sea Mud Mask goes on easily and dried within ten minutes.  </li>
            <li>It will last me at least six months (or maybe less :))</li>
            <li>The  ingredients in this mask are pure dead sea mud, organic shea butter, organic jojoba oil, organic aloe vera juice, organic calendula oil, and hickory bark extract.</li>
            <li>You only need a little for your whole face and neck area.  </li>
            <li>My face felt so much smoother immediately after, and my pores were a little smaller.</li>
            <li>My skin feels deep down clean after using InstaNature&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask.  </li>
            <li>But other then that it left my skin feeling soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other mud masks that were super messy and actually clogged the drain.</li>

            <li> HAPPY customer here!! :)</li>
            <li> What I honestly can say is that  I loved it!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes odor, even pleasant, can deter me from using something if it aggravates my nose or my asthma.</li>
            <li> Great product, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this marvelous natural product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had it feel this good.</li>
            <li> Fairly good mask to use on your face once a week or so.</li>
            <li> so you can get a ton of masks out of one jar and that is ALWAYS a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a fairly rigid skin care routine.</li>
            <li> This one is just as good as the rest of them.</li>
            <li> Good smell, you can use it just about anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister and she loved the product.  </li>
            <li> It s really good mask.</li>
            <li> but I loved the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and best of all no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> My mom loved this mask.</li>
            <li> But that is a good thing because that is the mask pulling out the toxins.  </li>
            <li> I have another mud masque that smells like camphor and is not as good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Good  </li>
            <li> However good the product is, the customer service was what won me over.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product .</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> They did not pay me for a good review.</li>

            <li> I loved this it made my skin look brighter.</li>

            <li> She also loved it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this to be a superior mask.</li>
            <li> it does a good job</li>
            <li> Which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li> In the moment it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> And it feels good for days afterwards.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about that yet, since I am not experiencing muscle aches, but that&#x27;s good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> bought this because of all the good reviews,&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I did this mask with my boyfriends daughter, and we loved it.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> but this one the &amp;#34;instanatural&amp;#34; is so good</li>
            <li> And my skin feels sooooooooooooo good.</li>
            <li> Nice texture and smoothes on well and feels great while on the skin.  </li>
            <li> and she loved it too.  </li>
            <li> Once I took it off my face felt tingly all over in a good way, like when you wash your face and you can feel your pores tingling.</li>
            <li> If this review happened to be good than it deserved it).</li>
            <li> I look good.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Product was provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> I then put on warm clothes and went and watched TV for 2hrs.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so this is perfect for absorbing excess oil.</li>
            <li> Although the mask dries on your face once it&#x27;s off, feels nice and moist.</li>
            <li> Use warm water and circular motions to remove the mask from the skin.</li>
            <li> liked that their wasn&#x27;t a smell at all.</li>
            <li> I then rinsed it with warm water.</li>
            <li> It doesnt have a smell which is nice</li>

            <li> I was shock how my skin was after it was clean.</li>

            <li> have found though that all natural facial masks do work the best for me though.  </li>

            <li> I also use it on my hands which has helped greatly with my winter dry skin.</li>

            <li> This is a great mask to use during the colder months or for people with dry skin that still want a clarifying mask.</li>
            <li> You really do get a fair amount of product in this container making a body mask a very feasible option.</li>
            <li> and I think its a good product for SKINCARE maintenance but not so much as curing any real problems.</li>

            <li> To read a full review you can check it out HERE.</li>
            <li> I loved it, very soothing and instantly refreshes my skin :)</li>
            <li> You can really feel it tighten as it dries, I love using this</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> my skin was nice as soft.</li>
            <li> You could use it for full body mud mask treatments.</li>
            <li> It felt cool going on, but no burning sensation like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It can be used anywhere on the body as a detoxifying mask, which is really cool.</li>
            <li> It also irritated my skin, and when i washed it off with cool water, i felt like i had a sunburn</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second I love how much you get in this container.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on nicely and you can feel it working, it U clogs your pours and leaves soft</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a massive jar, you can use it all over your body, and it still lasts for ages, making it a good deal to boot.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt smoother--it&#x27;s a true luxury</li>
            <li> A facial mask is a good way to relax and unwind.</li>
            <li> so you are going to get more than just two or three masks out of there because even when you smear it on and cover your face, you haven&#x27;t used a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a full on spa treatment</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to love this</li>
            <li> I applied this product on my face, it felt like cool lotion</li>
            <li> I also loved the glow and blush it brought back into my cheeks!</li>
            <li> Paid full price and would do so again.</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile ago and still have a good amount left in the jar.</li>
            <li> - We love this stuff so much that with all the girls at my house we are using a container a month.</li>
            <li> I love it so much in fact, that I purchased another for my mother for Valentine&#x27;s Day just a week after I bought mine.</li>
            <li> What I love about this is that you&#x27;re really getting a bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> and it feels cool.  </li>
            <li> I full expecting some sort of funky smell when I opened it but that wasn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loved how this not only opened my pores but added moisture to my face!</li>
            <li> My skin looks clearer and refreshed after I use this and feels super clean.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good because some facial stuff is overpowering.</li>
            <li> Very comforting especially in hot weather.</li>
            <li> I have good skin but get the occasional unwanted eruption.  </li>
            <li> And with having sensitive skin, warm instead of burning means everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love a mud mask for really clarifying my skin, but sometimes they can be a bit drying.</li>
            <li> I have posted a full review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> My skin had no bad reaction to this product whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have tried many masks and I enjoy trying new ones.</li>
            <li> Our skin feels smooth and healthy, almost new.</li>
            <li> Its moisturizes your skin to prevent intra-cellular water loss ,so its a perfect treatment for dry mature skin, but I would not use it if I had oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> After getting all of it off, I quickly washed my face with gentle cleansing soap to be sure I had gotten all of it off.</li>
            <li> Once completely dry, I was easily able to remove the mask with warm water.  </li>
            <li> My niece is a redhead and has very sensitive skin and this product gave her zero problems --- no rashes, nothing but a healthy glow and smooth cheeks.</li>
            <li> I might avoid it if you have dry skin, but it would be amazing for body and spot treatments!</li>
            <li> First mask that I have tried that clears my skin, tightens, and is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> first I was a bit red but that quickly went away and my face felt tighter, very smooth and had a nice glow to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I slather this on clean skin then crawl into a hot tub!</li>
            <li> My face was so remarkably smooth after the first treatment with no oily residue anywhere and no irritation occurred which is amazing since my skin is sensitive to almost everything man made.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feels like new skin!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> This mask makes my face feel so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Leaving my skin feeling clean and fresh, no minty smell</li>
            <li> My teenagers have been using this mask &amp; their skin has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li> Super luxurious.  </li>
            <li> It dries it up quick.</li>
            <li> You then pat dry with a clean cloth and apply a good moisturizer to start nourishing the skin.</li>
            <li> But that foes away quickly.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is extraordinary at clearing up breakouts and purifying your skin.</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s helped zap a couple blemishes quickly.</li>
            <li> Received quickly from seller.</li>
            <li> It started drying up quick</li>
            <li> It started drying up quick</li>
            <li> I was impressed by this mask and it would definitely be added to my facial routine.</li>
            <li> and my face seems more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> dead sea mud mask is the absolute best!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I removed the Mud Mask from my face, I noticed my face felt super smoother and softer than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> mmmm.... super soothing.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about the wonderful results from going to the dead sea and dipping into the waters, and how it heals.</li>
            <li> Ok I am still testing this mask but so far i think it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I would call this mask a very gentle mask with gentle and clean refreshing results.</li>
            <li> Since it is only recommended that you use this once a week you will have months worth of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, its made in the USA and it really works great.</li>
            <li> However, this mask made my skin feel cool and fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fun to horrify the family with the reptile greenish-black full mask.</li>
            <li> after wiping it off my face, my skin got super smooth and feels clear and clean!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really moisturizing, but it does leave my skin feeling smooth and clean after use.</li>
            <li> Hands down, great product.</li>
            <li> However, the tub is very large and reasonably priced, so I still feel that this is a great value for overall masks.</li>
            <li> Other than that your face will look more healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love clay masks and wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> I love how fresh and clean this makes my face feel and how it feels so exfoliated and soft</li>
            <li> I really like this product, for it doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell like most mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence on recommending this to anyone who has dry skin, but any one with fair or oily skin, go for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen first hand the benefits of how much better their skin looks and feels after a mud mask, and I really wanted something like that I could use on myself at home.</li>
            <li> When I first applied this, I wasn&#x27;t too sure how much you needed, if I had to mix it together</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mask and I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well!</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS MUD MASK!!</li>
            <li> After washing the mask off the first time I used it, I saw all of the dirt unclogged from my pores!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> Definitely way better than the aztec healing clay!</li>
            <li> It looks pretty gooey, not going to lie!</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say this scrub is my favorite!</li>
            <li> You get so much product! !</li>
            <li> I have problems with acne deep under the skin, and using this twice a week after washing my face has made most of my acne go away!</li>
            <li> i would absolutely recommend this to others!!</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, skin is tighter, and m face glows too, which I love!</li>
            <li> She loved how soft and new it made her skin feel even after just one use.</li>
            <li> The mask goes on easy and leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It was soft and smooth, almost slimy feeling, making it easy to apply and spread out over my face.</li>
            <li> My skin felt super soft after I took it out with water. :)</li>
            <li> It did a great job at removing excess oil without that tight feeling afterwards.  </li>
            <li> This leaves your face looking and feeling fresh and it may or may not make you look 10 years younger, but it sure does make you feel it!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this, the congested pores at the edge of my nose were completely clean.</li>
            <li> After using this with a good moisturizer, it is safe to say this product has helped my face tremendously in the negative degree weather we have been having!was drying up.</li>

            <li> The mask is quick, painless, and leaves my skin smooth, soft and the pores totally clean.</li>

            <li> and it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to use very much at a time.  </li>

            <li> It went on well and left my skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> Works very well and leaves the skin super smooth and soft.</li>

            <li> My skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I was really surprise with the result!</li>
            <li> You really do get your moneys worth when purchasing items from their brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinds unlike any other mask I have tried ( and I have tried A LOT of them) and I love it!  </li>
            <li> This is a great mask that I do at least twice a week since it has the benefits of cleaning out your pores and being soothing &amp; hydrating.</li>
            <li> I will repeat the wrap next week and make sure to drink plenty of water to help increase the toxins removal.</li>
            <li> It may also be useful for drying out pimples and blemishes if you do not want to apply to your whole face.</li>
            <li> - I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a smell when I applied it to my face and when I rinse the mask off, it leaves my face feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Will post later re results after I&#x27;ve used this more.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural asked me to review a number of their products and I definitely enjoy them.</li>
            <li> My skin is seemingly  temperamental and does not do well with many products out there for facial skin care.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> The directions state not to use this mask more than once per week, and I can definitely see why.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve only used it twice, so I haven&#x27;t seen any miraculous results, although I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> first chance</li>
            <li> Noticed difference after first use.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so smooth and seems to clear blemishes.  </li>
            <li> High recommended product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and I am pleased with the results from it&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to work pretty well though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this is a big jar as now we&#x27;ll both be using it.</li>
            <li> Overall i&#x27;m satisfied with the price and product itself.</li>
            <li> I use several InstaNatural products and honestly love them all.</li>
            <li> First, I don&#x27;t like the gummy texture.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this mud mask was that it had no scent.</li>
            <li> does exactly what I need it to do</li>
            <li> I fell that my skin was protected and more dynamic.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many facial masks</li>
            <li> but I will definitely give it more time and give another review.</li>
            <li> but I am definitely a repeat customer!! :)</li>
            <li> and that is exactly how you should apply it.</li>
            <li> As of now it has done exactly what it says that it is suppose to do and will do.</li>
            <li> anymore I love this product I definitely recommend this to family and friends!</li>
            <li> On my first use I could feel the difference I give this product  a 5 star</li>
            <li> skin first before applying the mud mask.</li>
            <li> (Ignore the funny look, something about mud on my face spurred funny</li>
            <li> While the jar does say discontinue if redness or irritation occurs, I feel like there could have been more information regarding potential ingredients that people may react to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made me feel like there was no way to be 100% sure that this item hadn&#x27;t been used and returned or tampered with prior to receiving it.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products but this mud mask beats them all.</li>
            <li> I burned my thumb on hot metal, and out of curiosity I applied the mud.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it i broke out afterwards, but I think that it just brought a lot of impurities to the surface of my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I was a bit hesitant at first to purchase this product because of the price.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using this Facial Mask.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results of this facial mask.</li>
            <li> my skin was incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, neck and chest and get in a hot bath for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> and that was just the first use</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I wash my face first and then applied on my face.</li>
            <li> I wash my face first and then applied on my face.</li>
            <li> I love every second of using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This quantity allows for many weekly treatments for your face, back or where ever else you like to apply a mask!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny cause</li>
            <li> I love beauty products, especially face masks.  </li>
            <li> To make the mud more pliable, several organic ingredients like Shea Butter,  Sunflower Oil , Aloe Vera juice, Vegetable Glycerin, Jojoba Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, Calendula Oil and filtered Water have been added.</li>
            <li> When you first apply the mask it feels like applying pudding.</li>
            <li> I love skin care products, and especially masks.</li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed my skin hlowing and pores were tighter..</li>
            <li> first use and it reduced the sprouting of my acne</li>
            <li> I now use it weekly, wish I could use it more often but the instructions say only use once a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many masks from different companies.</li>
            <li> It did make my face a bit red for a bit, but I think that had more to do with the hot water and scrubbing it off.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try on my face first),</li>
            <li> I use this Facial Mask once a week, and I really, really love it.</li>

            <li> so I will use it a couple more times before I give a solid review.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Seems pretty good and isn&#x27;t harsh.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s only intended to use once a week</li>

            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth after I use this mask.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I used it on my chest and shoulders first.</li>
            <li> (oil first then my cera ve).</li>
            <li> I used this mask and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> no further this will make you love your skin again</li>
            <li> After ONLY 2 weeks, my acnes have reduced and my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> Most things make me break out, even when you would think there is no possible way for it to cause a reaction.</li>
            <li> Also putting it on is easier still and no weird smell.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling, soft, smooth, and even coloring.</li>
            <li> My face overall looked and felt better</li>
            <li> This seller did something none has done before and that is send an email PRIOR to the product coming explaining a bit more about it.</li>
            <li> I felt an immediate cooling sensation by the time I was putting the top back on and putting it away.</li>
            <li> and this was my first one.</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time I saw a drastic change in the size of my pimples.</li>
            <li> I really think it removed some of the toxens from my skin!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I use this mask twice per week and it makes my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask let me reset the clock and pretend I was a good girl about my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask let me reset the clock and pretend I was a good girl about my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> This dead sea mask is every bit as good as the masks I give in the spa.</li>
            <li> I find my face feeling very soft, clean and radiant after the mask and have been receiving compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> good stuff it performs as stated and this amount with only having to use once a week should last a very long time unless you use fore body as well of course,when it drys it kind of stiffen which can be a little mildly itchy kind of the effect of when your nose itches at the dentist because you can&#x27;t touch it but</li>
            <li> My skin tone was clearing up, blackheads less noticeable, and most important my skin feels hydrated duringthese colder months.</li>
            <li> When it starts to dry, it tightens so much your face kind of hurts.  </li>
            <li> It is a jelly consistency, a little cool on the skin at first, but very easy to apply and cover.</li>
            <li> the service is really great,even the product is not excellent for my face ,but the seller are so sweet and responsibility ,giving me full refund .i use five times not as good as i image,but just for me,maybe i am so special.</li>
            <li> But, overall it&#x27;s just a nice simple clean mask.</li>
            <li> When I found Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask at and exceptional price I had to jump on the offer, and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> The first time after leaving the Dead Sea Mud Mask for 20 minutes, I was left with a nice clean surface that was not over dry but had a nice clean sheen.</li>
            <li> Any ways other than that its amazing.</li>
            <li> The directions say to use this only once per week, so I might change my opinion of this the next time I use this, but I do feel like it absorbs the excess oil in the face, although there were no radical changes (my skin had been pretty good anyway when I was using the mask.)</li>
            <li> I am convinced this is going to last me for a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am completely satisfied and couple of my girlfriends who tried it LOVE it as well.</li>
            <li> Your skin will look very nice afterwards though, very dewy and new looking and your pores will be shrunken and less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much all of their products and they&#x27;re all super high quality.</li>
            <li> My skin looked so clean and clear when I washed it off.</li>
            <li> I applied the mask using an old brush, to get the perfect thin application.</li>
            <li> Clean, clear skin after using this product once a week.</li>
            <li> This product really makes my face feel extremely smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel soft and clean after using.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling SO clean and soft.</li>
            <li> This makes me feel so clean and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel so soft, clean and refreshed without stripping away everything or leaving a film.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face clean and soft.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed it off I was amazed how soft my skin was, and how clean it felt.</li>
            <li> It was interesting and actually made spreading the mask onto my face much easier.</li>
            <li> and I love that it is 100% natural because i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite of the entire product line.</li>
            <li> It works just as good or better than the expensive stuff that you can get in the mall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the mud mask only once  but really liked the results so far.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was how much product you received and you don&#x27;t use much in every application,I am pretty sure it will last me the 12 months of shelf</li>
            <li> I was fairly intrigued as I’ve never actually used a proper mud mask.  </li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask is renowned the world over as the most effective, all natural, skin-reviving facial mask available.</li>
            <li> It definitely left my face feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Makes my face super soft!</li>
            <li> After applying, skin feels super soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter and more oils during the hot humid months.</li>
            <li> I only use it once a week since it is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> This mask is the first mask I have ever been able to use that doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to erupt the day after use and doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> When we used it not only was the aroma a very sweet smell but</li>
            <li> Before receiving this product to review, I already had a positive opinion about the InstaNatural brand.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> What I love about InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask: It makes a great gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a gift for my wife, and here&#x27;s what she had to say about this Dead Sea Mud Mask:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed when I opened up the tub, there wasn&#x27;t any real smell to it.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated the amount that you get and the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use much which makes it quite a deal!  </li>
            <li> : Yes, it tightens up the skin and there is some itchiness and when it dries it looks pretty much as expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really feel like with a consistent use of this product they will be gone forever.</li>
            <li> but it went away pretty fast.</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks ago, I was given InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Natural Mineral Infused Dead Sea Mud Mask to try out for free in exchange for my 100% honest, unbiased opinion of the product.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on the whole time I am soaking in the tub then rinse it off when  I am ready to get out!</li>
            <li> It is a charcoal gray (not black or brown) color and smells unbelievably clean, considering it is made from earth.  </li>
            <li> Surprised to see full sized product.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN (like me) THEN DO NOT USE AS SPOT TREATMENT ONE DAY, AND FULL MASK</li>
            <li> As it is drying, I can visual it is pulling impurities from my skin, leaving me with a clean, fresh feel.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft and clean and really minimizes my pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be wind down in the evening with a mask without having to set foot in spa.</li>
            <li> My pores were much smaller and my skin was definitely more vibrant.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of removing the old dull tissue and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I heard dead sea products was good to use, but this is my 2nd dead sea product I&#x27;ve used and was not at all happy with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for something new to try, this might be worth it for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for something new to try, this might be worth it for you.</li>
            <li> and my skin feel super soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> The container is easy to open</li>
            <li> The thicker the application, the longer it takes to dry and the more effect it will have on your skin.  </li>
            <li> The mask will dry in about 10-15 minutes, do not leave it on more than that</li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s more watery consistency, I would say it takes closer to 15-20 minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li> i make sure it is dry</li>
            <li> but when all was said done my felt good, felt clean, but didn&#x27;t look red nor did it feel like it had been given harsh treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it once a week (mostly Fridays after a long work week to unwind haha).</li>
            <li> My super sensitive skin was not irritated at all in any area.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t sting or leave your face dry yet my oily skin has been much more manageable since I started using the product.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling smooth and refreshed after the first use.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sometimes dry and flaky but my skin feels more hydrated then before.</li>
            <li> I  had mine on for more than 10 minutes so that it could completely dry.</li>
            <li> and I have super sensitive skin and psoriasis.</li>
            <li> These ingredients make for a mud mask that has no smell and feels super soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Makes skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy enough (for a mud mask).  </li>
            <li> If you have a pimple, this mask will dry it out for sure.</li>
            <li> it gets the more it &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; from your pores and can dry your face out a bit leaving it flushed.</li>
            <li> I think if you used it more, it might dry out your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :) Not to be graphic, but I had an under the skin things which normally lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Made in the USA no animal testing and pure ingredients.</li>
            <li> This certainly takes the cake.</li>
            <li> I know for a fact that it has certainly tightened the skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> Because this is a large jar, I will not be needing to re-order for awhile.  </li>
            <li> It certainly does not.</li>
            <li> Have noticed my pores are not as large as before.</li>
            <li> GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;The container is a large 16 ounces</li>
            <li> this is certainly the one to choose.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Dead Sea Mud Mask and I love it!  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the less than $25 with FREE amazon shipping price tag!</li>
            <li> The jar is fine enough and large</li>
            <li> so it will last long, easy to apply and after it &#x27;s removed the skin feels really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I have used this mask 2 times now, and I can confidently say that this will really dry up that excess oil!</li>
            <li> It also claims to improve fine lines and wrinkles when used on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> First, I liked that this Insta Natural Dead Sea Mask only has about 10 ingredients and most of them are organic.</li>
            <li> I will use this for the next 2 weeks and see what results I get and am pretty hopeful AND excited because I KNOW the outcome is going to be</li>
            <li> Afterwards I found my face to be soft &amp; smooth &amp; clear!  </li>
            <li> It left my skin super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> You can use it on just your face or your entire body, and it&#x27;s supposed to help with blemishes or to reduce the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> Over all decent!</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of a trip to the spa - a very high end one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The mask rinsed off easily leaving my skin feeling refeshed, tight and clean.</li>
            <li> And this one left it feeling pretty clean.</li>
            <li> When I first opened up the jar, I didn&#x27;t have high hopes.</li>
            <li> It is good, but really hard to take off.</li>
            <li> In spite of that, it feels good going on, seems hard to get off</li>
            <li> I use the mask once a week as directed, but it feels so good when I use it that I can hardly wait for the week to go by so that I can use it again.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the mask I was surprised!!</li>
            <li> It did get a little warm and back to cool in the first 10 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> , This tells me at best, it surfaced off a few dead cells and just brighten my skin  up a touch.</li>
            <li> My skin felt amazing with it on, while it dried and after I took it off.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a huge bottle so it will last forever.</li>
            <li> and I actually didn’t need that much to get a smooth coverage.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in how it looked the next day.</li>
            <li> Being a person who uses mask regularly, this 100% natural-InstaNatural Dead Sea Mask is a welcome addition to my skin care arsenal.</li>
            <li> a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is calmed, soothed skin that&#x27;s ready to drink up any serum or moisturizer you use afterward.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural line is proving very</li>
            <li> I am not a mask expert, so I can&#x27;t really compare this to others.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> really sticky</li>
            <li> The mask works on absorbing toxins, excess oil, and dirt.</li>
            <li> The texture is very thickâ€”and can be messyâ€”but</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the size of the jar (16 oz.) is very generous</li>
            <li> I think I was expecting a really think clay type consistency</li>
            <li> You get so much in the jar</li>
            <li> so you get plenty of product and you do not need to use much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with mud masks</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very moist mask, in this</li>
            <li> It gives me a clean yet not dry after mask feel to my skin.</li>
            <li> I tend to get a bunch of cystic acne when I eat to much diary</li>
            <li> Also, my skin felt very itchy while it was drying.  </li>
            <li> there is really not any sent to it which i love about it</li>
            <li> After using this product, I continued on with my regular nighttime skincare routine, and my skin did not feel any drier or more irritated than before.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after washing the mask off and drying my face, I could feel and see my skin was more firm.</li>
            <li> It really rehabs my skin.</li>
            <li> It really cleans your pores.</li>
            <li> (It doesn&#x27;t take much.)</li>
            <li> Although the directions said that I could wear the mask for 10-15 minutes, I was ready to get it off after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this because of the oils in it (jojoba, etc), and to my surprise this works really well.</li>
            <li> If you purchase it, you really won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> It really tightens up your skin as it dries.</li>
            <li> received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li> received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li> I really like how it leaves my skin feeling after I use it.  </li>
            <li> but there is an unusual texture.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really  invigorating to the skin.</li>
            <li> Once a week application is what is recommended, and that really seems sufficient.  </li>
            <li> This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t feel drying.  </li>
            <li> Left my skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother, make up glides in without gooping into my poors etc.</li>
            <li> I expected it to have more salt in it.  </li>
            <li> which  now I don’t use as much makeup as before.</li>
            <li> Dont see much effects</li>
            <li> It really cleaned my skin and made it feel softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it works.  </li>
            <li> I am still learning what this product is capable of.  </li>
            <li> and then  I can&#x27;t really tell that it did anything.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very comparable to the products sold in the Malls here in the National Capital Region</li>
            <li> High recommendation from me!</li>
            <li> Anyways, I really wanted to treat my skin to something</li>
            <li> have started using it once a week, makes my skin feeling fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have really oily acne prone skin, but this has cured me of breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Actually I don&#x27;t really smell anything.</li>
            <li> Really wanted this to work with my skin.</li>
            <li> It rinses off really well with almost no traces on a toner pad.  </li>
            <li> It might be a bit too much for those skin types to handle.</li>
            <li> really irritate either,</li>
            <li> When I use to do a weekly mask, my skin didn&#x27;t break out as much.</li>
            <li> and it really cleans the pores.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It really does feel like impurities are being drawn out of the skin.  </li>
            <li> Wearing masks make me feel like I&#x27;m at the spa, but this mask really resembles the ones at the spa.</li>
            <li> it means there are no irritating perfumes added.</li>
            <li> all the dirt, gunk was washed off and my face was squeaky clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> Really looks like mud, but has no smell.  </li>
            <li> It is a real winner.</li>
            <li> it really improved my skin.</li>
            <li> My acne and blemishes has really disappeared.</li>
            <li> I really did like the texture and that it had no smell</li>
            <li> I CAN SEE SO MUCH DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN.</li>
            <li> And I really like how they keep in touch with you giving advice etc</li>
            <li> It has a really creamy texture while your putting it on, then once it starts to harden on your face, you can really feel it going to work.</li>
            <li> but there is no odor really at all.  </li>
            <li> I am not one to use masks much - just once and awhile, but I like this one.  </li>
            <li> The directions say to use it once a week to keep from drying out your face; however, I have found that using the mud on my blemishes (no matter their cause) dries them up much faster.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product weekly now for a month and really like its effect on my face.</li>
            <li> I was very ezcited to recieve this product for review.</li>
            <li> I am very happu</li>
            <li> so my skin takes a real beating, and this product is on my must-have list now.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t believe I paid so much money for a mask that has something like that in it.</li>
            <li> It really looks like mud.  </li>
            <li> I really want to like it..</li>
            <li> It was not irritating at all to my skin.</li>
            <li> This really pulls out the impurities.</li>
            <li> Skin definitely feels smooth after use.</li>
            <li> and when it was drying I noticed it was really working on my pores as I could see them all.  </li>
            <li> When I heard about this promotion the mask sounded promising.  </li>
            <li> A bonus was that the mask really didn&#x27;t have a smell, and the consistency was gel-like.</li>
            <li> I always use sebum absorbing paper to deal with it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li> but I think the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> There is so much product in the container,</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re really rubbing it in while also washing it off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and my skin looked brighter and softer after I took it off.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> thank you so much for it guys</li>
            <li> Works very well and tightens up the face.</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> It really helps keeping the breakout in control and helps prevent scarring.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> This mask was... intense.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask - Skin Cleaner is one of the better Mask I have ever used I just just love the way</li>
            <li> The consistency almost reminds me of a really dense chocolate pudding.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It had the same smooth moisturizing feel as Aloe Vera gel.</li>
            <li> and this really helps with the irritation from it.</li>
            <li> If you do that I would advise using a loffa to help rinse it off rather than a white or light colored wash cloth like it did.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> face feeling very soft&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take much to take it off</li>
            <li> Well you really don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li> It didn’t really have too much of a smell  to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I appreciate the short, pronounceable ingredient list, and that it is free of parabens.</li>
            <li> Nothing to bragg about really.</li>
            <li> My skin feels SO much softer after I use this mask.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brands and I have liked them all.</li>
            <li> Omg this mask left my skin so soft, I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use, apply, let dry completely and rinse off.</li>
            <li> Only tried it twice and so far, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Once dried, remove the mud mask by using warm water and circular motions.</li>
            <li> I put a thin layer over my skin per the directions, putting some more around my nose area, since I have more oil there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product complementary, but this is 100% my honest opinion and that in no way changed my opinion about the product (I have been a blogger for 2 yrs now, and have given good reviews &amp; bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basically workin with one wrinkle, right smack dab in the middle of my forehead, so I&#x27;ll be sure to update readers should the tone and texture show improvement from regular use of this mask.</li>
            <li> All natural defiantly a plus!!!</li>
            <li> But most of us don&#x27;t have the time or funds to go lay around a spa a few times a week, right?</li>
            <li> The reviews listed have clearly demonstrated how effective this mask can be for some people, however, they don&#x27;t showcase the other side of it as much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always willing to try a new product and when a friend recommended this to me, I thought hey, why not.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the mask starts to hurt if you leave it on too long which i love to do lol.</li>
            <li> Right after the first use I could see that areas with large pores looked slightly smaller in size.</li>
            <li> I definitely think this product is worth investing in!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other acne treatments and home remedies that didn&#x27;t give me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other masks that are more drying for this purpose, and I&#x27;d hoped this would be a replacement.  </li>
            <li> but I tough it out and the results seem pretty good.</li>
            <li> I really liked the Dead Sea Mud Mask, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Was refreshing untill 5 minutes later when it became to itchy to bare.</li>
            <li> It actually refined skin&#x27;s texture and leaves it hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li> it left my skin feeling amasing, clean and</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older, any blemish takes SO much longer to heal....</li>
            <li> It moisturized where I needed to moisturize, and I felt clean and refreshed where it was normally extra oily.</li>
            <li> You do not use a large amount each time so the Insta Natural Dead Sea Mud Mask is worth way more than priced.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dried, it&#x27;s very easy to rinse away.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin that is also severely dry and sensitive to most products.</li>
            <li> After I washed this off it did leave my skin feeling dry, but I used the retinol serum from the same company after and the dryness went away so had no problem with that as everyone should put on a nice moisturizer after a mask anyways.  </li>
            <li> What I love about this mask is that it&#x27;s natural, dries up acne and oil, but doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> The wonderful thing, is that you can feel the mask working its magic -- thanks to the tightening (and I mean tight) action it has when its dry.</li>
            <li> It is easy to spread and feels cool on your face, I used only two times so far since use only once a week.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing, just don&#x27;t overuse or it will cause excessive drying.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin, so it makes me wonder what exactly is in this.</li>
            <li> It never fails to leave my skin so soft and radiant.</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me for review purposes, as usual, I promise to give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Natural product that I don&#x27;t have to worry about on my skin or in the environment, thanks InstaNatrual!</li>
            <li> I first opened the jar, I was surprised at what the texture was.  </li>
            <li> It honestly looked like a  slick mud consistency.  </li>
            <li> This is my first mud mask and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t have a scent at all.</li>
            <li> The product comes in a rather large jar, so you are definitely getting your moneys  worth when you purchase from</li>
            <li> Much better than the $65 little jars from the high end beauty store!</li>
            <li> Leave skin feeling new!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a full facial cleanse and exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other mud masks that burn, but this one feels more gentle and did not burn my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While my experience with this mask was a good one, I do think people with dry skin need to be very careful when using this product.</li>
            <li> I love being able to bring the spa home to me since it&#x27;s so expensive to go.</li>
            <li> Just enough to open the top layer and pore and eliminate the dirt and oil improving your skin tone and leaving it smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> really enjoyed using the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask and really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older now</li>
            <li> I started by washing my face with mild soap or a simple face wash.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s a main stay and a must have).</li>
            <li> the redness has only mildly subsided.</li>
            <li> Being able to actually like the skin on my face has been a big life changer for me.  </li>
            <li> I have to use a decent amount to get what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended, make sure to tone after because there&#x27;s still some mud left after.</li>
            <li> The product dries quickly, and you definitely feel a pulling sensation as it does.  </li>
            <li> I just waited for the next week and applied it as a regular mask, and no problem! :)  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get a discount, but I stand by my review!</li>
            <li> It is really easy to apply, at first you will feel a little itchy but once its starts to harden it goes away.</li>
            <li> The results come down to a cool, fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin really soft, but be sure to moisturize after or you&#x27;ll feel dry because the clay is pulling the natural oils (and junk!)</li>
            <li> Immediately afterwards I ran my fingers over my face to find that every  single inch of my  skin was silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This mud mask contains Pure Dead Sea Mud, which has numerous minerals which are beneficial for our skin, especially magnesium which is a great anti-inflammatory.</li>
            <li> It is much better than trying to deal with the mess and rinsing in the sink.</li>
            <li> My skin is absolutely glowing and feels so soft!</li>
            <li> (Just make sure you screw the lid on really tight between uses to avoid drying it out.)</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels after this mask - its leaves it very smooth and soft but does not feel too tight like when I used the bentonite clay mask.  </li>

            <li> I am a natural redhead with moderately sensitive  to sensitive olive fair to pale skin.</li>
            <li> It dries on pretty stiff but was easy to work with and wash off.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed it off, my skin was so soft!!</li>
            <li> (I mean, hey, there is A LOT in this jar) and they absolutely love it as well!</li>
            <li> My 2 daughters that suffer from a little acne use it and love it.</li>
            <li> Of course, like most mask, it did itch a little while it was drying.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin feel extra clean and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> This mask is used like any other- applied to clean skin and left for 10-15 minutes to dry, then rinsed off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at how much stuff was coming out.</li>
            <li> Really cleared my skin, which is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I love this 100% natural face cleansing product made from real mud from the sacred Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> This mud mask really tightens up your skin and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> real action starts when it begin drying.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry my face, it just leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> i have a sensitive skin but this really works well for me.</li>
            <li> The product does tends to settle but I would considered this normal, so</li>
            <li> After few use I&#x27;m able to see results.</li>
            <li> Wow, far better than expected</li>
            <li> this is not my favorite InstNatural product, and I have tried a few.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> I read on InstaNatural&#x27;s site, that they do not recommend using the Dead Sea Mud Mask more than once a week........</li>
            <li> That is normal, and is where the mask got deeper into the skin pulling impurities out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask is virtually the same...and at a much better price point.  </li>
            <li> my oily acne prone skin feels fresh, my t-zone pores are noticeably smaller</li>
            <li> email instructions on how to use it, which I found to be very helpful, more so than trying to read the small texts off the jar</li>
            <li> so many of the masks that had heavy perfumes bother my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are better Dead Sea Masks out there.</li>
            <li> It was definitely a foreign feeling since it has been so long since I did one, but when I took it off, my face looked 100x better!</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using it, i feel it does help my face glow with a better complexion.</li>
            <li> I love this dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li> removing the Dead Sea Mud Mask which I love.</li>
            <li> For thousands of years the Dead Sea has attracted visitors who love to bathe in this salt lake, which is known for</li>
            <li> The face section dried faster, since it was a thinner layer, but the area around my noise took longer, since I put more there.</li>
            <li> I love this dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li> This product last a while so it worth it the money.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this Dead Sea mud.</li>
            <li> The latest item is the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Must try the Dead Sea Mud Mask... :)</li>
            <li> I love my Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> You get a 1lb tub of the Dead Sea Mud Mask and it&#x27;s filled to the brim!</li>
            <li> Have only had this product a short time, but I love the results thus far.  </li>
            <li> I seen this product while browsing one day and figured what&#x27;s one more thing to waste money on at this point</li>
            <li> Although its recommend for acne to detoxify, it leaves a good film of oil behind.</li>
            <li> Rinses well, not hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> It is always nice to have skin especially my nose with out black heads.</li>
            <li> and I have developed mild acne in the last year.</li>
            <li> It brings deep blackheads to the surface for easy extraction, even the ones that will challenge an esthetician during a facial.  </li>
            <li> it left it super soft.  </li>
            <li> Drying time is quick, and my face is left soft and smoothe.</li>
            <li> Left my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> was very excited to try this mud mask because it contains Dead Sea minerals.</li>
            <li> I actually like this mask, it was just right for me.</li>
            <li> The container states that it will take up to 15 minutes to dry- which is true.</li>
            <li> Make sure it&#x27;s dried completely before washing it off!</li>
            <li> It does get really tight on the skin, so make sure you don&#x27;t put it along the sensitive parts of your skin like under your eyes.</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes of it on my face, it dried nicely and was quick to wash off without a mess.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a fantastic treat for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I also like to use a little dab of it more frequently on that dreaded acne.  </li>
            <li> Also my makeup looks a lot better since my acne is becoming less noticeable since using Insta Natural dead sea mud mask.  </li>
            <li> and I new that it was working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live the MUD</li>
            <li> I found a new friend for my face.</li>
            <li> &amp; so I am sometimes reluctant to try new products.  </li>
            <li> I live in humid and tropical weather.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, when I see a new breakout, I apply the mask on the spot overnight.  </li>
            <li> I am new to using mud masks</li>
            <li> I use face mask, but it&#x27;s really hard to find one you really can love.</li>
            <li> With such a HUGE tub I&#x27;m not surprise if this mask will last for months.</li>
            <li> The container is huge and will last me forever, but I&#x27;d definitely repurchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge promoter of this mud mask, and will likely give it to several of my friends for upcoming birthdays.</li>
            <li> I do think that if I hadn&#x27;t continued on with my product routine, my skin probably would have felt super dry.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish were different is the cruelty free part of this product.</li>
            <li> We used this mud mask on his entire face and like me, his skin was left smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> 30 minutes later I had lovely pink skin.</li>
            <li> It starts to dry quickly and pulls the oil and dirt out of your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I think that it&#x27;s the next step in my beauty regime to keeping my face looking fresh and young.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling very soft, and new.</li>
            <li> My complexion is more radiant; in fact, I might even say it glows a little bit!  </li>
            <li> unlike most mud masks this one is very unusual where a tiny bit goes a long long way</li>
            <li> and it is something that does not need to be used very frequently.  </li>
            <li> but I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> With this mask, my skin was very soft and it didn&#x27;t leave my face shiny like some others.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It feels amazingly smooth and cooling and hydrating on your skin and can be easily smoothed over the face, neck, decolletage, upper back, shoulders - wherever you need a little help on your body.</li>
            <li> you should really give this a try, especially if you have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use many other products!</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no mixing, or any type of special prep before applying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually wearing this mask right now, and I happened to get an email asking how I like the mud so far.</li>
            <li> For $25, you get a GIANT 16 oz jar - made from pure dead sea mud, organic shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera, and more.  </li>
            <li> It also makes your skin super soft and in the long run helps to restore an even skin tone for a smoother complexion.</li>
            <li> That is a weird combination of issues, so it is amazing that one product works well for all!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for almost 3 months now (2 times/week for the first month and 1 time/week for the next 2 months)</li>
            <li> I have some first trimester of pregnancy acne, so I used this mask and the next morning</li>
            <li> All natural and organic!</li>
            <li> Love Dead Sea Minerals, always do wonders for my skin!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> It works on the really small blackheads and prevents more from forming.</li>
            <li> My blackheads are pretty deep, they are not the ones that can be pulled off with those nose strips</li>
            <li> My face is soft and supple after using it!</li>
            <li> Now you exactly can tell where I put the product on my face as all the edges are red...</li>
            <li> I am not sure why, but I find rubbing mud or clay on my face than washing it off strangely satisfying.</li>
            <li> When I first opened up the jar, I was like gross...</li>
            <li> It is all natural, which is something I look for in skincare, but also helps maintain the clarity and clearness of my skin!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> So far, I like it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty big jar, 16 oz.  </li>
            <li> ; it is 100% natural, it is infused with minerals and it detoxifies &amp; purifies your skin!  </li>
            <li> I find that it brings the product back into the first start where you put it on</li>
            <li> Be aware that when this mask dries, you can definitely feel a pulling sensation on your skin.</li>
            <li> However, I encourage being aware that this product is not for daily use, as it may dry/irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a pretty bid tub; bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed is that my pores looked smaller.</li>
            <li> I almost felt that l wasn’t getting enough all over my face at first.  </li>
            <li> The first two times I used this I left it on longer than I should have</li>
            <li> I used this last night for the first time.  </li>
            <li> This mask is a natural and effective facial skin treatment formulated with Dead Sea Mud.</li>
            <li> So , the only thing I can tell in terms of skin improvement would just be the overall clean skin feeling after removing it</li>
            <li> and I still like a mud pack a few times a year as it really does make your skin feel clean.</li>
            <li> It does work, my pores have shrinks down a lot, my face feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t get this if you have very dry skin, as it really pulls the skin pretty taught when you have it on.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in my skin overall as I use other facial masks during the week, but it feels amazing when applied.</li>
            <li> Also, make super sure you have a really good moisturizer on afterwards and this will dry you out extremely badly!</li>
            <li> , this is huge size and will last long time.</li>
            <li> I now use just one layer that dries in less than 15 minutes and does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask was easy to spread over my face.</li>
            <li> I feel like after the first treatment that my pores were smaller and skin firmer, and I&#x27;m in my early fifties, with aging skin problems.</li>
            <li> Finally, at 37 years old, I&#x27;ve found something that really works on my break outs!  </li>
            <li> the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask goes a long way and let&#x27;s you treat your skin to some nice pampering.</li>
            <li> the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask goes a long way and let&#x27;s you treat your skin to some nice pampering.</li>
            <li> The product is good but it dried my face and created  dark patches on my face.</li>
            <li> The size is very large so it lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels so soft and looks so clear, almost glowing afterwards!  </li>
            <li> Helped my 10 year old out with some minor blemished skin and left our faces smooth.</li>
            <li> mud mask should feel cooling and soothing to the skin at first, but should then quickly start to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;Allow the mud mask to dry for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I live in an area that is very humid in the summer, makes me feel oil and greasy on nose and upper cheeks.</li>
            <li> This is a huge jar so it will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I applied this amazing Dead Sea Mud Mask to my face, I let is sit on my face for 15 minutes so it would dry.</li>
            <li> and I find that InstaNaturals price gives you more product for the same or less.  </li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for a dollar or less using amazingdealsgroup.com.</li>
            <li> Instead of making their faces softer and have less acne, like the product reviews had mentioned, it made both of them break out and have rougher more red skin.</li>
            <li> mud mask is green, soft and easy to apply to your face.</li>
            <li> I typically dry out on my cheeks, leaving my T zone oily, but this mask helped to even it out slowly, but with good improvement after three uses.  </li>
            <li> It looks fine because its dead sea mud</li>
            <li> it is a large quantity that will last quite a while for the price.  </li>
            <li> Large container, enough to share and still have plenty.  </li>
            <li> It certainly isn’t a one use mask, in fact I think that this will probably last me all year.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a large jar that will easily last over 6 months.</li>
            <li> The large jar should last quite a while!</li>
            <li> and you can see it come right back to live mix or well mixed mask for application.</li>
            <li> Very thick, but works nice</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was a reaction to the mask, but more of a reaction to being scrubbed since I gave myself a facial while testing this product and the exfoliant may have irritated my skin a little.</li>
            <li> It has served me well for many years, but now, in my mid-thirties, my skin is looking a bit dull.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure my skin has felt that smooth since before pre-teen acne hit me in Jr. High.  </li>
            <li> and I can clearly say that my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> Not messy comes already mixed and ready to use.</li>
            <li> The pores on my nose were less noticeable, and the surface of my skin felt soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it to spot it on pimples and this helps clear it within a day.</li>
            <li> It was clear from how it felt after the 15 minutes that it was time to wash it off.</li>
            <li> The directions aren&#x27;t clear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing the Dead Sea mud mask from my face, it felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and after you take it off your face appears clear.</li>
            <li> It also helps to clear pimples and blackheads, and restore an even skin tone and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> It has also helped clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li> So far I have no complaints about any of their skin care products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very emollient, if there is such a thing, for a clay mask.</li>
            <li> Once I cleansed my face, it felt soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> So far, I have had no issues with any of the InstaNatural products that I have reviewed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steven opted not to try it with me one night off, I&#x27;m still going to see if he will after I&#x27;ve posted this review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve talked to him about the benefits of it, but he&#x27;s shied away so far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this mud mask did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> The smell is none existent, so if your sensitive to smell this factor would be in your favor.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I have a natural pink/red undertone to my skin as well as acne prone.</li>
            <li> It does not have a scent at all as far as what I can tell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in my face.</li>
            <li> After I wash this off my face, my skin looks brighter and feels really soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when does mud ever look good?&lt;br /&gt;The mask is an all natural detoxifier.</li>
            <li> I have a spa night 2 or 3 times a week with my 75 year old grandma.</li>
            <li> i think my skin is just to sensitive for this.</li>
            <li> Makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li> I have only done my face but will be doing my whole body</li>
            <li> I may add to this review later to let you all know if it really is helping with the acne.</li>
            <li> So far my skin looks healthier and feels softer.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any real changes in my skin or anything substantially different from any drug store face mask.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of natural ingredience.</li>
            <li> so far so will continue to do my once a week treatment to see if there is any difference.</li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> I went through two washcloths to get it completely off.  </li>
            <li> MY SKIN FEELS SO SOFT AND</li>
            <li> My face and neck feel so soft after using this.  </li>
            <li> The color completely changed after applying the mask.</li>
            <li> It also seems to leave my face feeling soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin -</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients soften my skin and leave it feeling refreshed and my pores tightened.</li>
            <li> My face feels wicked soft for hours after I use</li>
            <li> The mask is 100% Natural and infused with minerals.</li>
            <li> If applying on the face, avoid the eye and lip areas and any areas you may be sensitive to over-drying.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, so I left the mask on for about 15 - 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels baby soft and looks rejuvenated after each use.</li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s too early to make a comment if it&#x27;s working or not</li>
            <li> I even use it on my arthritic shoulder to naturally help pull out toxins and sooth that area.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and refreshed like nothing else.</li>
            <li> Soft natural smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to see any results</li>
            <li> (I have really sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need all that much for your entire face.</li>
            <li> The mud is soft and non-gritty.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and refreshed afterward.</li>
            <li> I also wouldn&#x27;t have considered myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> and i have to say that i am completely amazed with this mask.</li>
            <li> For the record, I have 31 year old skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel so smooth without being harsh on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> have combo skin that leans sensitive plus acne.  </li>
            <li> Least favorite of the instranatural products.  </li>
            <li> My skin becomes so soft after washing the mud mask off.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial mask product.</li>
            <li> It was not harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Overall very content with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright so far.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week and makes my skin so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> So far used it twice and both times saw immediate results.</li>
            <li> I noticed improvements in problem areas on my face, and I am surprised with how thorough this mask cleanses.</li>
            <li> I recommend this line to anyone with combination and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It works wonders and also makes my face feel smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> my skin has and reduces my pore size by a considerable amount.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does not bother me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made100% Natural  </li>
            <li> I had a natural glow on face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although i do not like the feeling mud masks give my face, it really surprised me how well it took to my skin type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made100% Natural in a 16 oz.</li>
            <li> I used Insta Natural serum afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Yes, for one I like spa time at home, because I never have enough time to make an appointment at a real spa.</li>
            <li> Yes, for one I like spa time at home, because I never have enough time to make an appointment at a real spa.</li>
            <li> Also, I had the piece of mind of knowing that I was putting all natural ingredients into my skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn’t recommend it to people with sensitive skin, but I would recommend it to LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE.</li>
            <li> Although, you do not have to apply it under your nose and it is advised to not get this anywhere near your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it dries, the color changes to a light green and does not fall off your face either.</li>
            <li> and once I was it off, my face is so soft.</li>
            <li> SO MOISTURE AND SOFT AFTER USE IT.</li>
            <li> Not harsh on the skin</li>
            <li> This mask has changed my face completely.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Not too drying, but pulls out a lot of old oil and dirt that clogs pores.</li>
            <li> I have semi sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with eczema problems</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin stay away from it.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is 100 natural detoxifier and purifier that come from sea.</li>
            <li> and I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and did not have any reactions to it.</li>
            <li> Jar was filled to the top so it will last you quite some time as you will only need a thin layer for an application.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my face was soft and smoother than what it was before.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell of it, and it works sufficiently so far.</li>
            <li> I could feel my face firming, and my pore tightening up before the mask had completely</li>
            <li> AND it surprised me.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and not so oily afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have slightly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a product to invest in and it can be really beneficial to your skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin really soft</li>
            <li> so my 15 year old doesn&#x27;t swipe it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice so far in the two weeks since it arrived in the mail.</li>
            <li> So far, I like this.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels so soft once the mask  is used.  </li>
            <li> My sister is now ordering some because of how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, which is a must in my book.</li>
            <li> face felt really soft and supple after the mask.</li>
            <li> Moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I use this mask once a week for 15-20 minutes and it leaves my skin feeling extremely soft.</li>
            <li> After I use it on my face, it makes my face feel soft.</li>
            <li> I love how this leaves my face, it gets rid of pimples (at least for me) and makes my face clearer.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week and have noticed my face appearing even toned and soft.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so soft and moisturized, I was really pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this twice in the duration of the time of owning it and it hasn&#x27;t caused an skin irritation.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really soft after I&#x27;ve taken it off as well.</li>
            <li> I really love the dead sea mud facial masks.</li>
            <li> I love all that dead sea minerals do for my skin, and will definitely be keeping some of this mud mask on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love anything dead sea mud related.</li>
            <li> Fun to use with the &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; big enough you can use with others.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS INSTANATURAL DEAD SEA MUD FACIAL MASK.  </li>
            <li> InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is like having your own private spa at home!</li>
            <li> The fact, this mud comes from the Dead Sea with all its therapeutic properties entices me even more to incorporate it into my regular skin regiment.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea contains many minerals beneficial to the skin, such as magnesium, sodium, bromine, potassium and calcium.</li>
            <li> I used this once a week for the last few weeks and have felt my skin get a better complexion.</li>
            <li> I will update after a few more uses since you can only use it once</li>
            <li> not as thick as we expected but seem good.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my two daughters did not have a good experience and they will no longer use it.</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t muddy, it&#x27;s kind thin.</li>
            <li> It dries better if you don&#x27;t put it on too thick.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask is very easy to apply, not too dry or sandy.</li>
            <li> It also takes very little to cover my whole face, so this jar should last a nice long time!</li>
            <li> I mean that it contains a great deal of moisture for in the short time leaving it on my shin, it does not harden or become a shell whatsoever, wet mask.</li>
            <li> This mask definitely feels like it cleans my pores, but it is very itchy and leaves my skin pretty dry once I near the end of the 10-15 minutes that I have it on.</li>
            <li> Scared to use it as lid had been placed back on w an apparent attempt to real seal product to look new</li>
            <li> My skin felt tight and clean.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and tight.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin pretty dry</li>
            <li> Not to mention it gets the bathtub full of black when you are rinsing it off.  </li>
            <li> you might have a little bit more of a hard time removing it, but once you do make sure to moisturize your face after because this product does tend to dry out your face.</li>
            <li> It came off easily with water but was very messy.</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommended, especially for anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS EASY TO USE MASK AND VERY FIRM.  </li>
            <li> The only that I didn&#x27;t like was that since I have more dry skin then oily my face felt very dry.</li>
            <li> For those with dry skin, I would be a bit careful because of the salt in the product, but it has many beneficial factors that are worth looking into, and purchasing the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful, just tight.</li>
            <li> the directions only suggest 1 time a week because I want to live in this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am so serious when I tell you this mask is outstanding.</li>
            <li> A serious favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking locally for a decent mud mask for me</li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed my skin was a bit softer than prior to using, but it was after the third application that I truly noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I definitely suggest doing it only once a week, as its pretty drying for your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty big container and it seems to last for quite a bit of uses.</li>
            <li> Like other InstaNatural products, it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful toxins like so many other companies use.</li>
            <li> I used this last night for the first time and it left my face radiant and clearer from blemishes and blackheads as soon as I wiped it off.</li>
            <li> First of all I barely ever write reviews especially when products just meet expectations or a little under, but this product is worth the time as it exceed way beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a new addition to your facial routine and are looking for an all natural face mask</li>
            <li> Pat dry with clean, dry cloth.</li>
            <li> I now can wear less makeup and even feel comfortable wearing my hair out of my face on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Well now, with this Dead Sea Mud Mask, in less than 15 minutes, you can do your own mud mask spa day at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This very large container will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> My face is so smooth afterwards - no more blackheads.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it much - and often go long periods of time without using it.</li>
            <li> With some other mud mask products on the market, you can see the excess oil drawn out from the wet-looking spots on your pores when the mask has tried to a light grey color on the rest of your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave it on long as it would be very over drying.</li>
            <li> It really made my chin break out into really strange bumps.</li>
            <li> Sensation is soothing and cool, I have noticed a difference in just a few uses in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> One full sized mask contains 16 ounces of the Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> I liked that it didnt make my skin feel tight when it dried.</li>
            <li> It is a very large jar that will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> This 16 oz jar is a great value due to the fact that you only need to use a thin coat per application.</li>
            <li> Very shortly after my review was posted I heard from the vendor who apologized and is sending me a new jar to replace the damaged one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> I am such a fan of InstaNatural and will continue using and trying out new products.</li>
            <li> Ended up giving me 4 new zits on my forehead the next day.</li>
            <li> Tried it to compare to the borghese fango mask, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast.</li>
            <li> But you can really feel it when it starts to dry and tighten the skin..</li>
            <li> I find that if you put too much on, it will not fully dry in the time that it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like it could even dry out if it wanted to - there is something really moisture-rich and hydrating about the mask consistency.  </li>
            <li> My cheek looked promising initially as my pores appeared smaller.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mask is intense, almost too intense for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very generous amout and I would say that it will last two to three months because you only use it about once  a week.</li>
            <li> When I opened the item it doesn&#x27;t appear to be completely filled, about 1/3 of the facial mask was missing.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin incredibly soft immediately after use, and it has helped clear up my horrible pregnancy breakouts :) love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool because it&#x27;s almost like a gel infused with mud that goes on clear and looks like dried mud after it dries!</li>
            <li> I am African-American, have sensitive skin, and I am 36 years old next week.  </li>
            <li> InstaNatural Dead Sea mask is a worthy entry into the clay mask line.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask arrived quickly and packaged well to prevent damage.</li>
            <li> It dried quickly on my face</li>
            <li> The creamy mask is thick, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I always have a small pimple or little blackhead that is trying to become more than what it really is</li>
            <li> I always have a small pimple or little blackhead that is trying to become more than what it really is</li>
            <li> My pores were noticeably smaller and my skin was very soft after using.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve only used it once as once a week is what was recommended) and my very sensitive skin reacted well to Insta Naturals Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> but this disappeared within 10 minutes and it left me with very soft skin.  </li>
            <li> it left my skin feeling very soft after I had it on there for about 10/13 mins.</li>
            <li> It left my skin very soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li> This product (alongside with other products from InstaNatural) was my first purchase ever</li>
            <li> I mean what can I say other than I love it?!?</li>
            <li> I was asked to try out the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Musk, I was very interested to see for myself</li>
            <li> I’ve only ever done the peel off cucumber style masks before and the oatmeal one from Lush!  </li>
            <li> have very sensitive, dry to combo skin, and I&#x27;m starting to get older, so if that sounds like you, this will help a lot.</li>
            <li> i have occasional breakouts around period time, but for the most part, it&#x27;s prettly subtle.</li>
            <li> Received this product very quickly and am very anxious to use it.</li>
            <li> The mud is not too hard to smooth over your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it’s really hard to fit spa time in let alone</li>
            <li> Plus the tub is huge, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not suppose to touch your skin in general but after I use the mask all I want to do</li>
            <li> - I personally use it to help restore moisture and at times, clear up acne.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any long lasting effects as a bought it for pore shrinkage.</li>
            <li> only used it once so far.  </li>
            <li> My face feels really soft the next day after I apply lotion.</li>
            <li> Try it and you will thank me in the near future!</li>
            <li> Since I have a sensitive skin, I only leave it on for 10 minutes before rinsing it</li>
            <li> The mud mask seems to restore moisture naturally without actually drying your skin out.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin deep- cleansed and feeling soft and</li>
            <li> Not only was it gental enough for her skin, but it left mine feeling smoother, softer, and so much healthier.</li>
            <li> and it left it feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> Pores being smaller is a plus for me as I am at he 40 year old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> She said it definitely reduced redness and made her skin soft.</li>
            <li> Indulge your skin with the proper natural care that&#x27;s my motto</li>
            <li> I avoid any sensitive area such as my eye one.</li>
            <li> Makes my fave soft and looks like I just rexived a facial.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling soft and</li>
            <li> Not only is this an all natural product, but they use organic sources of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> It has all natural ingredients and you get a really big tub of it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply the mud mask to your whole face, being careful not to get it in your eyes or lips.  </li>
            <li> It takes roughly 10 - 15 minutes and you can feel it really tightening during that</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far.  </li>
            <li> My skin becomes soft and radiated and remains that way until the next use.</li>
            <li> I am quite surprised at how big the tub is compared to masks that I’ve bought before.  </li>
            <li> Apply it to your whole face (be careful of your eyes/lips) and leave it on for 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> I have only done one treatment, but had no adverse reactions, and I have fairly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My face actually feels soft and tingly</li>
            <li> My daughters and I added this to our skincare regimine and have noticed a marked changed in our skin with only two applications.</li>
            <li> not only was my skin soft and supple</li>
            <li> The size of the container really surprised me, I was expecting the container to be smaller.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and my pores appeared smaller.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin on my face seem fresh and firm after using.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I glopped on two layers because the first layer didn&#x27;t seem to be thick enough to work well.</li>
            <li> Right after applying it I can feel the cooling sensation and little tingling on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who had mild acne when younger and used to use inexpensive mud packs (not the expensive Dead Sea brands) and liked the way they work.</li>
            <li> firmed the skin which helps withe large pores looseness and other problems.</li>
            <li> Do make sure to use a thin layer otherwise it may not dry as it should.</li>
            <li> You just apply a thin layer, let dry for 10-15 minutes and rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li> I search for products made with all natural ingredients and with the absence of ingredients that I can&#x27;t even pronounce.</li>
            <li> My pores are a lot smaller, my skin is looking younger and my acne is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> Removes dull looking texture to reveal clean pores and brighter looking skin.</li>
            <li> I actually sent it back because the jar was only half full.</li>
            <li> but I tend to do one weekly incorporating all my skin and not limited to just the face.</li>
            <li> Plus, the jar is large enough to last a really long time!!</li>
            <li> This really is the holy grail of all masks, and the massive jar will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I survived, and the picture shows how the dry part is a light gray, while the wet part looks like the wet product before application.</li>
            <li> This has helped relieve the red, irritated blemishes my teen has developed.</li>
            <li> It works well enough that you would only need to use it once maybe twice per week depending on how sensitive and oily your skin is.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the mask seems pretty thin when it&#x27;s first applied.</li>
            <li> The only thing that drove me over the edge was the itching, but as a weekly or bi-weekly treatment, the benefit is worth the few minutes of itching.</li>
            <li> This particular mask is a wet mask, as opposed to others that are powdery and have to mix with water.  </li>
            <li> When I first put this on, I thought it was really thin and wasn&#x27;t going to do much, but it tightened my face like you wouldn&#x27;t believe!  </li>
            <li> It has a natural dark mud color, thanks to the pure dead sea mud, and it also contains organic Shea butter, sunflower oil, Aloe Vera juice, and jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I look like I&#x27;ve gone outside for too long with sunglasses on as there&#x27;s a distinct line around where I stopped the product under my eyes and other areas.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, it began to tingle a little</li>
            <li> and I find it to not be nearly as good as other Dead Sea mask that I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Only a thin layer of this very unique textured mud does the trick.</li>
            <li> It is a very light mask - swipes on skin smoothly and easily - not your typical thick, dry, cakey mud mask.  </li>
            <li> This time though, i put way too much on my face and it took a long time to dry out.</li>
            <li> I was slightly worried at first as my face was quite red</li>
            <li> The next morning the bumps I had were barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> My daily facial care routine is simple; Dove sensitive skin soap and a moisturizer with SPF.  </li>
            <li> damaged seal..appears to have been used prior to shipping hole punctured torn open in middle directly in seal inside under lid w some leakage all around inside of jar.</li>
            <li> I just received my package a few days ago and had to try it the first night.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this product, is it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of weird smell like some mud masks I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no icky mud smell, just be really careful to keep it out of your eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> My ideal Friday night: glass of wine, InstaNatural Dead Sea mask, and a cheesy celeb magazine!</li>
            <li> It was less muddy and more gelatinous, which was slightly strange, but it made application a little bit easier.</li>
            <li> This does not smell bad though and feels pretty good on your face its just the odd hand feel that gets to me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out the face too much and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> was a little skeptical at first, very light, water based..</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in a very long time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry my face out and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> caused me to break out, I have dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Not recommend for dry skins and patch test on sensitive skins to prevent irritation.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive or dry skin, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> would not, however, recommend this product to someone with naturally dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask about three times over the past week and my skin has really started to clear up.</li>
            <li> Made my face itch the first few times but after several uses the itching stopped.  </li>
            <li> I felt so pampered the first time I used InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask.  </li>
            <li> I have compared InstaNaturals price line on different all natural facial products to other all natural products I have tried</li>
            <li> and I may have put a little much on because it took a while to dry completely;</li>
            <li> the 15 minutes was over and the mud was dry and cracking, I grabbed a wet wash cloth and gently rubbed off the mud.</li>
            <li> One tip I can give you, is if you have sensitive skin, to let the mask only partially dry before removing as the drier</li>
            <li> My skin feels super soft after using it and I don&#x27;t find that it&#x27;s irritating at all</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far, but just after a single use I notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this line of products a few months ago after reading several positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Mask goes on easily and dried within ten minutes.  </li>
            <li> It will last me at least six months (or maybe less :))</li>
            <li> The  ingredients in this mask are pure dead sea mud, organic shea butter, organic jojoba oil, organic aloe vera juice, organic calendula oil, and hickory bark extract.</li>
            <li> You only need a little for your whole face and neck area.  </li>
            <li> My face felt so much smoother immediately after, and my pores were a little smaller.</li>
            <li> My skin feels deep down clean after using InstaNature&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask.  </li>
            <li> But other then that it left my skin feeling soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other mud masks that were super messy and actually clogged the drain.</li>
            <li> Note, use very sparingly so that you have a only a super thin layer or it will take a long long time to dry.</li>
            <li> The jar is a VERY large 16 ounces, so I have no doubt this will last me for at least the next 6 months using it twice a week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it irritating like most people had mentioned in other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face itchy or red at all.</li>
            <li> As expected, the mask gets tight when drying, but not uncomfortable for me.</li>
            <li> We let it dry completely, it took closer to 20mins for the masks to dry.</li>
            <li> Than I continue with the other products that I have purchased also from Insta Natural.</li>
            <li> I think this is due to the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin to other product</li>
            <li> another product that I can&#x27;t use due to my sensitive skin.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> a thin layer of mud mask to clean skin.</li>
            <li> use this product once a week, and just apply a thin layer to clean skin, then let it sit for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The instructions state to apply a thin layer on clean skin and leave on for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> (my usual go to place is Lush as I am a fan of natural ingredients/organic masks).  </li>
            <li> One of the reasons being that they come in small size tube or jar and not enough to apply to whole body.</li>
            <li> Although the color of the product is a bit weird, I love how it doesnt have a strange scent.</li>
            <li> You only use it once a week, so the container will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried using different moisturizers but their effect doesn’t last for long time.</li>
            <li> There is no clear plastic wrapping around the outside of the jar to ensure that the product hasn&#x27;t potentially been tampered with.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural 100% Natural Mineral Infused Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask Holistic Detoxifier &amp; Purifier is made with pure Dead Sea mud.</li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way and the product should last a long time because they give you so much.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does contain Pure Dead Sea Mud!</li>
            <li> Depending on how much or how little you use, the dry time will vary.</li>
            <li> I typically have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Dead Sea Mud Mask to anyone that asked and even to strangers in a passing conversation.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take a long time to dry and harden, but not super fast either.</li>
            <li> Anyways, the mask turns to a much lighter green color when it is dry.  </li>
            <li> , it need about 15 minutes to dry completely than wash it off carefully.</li>
            <li> It definitely has a drying and pulling sensation after a few minutes when applied, but as my skin is very clear, it doesn&#x27;t irritate any.</li>
            <li> I believe it makes my pores visibly smaller, but I don&#x27;t know how long that effect lasts.</li>
            <li> Since I haven&#x27;t used it for a long time (having received it recently)</li>
            <li> As I only use this one about once a week, I can attest to the long term benefits.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m starting the healing process with my troubling skin by useing Dead sea mud mask, so far it has left my skins feeing</li>
            <li> , so 16 oz will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> so it was thick at first.</li>
            <li> It takes longer than expected to dry (and I live in a very dry climate), so I have to give myself an extra ten minutes to allow for dry time.</li>
            <li> There was not a weird smell from this product which seems odd since so many mud mask do have a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and did get a little red after I used the mask</li>
            <li> It stings a little during the drying time, so I only let it stay on my sensitive skin for about 6 min.</li>
            <li> This jar will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used masks for years, that clear my skin, make pores seem less noticeable, etc.  </li>
            <li> Put it on, let it dry, make faces in the mirror to crack the clay, then rinse (#3 isn&#x27;t necessary, but who can resist?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this if you have problems with dry oily skin.</li>
            <li> but it actually helped to dry them out.</li>
            <li> I left the mask on for 20 minutes, however the directions state for 10 to 15 minutes until dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently washed this mask off of my face and have never wished more for a cold bucket of water to dunk my face in.</li>
            <li> I tried this a week later and did not let it completely dry.</li>
            <li> The double layers took about 30 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> I smeared it around my eyes, forehead, cheeks, nose, chin and neck, sat back and waited for the mud to dry.</li>
            <li> Gave it enough time to dry but not start to crack and rinsed it out with warm/cool water.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of minutes, the mask started to dry and as this happened I could feel my skin starting to tighten.  </li>
            <li> The next step is to let dry for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend  to get over dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I used it after cleansing my face and left it to dry.</li>
            <li> However, the mask only exacerbated the redness and dried out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was completely amazed after I used it, a few days later...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural and doesn&#x27;t have any heavy smell.</li>
            <li> &amp; I still struggle with acne, for crying out loud!  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend  this to anyone who wants a once a week facial with a lot of skin benefits, can&#x27;t go wrong with 100% natural.</li>
            <li> The larger ones shrank to half its size and the smaller ones disappeared the next day!</li>
            <li> Most other masks that I have used in the past were hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> A little messy on my first once you figure it out.</li>
            <li> On the second week of application, the main difference was that I did not experience any break-outs, which is a little odd for me.</li>
            <li> On the second week of application, the main difference was that I did not experience any break-outs, which is a little odd for me.</li>
            <li> Many mud masks either have a very unpleasant odor or they add so much fragrance to it to mask the scent it irritates you.</li>
            <li> It is almost a dark green brownish color and a bit grainy but not so much that you feel like your scratching your skin apart.</li>
            <li> Sound weird</li>
            <li> I have no idea why I took so long to use it.</li>
            <li> but I have a long way to go</li>
            <li> Definitely works as expected.</li>
            <li> and as it dried it felt just like the old ones drying</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what long term effects it has.</li>
            <li> I felt some tingling and didn&#x27;t keep it on for too long</li>
            <li> I break out a long my jaw line and after using this one time, I could see a difference.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I&#x27;d not completely washed the product off after looking in my magnifying mirror and saw that there was still &#x27;mud&#x27; in some of my pores that made them look like blackheads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Dead Sea Mud Mask that was sent to me by Insta Natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for so long.  </li>
            <li> I like that this Mask contains A blend of Organic Shea Butter, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Aloe Vera, Which in turn will nourish and moisturize the skin in the long run.</li>
            <li> It is said in the Bible that King David would spend time at this body of water, because even so long ago this place was considered something like a health resort.</li>
            <li> This mask is an all- natural detox and purifier for your skin that comes from the dead sea.</li>
            <li> only used it a few times so far, not much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of face masks</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask is 100% Natural and in a 16 oz container.</li>
            <li> then it has been in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Apply a thin layer to your face/ body, it&#x27;s a thin dark mud mask, it dries quickly &amp; leaves a cool feeling whilst drying and after removing.</li>
            <li> The seal was already broken when I got this product and the jar seemed only half full.</li>
            <li> I showered fast, washed my face and put a little bit on, did a little house work</li>
            <li> I was surprised to experience a tame cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> - I have used dead sea mud mask&#x27;s before, but with my sensitive skin, I have always had so sort of reaction- dry skin, itchy skin, red skin, etc, but with InstaNatural&#x27;s mask, I didn&#x27;t have any reactions, except for a little bit of tingling on my upper cheek area.</li>
            <li> It is a large jar and you only put on a thin layer each time.  </li>
            <li> This mask is also different in feeling and smell than any other mask i have ever used.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the container, I was expecting this mask to be very similar to other mud or clay masks</li>
            <li> The mask takes care of the extra oil on your face, dirt and other toxins inside your body.</li>
            <li> I like this mud mask because it&#x27;s different than other mud or clay masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with masks of all kinds, and was so excited when I got a coupon code</li>
            <li> Usually other facial products agitate my skin and this didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This mask beats any of the other masks that I&#x27;ve tried, even the tiny ones that cost $60</li>
            <li> With other products, I either get very red irritated skin</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to see long term how it helps with blackheads too!</li>
            <li> I can’t remember any other mask I have tried starting to itch once you are nearing the wash off time.</li>
            <li> I can’t remember any other mask I have tried starting to itch once you are nearing the wash off time.</li>
            <li> It only takes a fraction of the time compared to other masks to dry.</li>
            <li> After I apply it and allow it to dry for about 15mins</li>
            <li> It does get dry and tingly, but it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite for the fact it is a mud mask that supposed to dry up and absorb moisture, it doesn&#x27;t dry up or irritate my skin.</li>

            <li> DO NOT BUY if u have dry skin problems</li>
            <li> I am saving this for during the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t as dry.</li>
            <li> I spread it on, let it dry, and when I rinsed it off, my skin did feel softer and happier.</li>
            <li> but I needed to wait for it to dry all over my face before I could wipe it off...</li>

            <li> Leaving us Michiganders with that hideous winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and it should all dry within 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is my second Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask.</li>
            <li> Ive tried several different ones you will notice a difference in a few days of using this.</li>
            <li> I only use masks once a week, so I will come back and update in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> In my skins defense though, the last few days have been under ten degrees.</li>
            <li> No new acne break</li>
            <li> other thing I really like about this product is that it&#x27;s not super messy.</li>
            <li> I may sound a little dramatic here</li>
            <li> I usually have clear skin, but under stress can be prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and my pores are so small after using this mask.  </li>
            <li> I just applied the mud directly to my face and just rubbed it in using small circular motions to evenly coat</li>
            <li> Not safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> consistency is not too thick like some mud/clay mask, so it goes smoothly on the skin kinda like lotion and just thin layer is enough.</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s priced at $25.95 on Amazon at the moment, and itâ€™s a 16oz jar that will go quite a long way because not much is needed with each use.  </li>
            <li> I help her to apply one thin layer for the first time, she said it&#x27;s soothing.</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty thin</li>
            <li> As you can see, you first have to put a night thin layer of the product all around your face.</li>
            <li> Within that time my skin started to feel tight as the mask dried, which is normal with these type of mud masks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time l applied It, It was a little  hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product and it should last a while.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so this container will easily last the three of us a year + with weekly use.</li>
            <li> I always noticed improvement on my skin the next day after I used it the previous night.</li>
            <li> It did take about 30mins for it to fully dry, but maybe that&#x27;s because I applied it while I was in the bath, not really sure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I get less break outs after only 3 weeks of use!</li>
            <li> I think with  consistency, I will begin to see a much healthier skin that I&#x27;ve had in the past few year.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and naturally you don&#x27;t want to use this everyday on your skin.</li>
            <li> After about 10 minutes after washing it off, I did notice that my forehead went back to being a little dry.</li>
            <li> It did leave my skin a little dry afterwards but just a little bit of my moisturizer fixed that.</li>
            <li> I would say that if you have sensitive skin you should do a test area first because its a bit tingly feeling and whereas I like that, someone with sensitive skin might find it a little painful.</li>
            <li> hoping to get my money back for this mess.</li>
            <li> I left the mask on for a little longer than 15 minutes as a few spots by my cheeks were not dry yet.</li>
            <li> The next day when I woke up my face had already felt smoother and less rough.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea black mud is worldwide known for improving skin&#x27;s natural processes.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li> My skin was a little red after using, but the redness went away with moisturizer after about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Because it can be a little drying, I would recommend only using it once a week.</li>
            <li> The other night my husband showed me how dry his forehead was; the skin was flaking.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is not greasy and a little bit goes a long long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a crazy huge difference</li>
            <li> Usually clear face complex.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask -</li>
            <li> I remove it with a wet paper towel ( I buy the &amp;#34;cloth like&amp;#34; brand to use for my face).  </li>
            <li> I was curious how well it would work with a thinner texture than what I was used to.</li>
            <li> Areas that had a thinner amount, such as my forehead, dried quicker than areas around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of jello when shaking it in the tub but doesn&#x27;t move and when you touch it, it feels like wet mud for the ocean.</li>
            <li> I could definitely feel the mask tightening up on my skin as it dried, which took about 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li> I gave this dead sea mud to my teenage daughter, she has oily and acne problems.</li>
            <li> the thing that I did not like about the mask was that it applied very loosely</li>
            <li> Some mud masks will make my face red for a few hours after using it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and the few red spots I had are gone.</li>
            <li> It was bearable, but it was a lot tighter feeling than I expected.</li>
            <li> and I use wet paper towels for the edges I can&#x27;t get to (i.e. nose corners, along the hair line, ect.).</li>
            <li> The longer I kept it on, the harder the mask got.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> Not really fond of the smell,but it does wonders for my skin</li>
            <li> I later purchased it for myself before trying InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my feet don&#x27;t have any rough spots</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 15 minutes and as the mud dried I could feel it tingling all over</li>
            <li> I expected the tightness, but not the itchiness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does make your face slightly pink from the scrubbing.</li>
            <li> it is almost like I really do not want to shave again.  </li>
            <li> , there is no real smell to it.</li>
            <li> The mud is messy, and I did not see any improvement on my skin after several uses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before buying InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask, I have never tried a mud mask.</li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> That was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> It went on easily enough, but when it was dried, my face felt stingy and burny, which I wasnt psyched about.</li>
            <li> It is still that grayish, mucky color while it is wet.  </li>
            <li> I had recently purchased Instanatural&#x27;s argan oil and I just adored it; so, I decided to give the dead sea mud mask a chance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gentle, it hasn&#x27;t broken me out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different masks....</li>
            <li> it has absolutely no smell or scent to it all.  </li>
            <li> I will come back in a few weeks to update this review.</li>
            <li> we opened the jar, we did get a laugh out of the color, since it&#x27;s this weird gray-green color</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with what I put on my skin.  </li>
            <li> , then definitely check out InstaNatural’s Dead Sea Mud Mask, Retinol Moisturizer and Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this Dead Sea Mud Mask through the mail last week from InstaNatural for review purposes.  </li>
            <li> not much sleep, my skin has been having issues.</li>
            <li> I received the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask with a promotional code to review.</li>
            <li> and you will see wet spots still on your skin.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed because I read all the other great reviews.</li>
            <li> Also a little goes a long way....... a very long way.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am not able to use a lot of products (even makeup) because of it, but I can use this mask with no problem!</li>
            <li> I have tried several other product lines on both the mainstream cosmetic side and the natural side resulting in poor or nightmarish results.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, use as directed and this stuff works.</li>
            <li> Scary, right?  </li>
            <li> All organic and real.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll see it change from the dark seaweed color to a lighter gray as it dries, so you can see if there are areas that still need a moment to dry.</li>
            <li> Every other product I have used to open my pores has dried my face out to the max.</li>
            <li> It can be applied on wet or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Apply a small patch test first on a small area of skin to ensure no adverse reactions.&lt;br /&gt;Distribute a small amount of mud mask onto the face with your fingertips using circular and upward</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little different to put on a dark face mask</li>
            <li> It is a dark gel, and doesn&#x27;t dry into a flakey powder like other masks.  </li>
            <li> It did not dry out my skin like some of the other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> After about 10 minutes, I felt a slight burning/tingling sensation on my face and the mask was nearly dry</li>
            <li> To my surprise not only was this NOT a waste of money it has started to clear away old scars from my stomach and face that have left their marks from years of terrible acne products and being overweight.</li>
            <li> but my skin does look a little different and it made my face less oily</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But that being said a little bit of it goes a really long ways.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> 16 oz and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I found that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> personally liked that there was no noticeable scent, and although my face felt tight as it dried, it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> Only takes about 10-15 minutes to dry - it will depend on how thick you lay it.  </li>
            <li> at least bad acne faded, my psoriasis looks so much better after using this too!</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was very intrigued!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend using a foundation brush or other tool to spread the mask onto your face.</li>
            <li> It is meant to be used once per week to avoid drying out your face and can be used on other parts of your body.</li>
            <li> my mom on the other hand, i let her use it</li>
            <li> It feels weird at first</li>
            <li> And I was skeptical at first about how it can improve my skin.</li>
            <li> No more white heads and greasy looking skin for me.</li>
            <li> I was recently given the opportunity to review Dead sea mud mask from InstaNatural and I have found that Yes it does work!</li>
            <li> It gets rid of some blackheads and other nasties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth the money or the time spent on this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried Korean facial masks in the past but while it was relaxing to use, I never felt any effects.</li>
            <li> so I will be adding this to my mask rotation (sometimes I&#x27;ll use bentonite clay, other times I&#x27;ll use Queen Helen&#x27;s mint julep mask or the Proactiv sulfur mask).</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product and all other Insta Natureal skin products.</li>
            <li> The product contains lots of other greasy supplements.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually do masks especially like this one</li>
            <li> It dries a bit slower than other mask, but that hasn&#x27;t caused any issues for me.</li>
            <li> I have used facial masks before, usually a gel or cream, but never a mud mask.</li>
            <li> We do not know why and are misled by the other reviews.</li>
            <li> you can even apply the mud to other areas of your body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for the past two months and my face cleared up after only a week and stayed cleared up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to disclaim this product too soon, however I just want to let other people know what I&#x27;m experiencing.  </li>
            <li> So when we find a treatment we can use at home (probably a night after the kids are in bed), we tell each other about it.</li>
            <li> Besides that, I have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty itchy and goes on weird.</li>
            <li> I find that I have to use a towel to get some other brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other high-quality spa mud masks and this is akin to those.  </li>
            <li> Usually my masks last a day.</li>
            <li> Read ingredients carefully before purchasing!</li>
            <li> It works extremely well,</li>
            <li> But maybe this means it is working deeper than other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> But maybe this means it is working deeper than other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> My blemishes from past acne spots looked lighter and I was a left with a glowing complexion when removing the mask.</li>
            <li> so I need something that takes care of the oil and clogged pores without over drying other spots.</li>
            <li> and I did notice my skin was a little dry after using it.</li>
            <li> It took a little to wash off and my skin was really red after for a few hours.</li>
            <li> even some shampoos make me break out and have an allergic reaction when the soapy water gets on my forehead, including anything moroccan oil - so I&#x27;m normally very careful about what I try.</li>
            <li> That said, do be very careful to remove all the mask, checking hairline, around the nose and under the jawline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to be very careful when apply this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had skin problems for the last 15 years and spent hundreds of dollars on useless products nothing seams to help or last long term.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> It seems to speed up the healing process of active breakouts.</li>
            <li> I spent $50 for less than 4 ounces on the B. Kamins, and under $35 for 16 ounces.  </li>
            <li> have tried the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask on my face and neck area three times now and left it on until the mud dried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of (very expensive) masks in the past, I like this one better.  </li>
            <li> that have him a lot of trouble with for years and from the time he went into the dead sea in 2012 to the time he passed away in October it never came back.</li>
            <li> Smelled like cow....</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I applied a very thin layer and waited about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, because I&#x27;ve tried other products for my skin and nothing helped..  </li>
            <li> With heating during the winter harsh months, my skin becomes very dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave my face raw and red after use and I have noticed a difference after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems a little harder to get off than the others (I stand under a shower and let the water hit my face)</li>
            <li> When  I put it on I had a cooling sensation and after it started drying it made my face itch a little bit, but that was expected.</li>
            <li> My skin after applying it was a  little red for a small amount of time but</li>
            <li> At first I thought it as a little bit too expensive but after trying it out I could see why.</li>
            <li> Once this mask was dry, my skin felt very tight and continued to feel that way once the mask was removed.</li>
            <li> Feels very tight when dry</li>
            <li> I will admit that it looks a little daunting, considering it&#x27;s a very dark grey, almost black goo that you then smear allover your face.</li>
            <li> have used a few different clay masks in the past for my skin, but have yet to try a mud mask.</li>
            <li> I am prone to congested pores and I cleanse at least twice daily and every couple of days use a mask or peel.</li>
            <li> Now I will warn you do not laugh it will hurt from the stretching</li>
            <li> A small amount go a long way.</li>
            <li> You really cant go wrong with this is product.</li>
            <li> Oh I used to pamper myself at a local spa at least 4 times a year when I was working.</li>
            <li> My face feels refresh and even out all dark spots.</li>
            <li> clean.a small amout goes a long way .</li>
            <li> I can see this jar lasting for at least 6 months or longer if used once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful not to scrub or agitate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The  Dead Sea Mud Mask can be used on the body as well for a full-body detoxifier.&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> Okay mask but dries the crap out of your skin.</li>
            <li> my face is a little less rough and my skin is just softer u can use it on your face and body</li>
            <li> Now for one its not very attractive looking when you open it.</li>
            <li> Just a thin film begins to work and dry instantly pulling out dirt and toxins.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only written about half a dozen negative reviews on items I&#x27;ve purchased over the years</li>
            <li> I purchase products like this because I expect results down the road.  </li>
            <li> Only had to use small amount!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what will be the long term effects of using it twice, but I&#x27;ll update within a month or two if anything happens!</li>
            <li> It did get very tight when it dries, but when I rinse my skin it doesn&#x27;t feel, tight or dry.  </li>
            <li> the texture is much lighter than a clay mask and goes on very thin.</li>
            <li> It can get a little messy, I had to be careful.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used other brands of dead sea mask that have irriated my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the slight tingling as it dries as well.</li>
            <li> continued using this product for twice a week, as I did with previous masks.</li>
            <li> The texture of the mask was slightly odd to me, as in something I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li> It feels awkward to apply because while it&#x27;s much smoother than the ones without oils, it feels harder to get an even coat on my face</li>
            <li> and I seem to be breaking out less since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> As the days passed, I noticed my skin continuing to purge (i.e. clogged pores) and my pores looked and felt less</li>
            <li> As the days passed, I noticed my skin continuing to purge (i.e. clogged pores) and my pores looked and felt less</li>
            <li> Some of my black heads had been removed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically review products</li>
            <li> and my face already looks clearer and feels less inflamed.</li>
            <li> Aside from this mask helping my slight acne and oily face problem, I noticed it lightened some of my blackheads.</li>
            <li> ummmm, I purchased this and when I got it, the product was half used and opened....</li>
            <li> For those suffering from pimples, acne and blackheads you will see that the cleaner your face becomes from impurities, the less skin irritations will occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I pulled out half of a sunflower seed.</li>
            <li> The texture us slightly slimy but moreso clay like.</li>
            <li> It works like a typical mask in a sense that it hardens like cement and you just have to wash it off after 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> I also felt a slight itching sensation, but again, had no adverse reaction.  </li>
            <li> Since using this mask, I have noticed less oil production in my face.</li>
            <li> My mom said her skin felt tighter, my sister-in-law said she had smoother skin, and my niece had less redness.</li>
            <li> The mask it self, does feel slightly itchy when you have it on, and momentary after washing it off.</li>
            <li> Really cold at first, while applying.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to mess with mixing it with water</li>
            <li> It goes on think and dark but dried relatively quickly to a tight greenish color.  </li>
            <li> I was a little thrown off because the mask cream is black because I&#x27;ve never seen it in this color before.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin but even though the pores on my face feel tight after washing off, my skin does not feel moisturized at all.</li>
            <li> I can get tight feeling pores with a bottle of witch hazel.</li>
            <li> My face felt tight and the itchiness went away</li>
            <li> As it dries my skin did get tight but not itchy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll feel tight while it&#x27;s drying</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very dark black.</li>
            <li> My skin did feel a little tight and itchy</li>
            <li> Afterward, my face did feel a little tight, but it also felt softer, smoother and just refreshed.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks my face dry and tightens my skin a lot.</li>
            <li> The dead sea mask it a typical mud mask.</li>
            <li> As it is drying you will notice it going from a dark green gray to a lighten version of gray green.</li>
            <li> My acne was less harsh than before I had used it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a month</li>
            <li> It does itch a little when the mask dries on your face</li>
            <li> It did take a little work getting it off</li>
            <li> and I bought another one for my little sister because she still has sleep overs at college</li>
            <li> My little girls had never seen me in any type of mask</li>
            <li> Upon opening this jar I was a little unsure though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be a little itchy</li>
            <li> a little less,best way I can describe.but</li>
            <li> It all takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> It looked a little off putting when I opened it, but it is a MUD mask.</li>
            <li> This mud mask has virtually NO smell, and as I have never used one before I was a little nervous.</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;ll keep trying it for a little while longer.</li>
            <li> This, too, is an improvement over other masks I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I had been having little bumps under the skin on my chin and around area.</li>
            <li> within 5 to 10 minutes of it being on my face it started to itch a little.  </li>
            <li> A little goes along way</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look like the other mud masks I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> You might feel a little tingle while applying but its just letting you know that its doing its job.</li>
            <li> Did a little cooling, little warming, little itching as it was drying.</li>
            <li> Did a little cooling, little warming, little itching as it was drying.</li>
            <li> As the mask dried, it started to become tight and itchy.</li>
            <li> appreciate that it has basically no smell; wearing a product for 10-15 minutes that has a strong odor can be unpleasant (and I&#x27;ve done that before!)  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I can&#x27;t use it everyday as that would only cause dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> I got it the other day and couldnt wait to try it!!</li>
            <li> I received the Dead Sea Mud Mask on time.</li>

            <li> InstaNatural sent me their Dead Sea Mud Mask to review for my blog, GlamRiver</li>
            <li> I used the Dead Sea Mud Mask with ace bandages around my hips and stomach as a detoxifying wrap.</li>
            <li> After leaving it on for 10 to 15 minutes after only using a thin layer, it dries and hardens.</li>
            <li> So pamper yourself with some Dead Sea Mud Mask by InstaNatural today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> While it dried on my face it felt like it was drawing all the dirt and grime out.</li>
            <li> It changes from a medium gray color to a lighter gray when it has dried.</li>
            <li> when it dried there would be missing coverage.</li>

            <li> compensation for this review was in the form of the Dead Sea Mask via Brandbacker &amp; InstaNatural, but opinions are all mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This  Dead Sea mud mask</li>
            <li> When I used the Dead  Sea Mud Mask on my face, I felt it tightening up my skin while the mask was drying.  </li>
            <li> When I got to try this Dead Sea mask</li>
            <li> This InstaNatural Dead Sea mask comes in a 16 oz.</li>
            <li> , how well it dried.</li>
            <li> When I use this my skin feels clarified without being dried out.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my face and neck and once It dried up, it pulled all the oils and dirt out of my pores.</li>
            <li> When I tested it out, it was a typical mask texture: a little gooey, but no scent (yay!).</li>
            <li> The itching as it started to dry was pretty annoying - to the point that I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and had to wash it off before the 15 minutes were up.</li>
            <li> Came opened and already used half bottle!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a musk smell to it like other brands and it has reduced my acne by at least 50%.</li>
            <li> My face felt stiff and all I could move was my lips and blink.</li>
            <li> No strong negatives to review on this one.</li>
            <li> Excessive use may lead to drying out or irritating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Instead of applying the mud mask to the entire face, you can also use it as a spot treatment on blemishes to help remove excess oil from targeted areas and sooth irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Pimples, acne, and any blackheads are a thing of the past and so little is needed to cover the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li> Pimples, acne, and any blackheads are a thing of the past and so little is needed to cover the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li> I left it on until it was dry even though it itched like crazy.</li>
            <li> My skin has less of those random red spots.</li>
            <li> that using a thin layer once a week should and could go a long way.</li>
            <li> When I applied it to my face, the mud mask wasn&#x27;t as thick as some other mud mask products I have tried in the past, a lot thinner in consistency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as other mask I&#x27;ve had in the past, but the results are just as acceptable.</li>
            <li> I just tried this dead sea mask this past weekend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad itch where I can&#x27;t stand it, but its a teeny bit annoying.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for 2 weeks now, with combination of BeeFriendly&#x27;s raw honey mask.</li>
            <li> When it dries, it gets hard so be prepared for your face to start feeling a little stiff.</li>
            <li> It made my face feel very tight.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel very tight while it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Just feels very tight like its pulling your skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how well it would work on my acne, but within a few days I could definitely see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> My lines were&#x27;t as prominet and my stupid adult acne wasn&#x27;t as red...</li>
            <li> You apply this mask in a thin layer and wait 10-15 minutes for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> I put a thin layer on and let it sit for about 15 minutes until it was dry.</li>
            <li> It is a mask you put thinly a layer over your skin and then wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> You apply a thin layer all over your face, avoiding the eyes and lips, and let it dry.</li>
            <li> It has little to no scent--yay!  </li>
            <li> I have used several face masks in the past only to be disappointed that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> but when I recieved it half of the product was stuck on the lid when I opened it and that party was dried out that was a big disappointment..</li>
            <li> You can see it pulling out all the bad stuff out hahaha even after the mask is rinsed off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works for everyone with eczema/sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I’d tried in the past.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working perse</li>
            <li> i use it the way it says to on the container i take a small amount with my fingers</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see the results with continued use once per week.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn’t felt that firm in years!  </li>
            <li> I usually just do my face my arms and legs and feet</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I opened up Instanatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask and there was no scent to be found!</li>
            <li> When you slowly scrub it off, it exfoliates away all the dead skin.</li>
            <li> I have never used a Mud Mask before and was not sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> It was cold going on and did not seem to irritate my notoriously sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using it for only one week,  it is difficult to judge the results.  </li>
            <li> The jar says not to use it no more than once a week.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stink like others that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is a defective piece and whether I should use in on my skin.</li>
            <li> Sea mud was a small portion of the product.</li>
            <li> Who needs to go to expensive spa if you have this.. Will definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I added it to my usual nightly routine and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Continued using  it twice a week for the past two weeks  </li>
            <li> No better than what you can buy at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a coincidence but pimples seem to appear the day after doing a mud mask.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the mask or just relaxing.</li>
            <li> My late husband went to the dead sea when he was on a deployment to Jordan and it cured his eczema and athletes feet</li>
            <li> No sure on the pore reducer but the wrinkles on my forehead are gone gone</li>
            <li> Myself, my nieces, and even my son used the Dead Sea Mud Mask!</li>
            <li> , I have poor circulation in my skin, it also lead to an uneven skin tone and dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> First off I was super afraid that there would be a nasty smell to this, and to find out there is very little to none</li>
            <li> Usually when I may use a mask or a facial scrub, I find that they really dry out my face to point that I feels really bad if I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 and have very few wrinkles</li>
            <li> Just enough for a very thin layer on your face.</li>
            <li> My face felt very tight and hard to move once I got closer to the 10 minute mark.</li>
            <li> What drives me crazy though is actually understanding what the three little pigs meant when they commented to the wolf, &amp;#34;not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> You will notice that this dead sea mud mask is kinda cold and goes on kinda sheer.</li>
            <li> you first open the Mud Mask, it is very cold and will feel cold to your face.  </li>
            <li> But I will say that once this mask dries it pulls your skin very very tight!  </li>
            <li> I received this face mask and started putting it on when I noticed something hard in it.</li>
            <li> and you want to take your time with this because you don&#x27;t want to rub too hard or not get all of the product off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too hard to take off either, I just washed it off and rubbed my face in a circular motion with my hands</li>
            <li> ; I loath the little prickles sprouting through my chin skin, and I&#x27;m addicted to tweezing them out.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and it burned and itched really really bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sucker for skin masks, any shape, any size, any form.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing to stop the crazy itching</li>
            <li> I am a fan of masks and anything i can slather on my face sit in a bath and read for at least 15 minutes and not have to move.</li>
            <li> I did break out after using it, however, I&#x27;ve been breaking out a lot lately, so I think it just helped some pimples come to the surface.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s, so hormonal issues are an issue with my skin.</li>
            <li> It also seems the company is dishonest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> A secondary benefit seems to be the reduction of pain.  </li>
            <li> Then let is stay on for at least 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using at least 3</li>
            <li> I did not experience any negative reactions on my face.  </li>
            <li> It has helped to put some moisture back in my skin, because you know, this negative degree weather thing we have going on here really stinks.</li>
            <li> It has helped to put some moisture back in my skin, because you know, this negative degree weather thing we have going on here really stinks.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it also depends on how thick you apply the mask.</li>
            <li> You do Not need to put it on thick.  </li>
            <li> Just a warning, do not apply a thick layer.</li>
            <li> The consistency looks thick in the jar</li>
            <li> Too thick a layer</li>
            <li> The moment I used the mad mask, I could instantly feel it working on my pores and releasing all the dirt and oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> I also used it on my chest on a small blackhead that was indecisive about ruining my intro into 2015!</li>
            <li> I also used it on my chest on a small blackhead that was indecisive about ruining my intro into 2015!</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the small amount of blackheads I had on my nose had disappeared!</li>
            <li> However the burning of it in the last 30 seconds was very uncomfortable which is why I deducted a star.</li>
            <li> so there was no worries of odd ingredients or scary side effects.</li>
            <li> but when I began to put it on my face it felt a little weird.  </li>
            <li> Ive only used this a couple times and it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> I like that the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask can be applied on the body as well to spot treat those random pimples that pop up.</li>
            <li> The only negative to it is, after applying it, within minutes, my face begins to itch like crazy!  </li>
            <li> even if it is not fully dry, this will start to itch badly if you do, at least it did for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easier to take off than other clay masks, some of which feel like they put Crazy Glue in the mix.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after about ten minutes my face itched like crazy.</li>
            <li> I have terrible problems will big pores and a breakout ever other week.</li>
            <li> I would recommend doing a mask at least once a week!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t cake it on too thick!</li>
            <li> the cold grey look is conducive to &#x27;mud&#x27; but the feel of it is just wrong, its slimy and goopey.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> After applying a thin layer of the mask all over my face, I waited the fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li> The color is a litte unappealing but</li>
            <li> and i apply a thin layer on my face</li>
            <li> I was not happy, but rather grossed out.</li>
            <li> It just takes a thin layer to cover your face -</li>
            <li> I use it once a week all over my face in a thin layer.</li>
            <li> I then applied a thin layer of mud mask.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need much, a thin, even layer did the job.</li>
            <li> I found that the thin layer  was all I needed.</li>
            <li> It does on thinly, but it dries to your face.</li>
            <li> Just a thin coat works.</li>
            <li> I put the mask on as directed avoiding my lip and eye area and placed a thin layer onto my face and built it up because I wanted an even layer.</li>
            <li> but for some reason its just unappealing for me.</li>
            <li> you smear a thin layer of mud on your face, the ingredients gradually absorb excess oil, dirt and toxins from the skin as the mud dries on your face and body.</li>
            <li> To me, the mask goes on thin.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions; thin layer for 10 min.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it anyways and put a thin layer on my face, per directions.</li>
            <li> Its thin when you put it on</li>
            <li> It says to put on a thin layer</li>
            <li> (I know, so unhealthy, but what can you do?</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other mud masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I hate leaving things on my face for long periods of time</li>
            <li> but once this is dried, my skin cracks and is quite painful.</li>
            <li> BUT this mud saved me in other ways!!!!!!</li>
            <li> a disturbing texture.</li>
            <li> Disappointed I can&#x27;t use this :/</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying this out if you&#x27;re obsessed with masks like me.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all...!</li>
            <li> But, you know what the infamous they say, &amp;#34;Appearance&#x27;s can be deceiving&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Looking at it in the below picture you might think it would have a weird scent, but to my surprise it did not.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult to find any products for my face.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this mask.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to steer anyone wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they don’t like me.  </li>
            <li> ordering, I felt it to be expensive but a pea size is all you need.</li>
            <li> weird residue&lt;br /&gt;Leaves</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells weird.</li>
            <li> Ill coment after try out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite uncomfortable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> &amp;#34;I use this once a week - love it. My face is so smooth afterwards - no more blackheads.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A wonderful treat at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a while, and I finally decided to try it out. I absolutely love it. I have no idea why I took so long to use it. It leaves my face feeling really really smooth. I&#x27;ve never had it feel this good. It does get really tight on the skin, so make sure you don&#x27;t put it along the sensitive parts of your skin like under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product - i love the way my skins feels after using this scrub!! A little goes a long way with this product and it should last a while.  Will def. purchase again!</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty good. After I apply it and allow it to dry for about 15mins I rinse it off with luke warm water and rub with my hands, towel dry and my skin feel super soft and glowy. Than I continue with the other products that I have purchased also from Insta Natural. So far I have no complaints about any of their skin care products.</li>
            <li> only used it once so far.  haven&#x27;t formed an opinion yet</li>
            <li> As recommended on the instructions, I only use this once a week. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in my skin overall as I use other facial masks during the week, but it feels amazing when applied. It definitely has a drying and pulling sensation after a few minutes when applied, but as my skin is very clear, it doesn&#x27;t irritate any.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this mud facial mask. It&#x27;s so easy to apply, and drys quickly. I always noticed improvement on my skin the next day after I used it the previous night. I really enjoy InstaNatural product, and this product is no exception!</li>
            <li> Excellent mask! Refreshing and detoxifies well!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask - I really like the way my skin feels after this mask - its leaves it very smooth and soft but does not feel too tight like when I used the bentonite clay mask.  It is said to draw out impurities as well which can&#x27;t hurt.  The container is easy to open it is a large quantity that will last quite a while for the price.  I have compared InstaNaturals price line on different all natural facial products to other all natural products I have tried and I find that InstaNaturals price gives you more product for the same or less.  Another great facial product for a very good price from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I love it...worth to buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sucker for skin masks, any shape, any size, any form. Mud masks are a favorite, but let&#x27;s be clear. It&#x27;s a clay mask, and it works like all clay masks work. Put it on, let it dry, make faces in the mirror to crack the clay, then rinse (#3 isn&#x27;t necessary, but who can resist?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InstaNatural Dead Sea mask is a worthy entry into the clay mask line. First of all, it&#x27;ll be eons before you need another mask - the jar is huge! (Just make sure you screw the lid on really tight between uses to avoid drying it out.) It&#x27;s got a wonderful earthy scent as it dries on your skin. It&#x27;s also easier to take off than other clay masks, some of which feel like they put Crazy Glue in the mix. It&#x27;s very emollient, if there is such a thing, for a clay mask. it&#x27;s sort of luxuriously muddy, like the sensation of wiggling your toes in a mud puddle when you were a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is calmed, soothed skin that&#x27;s ready to drink up any serum or moisturizer you use afterward. I should also add that this mask is good for pretty much any skin type. The InstaNatural line is proving very promising!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I recieved this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> I received the Dead Sea Mud Mask on time. I used the mask after cleansing my face and left it on for about 15 minutes as instructed. I thought it would be a thicker consistency when applied, but it was lightweight. Once I cleansed my face, it felt soft. Since I had just used once, I may need to continue use for about a month to see if results are noticeable.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:62da1d276b7def85d1e88b7e18d6aec1]] Very easy to apply and remove.  Only takes about 10-15 minutes to dry - it will depend on how thick you lay it.  The thicker the application, the longer it takes to dry and the more effect it will have on your skin.  As it dries, there is a strong cooling and tightening sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to rinse off.  Rinses off cleanly and leaves skin feeling moisturized, clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No scent that I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product and you can feel the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> My face feels really soft the next day after I apply lotion.</li>
            <li> If you want a great mask this is the item to get!!!</li>
            <li> After using it for some weeks I can say it works as advertised. Delivery was fast and the jar has a good quantity. If your skin is sensitive, make sure to not do it right after washing your face.</li>
            <li> Love this mask.  It leaves my skin soft.  No new acne break out.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> Fairly good mask to use on your face once a week or so. I am not a mask expert, so I can&#x27;t really compare this to others. But I will say that once this mask dries it pulls your skin very very tight!  I believe it makes my pores visibly smaller, but I don&#x27;t know how long that effect lasts. Over all decent!</li>
            <li> this facial mask goes on smoothly and comes off easily, works well</li>
            <li> This is now one of my favorite weekly routines!  My skin feels so soft and my pores are so small after using this mask.  The bonus is scaring my kids!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Only had to use small amount!  Awesome!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This mask is very nice. A little bit goes a long way. I always look forward to my weekly treatment!</li>
            <li> Wow! It&#x27;s wonderful and I so enjoy being able to mask at home and enjoy a relaxing 15 minutes to myself.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! My teenagers have been using this mask &amp; their skin has improved tremendously. Great customer service, too!</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this mask. It does get dry and tingly, but it&#x27;s supposed to. You don&#x27;t need a ton and you get a lot.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, use as directed and this stuff works. No weird smell. Feels and looks like its actually doing something. I would say that if you have sensitive skin you should do a test area first because its a bit tingly feeling and whereas I like that, someone with sensitive skin might find it a little painful.</li>
            <li> This product (alongside with other products from InstaNatural) was my first purchase ever and I totally loved this mud mask! Have been using this for almost 3 months now (2 times/week for the first month and 1 time/week for the next 2 months) and I can clearly say that my skin has improved. My skin had no bad reaction to this product whatsoever. And to make it better, the packaging is really HUGE! Kid you not! I would totally recommend this to anyone who has been looking for mud mask that totally works! Try it and you will thank me in the near future! BTW, their customer service is also great. Really helpful!</li>
            <li> Lot of fun to use. I have sensitive skin and it is very gentle. Leave skin feeling new!</li>
            <li> Well I love this for my face... It&#x27;s not horribly thick goes on light and smooth, leaves skin soft!! BUT this mud saved me in other ways!!!!!! Poison Ivy!!! The ONLY thing to stop the crazy itching so I could sleep. SHINGLES!!! Yup dries the blisters up, the best thing so far that I have tried, and this year my shingles have not stopped!! So it&#x27;s a wonder mud for me. I like the slight tingling as it dries as well. I&#x27;m sure it draws out toxins.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this my daughter took it. All I can say is she loves it.</li>
            <li> I use this mask weekly. Since I haven&#x27;t used it for a long time (having received it recently) I can&#x27;t give an honest opinion on the effectivity and longtime results. However, I gave it a 5 Stars because the 2 times I used it, my skin felt good, clean, and refreshed.  The mask doesn&#x27;t have any strong odor. As expected, the mask gets tight when drying, but not uncomfortable for me. I remove it with a wet paper towel ( I buy the &amp;#34;cloth like&amp;#34; brand to use for my face).  Then i follow it with my routine creams. I will update this post after about 2 months to review its effectivity. I&#x27;m 51 and have very few wrinkles and I want to keep it that way.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
            <li> It is good, but really hard to take off. really sticky</li>
            <li> This mask is awesome! Cleans up blackheads effectively. Well, they do come back after a week or so, but I only to put this mask on and they&#x27;ll go away!&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is not too thick like some mud/clay mask, so it goes smoothly on the skin kinda like lotion and just thin layer is enough. With such a HUGE tub I&#x27;m not surprise if this mask will last for months. The mask has a cooling sensation when I put it on. You can feel that tightness when it&#x27;s drying. Since I have a sensitive skin, I only leave it on for 10 minutes before rinsing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite for the fact it is a mud mask that supposed to dry up and absorb moisture, it doesn&#x27;t dry up or irritate my skin. My skin feel smooth and soft. After second application I can see my complexion is brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, I have eczema on my face. One time my eczema was a bit flare up. Since this mask has a soothing and cooling effect, I tried to put it on my eczema. And the mask actually soothe my eczema. I was really surprise with the result! I&#x27;m not sure if this works for everyone with eczema/sensitive skin so you must test it on a small spot first.</li>
            <li> Great product, gentle. Leaves skin feeling and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Before receiving this product to review, I already had a positive opinion about the InstaNatural brand. All- and truly all of their products are wonderful and gentle on the skin because they are made with 100% natural and quality ingredients. You really do get your moneys worth when purchasing items from their brand.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a few different clay masks in the past for my skin, but have yet to try a mud mask. InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask arrived quickly and packaged well to prevent damage. I noticed as soon as I opened the container, that unlike clay masks  this mask had a thinner texture. I was curious how well it would work with a thinner texture than what I was used to. It worked pretty well! The Dead Sea Mud Mask was easy to spread over my face. The mud mask had no scent to it at all, which was nice. The container states that it will take up to 15 minutes to dry- which is true. I noticed that it also depends on how thick you apply the mask. Areas that had a thinner amount, such as my forehead, dried quicker than areas around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;The mud mask will lighten as it dries, and you will notice a tightening feeling on the areas applied. I like to apply about 15 minutes before I am going to shower, that way I can rinse it off while I wash up. The times that I have rinsed off at the sink, I like to use a warm washcloth to wash it off quicker. Some areas take longer for me to rinse off- again, the areas around my nose. Right after the first use I could see that areas with large pores looked slightly smaller in size. My skin did feel a little tight and itchy (I have sensitive skin) though after applying a moisturizer I felt refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I continued using this product for twice a week, as I did with previous masks. For me personally, to do more dries out my skin. This routine has helped me shrink my pores and also reduces irritation and inflammation I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking locally for a decent mud mask for me and/or Steven to use. Well, I do believe that I found it when I got accepted to review InstaNatural&#x27;s 100%Natural *Mineral-Infused Dead Sea Mud mask--Holistic Detoxifier &amp; Purifier for Radiant, Refined Skin. It comes in a 16 ounce tub, and there&#x27;s a lot of mud mask in there! The first thing that I noticed when I opened up the tub, there wasn&#x27;t any real smell to it. I&#x27;m totally grateful for the lack of odor, because a lot of products that I use or have around the house are scented. Sometimes odor, even pleasant, can deter me from using something if it aggravates my nose or my asthma. So far, I have had no issues with any of the InstaNatural products that I have reviewed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steven opted not to try it with me one night off, I&#x27;m still going to see if he will after I&#x27;ve posted this review. I&#x27;ve talked to him about the benefits of it, but he&#x27;s shied away so far. Okay, now onto information and and the review! Yes, it does contain Pure Dead Sea Mud! It contains many mineral that are good for the skin such as magnesium, sodium, bromine, potassium, and calcium.The mask works on absorbing toxins, excess oil, and dirt. This mud mask is great to use on those who have acne, blackheads, and the dreaded pimples. (This is the part that I keep stressing to my son!) It helps with making complexions smoother! You can also use in on your body skin! It can be used once a week.</li>
            <li> I have heard the hype about mud masks, and I have been intrigued, but havenâ€™t purchased any because there are so many to choose from a selection online. However, I was given the opportunity to try out this product through Tomoson free-to-review, and Iâ€™m rather pleased with my experience. This mud mask is InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask that removes excess dirt, oil, grime, and dead skin. It improves acne, blemishes, enlarged pores, and wrinkles. Itâ€™s even an all-natural remedy for dry, irritated skin.  This mud mask contains Pure Dead Sea Mud, which has numerous minerals which are beneficial for our skin, especially magnesium which is a great anti-inflammatory. To list a few ingredients this mask contains, there is Organic Shea Butter, Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Aloe Vera Juice, and Organic Jojoba Oil. Itâ€™s full of moisturizing properties, as well as anti-inflammatory, which are very important when it comes to skincare. Itâ€™s priced at $25.95 on Amazon at the moment, and itâ€™s a 16oz jar that will go quite a long way because not much is needed with each use.  The directions state to use this mud mask once a week, so I used as directed. After applying a thin layer of the mask all over my face, I waited the fifteen minutes. Within that time my skin started to feel tight as the mask dried, which is normal with these type of mud masks. The texture is very thickâ€”and can be messyâ€”but it is soothing, when applied. It is always best to do a test first on a small portion of your hand or arm just to make you do not have any allergic reaction, and be sure to check over the ingredient list, too. I have sensitive skin, but this mud mask did not irritate my skin at all. After the first use, I noticed my skin was a bit softer than prior to using, but it was after the third application that I truly noticed a difference. My skin tone was clearing up, blackheads less noticeable, and most important my skin feels hydrated duringthese colder months. I typically dry out on my cheeks, leaving my T zone oily, but this mask helped to even it out slowly, but with good improvement after three uses.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a mud mask to try, especially those with oily skin, or combination. For those with dry skin, I would be a bit careful because of the salt in the product, but it has many beneficial factors that are worth looking into, and purchasing the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a great thing when things that I love come together.  In this case it&#x27;s my love of masks and InstaNatural (I love their products!)!  InstaNatural sent me their Dead Sea Mud Mask to review for my blog, GlamRiver and before I even opened the jar I knew I would love it.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the size of the jar (16 oz.) is very generous so you can get a ton of masks out of one jar and that is ALWAYS a good thing.  I think I was expecting a really think clay type consistency but it&#x27;s more like a gel than anything else, actually...think pudding, pudding is probably the best description of the consistency.  Needless to say I was very intrigued!  It feels nice and cool when you first put it on and as it dries you can feel it cleaning out your pores and soothing your skin all at the same time.  It&#x27;s kinds unlike any other mask I have tried ( and I have tried A LOT of them) and I love it!  My skin feels clean, smooth and hydrated.  This is a great mask that I do at least twice a week since it has the benefits of cleaning out your pores and being soothing &amp; hydrating.</li>
            <li> *This product was received for free for review purposes only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Review: When receiving this product and opening up the tub you will notice that the mud mask is filled up, so there is no shortage of mask. This mask is also different in feeling and smell than any other mask i have ever used. It has the consistency of jello when shaking it in the tub but doesn&#x27;t move and when you touch it, it feels like wet mud for the ocean. The smell is none existent, so if your sensitive to smell this factor would be in your favor.&lt;br /&gt;When i apply this mask i make sure my face is freshly washed first, than i apply the mud mask. You will notice that this dead sea mud mask is kinda cold and goes on kinda sheer. But that being said a little bit of it goes a really long ways. I do keep my mask on for the 10-15 min. like it states on the packaging and ONLY us it one time a week. When its time to wash off the product you will need to use warm water and move in circular motions to get it off. if you kept the mask on longer than the 15 min. you might have a little bit more of a hard time removing it, but once you do make sure to moisturize your face after because this product does tend to dry out your face. Other than that your face will look more healthy and smooth. There is also a bonus to this product and that is you can use it on your body. I personally like to use it on my legs a day after shaving because it makes it more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- light feeling, no smell, leaves glowing healthier skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- can only use once a week,</li>
            <li> I love being able to bring the spa home to me since it&#x27;s so expensive to go. When I was approached to review this product, I wasn&#x27;t going to pass it up! I have a natural pink/red undertone to my skin as well as acne prone. I was excited to try this and I was not disappointed. When it says it cleans out the dirt, boy does it ever! I&#x27;m on a quest to try different ones, but this one is coming out to be a great product! InstaNatural never disappoints!</li>
            <li> Product itself is great, but packaging was not. The cap was cracked, which caused the product to dry out.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the container, I was expecting this mask to be very similar to other mud or clay masks I’d tried in the past. This mask, however, has a different consistency, almost jelly-like. It was interesting and actually made spreading the mask onto my face much easier. There was also no discernible smell; I’m not a fan of strong scents in things that are going on my face, so that was another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using a foundation brush or other tool to spread the mask onto your face. I feel like you get a more even coat that way. I also felt like I was messier around my hairline when using my fingers. I could definitely feel the mask tightening up on my skin as it dried, which took about 10-12 minutes. After that, it rinsed off fairly easily. I didn’t experience any irritation or redness, but I would recommend doing a test patch on your arm before applying the mask to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this mask, I liked how my skin looked and felt. I will definitely be using this weekly. *Product was provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> I used the Dead Sea Mud Mask with ace bandages around my hips and stomach as a detoxifying wrap. I measured around my hips and waist, then I applies a layer of the mud and then wrapped the area in bandages. I then put on warm clothes and went and watched TV for 2hrs.  after my time was up I removed the bandages, and showered off the mud, and remeasured. I lost 2 inches around my hips and 1 inch around my waist. I will repeat the wrap next week and make sure to drink plenty of water to help increase the toxins removal.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a month and I can feel it tighten on my face and after I take it off, it makes my face feel smooth but it has not made any difference at all to the appearance of my skin. This product did not work for me but everyone is different so who knows if it will work for you or not.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice so far and really love it. It is meant to be used once per week to avoid drying out your face and can be used on other parts of your body. It may also be useful for drying out pimples and blemishes if you do not want to apply to your whole face. After leaving it on for 10 to 15 minutes after only using a thin layer, it dries and hardens. It may also make your skin a bit itchy, but does not leave it red or irritated after removal. Removing the mud mask is very easy with some warm water and a washcloth. It does not have a scent at all as far as what I can tell. It looks and feels like chocolate pudding. Just a little bit goes a long way. Use after cleansing your face. The price is affordable and I was fortunate enough to receive this product for free to review through BrandBacker.</li>
            <li> First off I was super afraid that there would be a nasty smell to this, and to find out there is very little to none is amazing to be. Especially since the directions ask you to keep it on for 15 to 20 minutes while it does its&#x27; work. No, it is not something that is going to be attractive while wearing. It is almost a dark green brownish color and a bit grainy but not so much that you feel like your scratching your skin apart. Just enough to open the top layer and pore and eliminate the dirt and oil improving your skin tone and leaving it smoother and softer. Did I mention it also helps to reduce the look of wrinkles and fine lines too. I really do love this mask. You get so much in the jar that using a thin layer once a week should and could go a long way. So pamper yourself with some Dead Sea Mud Mask by InstaNatural today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Where do I begin with this? This is the best mask EVER! There is absolutely no mixing, or any type of special prep before applying. The wonderful thing, is that you can feel the mask working its magic -- thanks to the tightening (and I mean tight) action it has when its dry. I have oily skin, so this is perfect for absorbing excess oil. After one use, your skin will feel instantly smoother, as its refines and exfoliates. Also, its scent-free so you won&#x27;t smell like fish food for the rest of the day! This really is the holy grail of all masks, and the massive jar will last you a very long time. This is a must-have mask!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of masks and anything i can slather on my face sit in a bath and read for at least 15 minutes and not have to move. This was perfect for that, however.. not so perfect for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The jar is fine enough and large so you get plenty of product and you do not need to use much (in face i recommend you do not or it will take forever to dry) However, the substance itself is ... a disturbing texture. It looks fine because its dead sea mud the cold grey look is conducive to &#x27;mud&#x27; but the feel of it is just wrong, its slimy and goopey. This does not smell bad though and feels pretty good on your face its just the odd hand feel that gets to me. The mask will dry in about 10-15 minutes, do not leave it on more than that even if it is not fully dry, this will start to itch badly if you do, at least it did for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to wash off though and takes no time at all, just be sure to wash it off with warm water and your fingers in circular motions. Also, make super sure you have a really good moisturizer on afterwards and this will dry you out extremely badly! Your skin will look very nice afterwards though, very dewy and new looking and your pores will be shrunken and less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
            <li> I love trying all their products and I had to try the mask. You can definitely see it works by the third use. My skin feels soft and bright. Although the mask dries on your face once it&#x27;s off, feels nice and moist. One of the best mud masks I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great fragrant free mask. I felt it worked great for my very oily skin. It left my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> excellent for my skin</li>
            <li> Love this product I have seen results the fisry time of use my skin looks a lot clean and radiant, thanks instanatural for making good beauty products.</li>
            <li> I like it but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working perse but my skin does look a little different and it made my face less oily</li>
            <li> I loved this product&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> Very nice quality purifying mask. Not messy comes already mixed and ready to use. Made in the USA no animal testing and pure ingredients. A++++.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Ive only used this a couple times and it&#x27;s not that bad. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in my face. Im still debating whether I should get another one but I have a long way to go so I&#x27;ll give you an update once I finish it.</li>
            <li> It was great, it really helps my skin done it twice and does clean up as promised, what else could i say,,it feels great</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with mud masks but I do enjoy using this product. My daughter and I decided to start doing weekly facials at home using this product as well as a store-bought cleanser and scrub and we are both pleased with the results after two weeks. My daughter has had some issues with blackheads on her nose and they have decreased dramatically in the last two weeks. My skin is also clearer and feels great.</li>
            <li> Nice mask for a great value! I enjoyed this mask. It made my skin feel soft and clean after using. To read a full review you can check it out HERE. http://leopardlaceandcheesecake.blogspot.com/2015/02/review-instanatural-dead-sea-mud-mask.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I recieved this mud mask for testing and review purposes from Brand Backer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very moist mask, in this I mean that it contains a great deal of moisture for in the short time leaving it on my shin, it does not harden or become a shell whatsoever, wet mask. This, Making it quite easy to remove. I shower it off. No skin irritation and somewhat notable as  I am a natural redhead with moderately sensitive  to sensitive olive fair to pale skin. I have a fairly rigid skin care routine., From anti-aging products, toners, exfoliating, and  moisturizers. So, a mask is not a daily for me but I tend to do one weekly incorporating all my skin and not limited to just the face. You really do get a fair amount of product in this container making a body mask a very feasible option. The product does tends to settle but I would considered this normal, so In re- opening  it  for use ...I use stirring whipping tool  and you can see it come right back to live mix or well mixed mask for application. It will whip right back into a nice moist texture. It gives me a clean yet not dry after mask feel to my skin. I would recommend this product if your looking for an overall body and face mask ti incorporate into your regiment for some refreshing benefits. So , the only thing I can tell in terms of skin improvement would just be the overall clean skin feeling after removing it, This tells me at best, it surfaced off a few dead cells and just brighten my skin  up a touch. I would call this mask a very gentle mask with gentle and clean refreshing results. As I only use this one about once a week, I can attest to the long term benefits. But, overall it&#x27;s just a nice simple clean mask. As I have tried quite a few of this company&#x27;s products. This one is acceptable as many of the others. No strong negatives to review on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask a few times and I can say it really is helping me with my acne. I tend to get a bunch of cystic acne when I eat to much diary and I use this once a week and the net morning my pimples are smaller. You get your moneys worth... It does itch a little when the mask dries on your face but it does work great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is dense. It almost reminds me of flubber. There wasn&#x27;t a smell when I applied it to my face and when I rinse the mask off, it leaves my face feeling smooth and soft. I have semi oily/ dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NOT used it more than once a week. It doesn&#x27;t dry out the face too much and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Omg this s*** is amazing! :) You can see results really quickly!</li>
            <li> After using on my face, my face felt CLEAN! I thought the mud was going to be smelly but, it actually does not have a smell at all! I enjoyed how the mud felt on my face. Really cold at first, while applying. Super easy to apply. Just avoid the eye and mouth areas. The mask contains a nourishing blend of Organic Shea Butter, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Aloe Vera, Organic Calendula Oil and Hickory Bark Extract. I did not experience and skin irritation or dryness after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a thin layer of mud mask to clean skin. Leave mask on for 10-15 minutes (until dry). Use warm water and circular motions to remove the mask from the skin. Pat dry with clean, dry cloth. Use only once a week.</li>
            <li> You apply this mask in a thin layer and wait 10-15 minutes for it to dry.  Because of it&#x27;s more watery consistency, I would say it takes closer to 15-20 minutes to dry.  Also, my skin felt very itchy while it was drying.  After I wash this off my face, my skin looks brighter and feels really soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed using the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask and really recommend it. For this low price you get 16 ounces which is a TON of product.</li>
            <li> Refreshing to apply, good ingredients, pleasant smell, enjoy using this.  Will post later re results after I&#x27;ve used this more.</li>
            <li> I loved it, very soothing and instantly refreshes my skin :)</li>
            <li> Loveeee! You get a big Jar of it and do it once a week. Strips your face of any gunk and impurities</li>
            <li> Too thin, not enough &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; to it.</li>
            <li> great mask! I love the smell and feel of my skin after use. it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I gave this dead sea mud to my teenage daughter, she has oily and acne problems. I help her to apply one thin layer for the first time, she said it&#x27;s soothing. She likes it. I promise to give her once a week this special mud treatment if she behaves well. Love it!</li>
            <li> Insta Natural asked me to review a number of their products and I definitely enjoy them. This one is their Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;I liked that their wasn&#x27;t a smell at all. The color is a litte unappealing but when does mud ever look good?&lt;br /&gt;The mask is an all natural detoxifier. The mask takes care of the extra oil on your face, dirt and other toxins inside your body. It&#x27;s shown to help your pimples and blackheads with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;It also gives you a smoother looking complexion to even your ton and help reduce wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;They also say that you can use this on different parts of your body to help relieve muscle aches and pains, I did not use it for that but I might have to try that.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it on my face, the thing that I did not like about the mask was that it applied very loosely, I thought it would have been more like a paste so that it applies thicker.&lt;br /&gt;It made my skin feel really soft, I enjoyed the cooling effect when I applied it to my face. It did take about 30mins for it to fully dry, but maybe that&#x27;s because I applied it while I was in the bath, not really sure.&lt;br /&gt;There is a great mix of shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera, calendula oil and hickory bark extract that helps moisturize your face or body. It&#x27;s also supposed to help soothe dry and irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely check it out. It definitely makes your skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and it burned and itched really really bad. I washed it off as soon as I started feeling it of course but I was very disappointed because I read all the other great reviews.</li>
            <li> I really like this dead sea mud mask i use it the way it says to on the container i take a small amount with my fingers and i apply a thin layer on my face make sure you avoid around your eyes and mouth i leave the mask on for 15 min. i make sure it is dry then i use warm water and take it off by splashing my face with the water and moving my hands in circulation motion so that i gently remove the mask from my face after it all off my face i pad my face dry. Its as easy as that. This is my favorite mud mask it works great and I love that it is 100% natural because i have sensitive skin and it does not burn my face or leave it bright red or break me out  there is really not any sent to it which i love about it some mud masks just stink but not this one and it leaves my face so smooth and radiant so if your looking for a really great mud mask I am recommending this one to try and maybe you will love it just like I do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this mud mask for free in an exchange for my thought on this product. #deadseamask</li>
            <li> I have some first trimester of pregnancy acne, so I used this mask and the next morning I woke up and it&#x27;s already improved. I&#x27;ve used other mud masks that burn, but this one feels more gentle and did not burn my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> I love the  instaNaturals skincare products. I received 6 skincare products for. Well 5 skincare  products &amp; one masque for my hair.. I am so happy with the results. You can see a visible change in my skin.  I highly recommend there  products... All natural ingredients &amp; made in the USA you can&#x27;t go wrong...</li>
            <li> I have a spa night 2 or 3 times a week with my 75 year old grandma. I am always on the look for great products for our fun girls night. When I found Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask at and exceptional price I had to jump on the offer, and I am glad that I did. I just have to share my opinions of this great product. When we used it not only was the aroma a very sweet smell but the creamy feeling on your face is just heavenly. The next day when I woke up my face had already felt smoother and less rough. I am so happy that I found this. Thank you InstaNatural for making an honest product!</li>
            <li> The mask goes on easy and leaves my face soft and smooth. I hate leaving things on my face for long periods of time so i love how the mask dries fairly quickly and is easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> i received this product from tomoson.com for testing and reviewing purposes. my skin reacted so badly to this. it made my face so red and it looked like i was wearing a red mask when i washed it off my face. my mom on the other hand, i let her use it and she said it worked great for her. i think my skin is just to sensitive for this.</li>
            <li> this product is pretty cool. literally. it stays at a pretty low temperature which makes it feel nice when you put it on your face. I put a thin layer on and let it sit for about 15 minutes until it was dry. I then rinsed it with warm water. It did take a little work getting it off but my skin felt super smooth afterwards. It doesnt have a smell which is nice and it has a great texture (it isnt gritty). This jar will last you a very long time. you only use about 2 or 3 teaspoons and only use it once a week. I definitely think this product is worth investing in!</li>
            <li> good product easy absorb</li>
            <li> Would definitely get another one!</li>
            <li> This container is HUGE! Would recommend for anyone that loves being pampered :)</li>
            <li> Definitely works as expected.</li>
            <li> Love the mask and love that it is not messy at all , go&#x27;s on my face fine and washed off easy also pretty good size and amount in the bottle</li>
            <li> My skin is seemingly  temperamental and does not do well with many products out there for facial skin care. This mud is amazing. I use it weekly and my skin is refreshed and doesn&#x27;t break out. Love it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really love the dead sea mud facial masks. I have used several different brands and I have liked them all. This one is just as good as the rest of them. I like to put it on 5-10 minutes before I get into the shower. Then I can easily wash it off. It is much better than trying to deal with the mess and rinsing in the sink.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this mask. Super luxurious.  Didn&#x27;t dry my face out and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  It did a great job at removing excess oil without that tight feeling afterwards.  Just after one use,  i can already see a huge improvement! My face feels soft and smooth and i can&#x27;t wait to see what continued use will do!</li>
            <li> Was refreshing untill 5 minutes later when it became to itchy to bare.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li> OMG I love love love this!!! I got it the other day and couldnt wait to try it!! It made my skin feel tighter and softer. Great product and great price.  I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a great Dead Sea Mud Mask. It has a natural dark mud color, thanks to the pure dead sea mud, and it also contains organic Shea butter, sunflower oil, Aloe Vera juice, and jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;With all of those great ingredients, I was expecting it to have the same great botanical scent to it, as the other products in this line have. However, to my surprise, I couldn&#x27;t smell anything!&lt;br /&gt;I use this product once a week, and just apply a thin layer to clean skin, then let it sit for about 15 minutes. I rinse with warm water, then after patting the skin dry, apply a great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks and feels amazing, and it is one of my favorite parts of spa day! I love all that dead sea minerals do for my skin, and will definitely be keeping some of this mud mask on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received the items in this post complimentary for review purposes. All opinions within are purely my own*</li>
            <li> This mask is used like any other- applied to clean skin and left for 10-15 minutes to dry, then rinsed off with warm water. The directions state not to use this mask more than once per week, and I can definitely see why.&lt;br /&gt;While my experience with this mask was a good one, I do think people with dry skin need to be very careful when using this product. I have combination skin, so clay and mud masks can be beneficial for me, although will dry my skin out if I over-use them. I have used this mask 2 times now, and I can confidently say that this will really dry up that excess oil! If you have oily skin, this mask would be amazing for you!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel any tingling or irritation while using the product, although it has a cooling feel to it once applied. Once this mask was dry, my skin felt very tight and continued to feel that way once the mask was removed. After using this product, I continued on with my regular nighttime skincare routine, and my skin did not feel any drier or more irritated than before.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after washing the mask off and drying my face, I could feel and see my skin was more firm. The pores on my nose were less noticeable, and the surface of my skin felt soft and clean. I do think that if I hadn&#x27;t continued on with my product routine, my skin probably would have felt super dry. If you don&#x27;t have oily skin, it&#x27;s important to replenish healthy moisture to your skin after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve only used it twice, so I haven&#x27;t seen any miraculous results, although I love the way it makes my skin feel. It&#x27;s a really relaxing and spa-like product that is perfect for pampering yourself at the end of a long week. I might avoid it if you have dry skin, but it would be amazing for body and spot treatments!</li>
            <li> I mean what can I say other than I love it?!? I LOVE face masks. Thats my mommy time. This certainly takes the cake. Good smell, you can use it just about anywhere on your body. Im sure you know where NOT to use it. I have only done my face but will be doing my whole body first chance i get.  So peaceful, relaxing, and exciting knowing that then you wash it off you will see a difference in your skin. It evens everything out. Dry skin...gone. Oily skin...gone. Pimples and blackheads...gone. wrinkles/fine lines...improving.</li>
            <li> My skin never felt so good! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Definitely works like it should! My pores were noticeably smaller and my skin was very soft after using. I did break out after using it, however, I&#x27;ve been breaking out a lot lately, so I think it just helped some pimples come to the surface. I haven&#x27;t had anymore pimples after I broke out, so I&#x27;m happy. It did leave my skin a little dry afterwards but just a little bit of my moisturizer fixed that. I really appreciated the amount that you get and the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use much which makes it quite a deal!  I may add to this review later to let you all know if it really is helping with the acne. I&#x27;m looking forward to finding out! :D</li>
            <li> Noticed difference after first use. Product crafted with care, another 5 star product from Instanatural!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister and she loved the product.  She said it helped balance her pH levels or something like that.</li>
            <li> works well. Tried it to compare to the borghese fango mask, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast. but you get way more value for your money. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed how this product made my face feel smooth.</li>
            <li> The product works as described.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth after using this. And my pores appear smaller after washing the mask off. I&#x27;d recommend trying it</li>
            <li> I would give it more stars but this mud mask burned my face and left it bright red for 2 days. Just not for me. Delivery was great and the actual product seems to be good quality. Disappointed I can&#x27;t use this :/</li>
            <li> caused me to break out, I have dry sensitive skin but my daughter likes it.</li>
            <li> My skin felt beautiful after washing the mask off. My only complaint is that the mask starts to hurt if you leave it on too long which i love to do lol. But other then that it left my skin feeling soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> definitely works. I sometimes use it to spot it on pimples and this helps clear it within a day.</li>
            <li> This was easy to apply and easy to remove.  I really liked how my skin felt when removed.  So far my skin looks healthier and feels softer.</li>
            <li> Really Good !!!! Love It .</li>
            <li> I have only had the opportunity to try this once and I can honestly say I saw a difference in the size of my pores. I am anxious to see the results with continued use once per week. A little goes a long way and I could feel it tightening as it dried. I would recommend trying.</li>
            <li> I love mud masks and this one lived up to my expectations. It dried quickly on my face and I did not have any problems scrubbing it off like I do some mud masks. My skin looked so clean and clear when I washed it off. Some mud masks will make my face red for a few hours after using it but this one didn&#x27;t. This is a huge jar so it will last you a very long time. A little bit goes a long way and naturally you don&#x27;t want to use this everyday on your skin.</li>
            <li> OMG. SOMEONE USED THIS ALREADY AND SENT IT TO ME !!!!!!OMG. SOMEONE USED THIS ALREADY AND SENT IT TO ME !!!!!!OMG. SOMEONE USED THIS ALREADY AND SENT IT TO ME !!!!!!OMG.

            <li> This mask makes my face feel very smooth and helps with my acne.</li>
            <li> Omg this mask left my skin so soft, I love it</li>
            <li> I reacted badly to it.It broke up my face,now I&#x27;m dealing with getting rid of the acne.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It works better than any mask I have ever used. It seems to speed up the healing process of active breakouts. I am in love with this mask.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was at first, very skeptical about using this product in my face. I&#x27;ve tried so many other acne treatments and home remedies that didn&#x27;t give me the results I was looking for. The moment I used the mad mask, I could instantly feel it working on my pores and releasing all the dirt and oil on my skin. I would definitely recommend this if you have problems with dry oily skin. The mud mask seems to restore moisture naturally without actually drying your skin out. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  Made my face itch the first few times but after several uses the itching stopped.  I prefer to use twice a week rather than once like the directions say.  It makes my face feel so smooth and seems to clear blemishes.  I am in my late 40&#x27;s, so hormonal issues are an issue with my skin. This mask does wonders! The size is very large so it lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.. but when I recieved it half of the product was stuck on the lid when I opened it and that party was dried out that was a big disappointment..</li>
            <li> This has smoothed some lines on my face and added more of a youthful look, I think I could accurately say.  I know for a fact that it has certainly tightened the skin on my face.  The container says to only use this once per week and to leave the mask on for 10-15 minutes.  I can say it does its job and it is something that does not need to be used very frequently.  In other words, its a good buy for the money!</li>
            <li> I love it. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell &amp; it leaves your face smooth.</li>
            <li> great results, my skin looks brighter and more clear, saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li> One of the best mud masks I&#x27;ve used. It purifies, detoxifies, and deep cleanses your pores. I noticed a difference in my blackheads and pores appeared smaller. Great for oily skin, breakout prone skin, and those that need a deep cleaning. Not recommend for dry skins and patch test on sensitive skins to prevent irritation.</li>
            <li> I hate when I sound like a &amp;#34;sales person&amp;#34;, but. . .the truth is my skin has never looked better.  This leaves your face looking and feeling fresh and it may or may not make you look 10 years younger, but it sure does make you feel it!  I highly recommend you treat yourself.  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> The dead sea mask it a typical mud mask. I have not noticed any real changes in my skin or anything substantially different from any drug store face mask. No offensive odor, rinses off easily and skin feels smoother after use.</li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT product. I was a little thrown off because the mask cream is black because I&#x27;ve never seen it in this color before. Nevertheless, I have not stop using the product since I received it. When I first used it, I applied a very thin layer and waited about 10 minutes. I absolutely love the &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; feel that you get with mask. When I rinsed it off, my skin was so soft!! It definitely left my face feeling clean and refreshed! High recommended product!!</li>
            <li> I used it only twice and I immediately started to feel the result. Smaller pores, smoother skin. I love it</li>
            <li> It s really good mask. It has a lot of natural ingredience. After few use I&#x27;m able to see results. My skin looks more healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the product. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and the few red spots I had are gone. The price-quality ratio is also very good.</li>
            <li> I just love this mask. surprisingly there&#x27;s no smell and the mask works great. Sound weird but I use it when my eczema is going out of control to just sort of clarify my skin before putting on my moisturizer and it works great. It really rehabs my skin. When it dries it did feel a bit itchy but I&#x27;ll take it for the benefit it gives. And I just love this brand.they really do create great products and the customer service is the best. I was surprised to see so many ingredients in the mask and thought I&#x27;d like something more simple but I trust this brand and turns out the mask is wonderful. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite of the entire product line.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my daughter. She likes it.</li>
            <li> I like this mud mask because it&#x27;s different than other mud or clay masks I&#x27;ve tried. It actually refined skin&#x27;s texture and leaves it hydrated and clean. It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other mud masks I&#x27;ve tried. I would recommend trying this out if you&#x27;re obsessed with masks like me.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and I am pleased with the results from it&#x27;s use.  It does a great job of removing the old dull tissue and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  I liked the way it made my face tingle as it went to work, very rejuvenating.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels so much cleaner and fresher after using this dead sea mud mask. I&#x27;m usually skeptical of using too many products on my face, but this mask is amazing! It really cleans your pores. I&#x27;d recommend Instanatural to anyone.</li>
            <li> This seems more like clay then mud to be honest with you.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like mud either.  It seemed to work pretty well though.  I&#x27;ve only done it once so far so will continue to do my once a week treatment to see if there is any difference.</li>
            <li> Dries in 10 minutes. Use it once a week in the morning. Rejuvenates skin, reduces acne, fine line and tightens skin. Awesome prodect. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent mask. All natural. Will last forever!! (It doesn&#x27;t take much.) Leaves my skin deep- cleansed and feeling soft and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My skin hasn’t felt that firm in years!  Although the directions said that I could wear the mask for 10-15 minutes, I was ready to get it off after 10 minutes. It came off easily with water but was very messy. I went through two washcloths to get it completely off.  I would suggest applying the mask in the morning, then jumping into the shower to wash it off.  On the InstaNatural blog, they suggest using the mud on a specific spot or blemish if needed.  I love that idea! The beneficial minerals found in this mask seem to be helpful to the skin.  It also claims to improve fine lines and wrinkles when used on a regular basis.  Because it’s so easy to apply and remove, it’s definitely something I could fit into my beauty regimen. I received the Dead Sea Mud Mask to try. The opinions shared here are 100% mine.</li>
            <li> I have used the masked about 3 times now. I really like it I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin. Fewer blemishes my pores are smaller. I love the way my skin feels after using the product! I have  eczema on my back I have used on my back as well it has cleared it right up!</li>
            <li> Love this face mask. It&#x27;s so luxurious and tightens up your skin immediately. It has reduce my pore size greatly. I never thought my pores would ever shrink Kirk they have. I love this product and I  excited to try more from instanatural!</li>
            <li> I was reading over the product reviews and almost all of them have great reviews and 3 or more stars. It looks like this company may be writing their own reviews. :(&lt;br /&gt;I do like the product. It feels weird at first but after you wash it off your skin feels really smooth. The only thing I wish were different is the cruelty free part of this product. I found a dead baby fish in my container. I was not happy, but rather grossed out. It makes me want to never use the product again. I don&#x27;t want to find another fish. It also seems the company is dishonest.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see what all the excitement was. I returned the product since I couldn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using it yet.But I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.. It works just as good or better than the expensive stuff that you can get in the mall. You can really feel it tighten as it dries, I love using this and I bought another one for my little sister because she still has sleep overs at college and I thought it would be fun for her and her friends, plus its all natural :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Very good product! Smooth skin after it!</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS MUD MASK!! AFTER I USE IT MY SKIN FEELS SO SOFT AND MY PORES LOOK SMALLER. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I have only used this mask once but I loved the way it makes my face feel. I will update once I have fully tested the product.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old &amp; I tried this on our &amp;#34;Mommy &amp; Daughter&amp;#34; night, and it works great. Not only was it gental enough for her skin, but it left mine feeling smoother, softer, and so much healthier. This is now a permanent part of all &amp;#34;Mommy &amp; Daughter&amp;#34; nights to come!</li>
            <li> If anyone has tried it has ever wanted to try something like Hollywood glam glow. Look no further. I think this stuff is better. It doesn&#x27;t have the consistency of a scrub. It&#x27;s like like a regular face cream but then dries and you can literally see all the gunk coming out of your face. I was so surprised at how much stuff was coming out. I will say to use a moisturizer after you wash this off your face because it does say on the package that it removes oil from the skin and I did notice my skin was a little dry after using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent mud mask!  I highly recommend this product.  My face and neck feel so soft after using this.  I have been using this mask once a week and look forward to my &amp;#34;mud mask day&amp;#34;.  It goes on smoothly and best of all no fragrance.  Because this is a large jar, I will not be needing to re-order for awhile.  Excellent company!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great noticeable difference after 1 use</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin pretty dry</li>
            <li> Skin feels and looks great, the mud is cooling and pleasant on my face. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great product works well.</li>
            <li> I love the Deadsea Mud Mask! Although the color of the product is a bit weird, I love how it doesnt have a strange scent. It actually has NO smell! Once you apply the product, you can feel it start to dry and tighten your skin. Once the time is up, the product easily washes off with warm water. My skin felt so smooth and soft after! I would highly recommend this product!  I received one or more of the products mentioned above for a dollar or less using amazingdealsgroup.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I used this product and am completly satisfied with it i applied the dead sea mask to my face and when it was completed i washed off as directed it left my skin feeling amasing, clean and my skin was nice as soft. This was my results after just one use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy i got this product to test and review for free, I have poor circulation in my skin, it also lead to an uneven skin tone and dark spots on my face. I have excess oil that clog my pores that lead to acne. Well I&#x27;m starting the healing process with my troubling skin by useing Dead sea mud mask, so far it has left my skins feeing moisturize n with a healthy glowand soft to the touch i love the way my skin feels, i&#x27;m excited about this product and i will definitely be using bsl daily routine. It also works great for my son Eczema! Awesome. This product is definitely worth the money. 5 star for me</li>
            <li> My face feels fantastic! One of my favorite masks ever! The mask is the perfect consistency, and works very fast!</li>
            <li> This mask is everything!! Should have bought 2!</li>
            <li> This mud facial mask is so great, it goes on easy and smooth. While it dried on my face it felt like it was drawing all the dirt and grime out. It was clear from how it felt after the 15 minutes that it was time to wash it off. The mask washed off very easy with no harsh residue, my skin afterwards felt so soft and supple. I am really glad I was able to get this complementary and to share my experience with this great product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this mask. I&#x27;ve used it twice. It feels great on my skin and help minimize the pores. I dislike the texture,.. could be thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Pros : No tingling or burning sensation during application and I didn&#x27;t experience any side effect.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave my face raw and red after use and I have noticed a difference after a few uses.  Suffice to say, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> Safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many scrubs, gommages, masks and peels...mostly expensive. This is now &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; at the top of my list. I am prone to congested pores and I cleanse at least twice daily and every couple of days use a mask or peel. The first time I used this, the congested pores at the edge of my nose were completely clean. I doubt they&#x27;ve been this clean in years. The mask is quick, painless, and leaves my skin smooth, soft and the pores totally clean. The other night my husband showed me how dry his forehead was; the skin was flaking. We used this mud mask on his entire face and like me, his skin was left smooth and moist. I&#x27;m glad this is a big jar as now we&#x27;ll both be using it. I will be recommending this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> All natural and organic! I love it!</li>
            <li> Wow, far better than expected</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before I purchased this. And I was skeptical at first about how it can improve my skin. This product makes my skin complexion change for the better. The color completely changed after applying the mask. I will buy it again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I seriously love this mask. My face feels so smooth after. Its invigorating</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks my face dry and tightens my skin a lot. I like it a lot. It also seems to leave my face feeling soft after I use it. I don&#x27;t use it much - and often go long periods of time without using it. When it drys on your face you will most-likely feel a stinging/itching effect - no idea why that is but I tough it out and the results seem pretty good. It just takes a thin layer to cover your face - the thicker you put it on the longer it takes to dry. A little seems to go a long way and the product should last a long time because they give you so much.</li>
            <li> was so excited to try out this mask! I have oily acne prone skin, so I love a good purifying/detoxifying mask to clear out my pores and excess oils in my skin. This mask helped me do just that. I use it once a week all over my face in a thin layer. Do make sure to use a thin layer otherwise it may not dry as it should. The texture of the mask was slightly odd to me, as in something I wasn&#x27;t expecting. It was less muddy and more gelatinous, which was slightly strange, but it made application a little bit easier. I let the mask sit on my face for about 10-15 minutes, or whenever the mask looked completely dry. It changes from a medium gray color to a lighter gray when it has dried. I definitely felt this mask was doing what it claimed to do. My face felt very tight and hard to move once I got closer to the 10 minute mark. It was bearable, but it was a lot tighter feeling than I expected. Once I washed it all off my face, I patted it dry with a wash cloth and I followed it with a moisturizer to hydrate. I definitely suggest doing it only once a week, as its pretty drying for your skin.</li>
            <li> It is very beautiful and amazing results</li>
            <li> Cheaper than most mud mask and does the job well. I suggest using a brush to apply product and after about 30-1hr removing it with warm-&lt;br /&gt;water. Overall i&#x27;m satisfied with the price and product itself.</li>
            <li> This Mask is AMAZING! I felt like I was at a spa. My skin felt so amazing and looked amazing after using it. It did not overly dry out my skin and it left it feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> Noticing a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> This was a fun product to use!  My little girls had never seen me in any type of mask so their faces were priceless.  It goes on think and dark but dried relatively quickly to a tight greenish color.  I felt like my face and pores were very happy with me for using it!</li>
            <li> feel smooth after using it and feel better. very good product. I will buy it again,</li>
            <li> I love this mask! It itches while it dries, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and the itching has worn off some. After washing the mask off the first time I used it, I saw all of the dirt unclogged from my pores! I have extremely sensitive skin and am not able to use a lot of products (even makeup) because of it, but I can use this mask with no problem! I love this mask!! There is a lot of the mud in then container as well, so the price is well worth it! :)</li>
            <li> I love this mask! When washed off, my pores look smaller and my skin looks so happy!</li>
            <li> MUST HAVE.....This is without a doubt the best facial mask EVER!  The way your face feels afterward is truly amazing.  I even have my friends hooked on this mask!  A total must have for anyone that loves facials.  When it starts to dry, it tightens so much your face kind of hurts.  My fine lines and wrinkles are disappearing.  I am hoping after continue use, my pores minimize.  I use several InstaNatural products and honestly love them all.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a good deal as you get such a large amount. You could use it for full body mud mask treatments. It is quite a treat. Note, use very sparingly so that you have a only a super thin layer or it will take a long long time to dry. With that said... this is not my favorite InstNatural product, and I have tried a few. First, I don&#x27;t like the gummy texture. Secondly, I cannot tell visually if it is drawing excess oil from my pores on my nose. With some other mud mask products on the market, you can see the excess oil drawn out from the wet-looking spots on your pores when the mask has tried to a light grey color on the rest of your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who had mild acne when younger and used to use inexpensive mud packs (not the expensive Dead Sea brands) and liked the way they work. I&#x27;m older now and I still like a mud pack a few times a year as it really does make your skin feel clean. However, the all-clay types seem harsher to me than they used to: I find that while I think I still have an oily complexion, that that&#x27;s probably not the case, and my face feels and looks &#x27;clean but stressed&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try this because of the oils in it (jojoba, etc), and to my surprise this works really well. It feels awkward to apply because while it&#x27;s much smoother than the ones without oils, it feels harder to get an even coat on my face and I felt as though when it dried there would be missing coverage. However, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and as it dried it felt just like the old ones drying: Yes, it tightens up the skin and there is some itchiness and when it dries it looks pretty much as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems a little harder to get off than the others (I stand under a shower and let the water hit my face) but when all was said done my felt good, felt clean, but didn&#x27;t look red nor did it feel like it had been given harsh treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask. I have really sensitive skin - even some shampoos make me break out and have an allergic reaction when the soapy water gets on my forehead, including anything moroccan oil - so I&#x27;m normally very careful about what I try. The natural ingredients soften my skin and leave it feeling refreshed and my pores tightened. I use it once a week (mostly Fridays after a long work week to unwind haha). Highly highly recommended, especially for anyone with sensitive skin.  Plus, you can use it sparingly and it it will get the job done, so 16 oz will last you a long time. If you purchase it, you really won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This mask is awesome. A little messy on my first once you figure it out. . I really liked how this product left my skin feeling. It did a good job drawing out oils from my skin, leaving my skin feeling so soft and smooth. I can&#x27;t wait to see what long term effects it has. Happy with my purchase will buy again</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this mud mask was that it had no scent. I guess I though it would smell funky because of the name. It certainly does not. It&#x27;s super easy to use, apply, let dry completely and rinse off. It really tightens up your skin as it dries. It has helped me with my oily skin and I seem to be breaking out less since I&#x27;ve been using it. My face feels wicked soft for hours after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I thought it would cause more breakouts but it actually helped to dry them out. Hopefully with continued use my skin will improve. I am in love with this mask and I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has improved my skin color and is great as a spot treatment if you get a pimple. It dries it up quick. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Received this product very quickly and am very anxious to use it.</li>
            <li> ive been dying to dry a mud mask. this makes my skin feel so smooth and clean after one use.</li>
            <li> Purchased with discount. Made my skin look and feel beautiful with no irritation. Definitely will repurchase!</li>
            <li> very happy with product. does exactly what I need it to do</li>
            <li> Great product. Work wonders.</li>
            <li> Great quality and consistency! Love it.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing on my skin and leaves my face refreshed!</li>
            <li> nstaNatural: Dead Sea Mud Mask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is part of their Body Detoxifiers collection. The mask is 100% Natural and infused with minerals. The product serves two purposes, one to detoxify and secondly, to purify:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure Dead Sea Mud&lt;br /&gt;Organic Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;Organic Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;Organic Aloe Vera Juice&lt;br /&gt;Organic Calendula Oil&lt;br /&gt;Hickory Bark Extract&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium&lt;br /&gt;Sodium&lt;br /&gt;Potassium&lt;br /&gt;Calcium&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All products at InstaNatural are made in the USA and never animal tested&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application- I started by washing my face with mild soap or a simple face wash. I then applied a thin layer of mud mask. If applying on the face, avoid the eye and lip areas and any areas you may be sensitive to over-drying. I left the mask on for 20 minutes, however the directions state for 10 to 15 minutes until dry. I sometimes find some mud based masks work well after you shower, so I would apply and then use the water to wash my hands and just literally walk out with the mask on my face until 20 minutes would lapse. It&#x27;s my way of multi-tasking! You use warm water to gently remove the mask from the skin and I use wet paper towels for the edges I can&#x27;t get to (i.e. nose corners, along the hair line, ect.). This makes sure I do not stain any of our face towels. You then pat dry with a clean cloth and apply a good moisturizer to start nourishing the skin. I read on InstaNatural&#x27;s site, that they do not recommend using the Dead Sea Mud Mask more than once a week........doesn&#x27;t get easier when it comes to skin care regimens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to Expect- To avoid over-dryness, I made sure to stick to the directions and used the mask once a week for a 4-week period (I&#x27;m still using it and now it&#x27;s a main stay and a must have). The first time after leaving the Dead Sea Mud Mask for 20 minutes, I was left with a nice clean surface that was not over dry but had a nice clean sheen. I applied their retinol based moisturizer soon after to make sure I was nourishing my skin&#x27;s surface. As the days passed, I noticed my skin continuing to purge (i.e. clogged pores) and my pores looked and felt less (could not feel a bump) congested. On the second week of application, the main difference was that I did not experience any break-outs, which is a little odd for me. I always have a small pimple or little blackhead that is trying to become more than what it really is but I admit that I pick at them, so they get angry with me sometimes :). I had none and no irritations. It was easy to make this mud mask part of my &amp;#34;Sunday Face Clean&amp;#34; day. It&#x27;s the day that I try to make up for the week that I did not always have time to wash or primp my face like I wanted to. InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask let me reset the clock and pretend I was a good girl about my skincare routine. Pimples, acne, and any blackheads are a thing of the past and so little is needed to cover the surface of your skin. I also used it on my chest on a small blackhead that was indecisive about ruining my intro into 2015! Left it on for 15 minutes (sort of like a spot treatment) and overnight the redness diminished and it was nothing by day two. I also felt that my acne scars lightened and peeled at a quicker pace to reveal a nice skin&#x27;s surface that reflected no history of the blemish that resided there before! Easy to use and all the mask asks that you use it once a week......anyone can do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.

            <li> not as thick as we expected but seem good. So far so good, my skin was clean and soft after the first use. I fell that my skin was protected and more dynamic.</li>
            <li> First, I liked that this Insta Natural Dead Sea Mask only has about 10 ingredients and most of them are organic. It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, if any. When I applied it to my face, the mud mask wasn&#x27;t as thick as some other mud mask products I have tried in the past, a lot thinner in consistency. In my opinion, maybe to thing. It was soft and smooth, almost slimy feeling, making it easy to apply and spread out over my face. It can get a little messy, I had to be careful. I didn&#x27;t need much, a thin, even layer did the job. I applied the mask as directed, avoiding my eyes and lips. It felt cool going on, but no burning sensation like others I&#x27;ve tried. It didn&#x27;t take a long time to dry and harden, but not super fast either. The longer I kept it on, the harder the mask got. It did make my face start to itch as it did dry. I have really oily skin, so I left the mask on for about 15 - 20 minutes. I didn&#x27;t want to cause over drying. It was pretty easy to rinse off the mask with warm water. I preferred to rinse it off in the shower, just easier for me, personally. Afterward, my face did feel a little tight, but it also felt softer, smoother and just refreshed. I will continue to use this product once a week along with my daily facial cleansing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.

            <li> I am in love with this mud mask.  This Dead Sea Mud Mask goes on easily and dried within ten minutes.  The mask comes off easily and does not leave any residue on my skin.  My skin feels so soft and moisturized.  I use this once a week, and I do notice my pores are smaller.  Pores being smaller is a plus for me as I am at he 40 year old mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a teen and a tween that tried this mask.  They both loved how it cleaned their skin and how soft their skin felt after they used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product to review.  I am honest with my review.</li>
            <li> This is a Dead Sea Mask. What is it? It is a mask you put thinly a layer over your skin and then wait for it to dry. As it is drying it is working getting rid of dead skin and bacteria. Now I will warn you do not laugh it will hurt from the stretching and then the mask will not be as effective as if you didn&#x27;t laugh. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! As it is drying you will notice it going from a dark green gray to a lighten version of gray green. You leave the mask on between 10-15 mins. When it is fully dried it will look like holes on your face. That is normal, and is where the mask got deeper into the skin pulling impurities out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the mask I noticed my skin feeling smoother. Some of my black heads had been removed. It is always nice to have skin especially my nose with out black heads. I think they are every persons enemy. Now I didn&#x27;t try this time but I will. It suggest to use the mask on your sore muscles. I think if I did this I would put saran wrap over that area after I applied the mask.</li>
            <li> I am 51 &amp; I still struggle with acne, for crying out loud!  I recently started using the Dead Sea Mud Mask. It has little to no scent--yay!  I really like how it leaves my skin feeling after I use it.  I also like to use a little dab of it more frequently on that dreaded acne.  It helps them dry up much more quickly than they ever have with anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  And I have tried a lot through the years. I will definitely be buying this again after it&#x27;s gone, which won&#x27;t be for quite a while.  You get a generous amount and you don&#x27;t need to use very much at a time.  Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> With just the first use you can feel it working it&#x27;s magic. Only a thin layer of this very unique textured mud does the trick. It only takes a fraction of the time compared to other masks to dry. As it does you can feel your skin actually firming up. Keep in mind this was felt on my nose where excess skin is not available. This means my pores are feeling the crunch and I just love that. My pores have honestly seen better days and a mask like this is a miracle. My skin feels baby soft and looks rejuvenated after each use. My super sensitive skin was not irritated at all in any area. You do not use a large amount each time so the Insta Natural Dead Sea Mud Mask is worth way more than priced. I am so serious when I tell you this mask is outstanding. It not only made my skin look and feel awesome but my pesky blackheads didn&#x27;t even know what hit them. I suffer from them on my nose and have had a trouble of a time getting them to stay away. I really feel like with a consistent use of this product they will be gone forever. - See more at: http://www.frugalmomandwife.com/2015/01/insta-natural-dead-sea-mud-mask-review.html</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Use once a week to boost skin with vitamins and refresh for the upcoming week. Would definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but I like it...the texture is much lighter than a clay mask and goes on very thin. It is a gray color and almost a gel-like texture while you&#x27;re applying it but it dries to a matte clay-like texture. I felt some tingling and didn&#x27;t keep it on for too long but I have very sensitive skin. I did feel like my skin looked brighter after using it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My skin feels so soft and wonderful after using.</li>
            <li> This makes your face feel so fresh and rejuvenated! I love this and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I use this mask twice a week on my face and neck and absolutely love it! It leaves my face feeling SO clean and soft. I don&#x27;t find it irritating like most people had mentioned in other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face itchy or red at all. Some people claimed it made them break out after using but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s detoxing your skin... pulling the bad stuff out and it is possible you may break out a tiny bit but this mask also dries out any pimples you may have. I break out a long my jaw line and after using this one time, I could see a difference.</li>
            <li> I love this! Its a great product. Not really fond of the smell,but it does wonders for my skin</li>
            <li> I love that it has no scent. Too many products have an overpoweringly medicinal smell. The mask tingles as it dries, and leaves the skin feeling clean and smooth without dryness. My teenage daughter loves this as well as It lessens her acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product worked great! I&#x27;ve only used it 1 time and have already seen results. This mask literally pulled all the dirt and grease to the surface. I was washing away blackheads I didn&#x27;t know were there. My skin was so soft and smooth afterwards. Great product!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses this ad says she likes it. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell and she has not had any reactions to it yet.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! So happy with this!</li>
            <li> I really love this mud mask.&lt;br /&gt;All organic and natural ingredents, you can reallly feel it pulling all the impurities out of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin nice and clean but not dry.&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting more of this !</li>
            <li> Ive tried many facial masks but this one actually tightens my pores and helps to remove the impurities with in my skin. After applying and allowing it to dry, you can feel your skin tighten. Once its washed off you can tell a difference immediately. Its a great product for skin healing and cleaning properties.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smooths my skin.</li>
            <li> Every product I buy from this company is amazing! It&#x27;s amazing for my combination skin ! Even better after a relaxing bath! Lather it on sit there then rinse with your shower head! Different, yet amazing worth Every penny and it lasts a long time! I even seal it with two bobby pins then place it inside I a ziplock bag and leave it my bath water so it&#x27;s warm when I apply it! It&#x27;s refreshing!</li>
            <li> My mom loved this mask. I got it for her as a Christmas spa basket I made her. She said it definitely reduced redness and made her skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial mask!  The only negative to it is, after applying it, within minutes, my face begins to itch like crazy!  But that is a good thing because that is the mask pulling out the toxins.  You only want to do this one about once a week.</li>
            <li> I love this product, makes my skin glowing &amp; smooth</li>
            <li> This product is great. I was skeptical about how well it would work on my acne, but within a few days I could definitely see a noticeable difference. It says t leave the mask on for ten minutes, but I left it on for about 15 so it could completely dry. It made my face feel very tight. After washing it off my skin felt very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the mud mask 3 times and have not seen results yet so I think it&#x27;s too early to make a comment if it&#x27;s working or not but I will definitely give it more time and give another review.</li>
            <li> I worked with my Aesthetician for an entire year to help manage my skin.  One of her recommended products was a Dead Sea Mud Mask.  During my Express Mini Facials she would apply a Mud Mask to help restore my skin.  It was also suggested that I could do it at home 2 - 3 times a week.  The one she used was by B. Kamins.  I later purchased it for myself before trying InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNaturals Dead Sea Mud Mask is virtually the same...and at a much better price point.  I spent $50 for less than 4 ounces on the B. Kamins, and under $35 for 16 ounces.  AMAZING price point for Spa-Quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mud Masks work for all types of skin - I personally use it to help restore moisture and at times, clear up acne.  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This arrived, not sealed, with a tiny hair sticking out of it. I was looking forward to trying it, but I will toss it in the trash instead.</li>
            <li> This is great. I feel like it visibly reduces the size of my pores for some time after I have used it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great! It&#x27;s a little different to put on a dark face mask but I am definitely a repeat customer!! :)</li>
            <li> Love this masque. It&#x27;s the real deal-- Dead Sea minerals and it&#x27;s very dark black. The instructions suggest using a very thin layer.. and that is exactly how you should apply it. I found that the thin layer  was all I needed. The mask did get tighter and darker the longer I left it on. 30 minutes later I had lovely pink skin. That said, do be very careful to remove all the mask, checking hairline, around the nose and under the jawline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened it up, I touched it and it is mud but there is an unusual texture. If you tap the surface your finger(s) will bounce off the surface. It&#x27;s got a resilience. Also a little goes a long way....... a very long way. It&#x27;s a great deal . I like that i can use about 1.5 teaspoon on my face and not tablespoons of the goo. This works so well and it&#x27;s really  invigorating to the skin. I don&#x27;t use this as often as I should. I have another mud masque that smells like camphor and is not as good on my skin. (it&#x27;s also for drying out acne too so that could be the problem)&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is  so incredible. I highly recommend it for all but the most sensitive skin types. I am a skincare junkie and have tried a ton of products. This is one of the best ones I have seen in this category and the price point is very reasonable. Figure it will last about 6 months or more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a really pungent scent so it would be great for guys too.  Good  for those with acne as well. Even guys might like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for review purposes. Getting the product for free or a discount has no effect on the substance  or validity of the review.  I do reviews on my blog (LA-Story.com) as well and this will eventually make it there.&lt;br /&gt;I would have purchased this anyway since my child liked it too.</li>
            <li> It tighten my pores.. and it makes my face tighter as well...</li>
            <li> This is a Beautiful, Natural, Organic Mud Mask!  I have used many masks over the years, and this is my absolute Favorite.  It Glides on silky smooth.  You only need a little for your whole face and neck area.  You do Not need to put it on thick.  Just a thin film begins to work and dry instantly pulling out dirt and toxins.  This very large container will last a long time.  I even use it on my arthritic shoulder to naturally help pull out toxins and sooth that area.  Once a week application is what is recommended, and that really seems sufficient.  My skin was silky smooth after the easy wash off and pampering.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Surprised to see full sized product. Used once. Skin felt very clean and revitalized.</li>
            <li> just so so, not obvious changes on my face,maybe that will happen after one year application?</li>
            <li> This is another great product from InstaNatural, and part of their facial skin care line that I use. As of now it has done exactly what it says that it is suppose to do and will do. I use this about once a week, and it seems that it will last a while. I actually like the smell of this &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34;. It makes the skin on my face seem fresh and firm after using. I definitely like it and will continue using it. So this product is a winner in my book. I can honestly highly recommend this product. I count on Amazon reviews when I make purchases, and know that others do the same. I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying. If my review is helpful, let me know by checking helpful. This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 2 times a week for the last month or so maybe even a tad longer and I love it my face is a little less rough and my skin is just softer u can use it on your face and body I usually just do my face my arms and legs and feet my feet don&#x27;t have any rough spots anymore I love this product I definitely recommend this to family and friends!</li>
            <li> It useful for me. works great.</li>
            <li> Very thick, but works nice</li>
            <li> I just received my package a few days ago and had to try it the first night. I applied it as the directions stated, and left it on for the required time. It went on so smooth and creamy, and it was practically odorless. I really really love it. I feel like after the first treatment that my pores were smaller and skin firmer, and I&#x27;m in my early fifties, with aging skin problems. I would definitely purchase this item again. I&#x27;m so excited to have the opportunity to try this product and I will try to remember to come back an d write another review in a month, after I&#x27;ve had more time to use it.</li>
            <li> Love Dead Sea Minerals, always do wonders for my skin! Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> His mask feels soothing going on, and is spa like in texture and scent.  It is a dark gel, and doesn&#x27;t dry into a flakey powder like other masks.  It did get very tight when it dries, but when I rinse my skin it doesn&#x27;t feel, tight or dry.  I have oily, acne prone skin, so tried this as a spot treatment on blemishes.  It really didn&#x27;t feel drying.  I&#x27;ve used other masks that are more drying for this purpose, and I&#x27;d hoped this would be a replacement.  However, the tub is very large and reasonably priced, so I still feel that this is a great value for overall masks.</li>
            <li> My face feels so great after using this! Every Sunday night I use this and my oily acne prone skin feels fresh, my t-zone pores are noticeably smaller and I get less break outs after only 3 weeks of use! I love it and highly recommend this! If you also have an oily, acne prone, large pore but also sensitive skin, then this is for you too :)</li>
            <li> Awesome ingredients. Left my skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on the skin and upon drying my face i could feel this tenderness in my complexion, my sister in law is a dermatologist she highly recommends this product says it&#x27;s a good way to detoxify and clear your skin and evenly distribute the oil glands in your complexion. Indulge your skin with the proper natural care that&#x27;s my motto i don&#x27;t like using much chemicals specially on my face so i really liked this mask i will surely buy it again. Before using it i used to use all natural oils and herbs they also work great.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses, I have noticed an improvement with oily spots on my face as well as evening out the complexion on my face.</li>
            <li> Only tried it twice and so far, I absolutely love it.  Makes my skin feel soft and refreshed like nothing else.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  I had never used a mask before.  Now is part of my routine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  My skin is beautiful after 2 weeks I do Not have marks in muy skin.  I am amazing.</li>
            <li> Love, love, this mask.</li>
            <li> What was life like before this and why haven&#x27;t I heard of this before.  It is totally amazing!!!! My face felt twenty years younger!!!!! My husband also used this in his dry hands and it&#x27;s almost call cleared up. Five stars is not enough! !!!!</li>
            <li> Soft natural smell. Many of theae have made my skin sting and burn. I do not get that with this. Sensation is soothing and cool, I have noticed a difference in just a few uses in the texture of my skin. My skin is much smoother, make up glides in without gooping into my poors etc. I live in an area that is very humid in the summer, makes me feel oil and greasy on nose and upper cheeks. When I use this my skin feels smooth, non greasy and pleasant. Love it.</li>
            <li> Before even receiving the product I was&lt;br /&gt;sent email instructions on how to use it, which I found to be very helpful, more so than trying to read the small texts off the jar. I&#x27;ve used the mud mask only once  but really liked the results so far. However good the product is, the customer service was what won me over.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really moisturizing, but it does leave my skin feeling smooth and clean after use. Helps soothe blemishes as well.</li>
            <li> Very good for deep cleaning face</li>
            <li> On my first use I could feel the difference I give this product  a 5 star</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. You only need to apply it once per week.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mask!  Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product. I&#x27;ve used it four times now. Once a week. It drys out my skin. I have oily skin but even though the pores on my face feel tight after washing off, my skin does not feel moisturized at all. I can get tight feeling pores with a bottle of witch hazel. One thing that I strongly recommend is that the product is washed off with a bath cloth. I noticed that I&#x27;d not completely washed the product off after looking in my magnifying mirror and saw that there was still &#x27;mud&#x27; in some of my pores that made them look like blackheads. I&#x27;ve only written about half a dozen negative reviews on items I&#x27;ve purchased over the years but this just had to be one of them. I&#x27;ll use the product beings as I have it but would not recommend it or buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Really cleared my skin, which is sensitive.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I love how it feels when I put it on my face, and it has been helping my skin look clearer and more youthful!</li>
            <li> Great product with real results!! Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> amazing so far! my skin has cleared up, can&#x27;t wait to see how it&#x27;ll be after a few months of using it. Definitely way better than the aztec healing clay!</li>
            <li> This has been a great mask, leaves my skin smooth and definitely works on blemishes too.</li>
            <li> I expected it to have more salt in it.  More effectiveness for acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li> i just used 2 times but i feel it that it works.</li>
            <li> Nice product, will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this line of beauty products! I have dry skin in the winter and more oils during the hot humid months. I have been using this 1x a week and it really helps to remove dead skin cells. Can&#x27;t say enough about InstaNatural&#x27;s. I have the serum, the vitamin C, and the eye serum now. I can tell a difference in my skin. My face is more even toned, smooth, and it actually seems to help reduce my wrinkles. I would recommend all of the products they offer! Great company and great prices.</li>
            <li> i love this mask....my skin looks so nice after using it. and this jar will last for forever!</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and quick to dry.  Also not messy and easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> I would like to revise my earlier review of 2 stars to 5. I was very disappointed in the condition that my order was in when received. The jar was wrapped in cellophane and covered with product as the lid was cracked, the seal was broken,which allowed the leakage. Very shortly after my review was posted I heard from the vendor who apologized and is sending me a new jar to replace the damaged one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the product, I LOVE it so far (I&#x27;ve only used it once as once a week is what was recommended) and my very sensitive skin reacted well to Insta Naturals Mud Mask. It&#x27;s too early to see any results but I loved how soft and smooth my skin felt and am confident that results aren&#x27;t too faraway.</li>
            <li> Really cool! Works on my skin like magic. Acne reduced and skin softer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Dead Sea Mud Mask that was sent to me by Insta Natural and I&#x27;m enjoying it. You get soooo much product in this huge container. It can be used anywhere on the body as a detoxifying mask, which is really cool. I&#x27;ve never owned anything like this. My skin feels super soft after using it and I don&#x27;t find that it&#x27;s irritating at all (I have really sensitive skin). I think this is due to the natural ingredients.The consistency of the mask seems pretty thin when it&#x27;s first applied. You don&#x27;t need all that much for your entire face.When the mud mask is dry and I can&#x27;t move my face, I wipe away the mask with warm water and a washcloth, then wash my face one more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit my blog for more information: http://itsthelifeofalady.blogspot.com/2015/01/pamper-me.html</li>
            <li> Deep cleaned my pores without drying out my skin. I don&#x27;t have acne, so I can&#x27;t attest to how the mask works for that condition. The product just leaves my face feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> I love this 100% natural face cleansing product made from real mud from the sacred Dead Sea. It is was so easy to use. I just applied the mud directly to my face and just rubbed it in using small circular motions to evenly coat my face avoiding my eyes. I left it on for about 15 minutes and as the mud dried I could feel it tingling all over and I new that it was working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the 15 minutes was over and the mud was dry and cracking, I grabbed a wet wash cloth and gently rubbed off the mud. My face looked amazing. Not only did my face look and feel cleaner I felt great knowing it is all natural with minerals and organic ingredients and it left my skin radiant and refined. No more white heads and greasy looking skin for me.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product . Mud masks are always very good for your skin and leave you a very purified skin after using it. The box is about 16 oz/200 ml and the consistency of the product is actually very light. Feels like a cream with a thicker consistency. It has no smell and it is very easy to apply and remove. It dries in 10/15 minutes. I only use it once a week since it is pretty strong. I avoid any sensitive area such as my eye one. A small amount go a long way. My skin after applying it was a  little red for a small amount of time but my pores where looking amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse skin first before applying the mud mask. It can be applied on wet or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Apply a small patch test first on a small area of skin to ensure no adverse reactions.&lt;br /&gt;Distribute a small amount of mud mask onto the face with your fingertips using circular and upward motions.&lt;br /&gt;The mud mask should feel cooling and soothing to the skin at first, but should then quickly start to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;Allow the mud mask to dry for 10-15 minutes. Once dried, remove the mud mask by using warm water and circular motions. You can also use a damp warm cloth to help remove the mud mask if necessary. Simply let the warm towel rest on your face for 5-10 seconds in order to loosen the mask, then gently wipe the mask off. Be careful not to scrub or agitate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The  Dead Sea Mud Mask can be used on the body as well for a full-body detoxifier.&lt;br /&gt;Due to the high concentration of minerals, we recommend using the mud mask once a week. Excessive use may lead to drying out or irritating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Instead of applying the mud mask to the entire face, you can also use it as a spot treatment on blemishes to help remove excess oil from targeted areas and sooth irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I was always leery of mud masks. My brain told me mud stunk and just the smell would be miserable. Imagine my surprise when I opened up Instanatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask and there was no scent to be found! I applied the mask using an old brush, to get the perfect thin application. The mud is soft and non-gritty. I was surprised to experience a tame cooling sensation. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was supposed to happen, but I really enjoyed it. As the mask dried, it started to become tight and itchy. I expected the tightness, but not the itchiness. I powered through for ten minutes, then just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. The mask came off easily with just a rag and warm water. My skin felt soft and refreshed afterward. The week&#x27;s end blackheads were gone and the dry patches were soothed.&lt;br /&gt;In general, I love this mask. The only thing that drove me over the edge was the itching, but as a weekly or bi-weekly treatment, the benefit is worth the few minutes of itching. (Ignore the funny look, something about mud on my face spurred funny faces).&lt;br /&gt;I received a product free for review. All opinions are my own and I am not obligated to post a positive review.</li>
            <li> I was recently given the opportunity to review Dead sea mud mask from InstaNatural and I have found that Yes it does work! Upon opening this jar I was a little unsure though. It looks pretty gooey, not going to lie! It is kind of a slimy, murky mud but I went ahead and slapped it on! There is no reason that your daily beauty process cannot be relaxing at the same time.  I applied the mud mask and relaxed for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the mask to work its wonders the first time Im going to be honest my skin did start to itch I was afraid I was having a bad reaction but I feel that it was actually purging out impurities because after that first initial use I have not had no more itchiness when applying and my skin looks amazing  this mud mask has  improved my  skin’s appearance. What I honestly can say is that  I loved it!  you only have to use it once a week which is also great! I have used this product a couple of times now and I am really  enjoying the benefits of it. I feel like it has given me a great glow that I can carry around with me throughout the day. Also my makeup looks a lot better since my acne is becoming less noticeable since using Insta Natural dead sea mud mask.  also I notice my skin complexion looks more even and brighter which  now I don’t use as much makeup as before. Never was the type of girl to pay attention to all the lotions, masks etc.. but this is a product that I would definitely purchase not only for myself but for my friends. The jar is 16 oz and I’m guessing it will last a while, you don’t have to use a lot of product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically review products but I felt that I needed to warn people about this product. The reviews listed have clearly demonstrated how effective this mask can be for some people, however, they don&#x27;t showcase the other side of it as much. I&#x27;ve just recently washed this mask off of my face and have never wished more for a cold bucket of water to dunk my face in. I&#x27;ve tried many skin care products and have never had a reaction like I&#x27;m having right now so I wasn&#x27;t hesitant to try this product by any means. I also wouldn&#x27;t have considered myself to have sensitive skin. After about 10 minutes, I felt a slight burning/tingling sensation on my face and the mask was nearly dry so I started to wipe it off with a warm wash cloth as suggested. My cheek looked promising initially as my pores appeared smaller. As I continued to wipe more off I was horrified by how red my face was starting to become. After getting all of it off, I quickly washed my face with gentle cleansing soap to be sure I had gotten all of it off. Now it&#x27;s probably been 45 minutes since removing the mask and the area around my mouth still feels like it&#x27;s on fire and the redness has only mildly subsided. I look like I&#x27;ve gone outside for too long with sunglasses on as there&#x27;s a distinct line around where I stopped the product under my eyes and other areas. While the jar does say discontinue if redness or irritation occurs, I feel like there could have been more information regarding potential ingredients that people may react to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to my adverse reaction to the product I think they should be doing more with the packaging of this product. When you receive the product it just comes in the jar that is pictured. There is no clear plastic wrapping around the outside of the jar to ensure that the product hasn&#x27;t potentially been tampered with. I&#x27;d hoped there would be a clear plastic lining over the top when I opened the jar but there wasn&#x27;t. It made me feel like there was no way to be 100% sure that this item hadn&#x27;t been used and returned or tampered with prior to receiving it. The only thing you can go off of with packaging like this is the distributor&#x27;s word for it.</li>
            <li> when i received it today, the protection seal was not properly sealed. And the mud was 1/4 gone. unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;updated: I received a second product. It looked like the same. So i guess it wasn&#x27;t used, it&#x27;s just the seal were not properly sealed.</li>
            <li> Wow. This is my second time using it and i have to say that i am completely amazed with this mask. I have never been one to use a mask before i try this and im happy i did, because this will stay on my list as my face mask to buy and will be using only this. This time though, i put way too much on my face and it took a long time to dry out. It also irritated my skin, and when i washed it off with cool water, i felt like i had a sunburn, it look like i got a sunburn too, which goes to show that it does works. My face was red like a tomato everywhere the mask was. Well that was my fault. Just a warning, do not apply a thick layer. It does work, my pores have shrinks down a lot, my face feel smooth. I am 37 years old and this is amazing. It does gives you a younger looking skin, smoother I really recommend this ! I will be buying again for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask. I have tried many masks and I enjoy trying new ones. This one is by far one of the best sea mud masks I have used. It does on thinly, but it dries to your face. When you slowly scrub it off, it exfoliates away all the dead skin. It leaves your skin feeling very soft, and new. It gets rid of some blackheads and other nasties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make your face slightly pink from the scrubbing. But that foes away quickly. Overall, I would say this scrub is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> Dont see much effects</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff. I wish I had known about it sooner. It really cleaned my skin and made it feel softer and smoother. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This has helped relieve the red, irritated blemishes my teen has developed. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> As a man when it comes to shaving, it hurts.  I have used this for two weeks and my neck area feels so much better it is almost like I really do not want to shave again.  The mud gets into the pores and just takes away all those ingrown hairs that come back again and again.  I really like this product it works.  I will return for more and I have given it to my family t use as well we all love it.  Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EdRF</li>
            <li> invigorating and refreshing,it left my skin so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t used it but twice, and while I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable changes in tone or texture, it does leave my skin feeling clean without feeling dried out. Something tells me using it regularly over this summer is going to be beneficial. I plan to edit my review with more information once I&#x27;ve used the mask for a couple of months. For the record, I have 31 year old skin that&#x27;s combination to oily, prone to clogged pores, and has brown spots from hormones. I&#x27;m basically workin with one wrinkle, right smack dab in the middle of my forehead, so I&#x27;ll be sure to update readers should the tone and texture show improvement from regular use of this mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask once every week for a few months. I have moderate cystic acne and was hoping it would reduce the inflammation. However, the mask only exacerbated the redness and dried out my sensitive skin. I stopped using the mask two weeks ago and my face already looks clearer and feels less inflamed. If you have sensitive or dry skin, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> There are so many things I loved about this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the smell, there is no real smell to it. Many mud masks either have a very unpleasant odor or they add so much fragrance to it to mask the scent it irritates you. With this mask there was no real scent at all which I loved. I have sensitive skin so many of the masks that had heavy perfumes bother my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second I love how much you get in this container. It is huge! Since it is only recommended that you use this once a week you will have months worth of treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, its made in the USA and it really works great. It made my skin feel so smooth without being harsh on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have never used a Mud Mask before and was not sure what to expect. Opening up the jar I saw what looked like Mud Jello. If you could make jello out of dirt, that is what you would get. It smelled like minty dirt. It was cold going on and did not seem to irritate my notoriously sensitive skin. I left the mask on for a little longer than 15 minutes as a few spots by my cheeks were not dry yet. It took a little to wash off and my skin was really red after for a few hours. I don&#x27;t think it was a reaction to the mask, but more of a reaction to being scrubbed since I gave myself a facial while testing this product and the exfoliant may have irritated my skin a little. I would buy this again. And again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I tried it again without the harsh exfoliant and I was correct; the mask did not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*InstaNatural sent me a free jar to review. They did not pay me for a good review. They just sent me the free sample and asked I check it out.**</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I love this face mask! I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and I have developed mild acne in the last year. I&#x27;ve tried many different products but this mud mask beats them all. My skin is looking so much better after using this 3 times per week. My pores are a lot smaller, my skin is looking younger and my acne is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> I am still learning what this product is capable of.  Since I have been using it for only one week,  it is difficult to judge the results.  I purchased it to see if it would reduce facial scaring from squamous cell removal and enlarged pores.  It seems to be helping with both.  I am applying it nightly on the effected areas , however, and removing it in the morning.  A secondary benefit seems to be the reduction of pain.  I burned my thumb on hot metal, and out of curiosity I applied the mud.  The pain disappeared almost immediately.  I will definitely continue using and experimenting.  Many thanks for this unique product.</li>
            <li> Wanting a nice face masl? This is the one for you.</li>
            <li> I put this on per the instructions. I left it on until it was dry even though it itched like crazy. When I washed it off my face was very red and stayed that way for hours. I tried this a week later and did not let it completely dry. No redness. In spite of that, it feels good going on, seems hard to get off and then  I can&#x27;t really tell that it did anything. There are better Dead Sea Masks out there.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask. It takes longer than expected to dry (and I live in a very dry climate), so I have to give myself an extra ten minutes to allow for dry time. My face is also pretty red for about 15 minutes after removing the mask, but afterwards my skin is so clear and smooth and lovely! It also takes very little to cover my whole face, so this jar should last a nice long time!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and this does not aggravate it at all.  After using it, my pores are super clean and my skin looks smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my face feel and look! I&#x27;ve been using it awhile and I think its a good product for SKINCARE maintenance but not so much as curing any real problems. I don&#x27;t have horrible skin to begin with...i have occasional breakouts around period time, but for the most part, it&#x27;s prettly subtle. The jar says not to use it no more than once a week. I&#x27;ve used it twice only because once a week to me is not enough. And nothing happened. I&#x27;m not sure what will be the long term effects of using it twice, but I&#x27;ll update within a month or two if anything happens! (I pray not) Thanks for reading. There&#x27;s a God in heaven who loves You.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice a week for two weeks and its great. It works on the really small blackheads and prevents more from forming. don&#x27;t cake it on too thick! Just a thin coat works. Great product !!</li>
            <li> I use it once a week and I can see and feel the effect of this mask! I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask once a week for the last month.  The first time I used it i broke out afterwards, but I think that it just brought a lot of impurities to the surface of my skin.  This has not happened since.  I feel like this mask has improved the tone of my skin.  I feel like the color is more uniform and the texture is more smooth.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> i got this for a $ 1 to review from the company but i&#x27;ve also purchased many of their products..I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now &amp; this mask is great! i haven&#x27;t had any issues like others &amp; i have combo skin that leans sensitive plus acne.  it&#x27;s not drying to my skin &amp; i use it on my back as well.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it. i&#x27;ve used other brands of dead sea mask that have irriated my skin. this one didn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is a plus for me. i won&#x27;t need to restock for a while but I will repurchase once it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> this stuff is GR8!!!!!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This mask is by far the best mud mask I have ever used. It leaves the skin feeling fresh and clean and the mud is easy to wash off. There isn&#x27;t a musk smell to it like other brands and it has reduced my acne by at least 50%. It also doesn&#x27;t sting or leave your face dry yet my oily skin has been much more manageable since I started using the product. Thank you a hundred times over!</li>
            <li> The product has a lot of mud in the jar. It&#x27;s not skimpy at all. The mud is not too hard to smooth over your face.&lt;br /&gt;I used this mask as a traditional mask where it dries and I washed it off and I used it in the shower as a scrub when I didn&#x27;t have time to let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;Both ways it makes my skin feel clean and look good.</li>
            <li> amazing product. Skin is looking fabulous and more improved after only one use. Highly recommend. Also, have had a lovely experience with customer service as well!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!! even tones the skin while extracting impurities. ideal for oily skin! Very comparable to the products sold in the Malls here in the National Capital Region but at only a 1/3 of their cost</li>
            <li> The product is great.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I use once a week all over and sometimes in between on problem areas. Really great for clearing out pores!</li>
            <li> Superb mask! I am so impressed with this marvelous natural product. I cannot wait to try more from their line. This mud mask renews my skin to that of a newborn--smoothing out my fine lines &amp; working miracles on any problem areas. I am using it once a week. I look like I have been visiting a spa &amp; an amazing facialist! High recommendation from me!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this since january and i have got to say its worth every penny</li>
            <li> look how many 5 stars they received then you know it works.</li>
            <li> I have used the mud mask for almost a month now and I don&#x27;t see any changes. It&#x27;s actually drying out my skin. Therefore, I don&#x27;t use it anymore. I heard dead sea products was good to use, but this is my 2nd dead sea product I&#x27;ve used and was not at all happy with it.</li>
            <li> instanatural is a great company and this product is no different from their others in quality. Love the big jar you get and the mask feels amazing - works wonderfully - and you can be confident regarding the ingredients. Thanks for another great product to slow the aging process and make my skin look great!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific mask!  I use it once a week and my skin feels so soft and looks so clear, almost glowing afterwards!  I buy a lot of products from InstaNatural because they are organic and effective.  They are also provide excellent customer service and I&#x27;m proud to be a customer.</li>
            <li> I love the texture! It really makes my skin feel clean and amazing when done! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Just received! Came opened and already used half bottle! Disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Least favorite of the instranatural products.  The directions aren&#x27;t clear.  The mud is messy, and I did not see any improvement on my skin after several uses.  Not to mention it gets the bathtub full of black when you are rinsing it off.  Not worth the money or the time spent on this product.</li>
            <li> Quickly delivery and is a great product. My wife and daughter have both enjoyed this mask.</li>
            <li> This makes me feel so clean and leaves my skin so soft. Have noticed my pores are not as large as before.</li>
            <li> Its about time I gave this product a review. I bought this back in February, and I&#x27;ve been using it weekly ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask, I have never tried a mud mask. I have tried Korean facial masks in the past but while it was relaxing to use, I never felt any effects. Whats more, those masks had to be used quite often compared to this one which is just once a week. Anyways, I really wanted to treat my skin to something and I was a bit hesitant at first to purchase this product because of the price. However, the size and effect of this mud mask made it absolutely worth it to get. My skin becomes so soft after washing the mud mask off. Aside from this mask helping my slight acne and oily face problem, I noticed it lightened some of my blackheads. My blackheads are pretty deep, they are not the ones that can be pulled off with those nose strips so I was really happy to see the mask improving its condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my family try it (I mean, hey, there is A LOT in this jar) and they absolutely love it as well! It leaves your face soft and smooth. I recommend this to anyone! Its truly wonderful and I am impressed with InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> have started using it once a week, makes my skin feeling fresh and soft. love the mud mask so far.</li>
            <li> You get so much product! !&lt;br /&gt;more then I expected. .thanks instanatural!</li>
            <li> Love the way this cleans my face. Makes my fave soft and looks like I just rexived a facial.</li>
            <li> So far it has been a great product.  I loved how my skin feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> I loved this product!  It left my face feeling soft and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on nicely and you can feel it working, it U clogs your pours and leaves soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try you will love it!</li>
            <li> Great mask that dries quickly and cleans my pores. The first time I used it I glopped on two layers because the first layer didn&#x27;t seem to be thick enough to work well. The double layers took about 30 minutes to dry. I now use just one layer that dries in less than 15 minutes and does a fantastic job. Feels very tight when dry but that&#x27;s just because its working. Highly recommend for use in between facials.</li>
            <li> really liked the mask, it has already helped my skin! highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial mask product. I search for products made with all natural ingredients and with the absence of ingredients that I can&#x27;t even pronounce. Not only is this an all natural product, but they use organic sources of the ingredients. This 16 oz jar is a great value due to the fact that you only need to use a thin coat per application. I like that it doesn&#x27;t stink like others that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Also, I like that it works fast, just 10-15 minutes to achieve clean skin. As it is drying, I can visual it is pulling impurities from my skin, leaving me with a clean, fresh feel.</li>
            <li> My skin is absolutely glowing and feels so soft! Amazing product!</li>
            <li> This product made my skin really dry.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using this Facial Mask.  It is a large jar and you only put on a thin layer each time.  It starts to dry quickly and pulls the oil and dirt out of your skin.  It washes off easily and your face feels really soft after.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It left my face feeling smooth and refreshed after the first use.  I am looking forward to trying again and making it apart of my daily routine.  My skin is sometimes dry and flaky but my skin feels more hydrated then before.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice a week and it is outstanding.  I have really oily acne prone skin, but this has cured me of breakouts.  My skin looks radiant!</li>
            <li> This mask works so great on my dry skin! It has all natural ingredients and you get a really big tub of it so it will last forever!  It really cleans out my pores and gives my skin a nice glow. My face is soft and supple after using it!</li>
            <li> This gentle, easy to use mud left my skin feeling smooth and clean</li>
            <li> Love this - face feels really clean after using.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  Feels like your at the spa!</li>
            <li> My pores feel better already! I haven&#x27;t done a face mask since I was about 12 (I am in my 20s now) and this has made me remember why I love them so much! The application was easy. It was definitely a foreign feeling since it has been so long since I did one, but when I took it off, my face looked 100x better! Thank you InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> Very good! Left my face feeling great!</li>
            <li> This facial mask has cleared up pores I thought would never go away !! I am pleased with the results of this facial mask. Works better then any I have tried. Received this product free in return for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I loved this it made my skin look brighter. It takes about 2 weeks before you can see the difference. But it is a great product</li>
            <li> This mud mask is extraordinary at clearing up breakouts and purifying your skin. I absolutely love it. And it&#x27;s a massive jar, you can use it all over your body, and it still lasts for ages, making it a good deal to boot. It&#x27;s great to use as a spot treatment for zits overnight as well. InstaNaturals rocks!</li>
            <li> ummmm, I purchased this and when I got it, the product was half used and opened....hoping to get my money back for this mess.</li>
            <li> The seal was already broken when I got this product and the jar seemed only half full. I am not sure if this is a defective piece and whether I should use in on my skin. Not happy at all...!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it as a little bit too expensive but after trying it out I could see why. I really liked this dead sea mask because when you put it on, you can actually feel the sensation of your skin tightening and becoming clean! As soon as I wash it of, my face feels very clean and fresh. It&#x27;s going to be a little itchy when it&#x27;s drying but it&#x27;s totally worth it. I recommend that you only use it once a week. Also I was very happy when I received an instructional e-mail from the company to my e-mail to help me out. The seller was very courteous!</li>
            <li> This is awesome. I love how I can feel the mask drying on my face. It&#x27;s almost like I can feel the oil leaving. It also has exfoliating properties that I love. Make sure you follow the directions and start with a &amp;#34;clean face&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t use more than once a week. 😊</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth I will use this product for life.</li>
            <li> good but i ve got used product cover has been opened and about 1/4 was missed</li>
            <li> Arrived on time works great</li>
            <li> This is a wonder mud mask. It was not harsh on my sensitive skin. I used it and then afterwards washing my face my skin was incredibly smooth and soft. It felt so refreshing. My skin tone is already evening out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the mud mask I put jojoba oil on my face and it&#x27;s a beautiful combo! Overall very content with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I had been using it but this week (July 6) I saw it work its magic. I had/have an acne breakout and I had 4 huge pimples on Monday night. I scrubbed my face with Clarins scrub and then applied the mud mask. After 10 minutes, I rinsed my face. The pimples were visibly smaller. I thought it was because of the drying effect. I woke up this morning and they were almost invisible. I am confident they will be gone by Thursday. It is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: July 9... pimples gone. A+++</li>
            <li> Feels great going on-so cool and refreshing! Skin feels great after using this.  Would definitely buy it again. Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright so far. I will update when I have used it longer. But a plus side is that there isn&#x27;t a mud smell to it! Actually I don&#x27;t really smell anything. It goes on pretty thin but all you have to do is go around once and then do it a second time if you want.</li>
            <li> I could feel it working as soon as I put it on!  You can feel it pulling the out the impurities.  I love InstaNatural. Their products are always beyond what you expect.</li>
            <li> I love the feel on my face and it really feels clean after. My daughter who is 15 uses 1 a week to help dry up her break outs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this mask! Finally, at 37 years old, I&#x27;ve found something that really works on my break outs!  There is ample amount in the jar for tons of applications!!</li>
            <li> This mask had a very nice and smooth texture to it. Easy and clean to apply compared to many other mud masks. Unfortunately after about ten minutes my face itched like crazy. Really wanted this to work with my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for so long.  It was everything I was hoping it would be.  It felt so refreshing and really gave my face a great glow.  I think it even helped with my hormonal acne.  I can&#x27;t wait to try it as a detoxifier on my entire body.</li>
            <li> I have never used a mud mask before. I have used it three times since I got it. You can only use this product once a week. As you rub the mud on your face you wait for it to dry 15 minutes or so then wash it off. My skin has been looking great.</li>
            <li> I like that this is not too drying yet it&#x27;s helped zap a couple blemishes quickly. I like to do a face mask once a week since I&#x27;m prone to break outs so I will be adding this to my mask rotation (sometimes I&#x27;ll use bentonite clay, other times I&#x27;ll use Queen Helen&#x27;s mint julep mask or the Proactiv sulfur mask). I&#x27;ve found that alternating the masks yields better results for me.</li>
            <li> Feels like I&#x27;ve gone to the spa! Very happy with this so far!!</li>
            <li> You really cant go wrong with this is product. It leaves your face feeling refreshed and brighter</li>
            <li> This mud mask really tightens up your skin and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> The seal was open when i received it. i still used it but it burned my skin. I only put it on for 10 minutes. Now you exactly can tell where I put the product on my face as all the edges are red...my face has never been like this before:(</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter and I use this once a week.  Best mask I have found.  It makes my skin look amazing.  My daughter also uses it as a spot treatment for her acne.  Clears her skin right up.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It actually gave me break out on my face. I rarely have pimples, and this was my frist application so I am afraid to use it again.</li>
            <li> This mask is great to where I will get compliments within a few days of using it.  It is gentle without over drying the skin, effective and a super value.  I use it on both my face and back.  It rinses off really well with almost no traces on a toner pad.  It brings deep blackheads to the surface for easy extraction, even the ones that will challenge an esthetician during a facial.  I prefer it to more expensive brands like Glamglow.</li>
            <li> This mask clears my skin, seems brighter more radiant after use.  I would recommend this product and all other Insta Natureal skin products.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mask.  I use it once a week and makes my skin so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once since I purchased it but I absolutely love it! I could feel it tightening on my skin. I have fairly sensitive skin and did get a little red after I used the mask but it went away pretty fast. My skin felt amazing! As soon as my roommate came home, I had her try it as well. She also loved it. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this mask. Works very well and leaves the skin super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Made my skin smooth and reduced pore sizes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews so I felt I need to add my stars as well. This is great stuff and it works. I purchased it for my son to treat his acne. I tried it to test it out myself. Both our faces were clean and smooth. So far used it twice and both times saw immediate results.</li>
            <li> The product contains lots of other greasy supplements. Sea mud was a small portion of the product. That was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this mud mask. It is easy to apply and remove. It has a smooth consistency and made my skin feel cleaner and softer. I noticed improvements in problem areas on my face, and I am surprised with how thorough this mask cleanses. It even smells amazing. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a rejuvenating mud mask.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it on my face, neck and chest and get in a hot bath for about 15-20 minutes. It makes my skin really soft, but be sure to moisturize after or you&#x27;ll feel dry because the clay is pulling the natural oils (and junk!) out of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I really like about this product is that it&#x27;s not super messy. I&#x27;ve used other mud masks that were super messy and actually clogged the drain. This product doesn&#x27;t even leave a ring around the tub.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smoother and clean. It tingled during the drying process but felt great</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this to be a superior mask. If you just like the thought of having a mask, this will do it for you.  I purchase products like this because I expect results down the road.  I&#x27;ve used masks for years, that clear my skin, make pores seem less noticeable, etc.  I didn&#x27;t find this product to change anything.  I gave it some time, but found nothing to note.</li>
            <li> This product irritates my skin, i think i&#x27;m allergic or something like that</li>
            <li> good stuff it performs as stated and this amount with only having to use once a week should last a very long time unless you use fore body as well of course,when it drys it kind of stiffen which can be a little mildly itchy kind of the effect of when your nose itches at the dentist because you can&#x27;t touch it but a little less,best way I can describe.but it does a good job and that was just the first use so it is well worth the money it softened yet firmed the skin which helps withe large pores looseness and other problems.</li>
            <li> My fiancé and I both use this and we feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li> I used it as a body spa once or twice a month. My skin feels so soft and smooth. I absolutely love this. Who needs to go to expensive spa if you have this.. Will definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using it, i feel it does help my face glow with a better complexion. It&#x27;s nice to be wind down in the evening with a mask without having to set foot in spa.</li>
            <li> Refreshing for ALL skin types.  Love anything dead sea mud related.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always willing to try a new product and when a friend recommended this to me, I thought hey, why not. I&#x27;m more than happy I followed her recommendation. I use this mask once a week (mud mask Mondays) and my skin feels and looks great afterward. I added it to my usual nightly routine and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I will admit that it looks a little daunting, considering it&#x27;s a very dark grey, almost black goo that you then smear allover your face. Go for it, though. Your skin will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not, however, recommend this product to someone with naturally dry or sensitive skin. It might be a bit too much for those skin types to handle. However, if you have normal or oily skin, this product is fantastic. My skin is normal and I don&#x27;t generally have trouble with acne, so I can&#x27;t speak to its helpfulness in that area.</li>
            <li> Works well without over drying.</li>
            <li> One was opened and the other one was sealed, disgusting!</li>
            <li> This made my face look so nice. Tightened my pores.</li>
            <li> I follow the directions and use the mask only once per week.  It has made my skin more hydrated, toned and radiant.  It is a very large jar that will last a very long time.  I am such a fan of InstaNatural and will continue using and trying out new products.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Received quickly from seller.</li>
            <li> I started using this line of products a few months ago after reading several positive reviews. I&#x27;m 36 have always battled severe acne and discoloration. It&#x27;s generally horrible. I started with just the serum, then added the cleanser, then the night cream, then the toner and now the mask. Overall, this combination of products has drastically improved the look feel and overall health of my skin. I now can wear less makeup and even feel comfortable wearing my hair out of my face on a regular basis. This mask is the first mask I have ever been able to use that doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to erupt the day after use and doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin at all. I love the way my skin feels after I&#x27;ve used it. I&#x27;ve never felt better about my own face and it&#x27;s because I decided to invest in a line of quality products that actually works for me. I have tried several other product lines on both the mainstream cosmetic side and the natural side resulting in poor or nightmarish results. There&#x27;s something about this line that just works for me and I&#x27;m so thankful.  I may sound a little dramatic here but for me it&#x27;s a big deal. Being able to actually like the skin on my face has been a big life changer for me.  I recommend this line to anyone with combination and sensitive skin. It all takes a little getting used to but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with masks of all kinds, and was so excited when I got a coupon code so I could review this. The texture is more like a jelly than a mud, and was fun to squish before I applied it. It went on easily enough, but when it was dried, my face felt stingy and burny, which I wasnt psyched about. I frantically washed it off in the shower, and was amazed at how soft and smooth my face was! It feels awesome, and aside from some redness that quickly went away, it was flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive, dry to combo skin, and I&#x27;m starting to get older, so if that sounds like you, this will help a lot. However the burning of it in the last 30 seconds was very uncomfortable which is why I deducted a star.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite mud mask I&#x27;ve ever used. I received this to review from Instanatural. I have tried pretty much all of their products and they&#x27;re all super high quality. This line is awesome. This mud mask makes my skin feel SO SO Clean and awesome. I LOVE IT! The container is huge and will last me forever, but I&#x27;d definitely repurchase</li>
            <li> I received this mask for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to try this mud mask because it contains Dead Sea minerals. I don&#x27;t usually do masks especially like this one so I tried it. I put the mask on as directed avoiding my lip and eye area and placed a thin layer onto my face and built it up because I wanted an even layer. I had no idea the mask was going to harden . As it did I got an itchy prickly feel on my skin. I waited with the mask on for about 15 minutes after that I rinsed with warm water then it patted it dry with a paper towel. My face felt tight and the itchiness went away and I had a bit of redness left on my skin. After that I just moisturized my face with some argan oil and the redness went away and my skin felt better. I can only use this mask once a week because of it&#x27;s drying agents but I know this mask will leave great beneficial results because it&#x27;s taking away all the impurities on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now and I have noticed a huge difference from my face before this product, and after. I have problems with acne deep under the skin, and using this twice a week after washing my face has made most of my acne go away! It works wonders and also makes my face feel smooth and firm. I have combination skin so I have have the best of the oily world and dry world.. but using this product takes all of the oily-ness my skin has and reduces my pore size by a considerable amount. Will recommend this product, and looking forward to trying more of their products~</li>
            <li> I love this dead sea mud mask. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the color of it. I don&#x27;t know why but for some reason its just unappealing for me. Any ways other than that its amazing. I&#x27;ve been using once a week since I&#x27;ve gotten to review. My face feels and looks amazing since using. It has really helped shrink my huge pores and I do not have blackheads anymore. I have sensitive skin and it does not bother me. This is a pretty big container and it seems to last for quite a bit of uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made100% Natural  in a 16 oz. jar- more money for your buck. Also I like the fact that&#x27;s it&#x27;s made in the USA. Removes excess dirt, oil, grime &amp; dead skin  also Improves acne and blemishes  Reduces appearance of wrinkles &amp; fine lines.  I wash my face first and then applied on my face. At first it felt cool. It started drying up quick then it was easy to wash off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After removing the Dead Sea Mud Mask which I love. I noticed my face felt a lot softer and  smoother. I felt like I was at the spa. It was a perfect treat to treat myself to have some ME time.  I had a natural glow on face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply the mud mask to your whole face, being careful not to get it in your eyes or lips.  Then let is stay on for at least 10 minutes. I  had mine on for more than 10 minutes so that it could completely dry. It makes your skin feel very tight while it&#x27;s it&#x27;s drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing the Dead Sea mud mask from my face, it felt soft and smooth. My skin felt so  great and even hours later, my skin still feels really good and looks good, too. I got the product for testing purposes/ for free in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> I had gotten this product for free in return for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;It says that it helps cure ance and pimples, well it does. I was completely amazed after I used it, a few days later... My acne was less harsh than before I had used it. Although i do not like the feeling mud masks give my face, it really surprised me how well it took to my skin type. It didn&#x27;t burn or anything. Usually other facial products agitate my skin and this didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I received the Dead Sea Mud Mask for Review it retails for $25.95. It&#x27;s made100% Natural in a 16 oz. jar- more money for your buck. Also I like the fact that&#x27;s it&#x27;s made in the USA. Removes excess dirt, oil, grime &amp;amp; dead skin also Improves acne and blemishes Reduces appearance of wrinkles &amp;amp; fine lines. I wash my face first and then applied on my face. At first it felt cool. It started drying up quick then it was easy to wash off my face.As soon as I got this Facial Mask I tried it out on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I love mask in general they always seem to leave the skin feeling reborn and revived. And this one left it feeling pretty clean. It certainly left it &amp;#34;all a&#x27;glow&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t really irritate either, Which is always a good thing. I like that this Mask contains A blend of Organic Shea Butter, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Aloe Vera, Which in turn will nourish and moisturize the skin in the long run. And also purify your skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;And look at the size of this Jar! Nice for those on a budget such as myself.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is the best mask I have ever tried.  My face has never felt smoother--it&#x27;s a true luxury and you can see and feel the difference in just one use.  It&#x27;s like heaven in a jar for your face.</li>
            <li> This mask feels luxurious. Its something that would cost you a lot at a salon. Its moisturizes your skin to prevent intra-cellular water loss ,so its a perfect treatment for dry mature skin, but I would not use it if I had oily acne prone skin. Although its recommend for acne to detoxify, it leaves a good film of oil behind. So unless you&#x27;re already under a regimen for acne that is drying out your skin, and need to add moisture to drying skin, I would not use it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic mask. I use it once a week or so and it just refreshes my skin. It looked a little off putting when I opened it, but it is a MUD mask. I even put some on the kids and we had a mud mask pajama party.</li>
            <li> First mask that I have tried that clears my skin, tightens, and is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> easy to use, love how clean I feel after using it. Arrived on time and no issues with the seller, Will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> great for your skin you can tell the differences</li>
            <li> Most likely the best mud mask I have ever used in my life!&lt;br /&gt;I received it for free, but I was hesitant on using it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard a lot about dead sea products, but nothing about InstaNatural.&lt;br /&gt;First week I used it twice. Second time I used it once, and I just used it again. It&#x27;s perfect for my skin and I have super sensitive skin and psoriasis. It was perfect! I love every second of using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a single mom with a baby under 12 months, time is limited, so this was perfect for me to use. I showered fast, washed my face and put a little bit on, did a little house work and then I rinsed it off! It was amazing. It came off easily. I used a wet wash cloth and It came off perfectly. I used Insta Natural serum afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update*&lt;br /&gt;I use this mud mask twice a week now and it has made an amazing difference in my skin! I LOVE InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> Great product and you get a lot for your money. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> A facial mask is a good way to relax and unwind. I am not sure why, but I find rubbing mud or clay on my face than washing it off strangely satisfying. When I use to do a weekly mask, my skin didn&#x27;t break out as much. I received InstaNaturals Dead Sea Mud Mask for review, I was eager to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used clay masks before, so I was initially surprised this mask had more of a gel consistency. I felt like I had it thoroughly applied but it looks think on the face. Nonetheless, I experienced a cooling and a tightening sensation while it was drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask rinsed off easily leaving my skin feeling refeshed, tight and clean. I followed the mask with vitamin C serum and rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask also is a nice back and body mask. InstaNaturals are generous with their package sizes. One full sized mask contains 16 ounces of the Dead Sea Mud Mask. This quantity allows for many weekly treatments for your face, back or where ever else you like to apply a mask!</li>
            <li> This mask makes your face look so sleek &amp; smooth for days after using!</li>
            <li> Me and my gf both use it 1-2 times a week and it really cleans the pores. Be careful on sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with all natural. This product has good reviews but it does not necessarily mean that it will work for you. It has for me but i still have a few pimples here and there.</li>
            <li> This is my second Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask. I really like it. It&#x27;s not as thick as other mask I&#x27;ve had in the past, but the results are just as acceptable. It dries a bit slower than other mask, but that hasn&#x27;t caused any issues for me. It&#x27;s funny cause you&#x27;re not suppose to touch your skin in general but after I use the mask all I want to do is feel all over my skin because it&#x27;s so smooth. I think with  consistency, I will begin to see a much healthier skin that I&#x27;ve had in the past few year.</li>
            <li> I have used the product only once.  Will write a review later.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service. Thank you</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this product. In the moment it&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s cooling on your face, feels like it&#x27;s tightening your skin and after you take it off your face appears clear. It does tingle a bit almost to the point it itches. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any long lasting effects as a bought it for pore shrinkage. I could take it or leave it.</li>
            <li> My 2 daughters that suffer from a little acne use it and love it. It also helps thighten pores with regular use. I love it as well!! I recommend it! Will keep buying.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more affordable option than GlamGlow Supermud mask bought this because of the reviews. I have to use a decent amount to get what I&#x27;m looking for. I don&#x27;t know if its because I&#x27;ve used a clay in the before. But this was just ok for me.</li>
            <li> Feels so amazing. Fun to use with the &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; big enough you can use with others. Makes skin feel so soft, clean and refreshed without stripping away everything or leaving a film. So great!</li>
            <li> I love beauty products, especially face masks.  I don&#x27;t know why, maybe I get a kick out of freaking my kids out when I am wearing one or because they feel so good when I&#x27;m wearing one! Okay, I love both reasons.  A couple of weeks ago, I was given InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Natural Mineral Infused Dead Sea Mud Mask to try out for free in exchange for my 100% honest, unbiased opinion of the product.  Regardless of being given the product, my opinion is my own and no one else&#x27;s.  This post is how it worked for me.When I first opened up the jar, I was like gross...it&#x27;s grayish green.  Basically it looked like muck.  But, you know what the infamous they say, &amp;#34;Appearance&#x27;s can be deceiving&amp;#34;.  Well, They were right!  Looking at it in the below picture you might think it would have a weird scent, but to my surprise it did not.  Most face masks are funky colors anyways, so no big deal, right!  To prepare for the application, I washed and dried my face.  The I started applying the mask with two finger tips.  It was like drawing with finger paint&#x27;s making it kind of fun!  I took a picture of what the mask looks like before it dries.  It is still that grayish, mucky color while it is wet.  I look like the Swamp Thing&#x27;s wife.  Scary, right?  That&#x27;s alright, I had fun sneaking around the house looking for victims while wearing the mask!  Anyways, the mask turns to a much lighter green color when it is dry.  It takes about  10-15 minutes for it to completely dry. I have to say, my face felt great underneath the mask.  Once completely dry, I was easily able to remove the mask with warm water.  I didn&#x27;t even need face wash to get it off.  Just water and light rubbing with my hands until it was all gone.  The results...My skin felt amazing with it on, while it dried and after I took it off.  My face was instantly tighter, smoother and brighter!  My skin feels deep down clean after using InstaNature&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask.  I&#x27;ve been using the mask 2-3 times a week since I received it.  I would defiantly recommend this product to my family and friends.  As a matter of fact, I liked this product so much, I am putting together a spa day for my friends so they can try it out as well.</li>
            <li> This is some powerful stuff! I have used facial masks before, usually a gel or cream, but never a mud mask. I received the Dead Sea Mud Mask from InstaNatural to review and this one makes my skin feel GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;The container is a large 16 ounces so you are going to get more than just two or three masks out of there because even when you smear it on and cover your face, you haven&#x27;t used a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;I love that there is no mixing anything together. You open it and go! It is a jelly consistency, a little cool on the skin at first, but very easy to apply and cover. You will look like a swamp monster. That&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;The real action starts when it begin drying. You will feel everything tightening. There is a reason why the directions say to avoid your lip and eye area.. unless you&#x27;re an ogre and WANT to squeeze the jelly from your eyes, I would follow those! :)&lt;br /&gt;All kidding aside this is a really great mask. It contains ingredients you can pronounce. All organic and real.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll see it change from the dark seaweed color to a lighter gray as it dries, so you can see if there are areas that still need a moment to dry. It takes roughly 10 - 15 minutes and you can feel it really tightening during that time.&lt;br /&gt;It is super easy to remove. Just use warm water and lightly rub in a circular motion and it feels like it is dissolving from your skin. I used a washcloth to do this part.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feel fabulous each time I use this. It looks radiant and feels smooth and freshened up. It feels good! And it feels good for days afterwards. This is one of the best masks I have ever used and has quickly become one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my two daughters did not have a good experience and they will no longer use it. Instead of making their faces softer and have less acne, like the product reviews had mentioned, it made both of them break out and have rougher more red skin. We do not know why and are misled by the other reviews. We are very disappointed and upset.</li>
            <li> I have used several face masks in the past only to be disappointed that I wasted my money. I had recently purchased Instanatural&#x27;s argan oil and I just adored it; so, I decided to give the dead sea mud mask a chance. Well, to say the least I&#x27;m sure glad I did! It dries up my skin very nicely and my face feels very smooth and clean afterwards. I use it once a week as recommended and I love the results. I have clearer skin, which I am ecstatic about :)</li>
            <li> Awesome and works wonders!</li>
            <li> Great product. Item arrived as described.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to have a smell to it, but no smell, applied easily, washed off easily. Its a nice size jar that&#x27;ll last quite awhile. Made my skin feel fresh and smooth!</li>
            <li> For thousands of years the Dead Sea has attracted visitors who love to bathe in this salt lake, which is known for it&#x27;s many health attributes. It is said in the Bible that King David would spend time at this body of water, because even so long ago this place was considered something like a health resort. The mud contains many elements that are beneficial to our skin, like naturally occurring magnesium, sodium bromine, potassium and calcium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was asked to try out the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Musk, I was very interested to see for myself how well the ingredients work on my skin. The large 16 oz container is filled with - well you guessed it -  100 % all natural Dead Sea &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34;, that is infused with natural occurring  minerals. To make the mud more pliable, several organic ingredients like Shea Butter,  Sunflower Oil , Aloe Vera juice, Vegetable Glycerin, Jojoba Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, Calendula Oil and filtered Water have been added. These ingredients make for a mud mask that has no smell and feels super soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you smear a thin layer of mud on your face, the ingredients gradually absorb excess oil, dirt and toxins from the skin as the mud dries on your face and body. For those suffering from pimples, acne and blackheads you will see that the cleaner your face becomes from impurities, the less skin irritations will occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a full on spa treatment you can even apply the mud to other areas of your body. The packaging says that the mud can sooth muscle aches. I don&#x27;t know about that yet, since I am not experiencing muscle aches, but that&#x27;s good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask on my face and neck area three times now and left it on until the mud dried. When you first apply the mask it feels like applying pudding. I smeared it around my eyes, forehead, cheeks, nose, chin and neck, sat back and waited for the mud to dry. As the mud dries you feel your skin tightening a bit, which actually is a great sensation until someone comes along and makes you laugh. :) I love that the mud has no smell and  that after washing the mud off with warm water, my skin felt smooth and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So would I recommend the product? Yes, for one I like spa time at home, because I never have enough time to make an appointment at a real spa. Besides the cost is right too, for about $25 dollars the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask goes a long way and let&#x27;s you treat your skin to some nice pampering. InstaNatural backs all of their products with a lifetime 100% money-back guarantee and will refund your purchase price if you aren’t satisfied, so if you do not like this product, they will refund you your money. The mask is made in the USA, as is all of their products.bit, which actually is a great sensation until someone comes along and makes you laugh. :) I love that the mud has no smell and  that after washing the mud off with warm water, my skin felt smooth and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So would I recommend the product?

            <li> bought this because of all the good reviews,&lt;br /&gt; but it didnt seem work on me&lt;br /&gt;i got acne right after i washed the produxct away from my face</li>
            <li> I love skin care products, and especially masks. Even more than that I love natural products like this. This mask is an all- natural detox and purifier for your skin that comes from the dead sea. You know you hear all sorts of great things about products made from the dead sea. The dead sea contains many minerals that are great for your skin, like: magnesium, sodium, bromine, potassium and calcium. The  ingredients in this mask are pure dead sea mud, organic shea butter, organic jojoba oil, organic aloe vera juice, organic calendula oil, and hickory bark extract. That to me equals soothed, moisturized, and healthy skin. This mask works to absorb oil, dirt, and toxins that are in your skin. It also helps to clear pimples and blackheads, and restore an even skin tone and smoother skin. Not only is this a facial mask, but you can also use it as a body treatment, for muscle aches.  I love masks, because they make me feel like I get a mini trip to the spa. This mask is no exception, It has a cooling effect on your skin, that feels great. I did this mask with my boyfriends daughter, and we loved it. My skin felt awesome afterward, soft and looking great. Also, I had the piece of mind of knowing that I was putting all natural ingredients into my skin. There are no chemicals, or anything harmful in it..It comes in a huge bottle so it will last forever. My favorite part is that it&#x27;s not tested on animals, which is very important to me. It&#x27;s also made in the USA, which is always a plus. I&#x27;ve been using this mask once a week in combination with my normal skin care routine, and my skin feels healthy and wonderful.</li>
            <li> My once a week spa break. I don&#x27;t mind the &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; appearance at all since it leaves your skin so nourished. It is a &amp;#34;Mud&amp;#34; Facial Mask after all. Definitely recommend using all products from InstaNatural. I&#x27;m using at least 3 and I love it. Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the Seaweed Kelp but I&amp;#34;m sure the product will deliver what it states as I trust this company.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it twice a week! I have acne prone skin that is also severely dry and sensitive to most products. Many masks I&#x27;ve used burned or made my skin drier. Haven&#x27;t had either effect with this mask. I haven&#x27;t noticed a crazy huge difference but it does feel and look cleaner after using.</li>
            <li> This mud mask feels great going on, dries quickly, has no odor, and leaves the skin so soft and smooth.  It is also easy to remove.  It really does feel like impurities are being drawn out of the skin.  Like other InstaNatural products, it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful toxins like so many other companies use.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mask is intense, almost too intense for my skin. I wouldn’t recommend it to people with sensitive skin, but I would recommend it to LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE. Before this mask I had blackheads and 10 minutes later I DIDN’T HAVE BLACKHEADS. It smells really nice and applies really well!</li>
            <li> This mud mask has virtually NO smell, and as I have never used one before I was a little nervous. XD As it dries on your face it tightens up quite a bit. Almost like braces for your face, without the pain. Just feels very tight like its pulling your skin. I have just started using this so I will update after some time.</li>
            <li> Honest review for a deep discounted price..Great mud mask...One of the best facial madks I &#x27;ve ever used. After the first use I noticed my skin hlowing and pores were tighter..Continued using  it twice a week for the past two weeks  and my complexion has gotten so much more even toned. I live the MUD</li>
            <li> Oh I used to pamper myself at a local spa at least 4 times a year when I was working. It was so nice to have a 30 minute massage and mud mask cleanser. Well now, with this Dead Sea Mud Mask, in less than 15 minutes, you can do your own mud mask spa day at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mud mask is green, soft and easy to apply to your face. I applied it to my forehead, cheeks, chin and under my nose. Although, you do not have to apply it under your nose and it is advised to not get this anywhere near your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I applied this amazing Dead Sea Mud Mask to my face, I let is sit on my face for 15 minutes so it would dry. When it dries, the color changes to a light green and does not fall off your face either. This is truly a pampering type beauty product and I recommend it to all my friends and family to use at home and just have fun taking care of your face to keep that youthful looking appearance.</li>
            <li> Smooth and nice. I dig it.</li>
            <li> I love this mask!  It leave my skin brighter and firmer.  I look forward to using it every Sunday afternoon.</li>
            <li> first use and it reduced the sprouting of my acne, i can actually feel the pores are tighter and blackhead fall off the following day after use. and i have a feeling this would last longer than i thought.</li>
            <li> Not like it,it is slippery and easy to drop off from face</li>
            <li> only used it a few times so far, not much of an improvement. But i&#x27;ll keep trying it for a little while longer.</li>
            <li> This mask makes my face so clean after applying it. The fact that is contains minerals from the dead sea makes it so great. After I apply it, my face already feels so relaxed and once I was it off, my face is so soft. I found that after using this mask, it calms my face and removes the redness. Wearing masks make me feel like I&#x27;m at the spa, but this mask really resembles the ones at the spa. It&#x27;s a great way to treat yourself!</li>
            <li> When I first opened the mask I was surprised!! It had no scent!! which was amazing cause it means there are no irritating perfumes added. The mask also contains, shea butter, sunflower oil, aloe vera juice, glycerin, jojoba oil and calendula oil. These are all good, safe and natural ingredients! The texture is very light and gel/cream/clay like. its like a merge between those three and applies smoothly. The instructions state to apply a thin layer on clean skin and leave on for 10-15 minutes. After about 10-15 minutes, it dries and hardens like clay. And then you can rinse it off. When I rinsed off my face, I was shocked! all the dirt, gunk was washed off and my face was squeaky clean but not dry. Impressive! It does leave a film on your face which you might have to wipe with toner, and even after that my face appeared brighter, my skin was glowing. I was impressed by this mask and it would definitely be added to my facial routine. I now use it weekly, wish I could use it more often but the instructions say only use once a week. This is an item I would definitely repurchase and I recommend for the oily to combination skin types to make this a staple in your routine.  -Oreleona [Product provided for free for testing purposes]</li>
            <li> Great product.  Really looks like mud, but has no smell.  Once washed off the product leaves your skin feeling great.  Makes skin feel extra clean and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling fresh and clean.  Noticeable difference in surface of the skin after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many masks from different companies. This mask beats any of the other masks that I&#x27;ve tried, even the tiny ones that cost $60+. I absolutely love the size, the price, but most importantly, the product. It is all natural, which is something I look for in skincare, but also helps maintain the clarity and clearness of my skin! I feel so decongested after using this product, my makeup glides on easier, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any acne! I&#x27;m so glad I found this mask because it makes my skin feel amazing!!!</li>
            <li> me and my wife love it.it can see result since first use my face look whiter and softer .</li>
            <li> works great Ive tried several different ones you will notice a difference in a few days of using this.</li>
            <li> It did make my face a bit red for a bit, but I think that had more to do with the hot water and scrubbing it off.  Left my pores noticeably smaller and skin tighter.  I&#x27;m making this a weekly ritual.</li>
            <li> The product comes in a jar that was surprisingly big. The product feels the way it looks. I put a thin layer over my skin per the directions, putting some more around my nose area, since I have more oil there. It feels pleasant after putting it on, cool and a bit stingy, but that goes away, and it tightens up as it dries. This tightening feeling I am NOT a fan of. The face section dried faster, since it was a thinner layer, but the area around my noise took longer, since I put more there. I felt like my face was scrunching up, and I just wanted to wash it off, but I couldn’t because the are around my nose hadn’t dried yet. Lesson learned – do the same level of thickness over the entire face. Anyways, I survived, and the picture shows how the dry part is a light gray, while the wet part looks like the wet product before application. The directions say to use this only once per week, so I might change my opinion of this the next time I use this, but I do feel like it absorbs the excess oil in the face, although there were no radical changes (my skin had been pretty good anyway when I was using the mask.)</li>
            <li> I do enjoy a good mud mask from time to time and that is because I want to look for a product that can combat my oily skin, yet condition my skin with natural love. Luckily, I came across this product and I am hooked on it! You do not need a whole lot to create a layer, but when it dries, be aware that your face will turn pastel grey and that is okay! Washing off the product made my face feel really smooth and I can certainly feel my pores tighten! :) I love how organic the ingredients are too because I do not like using so much chemicals on my face due to my sensitivity. Want to read my entire review about this product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://lastnightwithlee.blogspot.com/2015/02/sponsored-post-instanatural-dead-sea.html</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS INSTANATURAL DEAD SEA MUD FACIAL MASK.  THIS IS EASY TO USE MASK AND VERY FIRM.  I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO PUT A LOT.  AFTER 10 MIN,  EASY TO CLEAN MY FACE.  SO MOISTURE AND SOFT AFTER USE IT. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> What I love about InstaNatural&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask: It makes a great gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a gift for my wife, and here&#x27;s what she had to say about this Dead Sea Mud Mask:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels noticeably softer and smoother after using this mask.  My complexion is more radiant; in fact, I might even say it glows a little bit!  So, in terms of performance, this mask definitely rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that it has basically no smell; wearing a product for 10-15 minutes that has a strong odor can be unpleasant (and I&#x27;ve done that before!)  The consistency of the mask makes it easy to apply, and it feels quite refreshing on my skin.  This, too, is an improvement over other masks I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Finally, I love the value.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing my skin feels so smooth !</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this mask! InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is like having your own private spa at home! I slather this on clean skin then crawl into a hot tub! I can&#x27;t even tell you what the directions are on the label! Lol! I leave it on the whole time I am soaking in the tub then rinse it off when  I am ready to get out! My skin looks so rosy and flushed afterwards and my pores look much smaller and refined. The texture looks and feels amazing! The fragrance is so earthy for lack of a better word. Earthy is good! I LOVE this mask and use it weekly as a treat for my face!</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  It leaves my skin feeling very fresh and clean.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of (very expensive) masks in the past, I like this one better.  Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This mask, unlike a LOT of others doesn&#x27;t have an overbearing scent as soon as you open the tub. I wa sgrateful for that because let&#x27;s be honest. Most of them stink. I didn&#x27;t think twice about putting this on my face, and after about 15 min of it tightening, I HAD to take it off. My face was red for about 10 min after, but I noticed a difference! My lines were&#x27;t as prominet and my stupid adult acne wasn&#x27;t as red... I will use this for the next 2 weeks and see what results I get and am pretty hopeful AND excited because I KNOW the outcome is going to be AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product complementary, but this is 100% my honest opinion and that in no way changed my opinion about the product</li>
            <li> I had been having little bumps under the skin on my chin and around area. I tried exfoliating and then just using a cleanser..nothing worked. Dude! After two uses i am bump free! I even used it for spot treatment...amazing. And the tub is huge!</li>
            <li> Loved it. Not harsh on the skin and my face always seems so fresh. Use it once a week and my face seems more vibrant.  Received to review.</li>
            <li> I was completely happy with this product. I was shock how my skin was after it was clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my face super smooth! Great formula, not hard to remove!</li>
            <li> I love this! I used this mask as soon as I recieved it, and I am hooked. My pores are so clean and my skin is noticeably smoother and softer. It was faster than most masks I&#x27;ve used, yet more efficient. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> After I read the instructions,I applied the mask on my face and I love it! First thing I noticed was how much product you received and you don&#x27;t use much in every application,I am pretty sure it will last me the 12 months of shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;I will use this once a week like recommend it. My skin felt super soft after I took it out with water. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome Facial mask I have a sensitive skin to other product but this one the &amp;#34;instanatural&amp;#34; is so good its awesome my skin is very soothing and cooling.My skin now is glowing I can&#x27;t believe I found the solution to my problem . 100% recommend this product to anyone who have beauty problem its will help you and solve your problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the free shipping and quickly delivered.</li>
            <li> This mask has changed my face completely. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for the past two months and my face cleared up after only a week and stayed cleared up. Also leaves my face bright and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love the way this mud mask makes my skin feel and look. I looks so refreshed and smooth and my skin feels so soft and silky. There&#x27;s no smell to the mud itself. It goes on nicely, dries within 10 to 15 minutes and I personally did not have any irritation to it. All in all I&#x27;d have to say this is an amazing mud mask that really makes my skin feel bright and youthful.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product especially if you have oily skin. This mud facial mask has a  nice clean smell and a soothing texture that feels really great against the skin.  I like that it can be used all over your face or just on the oily parts of your face. The mask leaves your face extremely clean and refreshed.  It is easy to remove with water.  This is a very generous amout and I would say that it will last two to three months because you only use it about once  a week. This definitely is a product that I will buy again. It is a real winner.</li>
            <li> Great product, not overly smelly, and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is the best mud mask that I ever used.</li>
            <li> This mask is great. When I first put it on, it began to tingle a little and I thought &amp;#34;here we go, another product that I can&#x27;t use due to my sensitive skin.&amp;#34; Instead, my face stopped tingling as the mask dried. When I rinsed the mask off, my face felt fresh...actually fresh! I always blew off the face wash commercials that claimed the product left you feeling rejuvenated. However, this mask made my skin feel cool and fresh. I absolutely love this mask!</li>
            <li> A very large container for the price you pay. The product itself has a pleasant oder unlike many mud masks that smell like gross mud, It goes on smooth, as it dries you can feel the skin start to tighten. It works well enough that you would only need to use it once maybe twice per week depending on how sensitive and oily your skin is. This would be a great product for teenagers who are fighting acne and even adults who have problems with cystic acne. I was surprised and very happy to see the mud mask was made in the USA so there was no worries of odd ingredients or scary side effects.</li>
            <li> Really nice mud mask. Not too drying, but pulls out a lot of old oil and dirt that clogs pores. Really leaves skin soft and feeling great. Nice packaging, plenty of information from company.</li>
            <li> I love this mask..it really improved my skin. My acne and blemishes has really disappeared. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this dead sea mud mask. I have used it twice now and it has helped diminish some clog poors and my skin feels tighter and healthier when I was her off. I have semi sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t cause any iratation. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with eczema problems but... My large pores has shrunk! And my skin feels sooooooooooooo good. I have not used it as body mask yet (because I just received it today and I wanted to try on my face first), but I can&#x27;t wait to do so!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, for it doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell like most mask. The fact, this mud comes from the Dead Sea with all its therapeutic properties entices me even more to incorporate it into my regular skin regiment. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Makes skin super soft. Amazing product and a great price for the enormous jar!</li>
            <li> the best Dennis http://www.onlinenurseryco.com</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to love this and I saw it got great reviews, but I think my skin isn&#x27;t happy with it. If you have sensitive skin stay away from it. After I put it on and left it for 15 min my face was red. It just isn&#x27;t meant for my skin. I really did like the texture and that it had no smell but I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> Feels great, no bad scent.  Nice texture and smoothes on well and feels great while on the skin.  Rinses well, not hard to remove.  Shared some with a friend and she loved it too.  Large container, enough to share and still have plenty.  A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I CAN SEE SO MUCH DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN. A GREAT PRODUCT !!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin beautiful. It&#x27;s a great mask to get all the gunk out of my pores and it leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask is awesome. Its very easy to apply. Right after applying it I can feel the cooling sensation and little tingling on my skin. This mask just works immediately. After 10 minutes pass I can&#x27;t move my cheeks, it felt like my skin was shrinking. I kept the mask for 15 minutes and I removed the mask with warm water. My face felt very clean and smooth. I used moisturizing cream 30 minutes after removing the mask. I love how my skin feels and looks after. This mud mask is 100 natural detoxifier and purifier that come from sea. It Contains many minerals that are good for skin. Mask absorbs excess oil, dirt any toxins from your skin. It helps restore an even skin tone for a smoother complexion. Great for someone who has acne or very oily skin.  I was sent these for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> it got here super fast even when selected no rush shipping.  I in love witht this!  i used it on my face it left it super soft.  It doesnt have a smell like alot of muds do.  i would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gentle, it hasn&#x27;t broken me out and I have really sensitive skin. Definitely recommended, make sure to tone after because there&#x27;s still some mud left after. Your skin will feel so smooth after you wash it off. And I really like how they keep in touch with you giving advice etc.. It&#x27;s a really good buy on my end!</li>
            <li> Great product! No odor and was great on my skin!</li>
            <li> I really love this mask. You only use it once a week, so the container will last a long time. It is very cooling on the face which is nice and relaxing. It doesn&#x27;t over dry my face, it just leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Just used my new face mask and my skin feels so smooth. I was happy it did not have any Oder since my sinuses are very sensitive. Feels nice and cool. Easy to wash off. I found a new friend for my face. I love it and am sure you will also. All natural defiantly a plus!!!</li>
            <li> Feels great on your skin and after I took it off my face was glowing. Great product!!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural’s Dead Sea Mud Mask is an all-natural detoxifier and purifier that comes from the renowned and sacred Dead Sea. The Dead Sea contains many minerals beneficial to the skin, such as magnesium, sodium, bromine, potassium and calcium. I use this Facial Mask once a week, and I really, really love it. Apply a thin layer to your face/ body, it&#x27;s a thin dark mud mask, it dries quickly &amp; leaves a cool feeling whilst drying and after removing. Remove with warm water! Especially when you are applying it to your face, a warm rag will remove it without a lot of effort. The results come down to a cool, fresh feeling. I would definitely recommend  this to anyone who wants a once a week facial with a lot of skin benefits, can&#x27;t go wrong with 100% natural.</li>
            <li> when put on it, so relax. after wash it off, feel fresh of my face.</li>
            <li> dead sea mud mask is the absolute best!!! i would absolutely recommend this to others!!</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask is very easy to apply, not too dry or sandy. It went on very smoothly and has a light scent. After 10 minutes of it on my face, it dried nicely and was quick to wash off without a mess. Most other masks that I have used in the past were hard to wash off. They would take quite a bit of rubbing to remove. With this mask, my skin was very soft and it didn&#x27;t leave my face shiny like some others. It was a nice matte. I have sensitive skin and did not have any reactions to it. Throughout the day, my face felt smooth and pampered. I recommend this product as a no fuss mask with great results!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far.  I only use masks once a week, so I will come back and update in a few weeks.  I am a long time user of face masks (my usual go to place is Lush as I am a fan of natural ingredients/organic masks).  I was excited to try this.  Jar was filled to the top so it will last you quite some time as you will only need a thin layer for an application.  Goes on easy enough (for a mud mask).  Gave it enough time to dry but not start to crack and rinsed it out with warm/cool water.  Love the way my skin felt after rinsing the mask off and love that there was no scent.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!! was a little skeptical at first, very light, water based.. But you can really feel it when it starts to dry and tighten the skin.. After rinsing my skin felt softer.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face clean and soft.</li>
            <li> So, I received this today and decided to give it a try. So far, I like it! It left my skin feeling smooth and clean. I also like the cooling feeling it gives once it&#x27;s applied. I plan to use it next week as well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have sensitive skin so it&#x27;s difficult to find any products for my face. With other products, I either get very red irritated skin or I get the irritated skin with extremely dry skin after..this mud mask is very gentle, soothing, and leaves my skin leaving soft and looking amazing! I did apply a moisturizer after use but only as a precaution because of my severe sensitivity..you should really give this a try, especially if you have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use many other products! Very pleased with the results I got from this mud mask! Thank you so much for making an amazing product that works for me!</li>
            <li> This mask is nice.  I received this during a product launch.  This comes in a container with a screw lid.  This particular mask is a wet mask, as opposed to others that are powdery and have to mix with water.  I followed the instructions on the container, washed my face, applied the mask, and let it work!  I did not experience any negative reactions on my face.  After about 12 minutes, the mask was dry, and I used a washcloth and removed the mask using a circular motion.  Afterwards, my face was soft and smoother than what it was before.  It&#x27;s the end of winter here in MN, and all the dry skin patches on my face were gone after I removed  the mask.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; so I am sometimes reluctant to try new products.  I have to say after using this product however I am quite pleased!!!  It smells great, goes on smooth, dries, &amp; then you wash off.  Afterwards I found my face to be soft &amp; smooth &amp; clear!  I&#x27;m very much enjoying it!!!</li>
            <li> Mud masks have always been my favorite, and this is no exception. Just use twice a week for deep cleansing. The quality is the amount is just amazing. It will last me at least six months (or maybe less :))</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this product</li>
            <li> Not only do I love this mask .. I love this company!! Everything I&#x27;ve ordered from InstaNatural has worked wonderful and has quickly become a trusted and highly recommended company for me</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask is 100% Natural and in a 16 oz container.It has about 2 or 3 months supply, if you use it once daily. The product is made in the USA, and no animal products/animal testing. This products removes excess oils, dirt and dead skin. It clears up both blemishes and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied this product on my face, it felt like cool lotion and it was quite relaxing. The mud mask didnt really have a scent at all, which is a great thing! I would leave the mud mask on my face for 15 minutes at night, and I can feel the mask tighten as if it is squeezing out the impurities of my face. The mask dries very quickly, and very easy to wash off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I removed the Mud Mask from my face, I noticed my face felt super smoother and softer than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be very careful when apply this product. You do not need to get this product in your eyes or on your lips!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product to buy and try out. It is super organic and no animal products whatsoever!</li>
            <li> “This mud is great, it evens out my combination skin and leaves it ever so soft and glowing.”</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this product, is it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of weird smell like some mud masks I have used in the past. In fact to me, it doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all. I then proceeded to apply it to my face. It has a really creamy texture while your putting it on, then once it starts to harden on your face, you can really feel it going to work. You know it is ready to take off once it turn&#x27;s to a light brown faded color. Once I took it off my face felt tingly all over in a good way, like when you wash your face and you can feel your pores tingling. I also noticed before I did it I had a lot of flaky skin, which it all removed. I definitely can see how this product would be good for fine lines and wrinkles, because it does a great job of tightening your skin as well.  I would recommend this product if your looking for a well made mud mask or having problems with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product complementary, but this is 100% my honest opinion and that in no way changed my opinion about the product (I have been a blogger for 2 yrs now, and have given good reviews &amp; bad. If this review happened to be good than it deserved it).</li>
            <li> This is hands down THE BEST mud mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  It worked perfectly pulling the oils as it detoxed and purified my face.  The bottle was a lot larger than I anticipated and the mask is quality ingredients.  It may take a while before I use up one container, but I will be ordering this one for all my spa gift baskets for friends.</li>
            <li> The product has a jelly like consistency but there is no odor really at all.  It spreads nicely and you can feel it dry as it sits on your skin.  My skin itches a bit as it dries and I have to remind myself not to scratch since it is still drying.  This mask was easy to clean off and the way my skin feels is great - super soft and looking good.  My pores are smaller and less noticeable.  I do like the way my skin looks and feels after using this mask.  I did not like the itching, but it stopped as soon as I washed it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a mask user you will like this one and if you are not- I am not one to use masks much - just once and awhile, but I like this one.  I look good.</li>
            <li> mmmm.... super soothing.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!! I would and have recommend to friends! Thank you for a great product!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Gentle, yet does a nice deep clean.</li>
            <li> Best item ever, I use this weekly and my skin feels so soft and a lot stronger against daily life.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best sea mud mask in the market. I have been using this twice a week, for 2 weeks. My pores are smaller, skin is tighter, and m face glows too, which I love! It is quite a big jar, 16oz. I use to buy the bosia mudd mask, much much smaller tube, and moreahn double he price. With this great price I will use on my legs and arm as all. summer is coming...</li>
            <li> When I received the product, the plastic lid underneath the cap was opened......this bothered me greatly.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Just a few days you can see the difference. It gets rib of almost anything you can think of. This product last a while so it worth it the money. Just give it a try. I will be buying from amazon now.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I like the smell of it, and it works sufficiently so far. Will update when I have used it for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Works as promised. Leaves my face feeling soft and clean and really minimizes my pores.</li>
            <li> Terrible!  Made my face turn bright red.  I do not have sensitive skin, so it makes me wonder what exactly is in this.</li>
            <li> When I opened the item it doesn&#x27;t appear to be completely filled, about 1/3 of the facial mask was missing.</li>
            <li> Yes I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually wearing this mask right now, and I happened to get an email asking how I like the mud so far. I received the Dead Sea Mud I ordered about a month ago. I LOVE it. I&#x27;m 44 and I still have combination skin. What drives me crazy though is actually understanding what the three little pigs meant when they commented to the wolf, &amp;#34;not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin!&amp;#34; I loath the little prickles sprouting through my chin skin, and I&#x27;m addicted to tweezing them out. This obsession can lead to me breaking the skin. Now that I&#x27;m older, any blemish takes SO much longer to heal....THIS is where the MUD has been my saving grace. The directions say to use it once a week to keep from drying out your face; however, I have found that using the mud on my blemishes (no matter their cause) dries them up much faster. I can honestly see an overnight difference. The tub is so big, I can&#x27;t imagine when I&#x27;ll run out. I highly recommend the mud. It&#x27;s also fun to horrify the family with the reptile greenish-black full mask. (0:</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this for a while before I reviewed and I&#x27;ve been using is weekly - my face feels great after the mask!  The smell I&#x27;m indifferent to but the results have been wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.. My skin felt so clean and &#x27;pure&#x27; after just the first use!</li>
            <li> I actually like this mask, it was just right for me.</li>
            <li> Great for Oily Skin..Has helped my acne breakouts and made my skin feel smoother after applying.Will Buy again!</li>
            <li> It has been a month and the product makes my skin feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Wow, I always forget how great I feel after a mud mask! Also good for the whole body to detox and feel smooth and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Look no further.  The best hands down</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use face mask, but it&#x27;s really hard to find one you really can love. This is it. I use it once a week &amp; my husband uses it too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product weekly now for a month and really like its effect on my face. I find my face feeling very soft, clean and radiant after the mask and have been receiving compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Am extremely happy with my Dead Sea Mask.  You can feel the mask tightening up doing it&#x27;s job by cleaning out ur clogged dirty pores.  Advice if u have semi dry skin use once a week if ur skin is oily twice a week.  After u wash ur mask off it might seem some redness and ur skin will feel dry this is the time u use ur favorite moisturizing cream. You will find each time u use the mask ur skin will be more and more smoother.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this mask.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different masks.... and my wife ALOT more and neither of us feel like this is that good.  However, it isn&#x27;t terrible, so I&#x27;m giving a neutral 3</li>
            <li> I love all of Instanarural products! This dead sea mud mask is great! You just apply a thin layer, let dry for 10-15 minutes and rinse with warm water. I was very ezcited to recieve this product for review. It left my skin super soft and smooth.I had a much more even skin tone and my face felt tighter. My pores were much smaller and my skin was definitely more vibrant. I use this once a week and I love my results thus far. I definitely recommend this mud mask.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this Dead Sea mud. I have heard so much about the wonderful results from going to the dead sea and dipping into the waters, and how it heals. This does everything it says it does. My skin is very sensitive and had some breakouts from a product that was too rich for my skin. I put the mud on my face for about 15 minutes. When I rinsed it off I was amazed how soft my skin was, and how clean it felt. The next morning the bumps I had were barely noticeable. I also loved the glow and blush it brought back into my cheeks! I am very happu I recieved this product to review as its wonderful! It does fantastic things for my skin and I love it!</li>
            <li> Im glad that i found this facial mask. Tried it yesterday for first time and so in love. My face feels refresh and even out all dark spots. Will buy it again!!!</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feels like new skin!</li>
            <li> Great, my teen daughters love it too.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of different masks over my lifetime, and this is definitely a favorite.  I use it once a week, and my skin always feels fantastic afterwards, and looks tighter and smoother.  I work outside so my skin takes a real beating, and this product is on my must-have list now.</li>
            <li> Love it..my skin looks sooo refresh!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!!! Leaves my skin incredibly soft immediately after use, and it has helped clear up my horrible pregnancy breakouts :) love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Paid full price and would do so again. Clean, clear skin after using this product once a week. Immediate results after one use. Minimizes pores and gives the softest skin I&#x27;ve ever had. Great company, great products.</li>
            <li> Very good! Reasonable price with good effect!</li>
            <li> No better than what you can buy at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Maybe is the low cost version of the Glamglow mask .&lt;br /&gt;I see different in my skin . my skin looks amazing after use , clean , fresh , radiance, glowy .My pores looks more better&lt;br /&gt;And the best is ALL NATURAL AND CRUELTY FREE!</li>
            <li> The product is good but it dried my face and created  dark patches on my face. But I will continue using it and will see if I see different result</li>
            <li> I received this face mask and started putting it on when I noticed something hard in it. I pulled out half of a sunflower seed. I don&#x27;t even know what to say about it but I can&#x27;t believe I paid so much money for a mask that has something like that in it.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! This mask makes my face feel so clean and fresh. I will definitely continue to use this product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile ago and still have a good amount left in the jar. Makes your skin feel clean and rejuvenated after use. I do this mask once a week.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product! I love it ! Just perfect for me and I recommend it highly - Fast Shipping too !</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! Face feels great whether applying on the entire face it just problem area..</li>
            <li> No noticeable improvenent.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the service, I have no complaints and product works like a charm, leaves skin soft, clean and healthy looking, happy customer and will recommend this product to others! :)</li>
            <li> My package came today in the mail, and I was so excited to try this mask!  I immediately tore open the box, read the directions, cleansed my face and put the mask on.  What I can say is this....it has absolutely no smell or scent to it all.  It&#x27;s a pretty big jar, 16 oz.  so this stuff is going to last.  The consistency looks thick in the jar but when I began to put it on my face it felt a little weird.  To me, the mask goes on thin.  I felt like I wasn&#x27;t putting enough on my skin.  It really looks like mud.  I am typing this review right now with it on my face and within 5 to 10 minutes of it being on my face it started to itch a little.  I have very sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the reason or is it supposed to itch briefly and then go away.  It&#x27;s not a bad itch where I can&#x27;t stand it, but its a teeny bit annoying.  I don&#x27;t want to disclaim this product too soon, however I just want to let other people know what I&#x27;m experiencing.  I really want to like it..so I will use it a couple more times before I give a solid review.  I will come back in a few weeks to update this review.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a coincidence but pimples seem to appear the day after doing a mud mask. Drying time is quick, and my face is left soft and smoothe. I have only done it twice in about two weeks. Usually clear face complex. Bought it for my back acne which I haven&#x27;t gotten to test yet. The texture us slightly slimy but moreso clay like.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazingly smooth and nice after I use this and I love how nice it looks even DAYS after I have used it. It was not irritating at all to my skin. The jar is a VERY large 16 ounces, so I have no doubt this will last me for at least the next 6 months using it twice a week. It is definitely worth the less than $25 with FREE amazon shipping price tag! Overall, I am very happy with the results of this Dead Sea Mask. It is perfect for my combination, acne prone, and slightly aging skin! That is a weird combination of issues, so it is amazing that one product works well for all!</li>
            <li> Love this!! I&#x27;ve been using it twice a week and my face feels great</li>
            <li> Update: 3/23/15 - We love this stuff so much that with all the girls at my house we are using a container a month. My hands have never been softer since applying this to my face a couple of times a week. This is really good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all my daughters, their friends, and even mine, I can tell you without a doubt, ladies love to pamper their skin! But most of us don&#x27;t have the time or funds to go lay around a spa a few times a week, right? So when we find a treatment we can use at home (probably a night after the kids are in bed), we tell each other about it. The latest item is the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we opened the jar, we did get a laugh out of the color, since it&#x27;s this weird gray-green color and it&#x27;s a mud mask so it was thick at first. You apply a thin layer all over your face, avoiding the eyes and lips, and let it dry. This took anywhere from 10-15 minutes, then I removed it with a wash cloth in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally liked that there was no noticeable scent, and although my face felt tight as it dried, it wasn&#x27;t painful. I also am a fan of products made in the USA and companies that offer 100% satisfaction guarantees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with acne, fine lines and wrinkles, hydration or just enjoys a good beauty treatment like a mud mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was purchased by me through a discount coupon or gift card.</li>
            <li> I used this mask for the first time last night, and it works amazingly well. I could feel my face firming, and my pore tightening up before the mask had completely dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slept in the mask overnight, something I often do with masks when I have a breakout. When I removed this morning, my pores were virtually invisible, and the redness and inflammation from my breakouts were gone. I definitely suggest purchasing this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help with acne and wrinkles. I just received it today. As it dries my skin did get tight but not itchy. My skin feels smoother. I noticed it said helps with ache muscles so I tried it on my knee which It did help. Not sure if it&#x27;s the mask or just relaxing. I will continue to use the mask but I throughly enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Not that impressed with this mask. I have used twice and I find it to not be nearly as good as other Dead Sea mask that I have purchased in the past. I will now just keep using my Tipton Charles instead. Worth spending more for quality...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mask! The best thing is that you hardly need to put a lot on your face. So it is truly the best product to invest in. You can see it pulling out all the bad stuff out hahaha even after the mask is rinsed off it is still working.</li>
            <li> Skin feels great after!</li>
            <li> I love the pulling feeling, like all toxins are leaving.</li>
            <li> Holy perfection!!!!!!!!!! I received this in the mail yesterday (super fast shipping) and could not wait to try it. Everyone has been talking about the benefits of dead sea masks and I&#x27;ve wanted to try one for months. When I received the opportunity to review this, I was thrilled. I immediately took it out of the packaging, locked myself in my bathroom, washed my face and applied the mask. After 15 minutes, I removed it using circular motions and warm water and then patted my face dry. I&#x27;m not really sure my skin has felt that smooth since before pre-teen acne hit me in Jr. High.  I&#x27;m sad the directions only suggest 1 time a week because I want to live in this stuff!</li>
            <li> This really pulls out the impurities. It brings the impurities to the skin surface so it is easy to extract them. I wouldn&#x27;t get this if you have very dry skin, as it really pulls the skin pretty taught when you have it on. I don&#x27;t leave it on long as it would be very over drying.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This mask is the perfect pick me up for winter, when my skin&#x27;s all over the map. It moisturized where I needed to moisturize, and I felt clean and refreshed where it was normally extra oily. There&#x27;s no icky mud smell, just be really careful to keep it out of your eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> This mask doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like most. Skin definitely feels smooth after use.</li>
            <li> Really dried out my skin. I followed the directions; thin layer for 10 min. Ended up giving me 4 new zits on my forehead the next day. It is STILL dry from it, definitively not using this again. Although I can see this being useful being a spot on but NOT as a mask. DO NOT BUY if u have dry skin problems</li>
            <li> my new favorite mask!  I just got done using this and when it was drying I noticed it was really working on my pores as I could see them all.  After I washed this off it did leave my skin feeling dry, but I used the retinol serum from the same company after and the dryness went away so had no problem with that as everyone should put on a nice moisturizer after a mask anyways.  I received this for review purposes and assure this is my honest opinion as I as an amazon shopper go off reviews and I don&#x27;t want to steer anyone wrong.</li>
            <li> I received my dead sea mud mask yesterday and decided just used it and I absolutely love it! I have really bad insomnia and I lose a lot of sleep which has taken a huge toll on my skin.. I decided to buy this to see if it would help! My late husband went to the dead sea when he was on a deployment to Jordan and it cured his eczema and athletes feet that have him a lot of trouble with for years and from the time he went into the dead sea in 2012 to the time he passed away in October it never came back. I was a little skeptical at first, because I&#x27;ve tried other products for my skin and nothing helped..  When  I put it on I had a cooling sensation and after it started drying it made my face itch a little bit, but that was expected. After I took it off, I could already tell a difference in my skin!! I can&#x27;t wait to see the results I have after several uses!! I definitely recommend it and I will be telling everyone I know how good it is!!</li>
            <li> Not safe for sensitive skin. Smelled like cow....&amp;#34;you know what&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use it. We love how clean our skin feels after application.</li>
            <li> This has a really nice smooth texture and is supposed to remove excess dirt and oil from skin, improve blemishes, and reduce the appearance of fine lines. The mask felt cool just after application and then dries to a light gray after about 10 minutes. My skin was a little red after using, but the redness went away with moisturizer after about 20 minutes. Because it can be a little drying, I would recommend only using it once a week. I am saving this for during the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t as dry. Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> Seems pretty good and isn&#x27;t harsh.  Used it twice now and my aging skin hasn&#x27;t dried up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I received the Dead Sea Mud Mask</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell, seems very pure &amp; good for me. My face felt good afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love using Mud Masks.  Unfortunately they don’t like me.  I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful with what I put on my skin.  Especially my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found though that all natural facial masks do work the best for me though.  I rarely have a reaction to those.  When I heard about this promotion the mask sounded promising.  Here is some information about the Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first open the Mud Mask, it is very cold and will feel cold to your face.  After 10 – 15 minutes of drying on your face, use a warm washcloth and wash the mask off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a bit red but that quickly went away and my face felt tighter, very smooth and had a nice glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the serum and the retinol moisturizer too.  My face has been clearer the last week then it has been in a long time.  The moisturizer is not greasy and a little bit goes a long long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a new addition to your facial routine and are looking for an all natural face mask, then definitely check out InstaNatural’s Dead Sea Mud Mask, Retinol Moisturizer and Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Moms it’s really hard to fit spa time in let alone Mommy time so what’s great about the Mud Mask is that you can pamper yourself at home!  We also used it on our hands and feet.  They felt nice and smooth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Product provided for free for testing purposes.”</li>
            <li> i have been using this for a while and I love it. My face feels so smooth and has helped even out my skin tone. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just used it, felt no stinging. No difference in the pores on my nose. Wish I could return it! I bought it just because of the reviews. It&#x27;s terrible waste if money!! Can someone tell me if there&#x27;s a way to return this product?</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: compensation for this review was in the form of the Dead Sea Mask via Brandbacker &amp; InstaNatural, but opinions are all mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t honestly tell you how the body treatment works, but I can tell you that my face actually felt smoother and hydrated after one use. AND it surprised me. - I have used dead sea mud mask&#x27;s before, but with my sensitive skin, I have always had so sort of reaction- dry skin, itchy skin, red skin, etc, but with InstaNatural&#x27;s mask, I didn&#x27;t have any reactions, except for a little bit of tingling on my upper cheek area. A bonus was that the mask really didn&#x27;t have a smell, and the consistency was gel-like. It went on rather easy, and washed off without leaving a residue. I really liked the Dead Sea Mud Mask, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put it on until it dries since I do it in the shower. My face feels soft and not so oily afterwards.</li>
            <li> If you’re looking for a mask that has natural ingredients, that is just as good as the masks you’ll find at Sephora, but won’t break the bank… this is a good one! I recommended this mask, because it does a great job at absorbing excess oil, dirt and toxins from the skin. A little goes along way and it dries quicker than most masks (it’s a mud mask, but it almost has a gel-like consistency). If you have a pimple, this mask will dry it out for sure. Blackheads? After a couple of times of applying this mask, they will be gone. It also makes your skin super soft and in the long run helps to restore an even skin tone for a smoother complexion. If you have oily skin, your pores will love it! I use it on my shoulders and neck as well, to relieve muscles aches at the end of the day. I have my husband apply it for me, I then take a warm bath and just relax, love it! It’s very easy to remove too, you don’t have to scrub for 10 minutes to get it off. Anywho, this is a good product! By the way, it was sent to me for free, but this is 100% my own opinion.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing! My skin becomes soft and radiated and remains that way until the next use. It stings a little during the drying time, so I only let it stay on my sensitive skin for about 6 min. It helps as a spot treatment for some pimples as well. Great product, I am very satisfied. Also bought one for a friend and she loved it as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent👍&lt;br /&gt;Excellent and I would advise everyone to use it</li>
            <li> I live in humid and tropical weather.Besides that, I have extremely oily skin.I always use sebum absorbing paper to deal with it every 30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;After rinse off this terrible mask...I felt it is Too dry-out my skin...so terrible...&lt;br /&gt;The seal had been opened when I unboxed&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great after using!</li>
            <li> I bought this with my own money. Okay mask but dries the crap out of your skin. I used this once a week for the last few weeks and have felt my skin get a better complexion. My skin has less of those random red spots. This is a good mask but once this is dried, my skin cracks and is quite painful. I feel like this mask also dries out your skin. After rinsing it off I would feel my skin pulling more on itself. I&#x27;m on the fence on recommending this to anyone who has dry skin, but any one with fair or oily skin, go for it.</li>
            <li> Ahhhh!! I absolutely love this product! I love it so much in fact, that I purchased another for my mother for Valentine&#x27;s Day just a week after I bought mine. Even my boyfriend uses it! I&#x27;m a huge promoter of this mud mask, and will likely give it to several of my friends for upcoming birthdays. I can literally feel the difference in my skin after I rinse the mask off. Gorgeous. Plus, it&#x27;s kinda fun to paint your face with mud ;)</li>
            <li> Everybody know how good is mud musk for skin so it&#x27;s not a question that I like this mask. It has a gel like texture so it&#x27;s easy to apply you don&#x27;t have to mess with mixing it with water it&#x27;s ready to use. I use it once a week and that&#x27;s enough. While it&#x27;s drying you&#x27;ll fell your skin pulse and strait, it need about 15 minutes to dry completely than wash it off carefully. I like that it&#x27;s a huge amount so it will last long, easy to apply and after it &#x27;s removed the skin feels really fresh and clean. It&#x27;s full with rich ingredients so the skin will filled up with all the minerals and vitamins but you definitely have to apply same moisturizer after using it cause it removes all the oils. I got it free for review but I think the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mud mask! It never fails to leave my skin so soft and radiant. It has brightened my complexion quite a bit and even toned it out. It works like a typical mask in a sense that it hardens like cement and you just have to wash it off after 10 minutes or so. I honestly have no complaints so far!</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural 100% Natural Mineral Infused Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask Holistic Detoxifier &amp; Purifier is made with pure Dead Sea mud. You can use it on just your face or your entire body, and it&#x27;s supposed to help with blemishes or to reduce the appearance of fine lines. When I tested it out, it was a typical mask texture: a little gooey, but no scent (yay!). I spread it on, let it dry, and when I rinsed it off, my skin did feel softer and happier.</li>
            <li> I got this Dead Sea Mud Mask through the mail last week from InstaNatural for review purposes.  I was fairly intrigued as I’ve never actually used a proper mud mask.  I’ve only ever done the peel off cucumber style masks before and the oatmeal one from Lush!  A few facts about the mask; it is 100% natural, it is infused with minerals and it detoxifies &amp; purifies your skin!  I am quite surprised at how big the tub is compared to masks that I’ve bought before.  It certainly isn’t a one use mask, in fact I think that this will probably last me all year.  It has a rich grey/brown colour and has a silky texture.  I applied the mask following the directions, avoiding my eyes.  I forgot to avoid my lip area as suggested but didn’t think that I was too close anyway.  The mud was so easy to apply and I actually didn’t need that much to get a smooth coverage.  After a couple of minutes, the mask started to dry and as this happened I could feel my skin starting to tighten.  I like it when you can feel that a product is working and I definitely could with this.  I have slightly sensitive skin so I only kept the mask on for 10 minutes, rather than the recommended 15.  The removal was really easy with a warm facecloth.  I was slightly worried at first as my face was quite red but this disappeared within 10 minutes and it left me with very soft skin.  I also noticed that the small amount of blackheads I had on my nose had disappeared! Woohoo!  I’m certainly going to be using this mask more often :-)  Review powered by Brandbacker!</li>
            <li> I used this last night for the first time and it left my face radiant and clearer from blemishes and blackheads as soon as I wiped it off. I was shocked it worked so well right after the first use. My husband noticed it too and said he will try it next week with me. I typically have very sensitive skin. Normally only stick to Clinique products but this is awesome. Now that I am in my 30s, and have 2 babies and not much sleep, my skin has been having issues. Love this product</li>
            <li> What I love about this is that you&#x27;re really getting a bang for your buck. There is so much product in the container, 16 oz and a little goes a long way. As you can see, you first have to put a night thin layer of the product all around your face. Watch out for you eyes though, you don&#x27;t want to get it too close to your face. The next step is to let dry for 10-15 minutes. I find that if you put too much on, it will not fully dry in the time that it is supposed to. When it dries, it gets hard so be prepared for your face to start feeling a little stiff. After that, you&#x27;re supposed to wash it off in circular motions. I find that it brings the product back into the first start where you put it on and you&#x27;re really rubbing it in while also washing it off. It&#x27;s a great feeling on your skin and you want to take your time with this because you don&#x27;t want to rub too hard or not get all of the product off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I took the mask off, my face instantly looked more fresh and felt baby smooth. Usually when I may use a mask or a facial scrub, I find that they really dry out my face to point that I feels really bad if I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on. However with this product, I noticed that face still felt moisturized and smooth. I woke up the next morning to a refreshed face that looked brighter as well. I love this product and it&#x27;s only intended to use once a week and I think that it&#x27;s the next step in my beauty regime to keeping my face looking fresh and young. I loved how it felt on my skin and I love how it my skin felt afterwards. It&#x27;s definitely a product to invest in and it can be really beneficial to your skin.</li>
            <li> great mask - doesn&#x27;t dry out in the jar - great for your skin.  feels great after washing off!</li>
            <li> Use this once a week as recommended and i feel cleansed after i do a mask.</li>
            <li> Hands down, one of the best face masks I&#x27;ve used.  For $25, you get a GIANT 16 oz jar - made from pure dead sea mud, organic shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera, and more.  Great for acne and blemishes - detoxes and purifies like a champ extracting excess oil and dirt fom one&#x27;s skin.  Use this baby once a week to also reduce the appearance of wrinkles and lines.  Apply it to your whole face (be careful of your eyes/lips) and leave it on for 10 minutes or so. Make sure it&#x27;s dried completely before washing it off! It&#x27;ll feel tight while it&#x27;s drying so don&#x27;t fret.  Definitely smoothes out your complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> As it drys it flakes off into your eyes! It&#x27;s also pretty itchy and goes on weird. The texture is more of a gel than a mud. My skin feels good after I take it off though.</li>
            <li> i have a sensitive skin but this really works well for me. It&#x27;s very soothing. Can&#x27;t wait to apply it again.</li>
            <li> I love how fresh and clean this makes my face feel and how it feels so exfoliated and soft</li>
            <li> This is a great mask that goes on very smooth, with no grittiness. It&#x27;s cool because it&#x27;s almost like a gel infused with mud that goes on clear and looks like dried mud after it dries! Very soothing and my skin looked brighter and softer after I took it off. I always take my mud masks off in the shower because they are easier to remove.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Dead Sea mud mask... It gives your face a deep cleanse.... Helps moisturize your skin... Must try the Dead Sea Mud Mask... :)</li>
            <li> Works great..... Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The wife loved this product. She loved how soft and new it made her skin feel even after just one use. She is recommending it to all her friends.</li>
            <li> The mask is amazing .. I should tell my friend about it .. thank you so much for it guys</li>
            <li> When I first opened up the jar, I didn&#x27;t have high hopes. It didn&#x27;t look like the other mud masks I&#x27;ve used in the past. It just wasn&#x27;t muddy, it&#x27;s kind thin. I decided to try it anyways and put a thin layer on my face, per directions. Well, it dries like mud! What I love about this mask is that it&#x27;s natural, dries up acne and oil, but doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry afterwards. This product was sent to me for review purposes, as usual, I promise to give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This is the most have product for oily skin!!</li>
            <li> I love my Dead Sea Mud Mask. Goes on Smoothly and it feels cool.  Works very well and tightens up the face. It cleaned my face nicely and my face felt smooth after. I love that it detoxifies and purifies and it is holistic. No harsh chemicals I am very satisfied with this. I did receive this product in return for  my honest opinion and that in no way changed my opinion. I really like this product a lot. I got smooth skin, doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin really soft</li>
            <li> the service is really great,even the product is not excellent for my face ,but the seller are so sweet and responsibility ,giving me full refund .i use five times not as good as i image,but just for me,maybe i am so special. the service is really perfect</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that this isn&#x27;t some skimpy amount. You get a 1lb tub of the Dead Sea Mud Mask and it&#x27;s filled to the brim! I used this last night for the first time and I absolutely LOVE the way my skin feels! It hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in a very long time. It goes on smooth and has no scent. I full expecting some sort of funky smell when I opened it but that wasn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll need to use it for a longer period of time to be able to provide long term feedback but for now, I am 100% happy with my purchase. I just need to find a good hiding place for it so my 15 year old doesn&#x27;t swipe it. I love it too much to share!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice so far in the two weeks since it arrived in the mail. This is a great product, and should definitely be purchased and added to your weekly skin care regimen- you will be happy you did</li>
            <li> Skin feels great!! Absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> This has been the best mask I have tried in over years.  The consistency is perfect and thin layer does the magic. I have been using it twice a week and have seen pores disappearing on my nose and cheek areas. It has helped control acne as well. Sometimes, when I see a new breakout, I apply the mask on the spot overnight.  It really helps keeping the breakout in control and helps prevent scarring.&lt;br /&gt;While ordering, I felt it to be expensive but a pea size is all you need. I am convinced this is going to last me for a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am completely satisfied and couple of my girlfriends who tried it LOVE it as well. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This mask was... intense. As it dries, it pulls your face. I even told myself &amp;#34;So this is what getting Botox must feel like&amp;#34;. My face felt stiff and all I could move was my lips and blink. The itching as it started to dry was pretty annoying - to the point that I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and had to wash it off before the 15 minutes were up. My face felt clean and smooth. But the second I moisturized with coconut oil after this mask, my skin instantly went &amp;#34;ahhhhhh&amp;#34;. Can&#x27;t wait to try it again and see how it does with consistent use. Also, this product has NO scent. So don&#x27;t worry about smelling like the sea or mud.</li>
            <li> When I first put this on, I thought it was really thin and wasn&#x27;t going to do much, but it tightened my face like you wouldn&#x27;t believe!  Pulled all the dirst out of my pores and was overall a great mud mask!  Plus, the jar is large enough to last a really long time!!</li>
            <li> So far, I like this.  I have only done one treatment, but had no adverse reactions, and I have fairly sensitive skin.  My daily facial care routine is simple; Dove sensitive skin soap and a moisturizer with SPF.  It has served me well for many years, but now, in my mid-thirties, my skin is looking a bit dull.  The product dries quickly, and you definitely feel a pulling sensation as it does.  I also felt a slight itching sensation, but again, had no adverse reaction.  My skin felt refreshed and looked radiant upon removal.  I will continue to use this mask and hope to see additional results!</li>
            <li> Have only had this product a short time, but I love the results thus far.  You can tell an immediate difference when using this mask.  Skin feels so soft once the mask  is used.  My teenage daughter loves it also.</li>
            <li> I have terrible problems will big pores and a breakout ever other week. So when i got the opportunity to try InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask i jumped at the opportunity. Now for one its not very attractive looking when you open it. I still decided ehh I’ll try it. It doesnt have any kinda smell to it; But it does feel amazing on the skin.*disclaimer: i did receive this product for test purposes*</li>
            <li> I actually sent it back because the jar was only half full. Also it had no protected cover on it so I didn&#x27;t even try it.</li>
            <li> I already love it. My face actually feels soft and tingly</li>
            <li> Makes my face super soft! I love this stuff! I am currently using all the Instanaturals products. Almost every ingredient is organic. I love this company!</li>
            <li> Great packaging and arrived as expected. Big jar, great value for the money. No smell, i like the consistency of the product.Feels clean and fresh after applying on my face, no irritation experienced.</li>
            <li> Loved how this not only opened my pores but added moisture to my face! Every other product I have used to open my pores has dried my face out to the max. I will now be using this on a regular bases!</li>
            <li> Great product! My face feels so fresh &amp; very clean after each use.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask - Skin Cleaner is one of the better Mask I have ever used I just just love the way it&lt;br /&gt;makes my face and neck feel after I use it. Removes excess dirt, oil, grime &amp; dead skin. Reduces appearance of wrinkles &amp; fine lines. I just love the fact that it made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I love it. It  feels so great on my face and my skin looked so much better after I washed it off.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have only done the mask 3 times since you can only do it one a week but I am noticing smaller pore size and it feels like it is cleaning out my pores when I do the mask. I have heard really good things about this product so I am excited to see more results😄</li>
            <li> This mask is absolutely AMAZING!! I love it so much! I use it along with the age defying serum and they work so wonderfully together. This mask felt amazing to apply and wear. It&#x27;s a nice cool feel, and then when it starts getting dryer you feel your skin tightening. I apply this before my shower so that the removal is easy and not messy. The consistency almost reminds me of a really dense chocolate pudding. (If that makes any sense lol.) This product really makes my face feel extremely smooth and soft. I honestly just love it!!  I HIGHLY recommend this product!! P.S. IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN (like me) THEN DO NOT USE AS SPOT TREATMENT ONE DAY, AND FULL MASK THE NEXT. It really made my chin break out into really strange bumps. That was the only time this has happened. I just waited for the next week and applied it as a regular mask, and no problem! :)  This company is absolutely awesome and I have already ordered another one of their products!! I can&#x27;t wait! Ahhhh!!</li>
            <li> Amazing to my face and very effective</li>
            <li> This was an awesome experience. This stuff made my face feel so smooth. It arrived quickly, packaged great. My sister is now ordering some because of how soft my skin was. Hands down, great product.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;ve been using the entire line of InstaNatural beauty products, and I love them all.  The Dead Sea mud mask is no exception.  It&#x27;s very easy to use compared to others, and goes on and covers evenly.  I think that&#x27;s the biggest difference between two masks that I&#x27;ve used recently.  No clumps.  My skin feels amazing and glows immediately after rinsing.  This is a great addition to my skin care routine.  It has also helped clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li> An invigorating mask! I love the way this feels on my face. I use it once a week. I appreciate the organic oils and aloe mixed with the mud. It keeps my skin hydrated rather than dried out. It does well to prevent breakouts! It is in my regular regimen now!</li>
            <li> I loved using this mask. It works great and made my skin feel renewed</li>
            <li> I finally got a chance to use these, when it dries it did make my face itchy but I needed to wait for it to dry all over my face before I could wipe it off...after wiping it off my face, my skin got super smooth and feels clear and clean! I would recommend doing a mask at least once a week!</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth after I use this mask. My skin looks clearer and refreshed after I use this and feels super clean. Definitely would recommend  to get over dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and she loves it. She said it makes her face feel &amp;#34;heathier and softer with a more even tone&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It really works. That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> My ideal Friday night: glass of wine, InstaNatural Dead Sea mask, and a cheesy celeb magazine!</li>
            <li> Works well and my face feels clean!</li>
            <li> I felt so pampered the first time I used InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask.  The creamy mask is thick, and easy to apply. It dried within 10 minutes, and removed easily with warm water. My face felt so much smoother immediately after, and my pores were a little smaller. I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s all natural, which is a must in my book.</li>
            <li> The consistency was actually a lot thinner than I had thought it would be. I had to use quite a bit to get the same density spread that I prefer for my masks. I really liked the way it felt. It had the same smooth moisturizing feel as Aloe Vera gel. The application was simple, there wasnt any clumps, lumps, or cakey-ness to the mixture. Depending on how much or how little you use, the dry time will vary. I liked that it didnt make my skin feel tight when it dried. When it was time to rinse it off, it came off easily. I find that I have to use a towel to get some other brands off.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that was face felt really soft and supple after the mask. I followed up with a serum and toning moisturizer. It has a definitely earned its way into my facial regimen.</li>
            <li> Great product. Since using this mask, I have noticed less oil production in my face. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who is unsure whether they should get it</li>
            <li> As a massage therapist, I often give clay facials to my clients when they choose &amp;#34;the works package&amp;#34; at the spa. I&#x27;ve seen first hand the benefits of how much better their skin looks and feels after a mud mask, and I really wanted something like that I could use on myself at home. This dead sea mask is every bit as good as the masks I give in the spa. One tip I can give you, is if you have sensitive skin, to let the mask only partially dry before removing as the drier it gets the more it &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; from your pores and can dry your face out a bit leaving it flushed. Well work the investment for a spa like treatment at home.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea black mud is worldwide known for improving skin&#x27;s natural processes. This mask is a natural and effective facial skin treatment formulated with Dead Sea Mud. The Dead Sea Mud Mask is renowned the world over as the most effective, all natural, skin-reviving facial mask available.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of a trip to the spa - a very high end one.  It is a very light mask - swipes on skin smoothly and easily - not your typical thick, dry, cakey mud mask.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like it could even dry out if it wanted to - there is something really moisture-rich and hydrating about the mask consistency.  I&#x27;ve tried other high-quality spa mud masks and this is akin to those.  It is a charcoal gray (not black or brown) color and smells unbelievably clean, considering it is made from earth.  It feels amazingly smooth and cooling and hydrating on your skin and can be easily smoothed over the face, neck, decolletage, upper back, shoulders - wherever you need a little help on your body.</li>
            <li> As a skin care product junkie, I&#x27;d say this is one of my favorite products! It feels amazing, just don&#x27;t overuse or it will cause excessive drying.  Overall this product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> This company has excellent customer service and a fantastic product line!! This mask is no exception. It comes in a large jar that will easily last over 6 months.Easy to use with great results. If you have not tried InstaNatural products I highly recommend you do. I know you will not be disappointed,</li>
            <li> I love clay masks and wanted to try something new. I invited my mom, sister-in-law, and niece over for a facial day so that every age group could try it. This is not thick like a clay mask, but still goes on easy like putting lotion on but not rubbing it in. We let it dry completely, it took closer to 20mins for the masks to dry. My mom said her skin felt tighter, my sister-in-law said she had smoother skin, and my niece had less redness. I also loved the mask, it made my skin feel smooth and look less red, I have mild acne and this really helps with the irritation from it. Over all, wonderful mask!</li>
            <li> My face feels so good after I use this. Moist and soft. Dead sea products are some of the best. I cannot wait to see long term how it helps with blackheads too! I workout a lot and my face is always sweaty, this is a great way to detoxify the skin.</li>
            <li> This is great on my skin! I like the effects on my skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great mask. It leaves your skin glowing for a few days. Usually my masks last a day. I use this once a week and my face feels so nourished. I have also tried this on my hands. Love how soft my hands feel.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff. I used it on my chest and shoulders first. Then I used it on my arms, legs and face. I found that a little goes a long way. It dries better if you don&#x27;t put it on too thick. I let it dry then just got in the shower to wash off. If you do that I would advise using a loffa to help rinse it off rather than a white or light colored wash cloth like it did. It left my wash rag looking like it was muddy...imagine that. I will use this quite often as it leaves your skin feeling refreshed and very smooth.</li>
            <li> It does the job with only one application a week. My daughters and I added this to our skincare regimine and have noticed a marked changed in our skin with only two applications. Be aware that when this mask dries, you can definitely feel a pulling sensation on your skin. It&#x27;s not painful, just tight. A little goes a long way, so this container will easily last the three of us a year + with weekly use. A great buy, excellent value, and visible skin improvement in a short amount of time. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing mask. There are so many benefits to using this weekly. The product is great and the delivery was fast! I will certainly buy again! I was lucky enough to get a discount, but I stand by my review! Amazing</li>
            <li> This mask was awesome! I double cleanse (oil first then my cera ve). This stuff did wonders on my pores and those annoying sebaceous filaments! I saw a decrease in them the next day. I look forward to using the mask again especially since it doesn&#x27;t have a tingling feel.</li>
            <li> I used this mask and it seems to work pretty well. It did not dry out my skin like some of the other products I have used in the past. I like the fact that this is an all natural product, as I try to stay away from too many chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed trying out this mask. Its thin when you put it on but it does a fine job in helping blemishes, oil and dirt go away. It leaves your skin feeling nice and refreshed. The only that I didn&#x27;t like was that since I have more dry skin then oily my face felt very dry. But overall is a great mask to use.</li>
            <li> Works great and feels nice one. Deep cleans and balances your face. Helped my 10 year old out with some minor blemished skin and left our faces smooth. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have finally got the chance to try this mud mask and I loved it! it left my skin feeling very soft after I had it on there for about 10/13 mins. It wasn&#x27;t too hard to take off either, I just washed it off and rubbed my face in a circular motion with my hands and it came right off.&lt;br /&gt;it comes with a lot so I know that it will last me a while because you don&#x27;t need to put on a lot to make your face feel smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> I have received this product for free for review. I have enjoyed using this mask. It has no smell and it goes on smooth and thin. You might feel a little tingle while applying but its just letting you know that its doing its job. Its easy to rinse off also. This mask makes my skin feel good after.</li>
            <li> I love this. My face felt so clean , smooth and refreshed after using this. I noticed a huge difference in how it looked the next day. Very happy so far, especially with the fact I have an oily face and have frequent blemishes. Glad I was able to try this!</li>
            <li> Great mask!! It feels really light on the skin! And it&#x27;s a great at-home treatment that feels like you&#x27;re at the spa. After applying, skin feels super soft and hydrated! Plus the tub is huge, and a little goes a long way! You get a lot of product for the great price!</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask. I really love to put face masks on my skin and have tried a lot, but this one is really good. Love all that a good natural stuff in it and smooths on your skin so soft and creamy. It&#x27;s cleans and detoxes your skin. You can see and feel when it is dry, about 20 minutes and when you remove it your skin will feel refreshed, firm  and moisturized. Couldn&#x27;t believe how big the tub is, will last awhile. I was given this product for a small fee for my unbiased opinion and am so happy I tried it. Would defiantly buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of all kind of facial mask products and this mask mud is pretty good one. It is easy to spread and feels cool on your face, I used only two times so far since use only once a week. I can&#x27;t see the change yet but hopefully get rid of my blackhead and whitehead problems continue to using it, this is huge size and will last long time.</li>
            <li> Horrible allergic reaction after use. Read ingredients carefully before purchasing!</li>
            <li> Ok I am still testing this mask but so far i think it is fantastic. It is really easy to apply, at first you will feel a little itchy but once its starts to harden it goes away. After using it my skin felt soft, another thing that i loved is that it is odorless. I wish i could use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Left my skin super soft. Love it</li>
            <li> I just tried this dead sea mask this past weekend and I am in love! It works extremely well, my face felt absolutely amazing after I used. This is now my go to mask that I will use from now on!</li>
            <li> I received the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask with a promotional code to review. I have to say, I really like this stuff. I have only used it once so far, but just after a single use I notice a difference in my skin. It is softer, cleaner feeling and my skin tone seems more even. I will update after a few more uses since you can only use it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works well&lt;br /&gt;Goes on and comes off easily&lt;br /&gt;No weird residue&lt;br /&gt;Leaves face feeling very soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smells weird.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is amazing. It has a gel like texture that I wasn&#x27;t expecting. It says to put on a thin layer and I may have put a little much on because it took a while to dry completely; but after washing it off my face felt so smooth. This is a great product and I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in facials. It does not have a smell so that&#x27;s good because some facial stuff is overpowering.</li>
            <li> This  Dead Sea mud mask it great leaves my skin nice and smooth and clean.a small amout goes a long way .</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask! I use this mask once a week for 15-20 minutes and it leaves my skin feeling extremely soft. I was looking for a mud mask, for deep cleaning, to rotate with my one-a-week moisture mask and I have found this one. The large jar should last quite a while! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> First of all I barely ever write reviews especially when products just meet expectations or a little under, but this product is worth the time as it exceed way beyond my expectations. This product is absolutely amazing and a must try for anyone with acne problems, scares, or stretch marks. I&#x27;ve had skin problems for the last 15 years and spent hundreds of dollars on useless products nothing seams to help or last long term. After seeing 4 skin specialists in 3 different states and being told at this point my skin is untreatable, I became depressed and antisocial. I seen this product while browsing one day and figured what&#x27;s one more thing to waste money on at this point not even the experts have helped... To my surprise not only was this NOT a waste of money it has started to clear away old scars from my stomach and face that have left their marks from years of terrible acne products and being overweight. My face was so remarkably smooth after the first treatment with no oily residue anywhere and no irritation occurred which is amazing since my skin is sensitive to almost everything man made. So if you think you&#x27;ve tried everything out there and nothing can possibly help your skin... search no further this will make you love your skin again and you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, and quickly. Natural product that I don&#x27;t have to worry about on my skin or in the environment, thanks InstaNatrual!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for 2 weeks now, with combination of BeeFriendly&#x27;s raw honey mask. Although I cannot say which mask did more work, I really liked this mask. It doesn&#x27;t have an artificial smell, and I do feel my skin smoother afterwards. After ONLY 2 weeks, my acnes have reduced and my skin tone is more even. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of InstaNaturals products and I was happy to get the Dead Sea mud mask as well. As always I am very satisfied with the quality and application of the mask. I was able to take a spa day and truly relax it was amazing. I applied the mask and waited until it was completely dry. My skin felt tight and clean. After I removed the mask my skin felt totally renewed not only was my skin soft and supple it is was also smooth and felt out of this world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was totally happy that I was able to provide myself a relaxing spa day and not have the huge spa bill. I recommend if you are looking for a  mask to add to your ritual this is certainly the one to choose.</li>
            <li> great mask noticeable results</li>
            <li> I purchased the Dead Sea Mud Mask and I love it!  The size of the container really surprised me, I was expecting the container to be smaller. When I used the Dead  Sea Mud Mask on my face, I felt it tightening up my skin while the mask was drying.  After I use it on my face, it makes my face feel soft. It actually softens out some of the wrinkles that have been forming around the corners of my eyes and on my forehead.  I use the mask once a week as directed, but it feels so good when I use it that I can hardly wait for the week to go by so that I can use it again.  I know  one thing for sure, this is one item in my beauty supplies that I will make sure that I will have on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> I would like get a free sea mud mask to see if it really works. Ill coment after try out</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a full facial cleanse and exfoliation. However, I encourage being aware that this product is not for daily use, as it may dry/irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> Great mask. Most things make me break out, even when you would think there is no possible way for it to cause a reaction. With this, no reaction except for better skin. Yeah!  And it&#x27;s a pretty bid tub; bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! It makes my skin feel so soft and my pores appeared smaller. It doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but it&#x27;s worth it for the results. I would totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love how this leaves my face, it gets rid of pimples (at least for me) and makes my face clearer. Would recommended it</li>
            <li> I like this product. I use it twice a week and have noticed my face appearing even toned and soft. I also use it on my hands which has helped greatly with my winter dry skin. There is no scent, it applies easily and feels smooth. I also like this company. I have used many products from this company including eye cream and moisturizer. They are helpful and dependable.</li>
            <li> Very comforting especially in hot weather.</li>
            <li> Being a person who uses mask regularly, this 100% natural-InstaNatural Dead Sea Mask is a welcome addition to my skin care arsenal. I love Dead Sea mud mask as they are perfect to draw out all toxins and dead cells from your skin. With heating during the winter harsh months, my skin becomes very dry and itchy. I have tried using different moisturizers but their effect doesn’t last for long time. When I got to try this Dead Sea mask I was really happy. I used it after cleansing my face and left it to dry. I washed it away with a wash cloth and the result was a clean, smooth, radiant complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using mud mask on my face for a long time and love how they leave my skin clean and smooth but never tried it on my body. One of the reasons being that they come in small size tube or jar and not enough to apply to whole body. This InstaNatural Dead Sea mask comes in a 16 oz. jar and has many added organic ingredients like shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera, calendula oil and hickory bark extract, so I decided to use it. I applied it all over and let it dry. Washed it off with a wash cloth. My skin felt so soft and moisturized, I was really pleasantly surprised. Thank you InstaNatural for another great product.</li>
            <li> I love face masks and this is one of the best! It leaves your skin feeling silky soft and clean! It&#x27;s also a great value!</li>
            <li> I Love how easy and smooth and refreshed it leaves my skin. Its like a spaday at home. i used it once a week and my skin feels better than ever</li>
            <li> Good product! My skin looks great after using it!</li>
            <li> I have used the mud mask a couple of times now and I am impressed how my face feels and looks after the mask. I would get this again. It&#x27;s hard to find a mask that you can feel and see a difference and plus this is a great price!</li>
            <li> Ahhh perfect for hanging out with friends and having a spa day! You won&#x27;t be disappointed how refreshed your skin feels after using this product. Perfect for a Christmas gift too.. Don&#x27;t forget to buy one for yourself!</li>
            <li> unlike most mud masks this one is very unusual where a tiny bit goes a long long way it doesn&#x27;t take much to take it off which is a huge plus! Also putting it on is easier still and no weird smell. Leaving my skin feeling clean and fresh, no minty smell either so this is even great for men to use! No burning or tingling on my face acne gone  in one use or at least bad acne faded, my psoriasis looks so much better after using this too! No sure on the pore reducer but the wrinkles on my forehead are gone gone and i have only used this twice along with the misfortune i had with a vitamin c reaction. Definitely a product to have for every day use and that sudden emergency facial!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You get a generous amount. It smells like mud too!  When I first applied this, I wasn&#x27;t too sure how much you needed, if I had to mix it together, how well it dried. Well you really don&#x27;t need that much. Just enough for a very thin layer on your face. It dries quite fast, and washes off very easy. Nothing to measure and mix. The mask it self, does feel slightly itchy when you have it on, and momentary after washing it off. It leaves your face feeling, soft, smooth, and even coloring. I use this, while Im relaxing in the bathtub. So, I can just easily wash off.  Just apply my favorite moisturizer afterwards, and enjoy the smooth feeling all day! I use this as recommended once a week. I think if you used it more, it might dry out your face.&lt;br /&gt;*Complementary product received for review purposes*</li>
            <li> Do this alone, because with this stuff on, you&#x27;ll look like you crawled out of a swamp. Other than that, this is a fantastic treat for your skin.  I left it on until the tightening sensation became too much, and rinsed off with warm water.  First thing I noticed is that my pores looked smaller. My face overall looked and felt better than it had in years.  I think I can go without makeup now.</li>
            <li> This mask definitely feels like it cleans my pores, but it is very itchy and leaves my skin pretty dry once I near the end of the 10-15 minutes that I have it on. It&#x27;s quite uncomfortable. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This seller did something none has done before and that is send an email PRIOR to the product coming explaining a bit more about it. The mask came then next day and I was even more excited to try it. It goes on smoothly and smells good. :) Not to be graphic, but I had an under the skin things which normally lasts a while. Next day it was gone! I am in love with this. Highly recommend. I have good skin but get the occasional unwanted eruption.  I have no doubt that with continual use of this product, my skin will be better than it&#x27;s ever been!</li>
            <li> The product comes in a rather large jar, so you are definitely getting your moneys  worth when you purchase from InstaNatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the jar, I was surprised at what the texture was.  It honestly looked like a  slick mud consistency.  Strangely enough, it didn’t smell like it though.  It didn’t really have too much of a smell  to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time l applied It, It was a little  hard to get used to. l am used to thicker  consistency  being glooped on my face. This was thinner type, with a smoother feel when spreading it over my face.  I almost felt that l wasn’t getting enough all over my face at first.  But after I got my face covered, It was fine. Almost immediately I felt the  cooling sensation from the mask to let me know it was doing its job.  the instructions say to leave on for 10 to 15 minutes before washing off.  During the 15 minute span, my  skin went from feeling cool, to warm, to cool again.  The warm was just warm, not a burning sensation. And with having sensitive skin, warm instead of burning means everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After leaving it on for 15 minutes, I grabbed a warm washcloth and washed it off. Immediately afterwards I ran my fingers over my face to find that every  single inch of my  skin was silky smooth. After about 10 minutes after washing it off, I did notice that my forehead went back to being a little dry. In my skins defense though, the last few days have been under ten degrees. Leaving us Michiganders with that hideous winter dry skin.  I also did not apply a moisturizer after washing it off too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use this product once a week. So I waited a week before trying it out again. The second time around, was just about the same thing. I felt an immediate cooling sensation by the time I was putting the top back on and putting it away. It did get a little warm and back to cool in the first 10 minutes of use. The last 5 minutes or so, it was starting to itch as it was drying up. I can’t remember any other mask I have tried starting to itch once you are nearing the wash off time. But maybe this means it is working deeper than other products I have tried.  After the second time using the mask, I did apply a moisturizer after washing it off. Hours later my skin was still smooth, even though I had to brave the Michigan winter in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third time was just about the same as my second. Did a little cooling, little warming, little itching as it was drying. But again, with a good moisturizer, I could feel the radiance coming from my skin for days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for something new to try, this might be worth it for you. It has helped to put some moisture back in my skin, because you know, this negative degree weather thing we have going on here really stinks. After using this with a good moisturizer, it is safe to say this product has helped my face tremendously in the negative degree weather we have been having!was drying up.

            <li> What an amazing mask. I am new to using mud masks and this was my first one. When I opened it and seen the actual mud it looked like it would be gross but it had no scent and had a nice creamy texture to it and was also cooling on the skin. The first two times I used this I left it on longer than I should have and my skin turned red for about an hour so now I just use it for 10 minutes and it works fine. This also rinses away very easily and is suggested to use it only once a week so every Monday I have a nice bubble bath and put this on my face. I was sent this to try out but I really do love it. It leaves my skin looking brighter and softer.</li>
            <li> It is one of my new favorite mud masks! After using it for the first time I saw a drastic change in the size of my pimples. The larger ones shrank to half its size and the smaller ones disappeared the next day! My blemishes from past acne spots looked lighter and I was a left with a glowing complexion when removing the mask. I like that the InstaNatural Dead Sea Mud Mask can be applied on the body as well to spot treat those random pimples that pop up. So far I have used this twice in the duration of the time of owning it and it hasn&#x27;t caused an skin irritation. All you need to do is apply a very thin layer and it should all dry within 15 minutes. Too thick a layer and you will see wet spots still on your skin. I can see this jar lasting for at least 6 months or longer if used once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> great product - v. quick shipping</li>
            <li> This is my first mud mask and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t have a scent at all. It dries on pretty stiff but was easy to work with and wash off.</li>
            <li> Wonderful mask. Unlike some reviews on here, I feel it has improved my complexion.  Follow the directions, DO NOT leave on longer than 15 minutes, or it will begin to itch.  I am African-American, have sensitive skin, and I am 36 years old next week.  I usually have clear skin, but under stress can be prone to breakouts. This product helped clean my pores; I am a dance teacher, so I tend to sweat in my makeup (I know, so unhealthy, but what can you do? I think no makeup at work is unprofessional). Hope this review helps someone similar to me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask about three times over the past week and my skin has really started to clear up. I have combination skin so I need something that takes care of the oil and clogged pores without over drying other spots. My skin feels really soft after I&#x27;ve taken it off as well. I appreciate the short, pronounceable ingredient list, and that it is free of parabens. I&#x27;m eager to try it on my body as well and see if it helps with sore muscles like it claims.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I love about this mask is has natural ingredients. I love a mud mask for really clarifying my skin, but sometimes they can be a bit drying. I don&#x27;t find that to be the case with this mask. When I use this my skin feels clarified without being dried out. This is a great mask to use during the colder months or for people with dry skin that still want a clarifying mask. This is a really great deal for such a huge jar, too!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and the results are instant. It tightens and lifts the skin. Removes dull looking texture to reveal clean pores and brighter looking skin. You get a huge sixteen ounce tub. I am addicted to this but unfortunately I can&#x27;t use it everyday as that would only cause dry skin issues. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review. I have posted a full review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> A serious favorite. It goes on sooo easy, I did not use very much so the jar will provide plenty of masks. It hardened up perfectly and left my face feeling super clean! I really think it removed some of the toxens from my skin! As far as face masks go this is one of the best ones ive tried!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! I use this mask twice per week and it makes my skin smooth and clear. Love this mask, will recommend to friends and family!</li>
            <li> I tried this tonight for the first time and I have to say i love it. My skin feels clean and tight.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me and did not cause any irritation to my skin. There was not a weird smell from this product which seems odd since so many mud mask do have a bad smell. I love using this product and feeling and seeing the results.</li>
            <li> This left my face feeling so super soft and lovely!</li>
            <li> Great product! Feel it working, and see smooth difference in my skin after just one use! HAPPY customer here!! :)</li>
            <li> I used this last night for the first time.  I really love this mud mask.  My skin felt healthier and it definitely helped my acne.  It is easy to apply, not too thick and not too thin. It was also easy to rinse off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about thIs product!! Awesome buy! Leaves skin feeling so great!</li>
            <li> OMG, this facial mask is amazing! I tried it on my face and neck and once It dried up, it pulled all the oils and dirt out of my pores. I proceeded with my moisturizer and my skin was looking amazing.My husband said that my face was glowing and asked what I had done. I&#x27;m in love with this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It left my skin very soft and glowing.  Of course, like most mask, it did itch a little while it was drying.  My daughter also tried it and love it.  I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> my face feels amazing after using it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product!!! Myself, my nieces, and even my son used the Dead Sea Mud Mask! Amazing results. We could feel the product working and can still feel the results. Our skin feels smooth and healthy, almost new. My niece is a redhead and has very sensitive skin and this product gave her zero problems --- no rashes, nothing but a healthy glow and smooth cheeks. I would highly recommend the Dead Sea Mud Mask to anyone that asked and even to strangers in a passing conversation.</li>
            <li> I finally used this product and its okay. Nothing to bragg about really.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and remove. Love the feeling afterwards</li>
            <li> So soothing and made my skin look amazing after!</li>
            <li> I had never tried a mud mask, so this was very interesting. It went on well and left my skin feeling very smooth. I felt like I was at a spa!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth. This is a great product. It&#x27;s very natural and doesn&#x27;t have any heavy smell. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Product arrived packaged well..was excited to get try it .. Opened lid to find it had already been opened/damaged seal..appears to have been used prior to shipping hole punctured torn open in middle directly in seal inside under lid w some leakage all around inside of jar. Scared to use it as lid had been placed back on w an apparent attempt to real seal product to look new</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask from InstaNatural. I have been on a mask kick for a while and have been trying out so many so I could find the perfect one. This one is so far my favorite. It&#x27;s easy to apply, goes on smoothly, and just feels so good. Once it&#x27;s dried, it&#x27;s very easy to rinse away. This mask has cleared up some acne I have been dealing with. It&#x27;s a great mask that goes deep into the pores to pull out all the junk that builds up that cleansers can&#x27;t remove. My skin feels SO much softer after I use this mask. It&#x27;s clearer, moisturized, and just all around cleaner! It&#x27;s such a nice way to pamper my face twice a week. You get a lot of product for a great price! Much better than the $65 little jars from the high end beauty store!</li>
