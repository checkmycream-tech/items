            <li> Very GOOD.  HAPPY WITH PURCHASE</li>
            <li> These buffers worked well and came quickly in the mail. I would order again.</li>
            <li> Great product and super cute</li>
            <li> A little hard, but still works well</li>
            <li> These are OK but a little to coarse for my natural nails but might be OK for acrylics. . I didnt read the discription well and thought this had a couple of textures, but all sides are the same grit. If you want the blocks with a selection of textures this isnt it.  next time I&#x27;ll get the blocks that have a different grade of the grit on every side.</li>
            <li> great for the price and they work well too</li>
            <li> Packaged good and are a good quality nail tool to use during the manicure process.  Gets the nails ready for polish</li>
            <li> Not the greatest, but they do as expected. Dont last very long though.</li>

            <li> They are all rough so not good for smoothing the nail but great for buffing out ridges</li>
            <li> Great price, cute pink color. Will order again</li>

            <li> they do have glitter on them but they are very good buffers I love them I wont have to buy any for a long time either :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected! thanks!</li>
            <li> Good price but I thought the sanding block files were a little flimsy.  I bought these to file down my toe nails.  The sanding surface wasn&#x27;t very effective.  The emery boards I bought on Amazon work better at filing my toe nails.  The first time I had a sanding block file used was during a pedicure.  Since they don&#x27;t reuse them, they gave it to me to take home.  It definitely worked better that these.</li>
            <li> I thought they were buffers but they are just nail files</li>
            <li> Love them,, lasting long, I would recommend this product to any nail Tech. Great Job keep up the good work</li>
            <li> love this little things</li>
            <li> Great bargain long lasting.</li>
            <li> These pink buffers are so dull they are really one use only items.  BTW they ship from Hong Kong and take over 4 weeks to arrive.  This product is of such inferior quality that I woluld not waste my money or considerable time on them</li>
            <li> The shipping on this product took forever!  Didn&#x27;t realize they were coming from China.  They also have glitter on them so will not work for what I had bought them for.</li>
            <li> i really like these for small chips in natural nails.  You have control of what you are removing with this product and leaves a smooth finish</li>
            <li> Nice, but a little harsh. They&#x27;re really pretty and have some sparkles on them.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these if you take care of your nails and like to work on them a lot. Very good for manicures.</li>
            <li> Perfect for at home manicures! Seriously, you cannot beat the rice you pay for 10 of blocks.  Work as expected, would recommend.</li>
            <li> These are perfect. I use them for buffing my nails before applying gel polish. They&#x27;re great for that. Plus they&#x27;re cute.</li>
