    <ol>
            <li>and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>This should PERFECT for all hair types !</li>
            <li>Great product thank you!</li>
            <li>Best color treatment ever!  </li>
            <li>Awesome just as described.</li>
            <li>I think Wella is the best</li>
            <li>Wella is great.</li>
            <li>But it works great with the color I used (Wella Color Charm T18) and presented the color that I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great results.</li>
            <li>Great deal, does everything it claims.</li>
            <li>volume developer works great if you are doing bleach.</li>
            <li>Very effective for my hair lightening needs.</li>
            <li>Excellent and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Thx Good product.</li>
            <li>Good find.</li>
            <li>Work great with Wella color but need more info.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Wella products!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Kind of akward</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and excellent pricing.</li>
            <li>I used to not care what kind of developer I used, but when I picked up the T18 &amp; T14 toner I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>, I consider better then most leading brands!</li>
            <li>My local hair product store went out of business and this was the best way for me to get what I need to color my own hair.</li>
            <li>It smells nice; not too chemically or strong.</li>
            <li>I got this for $4 and when the bottle arrived it was huge!</li>
            <li>I will order more.</li>
            <li>Love the size of the bottle</li>
            <li>I love this stuff I just wish it hadn&#x27;t almost fully poured out in the package.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed buying wella color charm cream .</li>
            <li>and I am glad she did.</li>
            <li>and I just love it</li>
            <li>I also found that giving my hair time to rest in between bleaching and toning was a better option for me.</li>
            <li>Because of pre bleaching I did not need to lift any more levels, which is what a 20 volume will do.</li>
            <li>Cream developer works better than Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>fast delivery and great product.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and allows for many uses.  </li>
            <li>Its a great professional product.</li>
            <li>Perfect and easier to use than I had expected.</li>
            <li>Gives a rich color that is better for your hair than box colors.  </li>
            <li>non-irritating to the scalp, and hair stayed smooth.</li>
            <li>It really does seem to cover the gray better since I have subbed this for the developer in my Revlon colorsilk haircolor</li>
            <li>Works well, nothing super special about it.</li>
            <li>Holy cow this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Comes quick.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment.</li>
            <li>Normally I wouldn&#x27;t mind getting more like this, but it was preopened.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was new or used and didn&#x27;t want to risk putting this on my head in case it&#x27;s been tampered with.</li>
            <li>This bottle was maybe 2 thirds full, so that is my first beef.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is something about the mix that is just superior to other brands I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This a also very gentle for retouching and bleaching roots.</li>
            <li>This product arrived very fast and works exactly how it us supposed to .</li>
            <li>Never use a volume higher then 20.</li>
            <li>I am trying this for the first time after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>I am also bleaching my hair for the first time.</li>
            <li>More developer than I&#x27;ll use in my entire life for a fraction of the in-store cost.</li>
            <li>I love how giant this container is.</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;Not willing to risk the quality of my  hair for $13</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s satisfactory when I when from black to blonde and only left on 10 minutes to find AMAZING RESULTS and WITHOUT DAMAGE.The smell is strong but this is a truly great devolper to dye hair.</li>
            <li>I can say that the developer I received looks very runny.</li>
            <li>and it was sealed really well</li>
            <li>The 20 volume developer looks very runny also.</li>
            <li>Developer works very well, used it with toner today.</li>
            <li>Love this - more than one person could really use in a decade of hair coloring, unless one practiced truly unhealthy hair coloring habits.</li>
            <li>Like other products better.</li>
            <li>I am using the Quick Blue bleach with the wella &amp;#34;white lady&amp;#34; T18 toner.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item along with a packet of Loreal Quick Blue powder bleach from Matchbox.</li>
            <li>and I opened to find the bottle of developer plus a 1lb tub of Quick Blue.</li>
            <li>I would buy again for mixing with toner, but will probably stick with high volume developer to get lighter blonde hair quickly.</li>
            <li>highly suggest, if you are using toner instead of dye, to get the 10 volume developer.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>Product showed up quickly and in a flat rate envelope.</li>
            <li>the developer is gentle and there is no harsh smell.</li>
            <li>It is nice and thick so it doesn&#x27;t drip when applied.</li>
            <li>Definitely worked well with Wella Color Charm; low odor and easy to use.</li>
            <li>that is strong enough to lift completely, yet gentle enough that my hair doesn&#x27;t completely break apart after lifting!</li>
            <li>This a new product for me</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t &#x27;need&#x27; 30 volume or higher to get bleach blonde hair and this can make it a safer option.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so far it works.</li>
            <li>My skin is quite sensitive and prone to flair ups.</li>
            <li>I did toner directly after bleaching once and</li>
            <li>and I was so surprised at how this worked .</li>
            <li>I still use it to mix my professional hair color at home.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and does not damage my hair.</li>
            <li>Came earlier than expected it was a full bottle</li>
            <li>30 and 40 are too harsh for hair, specially for first timer and inexperienced user.</li>
            <li>have thick, coarse, high volume, wavy ashe light brown/dark blonde hair that pulls gold.</li>
            <li>No overpowering smell, and my hair was left soft, shiny, and healthier than it looked before.</li>
            <li>And if it does, I wonder how old the product I received was to have so much of the contents missing.</li>

            <li> This will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Not runny and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been using for a long time.</li>
            <li> My color has never lasted this long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mainly giving this a bad rating because the bottle arrived with a huge dent in the side, the cap was basically off, and the product was all over the box, the packaging, and the other items I ordered.</li>
            <li> Inner seal was missing - unlike when I purchase the same product in-store :</li>
            <li> Be careful if you already have highlights in your hair, as you can &#x27;slap&#x27; those highlighted areas by accident if you are doing an all over application.</li>
            <li> Ordered this and received a bottle that has no safety seal inside (not sure if that&#x27;s normal) and has about 1/3 of the developer cream missing.</li>
            <li> I found that with 10 volume I still get the same toner results that I want with virtually very little damage.</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on the product itself as I did not use the product due to this.</li>
            <li> I rec it to use with other Wella color products.</li>
            <li> Was a little confused when it wasn&#x27;t sealed, but it doesn&#x27;t matter much to me.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair black and it does the job well.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit watery compared with the products I used before, however I don&#x27;t think it effectes the the end result.</li>
            <li> It was a little harsh on my hair though.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dark</li>
            <li> I just opened my package a few hours ago</li>
            <li> There seems to be some of the cream missing, too, if you&#x27;d even call it that.</li>
            <li> The bottle of developer looked like it had been opened and a small amount missing from the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, the contents are certainly creamy in color, but as thin as water - not what I would call &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; at all, and I&#x27;ve been using hair products for work for 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not more expensive either.  </li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t tried it, but it was awkwardly packaged and the bottle was already opened?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually afraid to try it,</li>
            <li> Smells bad.  </li>

            <li> Ordered this and received a bottle that has no safety seal inside (not sure if that&#x27;s normal) and has about 1/3 of the developer cream missing. Does this evaporate? And if it does, I wonder how old the product I received was to have so much of the contents missing. I cannot comment on the product itself as I did not use the product due to this. I can say that the developer I received looks very runny. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was new or used and didn&#x27;t want to risk putting this on my head in case it&#x27;s been tampered with. YIKES!</li>
            <li> This is the easiest way for me to purchase this product and it&#x27;s not more expensive either.  I will order more.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit watery compared with the products I used before, however I don&#x27;t think it effectes the the end result.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I wanted to stick with the same brand and line as the hair color I&#x27;m going to be using, even though I know that&#x27;s not necessary. I&#x27;m mainly giving this a bad rating because the bottle arrived with a huge dent in the side, the cap was basically off, and the product was all over the box, the packaging, and the other items I ordered. I also wanted to mention, as others have, that the product is quite runny for a cream developer. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I used this developer with Wella Color Charm Toner (T18) and it worked perfectly. It was a little harsh on my hair though.</li>
            <li> Ive used this for a year, with toners.  My hair is very dark so I need the 30 volume for bleach.  But I use this 20 volume for toners.  Works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I havent used another brand because this is Wella, and my toners are by Wella also, so I just prefer to use the same brand.</li>
            <li> It did its job like five times and I still have a ton left! Love the size of the bottle</li>
            <li> This product worked well and did what it was supposed to. I would buy it again the next time I need some.</li>
            <li> Excellent and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very effective for my hair lightening needs.</li>
            <li> I just opened my package a few hours ago so I haven&#x27;t tried it, but it was awkwardly packaged and the bottle was already opened? There seems to be some of the cream missing, too, if you&#x27;d even call it that. The liquid&#x27;s viscosity is very low and basically just looks like watered-down milk. I&#x27;m actually afraid to try it, but oh well, I&#x27;ll give it a go.</li>
            <li> Was a little confused when it wasn&#x27;t sealed, but it doesn&#x27;t matter much to me. Works the way it&#x27;s supposed to. Wella is great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I just wish it hadn&#x27;t almost fully poured out in the package.</li>
            <li> Product showed up quickly and in a flat rate envelope. Kind of akward but it worked. Bottle was intact. I would definately order form this company again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a developer so it smells and makes my eyes water! But it works great with the color I used (Wella Color Charm T18) and presented the color that I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected it was a full bottle and it was sealed really well</li>
            <li> A product I will use again</li>
            <li> Thx Good product. It really does seem to cover the gray better since I have subbed this for the developer in my Revlon colorsilk haircolor</li>
            <li> Devolpers are NOT all the same ! We&#x27;ll is my go to , I consider better then most leading brands! It&#x27;s satisfactory when I when from black to blonde and only left on 10 minutes to find AMAZING RESULTS and WITHOUT DAMAGE.The smell is strong but this is a truly great devolper to dye hair. Never use a volume higher then 20. This should PERFECT for all hair types ! I really enjoyed buying wella color charm cream .</li>
            <li> Comes quick. Use this all the time</li>
            <li> Works well, nothing super special about it. Not runny and lasts a long time. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been using for a long time. My local hair product store went out of business and this was the best way for me to get what I need to color my own hair.</li>
            <li> Use this for Wella Toners, works will and the toners never give me a problem. Great results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and used it with Wella color.  This is the developer.  Easy to use and allows for many uses.  The color comes in smaller containers but still allows for several different colorings.  Gives a rich color that is better for your hair than box colors.  My hairdresser recommended that I use it and I am glad she did.</li>
            <li> Return customer! Fast shipping and excellent pricing.</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d as listed.Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Work great with Wella color but need more info. to mix, just said 2 to 1 ratio. How about if I use 3 to 1 ratio will it get darker or lighter?&lt;br /&gt;But so far it works.</li>
            <li> Definitely worked well with Wella Color Charm; low odor and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This a new product for me and I just love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Wella products! At the moment, I have platinum blonde hair and this is the only developer I have ever used that is strong enough to lift completely, yet gentle enough that my hair doesn&#x27;t completely break apart after lifting!</li>
            <li> Did the job and did not damage my hair - going from gray to white using wella toner T18</li>
            <li> Smells bad.  Like other products better.</li>
            <li> Great product thank you!</li>
            <li> Did what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I am trying this for the first time after reading the reviews. I am also bleaching my hair for the first time. I am using the Quick Blue bleach with the wella &amp;#34;white lady&amp;#34; T18 toner. I am still in the process of getting it to that &amp;#34;bleach blonde&amp;#34; as I started w med/light brown hair ....the developer is gentle and there is no harsh smell.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Immediate results !</li>
            <li> Great deal, does everything it claims. I used this to mix with powder bleach &amp; toner. However, I prefer 30-40 volume for bleaching. I would buy again for mixing with toner, but will probably stick with high volume developer to get lighter blonde hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I used to not care what kind of developer I used, but when I picked up the T18 &amp; T14 toner I decided to give this a try. There is something about the mix that is just superior to other brands I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help any ladies that may have hair like mine:&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse, high volume, wavy ashe light brown/dark blonde hair that pulls gold. I have two cowlicks going opposite ways on each side of my head. My skin is quite sensitive and prone to flair ups. If I were to use an analogy, my hair is like titanium and my skin is like paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This volume developer works great if you are doing bleach. You don&#x27;t &#x27;need&#x27; 30 volume or higher to get bleach blonde hair and this can make it a safer option. Be careful if you already have highlights in your hair, as you can &#x27;slap&#x27; those highlighted areas by accident if you are doing an all over application. I also found that giving my hair time to rest in between bleaching and toning was a better option for me. I did toner directly after bleaching once and the result was straw. Crunchy straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest, if you are using toner instead of dye, to get the 10 volume developer. Because of pre bleaching I did not need to lift any more levels, which is what a 20 volume will do. I found that with 10 volume I still get the same toner results that I want with virtually very little damage.</li>
            <li> Best color treatment ever!  My color has never lasted this long.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item along with a packet of Loreal Quick Blue powder bleach from Matchbox. It arrived today in a box and I opened to find the bottle of developer plus a 1lb tub of Quick Blue. The bottle of developer looked like it had been opened and a small amount missing from the bottle. It had packing tape covering the cap. After opening it to see, no safety seal was found. The QuickBlue was opened, powdered bleach was dusted throughout the box and it had 2 baggies inside of it. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t mind getting more like this, but it was preopened. No note accompanied it saying it had been replaced or whatever. The 20 volume developer looks very runny also.</li>
            <li> This bottle was maybe 2 thirds full, so that is my first beef.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the contents are certainly creamy in color, but as thin as water - not what I would call &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; at all, and I&#x27;ve been using hair products for work for 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this - more than one person could really use in a decade of hair coloring, unless one practiced truly unhealthy hair coloring habits. No overpowering smell, and my hair was left soft, shiny, and healthier than it looked before. Good find.</li>
            <li> Awesome just as described. Cream developer works better than Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product arrived very fast and works exactly how it us supposed to . I used this with white lady wells color charms to tone my hair and I was so surprised at how this worked . I would highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> Holy cow this is a great buy. More developer than I&#x27;ll use in my entire life for a fraction of the in-store cost.</li>
            <li> l don think i&#x27;ll be going to a salon again</li>
            <li> I finally got around to mixing this with color bought from same place, and the color didn&#x27;t process</li>
            <li> This stuff is always reliable. Its a great professional product. I rec it to use with other Wella color products.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered as per description.  I think Wella is the best</li>
            <li> I got this for $4 and when the bottle arrived it was huge! 32 FL OZ. I still use it to mix my professional hair color at home. It is nice and thick so it doesn&#x27;t drip when applied. It smells nice; not too chemically or strong. It leaves my hair soft and does not damage my hair. I have been using this for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> Will use this instead of box dyes! Perfect and easier to use than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I love how giant this container is. This will last me a long time. I dye my hair black and it does the job well.</li>
            <li> fast delivery and great product. blended well with my dying cream. non-irritating to the scalp, and hair stayed smooth. will buy over and over again.</li>
            <li> Consistency was similar to water ... Inner seal was missing - unlike when I purchase the same product in-store :(&lt;br /&gt;Not willing to risk the quality of my  hair for $13</li>
            <li> If you are like me, doing bleach at home, then you should use this. If you made a mistake and you can still recovery with a dye. 30 and 40 are too harsh for hair, specially for first timer and inexperienced user. This a also very gentle for retouching and bleaching roots.</li>
            <li> Developer works very well, used it with toner today.</li>
