            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of eyelash adhesive in my life, but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Light browns and bright colored liners may not get along with this liner glue.</li>
            <li>This is clearly the best adhesive.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li>The glue is really nice, easy to control, and of course, does the job.</li>
            <li>I do think it looks better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; you get at a store.</li>
            <li>The price for this item was better than the prices I&#x27;ve seen in stores.</li>
            <li>I like Revlon&#x27;s adhesive so much better...</li>
            <li>She love it.</li>
            <li>you best believe that even an entire night of sweating and dancing, this lash glue will stay on.&lt;br /&gt;also</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this lash adhesive.</li>
            <li>:) thank you.</li>
            <li>I have used it many times and it is prefect</li>
            <li>It is my favorite.</li>
            <li>My favorite adhesive.</li>
            <li>I use this adhesive on my ardell lashes and love the combination.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you will get it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love it ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li>I have purchased this from drugstores many times.</li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>Perfectly put every time I get back home.</li>
            <li>i love it its amazing it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it</li>
            <li>She uses the eyelash glue so that motivates me to ask and so far I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>I also love how it dries black, it blends in perfectly with my eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it gives an excellent hold to your faux lashes.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to drow my eyes with the eyeliner after applied the eyelashes.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this its is easy to use and apply&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy as that.</li>
            <li>They come off easily with water/tears.</li>
            <li>Comes off easily with liquid make-up remover.</li>
            <li>I am undecided as to whether I think it is as strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen people complain about the strong odor, and I&#x27;m not gonna lie</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff and not ridiculously priced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to put on a full set of lashes, but then again, I&#x27;ve never tried with the DUO.</li>
            <li>Great seller, fast and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I found black was the best way to go.</li>
            <li>im super satisfied with it</li>
            <li>I needed the latex free one and this product did not tell you the ingredients</li>
            <li>&gt; If you have any questions on my review please feel free to ask.</li>
            <li>advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it</li>
            <li>Works great and lashes stay put all day long.</li>
            <li>By far the best and longest lasting lash glue</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll have to clean up your eye area if you miss your lash line.</li>
            <li>Duo, works amazing and helps make my lashes look natural!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff perfect for getting a natural look for dark haired beauties.</li>
            <li>At first i really liked it because it gets tacky super fast.</li>
            <li>Application might work with practice and more steady fingers</li>
            <li>Glue came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have steady hands</li>
            <li>It holds up well, dries quickly and is virtually waterproof.</li>
            <li>I love the dark color of this glue, it blend nicely with the color of my lashes.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Worked exactly as described!  </li>
            <li>glue is easy to apply,  I will normally put black liner on first before I put the lashes on and it blends beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Like this one better than the clear glue</li>
            <li>Not to mention, the darker tone to the glue makes the lash look more natural.</li>
            <li>I found a clear waterproof one I like lots better.</li>
            <li>I used to love clear adhesive until I gave this a try.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite adhesive because it blends with the lashes and doesn&#x27;t stick to your natural lashes ripping them out.  </li>
            <li>Got here super fast !</li>
            <li>But other then that It was good and worked well</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t see the glue (if you do it right)</li>
            <li>I normally use another waterproof eyelash glue and that one works fine.</li>
            <li>It dries quick and it looks so much better than the clear/ white.</li>
            <li>The color is also a good match if you always use black eyeliner as  I do.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much</li>
            <li>MORE THEN ten Dollars at sephora</li>
            <li>Item as described and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Actually,  I think the hair glue is much better than this.</li>
            <li>God knows who touched this product or what was touching it if the outside looked like it was dragged through mud.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>really holds the lashes !</li>
            <li>Firstly I receive this product on time..</li>
            <li>Really recommend it!  </li>
            <li>very affordable!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nowhere near as odorous as some reviews made it seem and the smell goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>More of a grey color than black, but it stuck well and comes out of the tube nicely.</li>
            <li>though I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t need to for a long while!</li>
            <li>so when i applied it my eyes got swollen and really irritated</li>
            <li>It also holds up really well</li>
            <li>Lasts really well</li>
            <li>It is really goo</li>
            <li>My lashes stay put all day and night, but when I&#x27;m ready to remove them I have no problems.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t really say &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li>I really like this product I wish it had a wand applicator</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The Duo brush-on adhesive does not smell but it only comes in clear so far (which I do like this one more since I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting any extra product because you get more control).</li>
            <li>It actually seems to make the lashes look more natural bc</li>
            <li>I have the waterproof and love that for active days</li>
            <li>So cry a few tears of joy as you will not have to worry about your lashes coming loose.</li>
            <li>and this is hands down my favorite.</li>
            <li>make sure you apply a little pressure so the glue can really bond to your eye.</li>
            <li>I love that it is black.</li>
            <li>I like that the color goes on very natural and it doesn&#x27;t show as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>highly recommend people boycott this seller and not risk their health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(item is a shade of light grey) not black like exprected.</li>
            <li>Hiding the band of my eyelashes is so easy with this dark color.</li>
            <li>strong glue, turns black after it dries as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller</li>
            <li>I am not sure that it works better then</li>
            <li>It last all day even in hot humid weather.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by a professional make up artist and it works well!  </li>
            <li>I love that the glue is dark as oppose to the white glue that is so noticeable.</li>
            <li>This dark adhesive is so much better than the white.</li>
            <li>but I think it doesnt work as well as the clear version.</li>
            <li>It dries clear and</li>
            <li>I prefer the clear...</li>
            <li>Clearly it was used before.</li>
            <li>it becomes clear..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>When I received the product in the mail the box the glue came in was completely destroyed.</li>
            <li>Its not messy when you apply</li>
            <li>This is my old standby.</li>
            <li>The glue holds a day with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li>I apply it directly to the lashes, wait like 30 seconds or until it starts to become sticky then apply them to my face.</li>
            <li>Love the dark color and the long term stick ability of this glue.</li>
            <li>but it does provide a good hold while also not being difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t black, more like a charcoal or dark gray, but blends in real well with your makeup</li>
            <li>I would recommend their clear version if you are using liners that are not dark.</li>
            <li>Item was not at dark as expected, but still worked appropriately for lashes.</li>
            <li>It was clearly smashed before it was shipped and there seems to be hot pink nail polish all over it.</li>
            <li>They are simply super, when I apply the glue no one noticed since it turns black after a while</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands before and after using Duo for the first time</li>
            <li>I have always used the white that turned clear.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s barely noticeable at all.</li>
            <li>Comes out a funny color but will eventually turn a dark brownish/black color after it dries.</li>
            <li>not very sticky does not work very well</li>
            <li>It sticks really well, but can be gloopy if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Just be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fall off or hang low, they stay on and strong with only a small strip of adhesive.</li>
            <li>Using a toothpick to apply makes it much easier to use than other types of glues I have tried.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to white or clear.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the dark color.</li>
            <li>So much in one little tube.</li>

            <li> I have used it many times and it is prefect</li>
            <li> It is my favorite.</li>
            <li> My favorite adhesive.</li>
            <li> I use this adhesive on my ardell lashes and love the combination.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you will get it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love it ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> I have purchased this from drugstores many times.</li>
            <li> What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> Perfectly put every time I get back home.</li>
            <li> i love it its amazing it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it</li>
            <li> She uses the eyelash glue so that motivates me to ask and so far I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I also love how it dries black, it blends in perfectly with my eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it gives an excellent hold to your faux lashes.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to drow my eyes with the eyeliner after applied the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this its is easy to use and apply&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy as that.</li>
            <li> They come off easily with water/tears.</li>
            <li> Comes off easily with liquid make-up remover.</li>
            <li> I am undecided as to whether I think it is as strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen people complain about the strong odor, and I&#x27;m not gonna lie</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff and not ridiculously priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to put on a full set of lashes, but then again, I&#x27;ve never tried with the DUO.</li>
            <li> Great seller, fast and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I found black was the best way to go.</li>
            <li> im super satisfied with it</li>
            <li> I needed the latex free one and this product did not tell you the ingredients</li>
            <li> &gt; If you have any questions on my review please feel free to ask.</li>
            <li> advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it</li>
            <li> Works great and lashes stay put all day long.</li>
            <li> By far the best and longest lasting lash glue</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll have to clean up your eye area if you miss your lash line.</li>
            <li> Duo, works amazing and helps make my lashes look natural!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff perfect for getting a natural look for dark haired beauties.</li>
            <li> At first i really liked it because it gets tacky super fast.</li>
            <li> Application might work with practice and more steady fingers</li>
            <li> Glue came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have steady hands</li>
            <li> It holds up well, dries quickly and is virtually waterproof.</li>
            <li> I love the dark color of this glue, it blend nicely with the color of my lashes.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as described!  </li>
            <li> glue is easy to apply,  I will normally put black liner on first before I put the lashes on and it blends beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Like this one better than the clear glue</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the darker tone to the glue makes the lash look more natural.</li>
            <li> I found a clear waterproof one I like lots better.</li>
            <li> I used to love clear adhesive until I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite adhesive because it blends with the lashes and doesn&#x27;t stick to your natural lashes ripping them out.  </li>
            <li> Got here super fast !</li>
            <li> But other then that It was good and worked well</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t see the glue (if you do it right)</li>
            <li> I normally use another waterproof eyelash glue and that one works fine.</li>
            <li> It dries quick and it looks so much better than the clear/ white.</li>
            <li> The color is also a good match if you always use black eyeliner as  I do.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much</li>
            <li> MORE THEN ten Dollars at sephora</li>
            <li> Item as described and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Actually,  I think the hair glue is much better than this.</li>
            <li> God knows who touched this product or what was touching it if the outside looked like it was dragged through mud.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> really holds the lashes !</li>
            <li> Firstly I receive this product on time..</li>
            <li> Really recommend it!  </li>
            <li> very affordable!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nowhere near as odorous as some reviews made it seem and the smell goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> More of a grey color than black, but it stuck well and comes out of the tube nicely.</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t need to for a long while!</li>
            <li> so when i applied it my eyes got swollen and really irritated</li>
            <li> It also holds up really well</li>
            <li> Lasts really well</li>
            <li> It is really goo</li>
            <li> My lashes stay put all day and night, but when I&#x27;m ready to remove them I have no problems.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t really say &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li> I really like this product I wish it had a wand applicator</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The Duo brush-on adhesive does not smell but it only comes in clear so far (which I do like this one more since I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting any extra product because you get more control).</li>
            <li> It actually seems to make the lashes look more natural bc</li>
            <li> I have the waterproof and love that for active days</li>
            <li> So cry a few tears of joy as you will not have to worry about your lashes coming loose.</li>
            <li> and this is hands down my favorite.</li>
            <li> make sure you apply a little pressure so the glue can really bond to your eye.</li>
            <li> I love that it is black.</li>
            <li> I like that the color goes on very natural and it doesn&#x27;t show as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> highly recommend people boycott this seller and not risk their health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (item is a shade of light grey) not black like exprected.</li>
            <li> Hiding the band of my eyelashes is so easy with this dark color.</li>
            <li> strong glue, turns black after it dries as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller</li>
            <li> I am not sure that it works better then</li>
            <li> It last all day even in hot humid weather.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a professional make up artist and it works well!  </li>
            <li> I love that the glue is dark as oppose to the white glue that is so noticeable.</li>
            <li> This dark adhesive is so much better than the white.</li>
            <li> but I think it doesnt work as well as the clear version.</li>
            <li> It dries clear and</li>
            <li> I prefer the clear...</li>
            <li> Clearly it was used before.</li>
            <li> it becomes clear..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> When I received the product in the mail the box the glue came in was completely destroyed.</li>
            <li> Its not messy when you apply</li>
            <li> This is my old standby.</li>
            <li> The glue holds a day with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li> I apply it directly to the lashes, wait like 30 seconds or until it starts to become sticky then apply them to my face.</li>
            <li> Love the dark color and the long term stick ability of this glue.</li>
            <li> but it does provide a good hold while also not being difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t black, more like a charcoal or dark gray, but blends in real well with your makeup</li>
            <li> I would recommend their clear version if you are using liners that are not dark.</li>
            <li> Item was not at dark as expected, but still worked appropriately for lashes.</li>
            <li> It was clearly smashed before it was shipped and there seems to be hot pink nail polish all over it.</li>
            <li> They are simply super, when I apply the glue no one noticed since it turns black after a while</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands before and after using Duo for the first time</li>
            <li> I have always used the white that turned clear.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s barely noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> Comes out a funny color but will eventually turn a dark brownish/black color after it dries.</li>
            <li> not very sticky does not work very well</li>
            <li> It sticks really well, but can be gloopy if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fall off or hang low, they stay on and strong with only a small strip of adhesive.</li>
            <li> Using a toothpick to apply makes it much easier to use than other types of glues I have tried.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to white or clear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the dark color.</li>
            <li> So much in one little tube.</li>
            <li> I WILL ONLY BUY THE BLACK ADHESIVE GLUE, THIS GLUE DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE A CRUSTY WHITE RESIDUE LIKE THE CLEAR ADHESIVE.</li>
            <li> After reading so much good review about this duo lash adhesive, I finally purchased one and was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Especially because the last lash adhesive i was using was white (that dried clear)</li>
            <li> When I use LashGrip, My eyelash stay on over 2 days without any sign of fall off, I don&#x27;t have a lot of eyelashes, I don&#x27;t use mascara, I sleep with these fake eyelashes fine when I use lash grip, but Duo only last me a day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried the clear and dark lash adhesive as well as the brush-on.</li>
            <li> I use either the dark or clear formula, I put liner over the seam anyways</li>
            <li> Works well to adhere my false full set of eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I tend to apply it a little thicker because I live in a humid climate</li>
            <li> I like the dark rather than the clear as the dark fills in any little spaces between your own or the false lashes.</li>
            <li> would use black or clear both works well.</li>
            <li> If you use black or dark brown liner though, this really helps hide that pesky lash  band.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take too long to dry, but stayed pliable long enough for me to adjust and readjust my lashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes look natural using the dark!</li>
            <li> Pretty convenient, if a little messy.</li>
            <li> Items are expected in proper packaging for transport.</li>
            <li> It is grey in color but once applied it&#x27;ll disappear.</li>
            <li> Once you get it applied it will work for a really long time, and it isn&#x27;t noticeable at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to hold all day so long as I am not in a humid and windy environment.</li>
            <li> This helps blend them in to your natural lash line and doesn&#x27;t have the obvious clear shiny false eyelash line.</li>
            <li> Afterward, I was really discouraged and skeptical about getting new adhesive, but all it took was one try</li>
            <li> Oh once dry</li>
            <li> Its long lasting, and since its dark its not even noticeable.</li>
            <li> The lid from the glue was missing and it seems there was an object lodged into the tip to apparently stop the product from drying out.</li>
            <li> THE BLACK GIVES YOU A EYELINER EFFECT WHEN YOU APPLY IT PROPERLY TO THE EYELASH STRIPS.</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to applying with a tube (messy) to false eyelashes and getting the proper timing between application to lashes and placing above eyelash so it stick quickly.</li>
            <li> Its going to look grey when it comes out, but it will dry black.</li>
            <li> Got this item and the package was open and it was half empty!</li>
            <li> It does dry out if you don&#x27;t close the cap tightly or don&#x27;t use it for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> This color says dark, but it&#x27;s grey.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dont like is that it it oozes out of the tube... a lot.</li>
            <li> The Dark tone dries black/charcoal grey, which makes it a breeze to hide with your eyeliner.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dark, - and gets gradually darker after you give it some time to dry</li>
            <li> Then hold the middle and the end down with a little pressure as well.</li>
            <li> I was kinda hoping the glue was going to be black instead of a dark whitish grey color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands that hurt my eyes and make them water.</li>
            <li> Using this product,  I had to reapply the lashes every other day.</li>
            <li> I prefer the dark color because the invisible color it&#x27;s not really invisible.</li>
            <li> now I wonder why they even make any other color.</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other adhesive.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other lash glue anymore.</li>
            <li> and this one is grey and dries black which works well with the black eyeliner i use.</li>
            <li> It is too thin, not sticky enough and ends up running all over your fingers before you have a chance to attach the last to your eye</li>
            <li> I decided to try the dark.  </li>
            <li> Holds lashes well and the dark color is a plus.  </li>
            <li> I always wear dark lash adhesive with my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes always stay in place the dark pigment helps them blend with my make up</li>
            <li> Color is dark and blends with make-up.  </li>
            <li> but the dark does a lot in blending the eyeliner and hairline.</li>
            <li> The dark color works well for me since I have dark lashes.</li>
            <li> I was always unhappy with the white residue my regular glue left until I stumbled upon the black -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I ever tried other brands!</li>
            <li> and it comes out black</li>
            <li> I have black lashes, so this matches my color well.</li>
            <li> Drying black.</li>
            <li> How long you wait for the glue to become tacky is a bit hard you have to practice.</li>
            <li> You may need to practice how thick you apply the glue and how long you wait to apply the lash.</li>
            <li> It may take a little skill to apply this dark adhesive correctly, because if it smears it looks like messy eyeliner on your lids.</li>
            <li> I like the dark color which blend in well after it dries however, the glue is not strong as the one I purchased at Walmart &amp;#34;LashGrip&amp;#34; under $3  over a year ago.</li>
            <li> BUT it would be less messy if not in a tube and instead applied with a brush.</li>
            <li> i have never used it before ordering it, so i was a little nervous to buy</li>
            <li> no matter how little you try to put on it.</li>
            <li> I hold the lash with tweezers and apply the glue, then I blow on the glue a little to get it tacky faster.</li>
            <li> Just play around with it a little</li>
            <li> I wear falsies everyday  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I will add a few pictures of my eyelashes because I have tons of them with this glue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used DUO glue for my false lashes that I wear, daily!</li>
            <li> When I took off the fake eyelashes, there was still glue, it wouldn&#x27;t come off, and it was super irritating!</li>
            <li> Dries very dark and lasts all night!</li>
            <li> Works so well for my small mini sets of lashes</li>
            <li> Didnt like it, application was hard to do and ended up all over the place</li>
            <li> but it depends how thick the line you apply to the false lash is.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced irritation or discomfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing false eyelashes for years now, so I know how to apply the adhesive.</li>
            <li> Never before had used false eyelashes, but I&#x27;ve been watching some videos of makeup (ByCamilaCoelho)</li>
            <li> I thought it would be difficult to work with, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> but I bought the wrong color...</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply and the color can be seen</li>
            <li> It stinks but does what promises to do</li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t even know I have artificial lashes at all.</li>
            <li> My fake eyelashes have endured the windiest days to sweaty, brutal, headbanging concerts.</li>
            <li> Recommended badly.</li>
            <li> the latex base wouldn&#x27;t stick to my eyelids</li>
            <li> I just got my item today and the packaging is covered with nasty brown mystery smudges everywhere.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have always used the white that turned clear.  I decided to try the dark.  I do think it looks better.  I am undecided as to whether I think it is as strong.</li>
            <li> MORE THEN ten Dollars at sephora and I saved money!!</li>
            <li> More of a grey color than black, but it stuck well and comes out of the tube nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; you get at a store. It dries quick and it looks so much better than the clear/ white.</li>
            <li> Great seller, fast and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> By far the best and longest lasting lash glue I&#x27;ve ever used! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite adhesive that works great and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. I&#x27;ve used other brands that hurt my eyes and make them water. Duo, works amazing and helps make my lashes look natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used DUO glue for my false lashes that I wear, daily! The price for this item was better than the prices I&#x27;ve seen in stores. Item as described and fast delivery! Def will repurchase!</li>
            <li> Like this one better than the clear glue</li>
            <li> Items are expected in proper packaging for transport. No damage to items. Item was not at dark as expected, but still worked appropriately for lashes. (item is a shade of light grey) not black like exprected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing false eyelashes for years now, so I know how to apply the adhesive. This does NOT hold for me at all! I like Revlon&#x27;s adhesive so much better...</li>
            <li> As described, would buy again!</li>
            <li> The Duo lash adhesive works ok,i have used it several times. I am not sure that it works better then the eyelash adhesive i already had. I may buy again.</li>
            <li> Used it once for a wedding, works well and doesn&#x27;t sting if accidentally goes in eye.</li>
            <li> I wish the hole that allows the product to come out was a bit smaller, because too much product comes out at once and it can get a bit messy... but it does provide a good hold while also not being difficult to remove. I&#x27;ve seen people complain about the strong odor, and I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant... but it&#x27;s nowhere near as odorous as some reviews made it seem and the smell goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I needed the latex free one and this product did not tell you the ingredients so when i applied it my eyes got swollen and really irritated</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, it adheres quickly and dries even quicker. Not to mention, the darker tone to the glue makes the lash look more natural.</li>
            <li> Holds lashes well and the dark color is a plus.  I will never go back to white or clear.</li>
            <li> This glue works great! I love that the glue is dark as oppose to the white glue that is so noticeable. It isn&#x27;t black, more like a charcoal or dark gray, but blends in real well with your makeup so it&#x27;s barely noticeable at all. It also holds up really well, I had no issues with the lashes falling off or \\&quot;flipping\\&quot; up at the ends. I had the lashes on for 8 hours before I peel them off myself.</li>
            <li> This color says dark, but it&#x27;s grey. Using this product,  I had to reapply the lashes every other day. As soon as my face became oily or I washed my face, the lashes came off. This also smells like regular hair glue. Actually,  I think the hair glue is much better than this.</li>
            <li> It stinks but does what promises to do</li>
            <li> Best lash adhesive I&#x27;ve used so far. It last all day even in hot humid weather. It may take a little skill to apply this dark adhesive correctly, because if it smears it looks like messy eyeliner on your lids. Other than that, it gives an excellent hold to your faux lashes.</li>
            <li> Lasts really well but I think it doesnt work as well as the clear version.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I needed! Works great and you can&#x27;t even tell that glue is used because it blends in great with my eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I always wear dark lash adhesive with my eyelashes. This helps blend them in to your natural lash line and doesn&#x27;t have the obvious clear shiny false eyelash line.</li>
            <li> i have never used it before ordering it, so i was a little nervous to buy so i can try it out. It is really goo and it comes out black so it blends in well with your make up</li>
            <li> Especially because the last lash adhesive i was using was white (that dried clear) and this one is grey and dries black which works well with the black eyeliner i use.</li>
            <li> I wear falsies everyday  and this is hands down my favorite. My lashes stay put all day and night, but when I&#x27;m ready to remove them I have no problems. I never lose any of my own lashes. I also love how it dries black, it blends in perfectly with my eyeliner.</li>
            <li> this is a nice glue. stayed on all day, plus happy-hour time. The color is also a good match if you always use black eyeliner as  I do.</li>
            <li> I just got my item today and the packaging is covered with nasty brown mystery smudges everywhere. It was clearly smashed before it was shipped and there seems to be hot pink nail polish all over it. I will NOT be using this product out of fear that I&#x27;ll infect my eye..God knows who touched this product or what was touching it if the outside looked like it was dragged through mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend people boycott this seller and not risk their health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy.</li>
            <li> the latex base wouldn&#x27;t stick to my eyelids so I ended up giving it to a friends. She love it.</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to applying with a tube (messy) to false eyelashes and getting the proper timing between application to lashes and placing above eyelash so it stick quickly. Application might work with practice and more steady fingers BUT it would be less messy if not in a tube and instead applied with a brush. i have recently used Duo in a bottle with brush and it is 5*. Go for the brush.</li>
            <li> They are simply super, when I apply the glue no one noticed since it turns black after a while and it was easy to drow my eyes with the eyeliner after applied the eyelashes. Recommended badly.</li>
            <li> Great adhesive!  I thought it would be difficult to work with, but it wasn&#x27;t.  It didn&#x27;t take too long to dry, but stayed pliable long enough for me to adjust and readjust my lashes.</li>
            <li> Comes out a funny color but will eventually turn a dark brownish/black color after it dries. Pretty convenient, if a little messy. But thats my fault.</li>
            <li> I WILL ONLY BUY THE BLACK ADHESIVE GLUE, THIS GLUE DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE A CRUSTY WHITE RESIDUE LIKE THE CLEAR ADHESIVE. THE BLACK GIVES YOU A EYELINER EFFECT WHEN YOU APPLY IT PROPERLY TO THE EYELASH STRIPS.</li>
            <li> Product:&lt;br /&gt;Very strong glue, turns black after it dries as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller: Came in on time, perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Good adhesive and good color. Using a toothpick to apply makes it much easier to use than other types of glues I have tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the dark color. I found a clear waterproof one I like lots better.</li>
            <li> you best believe that even an entire night of sweating and dancing, this lash glue will stay on.&lt;br /&gt;also it&#x27;s dark, - and gets gradually darker after you give it some time to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it smells heinous, but such is life.</li>
            <li> i love it its amazing it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it im sui love it its amazing it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it im super satisfied with it love love love per satisfied with it love love love</li>
            <li> When I took off the fake eyelashes, there was still glue, it wouldn&#x27;t come off, and it was super irritating!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much and I would recommend this its is easy to use and apply&lt;br /&gt;I would use black or clear both works well.</li>
            <li> It is too thin, not sticky enough and ends up running all over your fingers before you have a chance to attach the last to your eye and then it&#x27;s all over your eye lid no matter how little you try to put on it.</li>
            <li> Works so well for my small mini sets of lashes (I don&#x27;t remember what they&#x27;re called, but there&#x27;s about 3-4 lashes to a group that you put on). I put the glue onto the package and let it sit for about a minute, then I grab the group of lashes and dip them into the glue and apply. Easy as that. I&#x27;ve never been able to put on a full set of lashes, but then again, I&#x27;ve never tried with the DUO. I may have to do that some day. If I do, I&#x27;ll update this review. But the glue is perfect for what I use it for. It dries clear and my own mother thought I just got some really good mascara!!!!</li>
            <li> Package was open with glue spilled on the cap when I received it. No foil cap like there should have been.</li>
            <li> I give this brand a 5 star on effectiveness but I bought the wrong color... I prefer the clear... But that&#x27;s my own mistake.</li>
            <li> Great product, price, and fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The review has nothing to do with the actual product. When I received the product in the mail the box the glue came in was completely destroyed. The lid from the glue was missing and it seems there was an object lodged into the tip to apparently stop the product from drying out. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Good for blending in with your eye make up--however, it does make my eyes burn and make my eyes water.</li>
            <li> really holds the lashes !</li>
            <li> I use this duo eyelash glue daily with strip and individual lashes.  It is the absolute best eyelash glue on the market.  I prefer the dark color because the invisible color it&#x27;s not really invisible. The invisible leaves a residue on my lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This glue is easy to apply,  I will normally put black liner on first before I put the lashes on and it blends beautifully.  I will add a few pictures of my eyelashes because I have tons of them with this glue on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you have any questions on my review please feel free to ask.</li>
            <li> This dark adhesive is so much better than the white. The lashes look natural using the dark!</li>
            <li> I was kinda hoping the glue was going to be black instead of a dark whitish grey color. But other then that It was good and worked well</li>
            <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
            <li> Always the best, I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Got this item and the package was open and it was half empty! Clearly it was used before. Cannot believe this would happened!</li>
            <li> This is the eyelash glue recommended by the experts as well as just about everybody on the internet for strip lashes. I have to concur. It&#x27;s good stuff and not ridiculously priced. Glue came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as described!  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> After reading so much good review about this duo lash adhesive, I finally purchased one and was a bit disappointed. I like the dark color which blend in well after it dries however, the glue is not strong as the one I purchased at Walmart &amp;#34;LashGrip&amp;#34; under $3  over a year ago. When I use LashGrip, My eyelash stay on over 2 days without any sign of fall off, I don&#x27;t have a lot of eyelashes, I don&#x27;t use mascara, I sleep with these fake eyelashes fine when I use lash grip, but Duo only last me a day. I will have to take it out and redo it.&lt;br /&gt;the quality is okay. Not as great.  I need the lash adhesive that can last 5-7 days. Would love to have eye lash extention but don&#x27;t have budget for it. if you know any good adhesive, please feel free to leave the comments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of eyelash adhesive in my life, but this is by far the best.  It stays put and dries well!  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this lash adhesive. If you know how to apply it correctly it will last! I do recommend this lash glue.</li>
            <li> Never before had used false eyelashes, but I&#x27;ve been watching some videos of makeup (ByCamilaCoelho) she is a beauty guru from Brazil and thousands of followers. She uses the eyelash glue so that motivates me to ask and so far I&#x27;m happy. My last hour tabs intact. is a wonderful glue.</li>
            <li> This adhesive will smell when you&#x27;re squeezing it out of the tube. However, once it dries, you won&#x27;t notice it. The Duo brush-on adhesive does not smell but it only comes in clear so far (which I do like this one more since I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting any extra product because you get more control). I&#x27;ve never had my lashes fall off while using Duo adhesives and I&#x27;ve tried the clear and dark lash adhesive as well as the brush-on. Just make sure you have steady hands or you&#x27;ll have to clean up your eye area if you miss your lash line. You can also get these cheaper here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was always unhappy with the white residue my regular glue left until I stumbled upon the black - now I wonder why they even make any other color. Brilliant.</li>
            <li> Great!!! Its long lasting, and since its dark its not even noticeable. It actually seems to make the lashes look more natural bc it hides the seam.</li>
            <li> Firstly I receive this product on time.. And secondly it works with ease!! Its not messy when you apply and it doesn&#x27;t smell.. Oh once dry it becomes clear.. Its one of the best adhesive on the market.</li>
            <li> Cheap and nice! I like them :) thank you.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a professional make up artist and it works well!  Really recommend it!  I have used it many times and it is prefect</li>
            <li> So much in one little tube. Good sticking power. Perfect tint. Wouldn&#x27;t really say &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; though. They come off easily with water/tears.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used!!!! It is my favorite. I have black lashes, so this matches my color well.</li>
            <li> Does what it says.....  My favorite adhesive.</li>
            <li> I normally use another waterproof eyelash glue and that one works fine. Got this after a recommendation from a friend. At first i really liked it because it gets tacky super fast. But when I used it on a client of mine, she notified me that halfway through the night her lashes fell off!</li>
            <li> So I got this because of the color. I love that it is black. Its going to look grey when it comes out, but it will dry black. The only thing I dont like is that it it oozes out of the tube... a lot.</li>
            <li> Love the dark color and the long term stick ability of this glue. Recommend it to all my friends now</li>
            <li> Always use this brand. Hold and ease of use is excellent. My lashes always stay in place the dark pigment helps them blend with my make up</li>
            <li> Didnt like it, application was hard to do and ended up all over the place</li>
            <li> I used to love clear adhesive until I gave this a try. Hiding the band of my eyelashes is so easy with this dark color. I would recommend their clear version if you are using liners that are not dark. Light browns and bright colored liners may not get along with this liner glue. If you use black or dark brown liner though, this really helps hide that pesky lash  band.</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply and the color can be seen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all. This is clearly the best adhesive. It holds up well, dries quickly and is virtually waterproof. So cry a few tears of joy as you will not have to worry about your lashes coming loose. I like the dark rather than the clear as the dark fills in any little spaces between your own or the false lashes.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this brand is the standard for beauty-savvy people everywhere! The glue is really nice, easy to control, and of course, does the job. The Dark tone dries black/charcoal grey, which makes it a breeze to hide with your eyeliner. This adhesive is great! I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing it again - though I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t need to for a long while!</li>
            <li> I use this adhesive on my ardell lashes and love the combination. I like that the color goes on very natural and it doesn&#x27;t show as much as I thought it would. Some people don&#x27;t even know I have artificial lashes at all.</li>
            <li> Color is dark and blends with make-up.  Comes off easily with liquid make-up remover.</li>
            <li> There are no brands that are even close to being as good as this adhesive. I&#x27;ve tried Revlon&#x27;s adhesive, and it didn&#x27;t hold the eyelashes on at all. Afterward, I was really discouraged and skeptical about getting new adhesive, but all it took was one try and I fell in love. I will never buy any other adhesive.</li>
            <li> Works great and lashes stay put all day long. Only issue is there is some glue left on the eyelid once you remove the lashes and it takes a bit of effort to get it off.</li>
            <li> Worked good blended with my eyeliner</li>
            <li> I have the waterproof and love that for active days but the dark does a lot in blending the eyeliner and hairline. I Sleep with it and in the morning they are still on.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff perfect for getting a natural look for dark haired beauties. For those who say it didn&#x27;t work there is a bit of a learning curve. It says to wait 30 seconds for it to set but it depends how thick the line you apply to the false lash is. I tend to apply it a little thicker because I live in a humid climate and I wear my lashes all day about 12 hours. I hold the lash with tweezers and apply the glue, then I blow on the glue a little to get it tacky faster. (I wait about 40 seconds but it depends) How long you wait for the glue to become tacky is a bit hard you have to practice. Then apply from the inner corner. make sure you apply a little pressure so the glue can really bond to your eye. Then hold the middle and the end down with a little pressure as well. You may need to practice how thick you apply the glue and how long you wait to apply the lash. The humidity and the temp in your house may make a difference. Just play around with it a little and I&#x27;m sure you will get it. Good luck I hope this helped! Once you get the hang of it you will be hooked it makes such a difference.</li>
            <li> Dries very dark and lasts all night! Will definitely buy again. Just a word of warning, it doesn&#x27;t stick well unless you wait a good 30-40 seconds for it tack up on the eyelash before you try to put it on.</li>
            <li> sticks well on my eyelids! very affordable! will use this in all formal gatherings I&#x27;ll attend in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the best glue ever! Drying black. You don&#x27;t see the glue (if you do it right) lol.</li>
            <li> not very sticky does not work very well buy something else not to impressed with the product its self glue was done after a day</li>
            <li> This is my favorite adhesive because it blends with the lashes and doesn&#x27;t stick to your natural lashes ripping them out.  This is my old standby.</li>
            <li> I love the dark color of this glue, it blend nicely with the color of my lashes. The glue holds a day with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li> I always use it I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands before and after using Duo for the first time I don&#x27;t know why I ever tried other brands! IT IS AMAZING. Easy to apply and stays on perfectly! Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all when I take the lashes off either. It is grey in color but once applied it&#x27;ll disappear.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other lash glue anymore. This stuff is the best I don&#x27;t have any complaints will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product I wish it had a wand applicator but it works great.</li>
            <li> It sticks really well, but can be gloopy if you aren&#x27;t careful.  Once you get it applied it will work for a really long time, and it isn&#x27;t noticeable at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful not to use too much and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Like the glue but I notice that glue is just like weave/hair glue that you can buy at any beauty supplied store for like a $1. So if you want to not pay $4~6 on eyelashes glue, then buy hair glue.</li>
            <li> Got here super fast ! Love it ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> Works well to adhere my false full set of eye lashes. I have not experienced irritation or discomfort. Seems to hold all day so long as I am not in a humid and windy environment. The dark color works well for me since I have dark lashes. I have purchased this from drugstores many times. It was cheaper on Amazon, and got shipped to my door, bonus! It does dry out if you don&#x27;t close the cap tightly or don&#x27;t use it for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;add lashes&amp;#34; beginner! Works Great for me!!! I found black was the best way to go. I put my lashes on with this adhesive and they last all day! They don&#x27;t fall off or hang low, they stay on and strong with only a small strip of adhesive. I apply it directly to the lashes, wait like 30 seconds or until it starts to become sticky then apply them to my face.</li>
            <li> What more is there to say? DUO glue is the best. My fake eyelashes have endured the windiest days to sweaty, brutal, headbanging concerts. Perfectly put every time I get back home. Duo glue is the best for sure. I use either the dark or clear formula, I put liner over the seam anyways and they both work just as well.</li>
