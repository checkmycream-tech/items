            <li>The look was nice, it held most of the day (which it never does with any other product I&#x27;ve used), and best of all it smelled nice.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite things about this product</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I was able to review it for the company.  </li>
            <li>so such an extended period of time and the best part of all</li>
            <li>I love having beachy waves for the Summer time.</li>
            <li>it is OK,</li>
            <li>absolutely love it.</li>

            <li>love this Surf Spray</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is my choice to spray on my hair when i get out of the shower and go</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair wavy, with no brittle-feeling, dryness or crunchiness.</li>
            <li>I love the look of the wind/beach waves for hair.</li>
            <li>I like to use a waver in my hair and to give it a more natural,tussled look</li>
            <li>I love that it contains marine ingredients like sea salt, Marine Sea Kelp and Algae.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic  product!</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>It gives you a sexy beach or bed head look.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for something that will make my hair have more texture.</li>
            <li>Love how the product smells</li>
            <li>but I wish it had a bit more hold/texturizing properties.</li>
            <li>I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li>I love my hair  </li>
            <li>but if you spray your hair with this spray, it will leave your hair looking carefree and stylish throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and most of the time it frizzes up.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ll scrunch my hair so it&#x27;ll help create more texture/curls.</li>
            <li>I think for the price, it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.</li>
            <li>Surf Spray gives your hair the texture and hold of ocean mist without actually making your hair &amp;#34;dirty.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get sexy hair with this stuff.</li>
            <li>but these are okay</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair wavy and reminds me of how my hair gets when I get out of the ocean.  </li>
            <li>so glad I discovered this spray</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this product after reading all the reviews about it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff it makes ur hair so soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>This one is pretty good though.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I also love how easy it is to use because you literally just spray some in your hair,work it in, and let it do</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking a star away because it doesn&#x27;t smell good and the smell is strong at first</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with this spray on my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very impressed with It Haircare and am looking forward to purchasing and trying other products from their line :)</li>
            <li>I liked it from the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, very comparable to those products in the salon and high end beauty stores.</li>
            <li>Fresh marines scent will leave your hair smelling amazing all day</li>
            <li>This great product line leaves hair soft, manageable and touchable, even if your hair is fried.</li>
            <li>It really did a good job of giving my hair texture and the look I had been hoping for.  </li>
            <li>It gives me quick waves and if I spray on more than I get more of a curly look.</li>
            <li>but right off the bat noticed the amazing smell so determined</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use and Surf&#x27;s Up!</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and go too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is not too strong and it doesnt bother me at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products right now!</li>
            <li>I have stick-straight, somewhat fine hair that never has any volume.</li>
            <li>The spray itself does have a nice scent, so that&#x27;s a positive.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is a huge fan of surf</li>
            <li>I received a free product to review.</li>
            <li>My hair just does what it wants to-you can&#x27;t count on it in any kind of weather.  </li>
            <li>have received free products to help facilitate my review</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>This Surf Spray REALLY makes my highlights POP!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better but the pretty blue color makes me happy</li>
            <li>This is great for flat ironing.</li>
            <li>This is a dry spray so no heat is required, which is great for fine hair.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I was excited about purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell but have to use very sparingly or will leave a film feeling in your hair!</li>
            <li>It is perfect for summer time because your hair gets damp and humid a lot so not many hairstyles hold throughout the day</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a pretty good product, particularly as a spray.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>The Styling Spray really didn&#x27;t do too much for me, but it did smell good.  </li>
            <li>For quick beachy waves, my daughter likes to lightly use a curling wand and when she&#x27;s finished, she sprays on the Surf spray and kinds</li>
            <li>Most of them were positive.</li>
            <li>Everyone wants sexy hair, right?!</li>
            <li>It has a fresh light scent.</li>
            <li>I think it would work better on someone with straight hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthier and full of volume now.</li>
            <li>I am always on the hunt for hair products because I have very curly hair and humid weather raises hell with my hair and this spray is the perfect answer when I want to wear it down</li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;ll use it on my ends after I&#x27;ve curled them and give a mild scrunch.</li>
            <li>It works like a gentle, great smelling hairspray, and definitely inspires beachy looks.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a light refreshing scent that will softly linger in your hair without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The picture is very deceiving in showing three bottles, which I thought were a great bargain at the price, however; just a picture of different angles of ONE bottle.  </li>
            <li>the Castor Oil delivers anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties ensuring the long-term health of hair and scalp and last but not least I look beautiful every time I use this product on my hair</li>
            <li>I love that I can now have my natural curly hair down and looking beautiful without any issues.</li>
            <li>- I have super fine super straight hair that never holds a curl or wave.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot from a spray but this actually did amazing!  </li>
            <li>-  you should be more clear!</li>
            <li>It works best if you spray it on your hair when it&#x27;s just starting to partially dry, depending on the texture you want.</li>
            <li>It was quite thicker and more easy to manage in such a humid climate.</li>
            <li>Helps to create waves in my fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t do much for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Surf spray makes my super flat and fine hair much more texturized as well as volatized.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing, and actually works!</li>
            <li>My hair has a more natural look to it.</li>
            <li>Not only does it give my hair a nice texture it volumizes ALL DAY</li>
            <li>I will recommend this to all my friends, it is a treat product to have on hand and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>sexy touchable wave - enhancing, texturing spray to bring out hair&#x27;s natural body and bounce (not</li>
            <li>The convenience isn&#x27;t worth literally throwing money away.</li>
            <li>I had fun trying this product for a review.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and has several natural ingredients too.</li>
            <li>This gives my hair a really nice wave that I can&#x27;t reproduce by simply washing and applying conditioner at home.  </li>
            <li>When you brush your hair, the brush does stick a bit, but I think it’s well worth it.</li>
            <li>, it smells so fresh like the ocean breeze.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair a little more stiffer than I&#x27;d like but other than that its pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>I find that it works best when the hair is dry rather than wet or damp.</li>
            <li>It left my stick straight hair nice any wavy all evening.  </li>
            <li>There were only only three ingredients that I wasn&#x27;t too happy</li>
            <li>I put this product on blow dried straight hair, and it created a great looking wave with lots of volume.</li>
            <li>I have to say I preferred it much more on my second day hair then my freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li>I like Free and Clear because I am very sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li>This spray worked very very well for her hair.</li>
            <li>This product smells good, but it burns my scalp a little bit</li>
            <li>It gave my hair volume and texture and took away that oil that I absolutely dread!  </li>
            <li>I tried the product on damp hair first.</li>
            <li>I had lovely texture and volume that held the entire day.</li>
            <li>bought brand that I never should have strayed from in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Now, I can just go with this spray &amp; let my hair do what it wants!  </li>
            <li>Very deceitful to show THREE bottles &amp; deliver ONE! -  </li>
            <li>I used it the first time</li>
            <li>Overall, i am pleased with this spray and would recommend.</li>
            <li>With this Surf spray It gives me such a light full looking hair style and my curls</li>
            <li>I really love the texture scent and above all the formulation of this hair product.</li>
            <li>Also has Abyssinian Oil that helps smooth the hair shaft for supremely soft bounce and no frizz  waves.</li>
            <li>I once get something like this that smelled of rotten eggs and it costs me a pretty penny too.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I watched the tips and advice and watched women with hair like mine finally become able to style it and have it hold in some form.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily hair and was looking for a product that would kind of &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; my locks so I didn&#x27;t have to wash it every day.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it adds just enough texture to my hair and really defines my waves.</li>
            <li>I put this on while my har was wet and when it dried my hair had perfect beach waves!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Thw seller I was able to review this for next to nothing!!</li>
            <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li>Most of all, I enjoy the extra body the product adds especially when I curl or flatten my hair.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t use it but twice - can&#x27;t give a fair review on how well it works because I couldn&#x27;t get past the scent.</li>
            <li>how full and soft my hair is now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The packaging is very simple and straightforward, the spray dispenses the right amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Absolutely no maintenance needed (and I am a high maintenance kind of girl)</li>
            <li>so my hair pretty much does what it wants.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really give my blonde/half-straight that much wavyness, my hair feels funny when I use it</li>
            <li>It works so much better on curly, dry, and color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a naturally curled, yet barely polished hair</li>
            <li>, I really like another brand but thought that I would try this one since the reviews were so positive</li>
            <li>It Haircare Surf Spray smells so good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard</li>
            <li>It’s hard for me to get my wave looking good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product for such a low price</li>
            <li>it left my hair SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>the picture at a glance to me is simply very deceiving</li>
            <li>wife has wavy hair, and she sprays surf spray as she scrunches her hair and the result looks like salon styled beach hair, in literally 2 minutes she looks like she&#x27;s ready for a fancy date</li>
            <li>Another surf spray that doesn&#x27;t really give you beach hair.</li>
            <li>Even better than Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray, It Surf Spray is infused with Abyssinian Oil and Algae Triage Complex, natural Sea Salt and Marine Sea Kelp to create sexy wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure to shake and spray on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and it has a tropical scent to it!</li>
            <li>so it gives that un-done look that I love without leaving my hair wet and crunchy.</li>
            <li>but this did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>spray.&lt;br /&gt;The surf spray by It Haircare works very well and smells awesome!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The photo of 3 bottles is very deceptive. .</li>
            <li>I can go straight or in a ponytail</li>
            <li>I have gone back to my original and much cheaper store</li>
            <li>and it works better than any other spray I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I make sure my hair is barely damp, flip my hair over and spray,working it through with my fingers only.</li>
            <li>Smells great and a little product goes a long way!</li>
            <li>The results are amazing and long lasting</li>
            <li>I HAVE VERY FINE, LIMP HAIR.  </li>
            <li>I live by this brand!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this spray after researching and reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>It even gave me volume on top of my head where my hair refuses to stick up a little</li>
            <li>I sprayed on a little bit more</li>
            <li>It leaves a matte finish, which is great since sometimes my hair gets a little oily (especially now that it&#x27;s short!)</li>
            <li>For someone who have a very fine and straight hair, beach waves are really hard for me to</li>
            <li>I have used so many mouse and volumizing hair products from the drugstore, but they make my hair heavy and flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe a few times a month for an easy do when I don&#x27;t have much time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It lays flat and that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t make my curls fall flat and gives me the right amount of messy, super-model, I woke up like this, sexy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for something easy and low maintenance that would give my generally flat hair some volume and body without making my hair feel crunchy/</li>
            <li>OK...I really should have known better or at least thought about it......</li>
            <li>This was an impulse buy for me, but I was very surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever had a texturizing spray that actually made my hair look like it does when I come home from the beach.</li>
            <li>My hair is always shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants soft waves that look like you just came back from the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t over use the product I flipy hair upside down after a shower and spray 4-5 times to make sure that all of my hair (back and front) has some product dispersed into it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this wave spray, it&#x27;s been to humid to have bone straight hair and who doesn&#x27;t want the beachy waves minus the hard hold that it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy with fine straight hair and this did Not do anything to make my hair wavy wet or dry!</li>
            <li>I just let my hair air dry and flip it over a few times and that&#x27;s it ready to go out the door, I will be ordering more before I run out of this product, Disclosure:</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair with frizz.</li>
            <li>And as far as the product...</li>
            <li>I like the smell &amp; it leaves my hair soft &amp; not crunchy.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I sprayed it directly on my hand..</li>
            <li>I was also looking at the ingredients and they were natural.</li>
            <li>Oil delivers truly healthy-looking luster and smoothes the hair shaft for supremely soft bounce and no frizz bombshell waves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it just feels soft and looks great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The waves it gives my hair are soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>My daughter was with me and she has naturally curly hair (go figure).</li>
            <li>Beach hair is always so sensual and slightly wild-</li>
            <li>I love that it has ingredients including sea salt, Marine Sea Kelp and Algae Triage Complex</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and silky and I get compliments on</li>
            <li>I use when I wear my hair natural.</li>
            <li>They add a soft texture that nourashies.</li>
            <li>I really did not like the feeling that it left in my.</li>
            <li>I also like to use it as a hairspray substitute (just as a light hold hairspray) to tame the stray/baby.</li>
            <li>I have thick straight hair with lots of strays and this makes my clean hair behave with out feeling stuck or sticky like hair</li>
            <li>The scent is light, not too heavy (in fact I barely noticed it), and the spray itself is also very lightweight and does not make your hair feel like it&#x27;s weighed down too much.</li>
            <li>I also tried to use it on my hair when it was dry, thinking maybe it would work better, but again, it did nothing but make my hair feel limp again.  </li>
            <li>Not crunchy, greasy, or hard but soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different sea salt type of sprays here lately</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 49 yr old woman and as you get older your hair gets dry and course.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>I generally either need a lot of product to get what I&#x27;d like my hair to do or</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure it really does much of anything to my hair.</li>
            <li>The first picture in the image is before wetting my hair, middle is after I wet and sprayed this in</li>
            <li>and/or if you just want a cool hair product to use to primp up your hair from the usual.</li>
            <li>After reading the directions for this I used it on freshly washed and dried hair.</li>
            <li>Fine spray mist with a subtle tropical scent.</li>
            <li>It also did not dry out my hair and it smells womderful👌🏻</li>
            <li>The bottle it comes in is good size and will last at least a few months (unless you&#x27;re using this product religiously and daily).  </li>
            <li>- this bottle was about $5 more expensive, smaller in volume, smelled like dirty feet, and left my hair feeling fine and smooth...</li>
            <li>I have long, naturally wavy hair, and I was looking for a product to enhance my waves and hold them throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>and it would seem I have the full head of thick hair I always wish for.</li>
            <li>I do not like to put any product on my hair really because i do not want to lose my shape of my curls and or weight them down.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is difficult to style.</li>
            <li>I took it down and wet it a little, sprayed this in and wasn&#x27;t sure if it worked or not</li>
            <li>no texture at all, just frizz that wouldn&#x27;t even stay behind my ears because it was so fine.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was able to review it for the company.  </li>

            <li> I love having beachy waves for the Summer time.</li>

            <li> absolutely love it.</li>

            <li> I love this product because it is my choice to spray on my hair when i get out of the shower and go</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair wavy, with no brittle-feeling, dryness or crunchiness.</li>
            <li> I love the look of the wind/beach waves for hair.</li>
            <li> I like to use a waver in my hair and to give it a more natural,tussled look</li>
            <li> I love that it contains marine ingredients like sea salt, Marine Sea Kelp and Algae.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic  product!</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> It gives you a sexy beach or bed head look.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for something that will make my hair have more texture.</li>
            <li> Love how the product smells</li>
            <li> but I wish it had a bit more hold/texturizing properties.</li>
            <li> I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li> I love my hair  </li>
            <li> but if you spray your hair with this spray, it will leave your hair looking carefree and stylish throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and most of the time it frizzes up.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ll scrunch my hair so it&#x27;ll help create more texture/curls.</li>
            <li> I think for the price, it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.</li>
            <li> Surf Spray gives your hair the texture and hold of ocean mist without actually making your hair &amp;#34;dirty.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get sexy hair with this stuff.</li>
            <li> but these are okay</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair wavy and reminds me of how my hair gets when I get out of the ocean.  </li>
            <li> so glad I discovered this spray</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product after reading all the reviews about it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff it makes ur hair so soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This one is pretty good though.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I also love how easy it is to use because you literally just spray some in your hair,work it in, and let it do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking a star away because it doesn&#x27;t smell good and the smell is strong at first</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with this spray on my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very impressed with It Haircare and am looking forward to purchasing and trying other products from their line :)</li>
            <li> I liked it from the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very comparable to those products in the salon and high end beauty stores.</li>
            <li> Fresh marines scent will leave your hair smelling amazing all day</li>
            <li> This great product line leaves hair soft, manageable and touchable, even if your hair is fried.</li>
            <li> It really did a good job of giving my hair texture and the look I had been hoping for.  </li>
            <li> It gives me quick waves and if I spray on more than I get more of a curly look.</li>
            <li> but right off the bat noticed the amazing smell so determined</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use and Surf&#x27;s Up!</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and go too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is not too strong and it doesnt bother me at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products right now!</li>
            <li> I have stick-straight, somewhat fine hair that never has any volume.</li>
            <li> The spray itself does have a nice scent, so that&#x27;s a positive.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is a huge fan of surf</li>
            <li> I received a free product to review.</li>
            <li> My hair just does what it wants to-you can&#x27;t count on it in any kind of weather.  </li>
            <li> have received free products to help facilitate my review</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> This Surf Spray REALLY makes my highlights POP!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better but the pretty blue color makes me happy</li>
            <li> This is great for flat ironing.</li>
            <li> This is a dry spray so no heat is required, which is great for fine hair.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was excited about purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but have to use very sparingly or will leave a film feeling in your hair!</li>
            <li> It is perfect for summer time because your hair gets damp and humid a lot so not many hairstyles hold throughout the day</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a pretty good product, particularly as a spray.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> The Styling Spray really didn&#x27;t do too much for me, but it did smell good.  </li>
            <li> For quick beachy waves, my daughter likes to lightly use a curling wand and when she&#x27;s finished, she sprays on the Surf spray and kinds</li>
            <li> Most of them were positive.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants sexy hair, right?!</li>
            <li> It has a fresh light scent.</li>
            <li> I think it would work better on someone with straight hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthier and full of volume now.</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for hair products because I have very curly hair and humid weather raises hell with my hair and this spray is the perfect answer when I want to wear it down</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;ll use it on my ends after I&#x27;ve curled them and give a mild scrunch.</li>
            <li> It works like a gentle, great smelling hairspray, and definitely inspires beachy looks.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a light refreshing scent that will softly linger in your hair without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The picture is very deceiving in showing three bottles, which I thought were a great bargain at the price, however; just a picture of different angles of ONE bottle.  </li>
            <li> the Castor Oil delivers anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties ensuring the long-term health of hair and scalp and last but not least I look beautiful every time I use this product on my hair</li>
            <li> I love that I can now have my natural curly hair down and looking beautiful without any issues.</li>
            <li> - I have super fine super straight hair that never holds a curl or wave.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot from a spray but this actually did amazing!  </li>
            <li> -  you should be more clear!</li>
            <li> It works best if you spray it on your hair when it&#x27;s just starting to partially dry, depending on the texture you want.</li>
            <li> It was quite thicker and more easy to manage in such a humid climate.</li>
            <li> Helps to create waves in my fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do much for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Surf spray makes my super flat and fine hair much more texturized as well as volatized.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, and actually works!</li>
            <li> My hair has a more natural look to it.</li>
            <li> Not only does it give my hair a nice texture it volumizes ALL DAY</li>
            <li> I will recommend this to all my friends, it is a treat product to have on hand and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> sexy touchable wave - enhancing, texturing spray to bring out hair&#x27;s natural body and bounce (not</li>
            <li> The convenience isn&#x27;t worth literally throwing money away.</li>
            <li> I had fun trying this product for a review.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and has several natural ingredients too.</li>
            <li> This gives my hair a really nice wave that I can&#x27;t reproduce by simply washing and applying conditioner at home.  </li>
            <li> When you brush your hair, the brush does stick a bit, but I think it’s well worth it.</li>
            <li> , it smells so fresh like the ocean breeze.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a little more stiffer than I&#x27;d like but other than that its pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I find that it works best when the hair is dry rather than wet or damp.</li>
            <li> It left my stick straight hair nice any wavy all evening.  </li>
            <li> There were only only three ingredients that I wasn&#x27;t too happy</li>
            <li> I put this product on blow dried straight hair, and it created a great looking wave with lots of volume.</li>
            <li> I have to say I preferred it much more on my second day hair then my freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li> I like Free and Clear because I am very sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li> This spray worked very very well for her hair.</li>
            <li> This product smells good, but it burns my scalp a little bit</li>
            <li> It gave my hair volume and texture and took away that oil that I absolutely dread!  </li>
            <li> I tried the product on damp hair first.</li>
            <li> I had lovely texture and volume that held the entire day.</li>
            <li> bought brand that I never should have strayed from in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Now, I can just go with this spray &amp; let my hair do what it wants!  </li>
            <li> Very deceitful to show THREE bottles &amp; deliver ONE! -  </li>
            <li> I used it the first time</li>
            <li> Overall, i am pleased with this spray and would recommend.</li>
            <li> With this Surf spray It gives me such a light full looking hair style and my curls</li>
            <li> I really love the texture scent and above all the formulation of this hair product.</li>
            <li> Also has Abyssinian Oil that helps smooth the hair shaft for supremely soft bounce and no frizz  waves.</li>
            <li> I once get something like this that smelled of rotten eggs and it costs me a pretty penny too.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I watched the tips and advice and watched women with hair like mine finally become able to style it and have it hold in some form.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily hair and was looking for a product that would kind of &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; my locks so I didn&#x27;t have to wash it every day.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it adds just enough texture to my hair and really defines my waves.</li>
            <li> I put this on while my har was wet and when it dried my hair had perfect beach waves!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Thw seller I was able to review this for next to nothing!!</li>
            <li> No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li> and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> Most of all, I enjoy the extra body the product adds especially when I curl or flatten my hair.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t use it but twice - can&#x27;t give a fair review on how well it works because I couldn&#x27;t get past the scent.</li>
            <li> how full and soft my hair is now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The packaging is very simple and straightforward, the spray dispenses the right amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Absolutely no maintenance needed (and I am a high maintenance kind of girl)</li>
            <li> so my hair pretty much does what it wants.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really give my blonde/half-straight that much wavyness, my hair feels funny when I use it</li>
            <li> It works so much better on curly, dry, and color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a naturally curled, yet barely polished hair</li>
            <li> , I really like another brand but thought that I would try this one since the reviews were so positive</li>
            <li> It Haircare Surf Spray smells so good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard</li>
            <li> It’s hard for me to get my wave looking good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product for such a low price</li>
            <li> it left my hair SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> the picture at a glance to me is simply very deceiving</li>
            <li> wife has wavy hair, and she sprays surf spray as she scrunches her hair and the result looks like salon styled beach hair, in literally 2 minutes she looks like she&#x27;s ready for a fancy date</li>
            <li> Another surf spray that doesn&#x27;t really give you beach hair.</li>
            <li> Even better than Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray, It Surf Spray is infused with Abyssinian Oil and Algae Triage Complex, natural Sea Salt and Marine Sea Kelp to create sexy wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Make sure to shake and spray on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and it has a tropical scent to it!</li>
            <li> so it gives that un-done look that I love without leaving my hair wet and crunchy.</li>
            <li> but this did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> spray.&lt;br /&gt;The surf spray by It Haircare works very well and smells awesome!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The photo of 3 bottles is very deceptive. .</li>
            <li> I can go straight or in a ponytail</li>
            <li> I have gone back to my original and much cheaper store</li>
            <li> and it works better than any other spray I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I make sure my hair is barely damp, flip my hair over and spray,working it through with my fingers only.</li>
            <li> Smells great and a little product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The results are amazing and long lasting</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY FINE, LIMP HAIR.  </li>
            <li> I live by this brand!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this spray after researching and reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!  </li>
            <li> It even gave me volume on top of my head where my hair refuses to stick up a little</li>
            <li> I sprayed on a little bit more</li>
            <li> It leaves a matte finish, which is great since sometimes my hair gets a little oily (especially now that it&#x27;s short!)</li>
            <li> For someone who have a very fine and straight hair, beach waves are really hard for me to</li>
            <li> I have used so many mouse and volumizing hair products from the drugstore, but they make my hair heavy and flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe a few times a month for an easy do when I don&#x27;t have much time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It lays flat and that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t make my curls fall flat and gives me the right amount of messy, super-model, I woke up like this, sexy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for something easy and low maintenance that would give my generally flat hair some volume and body without making my hair feel crunchy/</li>
            <li> OK...I really should have known better or at least thought about it......</li>
            <li> This was an impulse buy for me, but I was very surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever had a texturizing spray that actually made my hair look like it does when I come home from the beach.</li>
            <li> My hair is always shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants soft waves that look like you just came back from the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t over use the product I flipy hair upside down after a shower and spray 4-5 times to make sure that all of my hair (back and front) has some product dispersed into it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this wave spray, it&#x27;s been to humid to have bone straight hair and who doesn&#x27;t want the beachy waves minus the hard hold that it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with fine straight hair and this did Not do anything to make my hair wavy wet or dry!</li>
            <li> I just let my hair air dry and flip it over a few times and that&#x27;s it ready to go out the door, I will be ordering more before I run out of this product, Disclosure:</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair with frizz.</li>
            <li> And as far as the product...</li>
            <li> I like the smell &amp; it leaves my hair soft &amp; not crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I sprayed it directly on my hand..</li>
            <li> I was also looking at the ingredients and they were natural.</li>
            <li> Oil delivers truly healthy-looking luster and smoothes the hair shaft for supremely soft bounce and no frizz bombshell waves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it just feels soft and looks great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The waves it gives my hair are soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li> My daughter was with me and she has naturally curly hair (go figure).</li>
            <li> Beach hair is always so sensual and slightly wild-</li>
            <li> I love that it has ingredients including sea salt, Marine Sea Kelp and Algae Triage Complex</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and silky and I get compliments on</li>
            <li> I use when I wear my hair natural.</li>
            <li> They add a soft texture that nourashies.</li>
            <li> I really did not like the feeling that it left in my.</li>
            <li> I also like to use it as a hairspray substitute (just as a light hold hairspray) to tame the stray/baby.</li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair with lots of strays and this makes my clean hair behave with out feeling stuck or sticky like hair</li>
            <li> The scent is light, not too heavy (in fact I barely noticed it), and the spray itself is also very lightweight and does not make your hair feel like it&#x27;s weighed down too much.</li>
            <li> I also tried to use it on my hair when it was dry, thinking maybe it would work better, but again, it did nothing but make my hair feel limp again.  </li>
            <li> Not crunchy, greasy, or hard but soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different sea salt type of sprays here lately</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 49 yr old woman and as you get older your hair gets dry and course.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> I generally either need a lot of product to get what I&#x27;d like my hair to do or</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure it really does much of anything to my hair.</li>
            <li> The first picture in the image is before wetting my hair, middle is after I wet and sprayed this in</li>
            <li> and/or if you just want a cool hair product to use to primp up your hair from the usual.</li>
            <li> After reading the directions for this I used it on freshly washed and dried hair.</li>
            <li> Fine spray mist with a subtle tropical scent.</li>
            <li> It also did not dry out my hair and it smells womderful👌🏻</li>
            <li> The bottle it comes in is good size and will last at least a few months (unless you&#x27;re using this product religiously and daily).  </li>
            <li> - this bottle was about $5 more expensive, smaller in volume, smelled like dirty feet, and left my hair feeling fine and smooth...</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally wavy hair, and I was looking for a product to enhance my waves and hold them throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> and it would seem I have the full head of thick hair I always wish for.</li>
            <li> I do not like to put any product on my hair really because i do not want to lose my shape of my curls and or weight them down.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is difficult to style.</li>
            <li> I took it down and wet it a little, sprayed this in and wasn&#x27;t sure if it worked or not</li>
            <li> no texture at all, just frizz that wouldn&#x27;t even stay behind my ears because it was so fine.</li>
            <li> Love it for casual days and only takes about 30 seconds to do my hair!</li>
            <li> I sprayed and scrunched it through my towel dry hair and let it dry naturally the rest of the way.</li>
            <li> I use the spray directly onto wet hair and proceed to drying!</li>
            <li> can cause dermatitis, brief exposure to MIT is toxic in low concentrations during neural development, increasing the risk of seizures and visual abnormalities.</li>
            <li> Overall, definitely a must have for those with fine, dull, limp hair</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy, thick, smooth hair</li>
            <li> I found that while this does texturize, it still leaves my hair touchably soft, you don&#x27;t have that hard crunchiness that many hair gels can leave behind.</li>
            <li> I bought Surf Spray on a whim in hopes it would add some texture and volume to my flat hair.</li>
            <li> it flat out</li>
            <li> Works in both short and long hair.</li>
            <li> The next time I tried the product on dry hair and used my hands again to work through.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh my hair down much either.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that makes your hair feel soft and limp, this product will indeed help you achieve that.</li>
            <li> I have never been so glad to be wrong!</li>
            <li> You can use it on dry hair too</li>
            <li> I just received it &amp; had to try it immediately on my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I have semi wavy hair if I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and sprayed surf spray on my hair and let it naturally dry and fluffed it with my fingers and within 2 wks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dry spray</li>
            <li> Spray in dry hair&lt;</li>
            <li> Wait until dry</li>
            <li> ( If don’t have time to air dry, blow dry with hair drier and</li>
            <li> can use it with damp hair or on dry hair, depending on how you decide to style it.</li>
            <li> I put this on dry and scrunch it</li>
            <li> I tried fewer sprays the next few times I used it, however I could just feel it drying out my hair with the same crunchy results.</li>
            <li> Surf Spray is like a hair spray for people who want the fluff and volume of the good ole&#x27; aerosol cans but hate the crunchy sticky feel.</li>
            <li> So I have very straight, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was&#x27;nt using conditioner in my hair which left it heavy and flat.</li>
            <li> so I usually don&#x27;t get to actually wear my hair down with my natural curly hair</li>
            <li> I like that it is a dry spray rather than a wet one</li>
            <li> have long, thick, naturally wavy/curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> and the last is about an hour later, after it fully dried!</li>
            <li> I spray on wet hair and work it in, then blow dry.</li>
            <li> or i can spray on my wet hair and then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it can be used on both wet or dry</li>
            <li> I was pretty amazed that it&#x27;d hold up my thick and heavy hair</li>
            <li> I like that you can use this on wet or dry hair!</li>
            <li> scrunches her hair up in her hands and boom, loose, wavy, hair!</li>
            <li> However, when I applied it to my damp hair and let it naturally dry, my hair felt limp and flat all day.  </li>
            <li> This surf spray tries to help you rekindle that ocean-side romance.</li>
            <li> When I got this product the bottle was empty.....</li>
            <li> Brushing out your hair after applying it will loosen the waves and the rough texture of the hair.</li>
            <li> Try applying it on wet hair to see a grunge like/ wet affect as well.</li>
            <li> As soon as it starts getting close to being empty</li>
            <li> all I have to do is wet it again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While not a huge drastic difference, there is definitely a bit of beachy -wave</li>
            <li> spray this with a slightly dampened hair before I start to blow dry it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does make your hair a little gritty, as previous reviews say.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products similar to this in the past that leave my hair sticky but this spray does not.</li>
            <li> decided to use it the other night after I washed my hair.</li>
            <li> If so, then use less or put it in when your hair is still really wet.</li>
            <li> I put it on and it takes a few hours, but it really adds waves to my thin hair.</li>
            <li> The hair feels silkier afterwards, less dry and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> took the label off and attached it to a dark background, so you could read the label, after I scanned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> WHILE IT IS STILL SLIGHTLY DAMP AND THEN STYLE IT.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something like this, and would have settled for less, but I got no wave at all.  </li>
            <li> I spritz a bit in my hair when it&#x27;s still wet and style as usual.</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair</li>
            <li> It is not sticky or heavy and does not weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> It seemed to leave just a little bit of build up on my hair, though.  </li>
            <li> I just spray it on my damp hair and tousle a little bit.</li>
            <li> expecting 3 bottles since the other photos showed the description, and the bottle size is quite small.</li>
            <li> It felt a little to oily for my liking.</li>
            <li> However, after opening the box it was shipped in I found that the product was missing the cap and spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> The missing parts were not found in the box.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to pump too much to waste your product.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> but my curls just turn into a ball of frizz when dried</li>
            <li> and you just need that messy, tousled hair with a bit of waves in it.</li>
            <li> Weird considering I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> no more limp locks.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and long and hard to keep curls in it.</li>
            <li> dried unless I put in gel and hairspray which then just leaves my hair sticky and hard.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair like other sprays or make my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> However, it did help tame my hair a bit!</li>
            <li> This Surf Spray however doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or hard but it does keep my hair from frizzing up</li>
            <li> It holds my hair in place but it is not sticky or hard to comb out.</li>
            <li> It is infused with Abyssinian oil and Algae triage complex.</li>
            <li> combination of marine- based performance ingredients including sea salt, Marine Sea Kelp and Algae Triage Complex enhances the body and structure of hair while nourishes, conditioning, strengthening and protecting hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She is a fanatic about her hair; refuses to use any product with sulfates.</li>
            <li> bottle arrived encased in a plastic bag, and unfortunately the bottle was wet all over so somehow some must have sprayed out in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and calics on my bang area</li>
            <li> I no longer had limp, lifeless hair!!</li>
            <li> and I was expecting it to fail like all the other spray in products.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday but was very anxious to use it.  </li>
            <li> and so very hard to replicate at home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really, really frustrating and makes me not want to purchase from here again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had awful luck in the past with hair products, my hair is very thick, heavy and has a very very slight kink.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I am unable to use it and have to return it.</li>
            <li> I got a beach spray sample in my birch box but that brand was wat to expensive, did a search and found this one and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it leaves my hair crunchy and feeling dirty</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong buying thi spray!</li>
            <li> /&gt;that are have bad.</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed as I feel it did nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li> My mistake, but Disappointed in the advertising presentation.  </li>
            <li> Some people hate that sticky matte feeling in their hair.</li>
            <li> Plus I hate the smell of it</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the results!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The packaging was AWFUL though.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m awful at doing anything with my hair.</li>
            <li> Packaging was terrible.</li>
            <li> I hated it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a winner. Fine spray mist with a subtle tropical scent. It is not sticky or heavy and does not weigh the hair down. This great product line leaves hair soft, manageable and touchable, even if your hair is fried.</li>
            <li> It added volume to my hair, has a great scent and some texture. I spritz a bit in my hair when it&#x27;s still wet and style as usual. The product has gel in it which helps hold style. Then I&#x27;ll use it on my ends after I&#x27;ve curled them and give a mild scrunch. It works like a gentle, great smelling hairspray, and definitely inspires beachy looks.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the scent at all so I didn&#x27;t use it but twice - can&#x27;t give a fair review on how well it works because I couldn&#x27;t get past the scent. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  I have extremely oily hair and was looking for a product that would kind of &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; my locks so I didn&#x27;t have to wash it every day.  This did the trick.  It gave my hair volume and texture and took away that oil that I absolutely dread!  I only wish it was in a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was excited about purchasing this product. However, after opening the box it was shipped in I found that the product was missing the cap and spray nozzle. I am unable to use it and have to return it. The missing parts were not found in the box. I can&#x27;t believe someone didn&#x27;t notice this before shipping it.</li>
            <li> My hair has a more natural look to it.</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy, thick, smooth hair and this gives it a great salty matte texture and brings out the wave. It works best if you spray it on your hair when it&#x27;s just starting to partially dry, depending on the texture you want. Some people hate that sticky matte feeling in their hair. If so, then use less or put it in when your hair is still really wet. You can use it on dry hair too but that&#x27;s a bit too sticky for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks! I wash my hair, spray this in, and my hair look gorgeous! Absolutely no maintenance needed (and I am a high maintenance kind of girl)</li>
            <li> I love this product because it adds just enough texture to my hair and really defines my waves. I like the scent and the ease of the spray bottle.</li>
            <li> This product smells great. It&#x27;s one of my favorite things about this product and I find myself going back for a spritz midday just so I can smell like it.</li>
            <li> Surf spray makes my super flat and fine hair much more texturized as well as volatized. I spray a generous amount at the roots and a bit under my hair and it would seem I have the full head of thick hair I always wish for. The product has great staying power as well. Works great!</li>
            <li> It’s great and I’m buying it again.</li>
            <li> I’m having a blast! All I do is spray it unto my hair and everything is done!</li>
            <li> This has replaced my salt spray as a daily texturizer. I like that it is a dry spray rather than a wet one, it doesn&#x27;t make my curls fall flat and gives me the right amount of messy, super-model, I woke up like this, sexy hair.</li>
            <li> This product smells good, but it burns my scalp a little bit and I&#x27;m not sure it really does much of anything to my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product way better than the stuff at Department stores I will get this every month</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, and actually works! I put it on and it takes a few hours, but it really adds waves to my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I was able to review it for the company.  I used it last night and got lots of compliments on my hair.  It left my stick straight hair nice any wavy all evening.  It also did not dry out my hair and it smells womderful👌🏻</li>
            <li> Definitely did what it said. My hair is curly but gets frizzy, this kept the curls in without over drying. And I actually like the smell.</li>
            <li> Great texture, good product ;)</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday but was very anxious to use it.  I have tried so many different sea salt type of sprays here lately...seems they&#x27;ve been all the rage in my subscription boxes.  A lot of them have just been &amp;#34;o.k.&amp;#34; in my opinion.  This one is pretty good though.  It really did a good job of giving my hair texture and the look I had been hoping for.  It smells really good too.  It seemed to leave just a little bit of build up on my hair, though.  That is not something I have noticed before.  However, the way it made my hair look and the great smell kind of makes up for that.  Sample provided for testing, evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair. Not even the 80&#x27;s spiral perm added any waves or curl to it. I bought Surf Spray on a whim in hopes it would add some texture and volume to my flat hair. I tried the product on damp hair first. Just sprayed it all over and used my hands to work it through my hair. I was shocked at the results! I had lovely texture and volume that held the entire day. The next time I tried the product on dry hair and used my hands again to work through. I no longer had limp, lifeless hair!! This product is now my go to hair product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had awful luck in the past with hair products, my hair is very thick, heavy and has a very very slight kink. I generally either need a lot of product to get what I&#x27;d like my hair to do or it flat out just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair. Being a stay at home mom I&#x27;d been looking for something easy and low maintenance that would give my generally flat hair some volume and body without making my hair feel crunchy/greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw Surf Spray by It, I decided to give it a shot and I was expecting it to fail like all the other spray in products. I have never been so glad to be wrong! Not only does it give my hair a nice texture it volumizes ALL DAY (will last for 2-3 days without a shower though it&#x27;ll straighten out a bit). I was pretty amazed that it&#x27;d hold up my thick and heavy hair so such an extended period of time and the best part of all it left my hair SMOOTH. Not crunchy, greasy, or hard but soft and smooth; like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any product at all. I didn&#x27;t over use the product I flipy hair upside down after a shower and spray 4-5 times to make sure that all of my hair (back and front) has some product dispersed into it. Also it smells wonderful, it&#x27;s a light refreshing scent that will softly linger in your hair without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very impressed with It Haircare and am looking forward to purchasing and trying other products from their line :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, this does not effect the integrity of my review and I stand by my opinions of this product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product after reading all the reviews about it.  However, I was disappointed as I feel it did nothing for my hair.  I have long, naturally wavy hair, and I was looking for a product to enhance my waves and hold them throughout the day.  The spray itself does have a nice scent, so that&#x27;s a positive.  However, when I applied it to my damp hair and let it naturally dry, my hair felt limp and flat all day.  I honestly felt as if nothing had been sprayed into my hair.  I also tried to use it on my hair when it was dry, thinking maybe it would work better, but again, it did nothing but make my hair feel limp again.  I have gone back to my original and much cheaper store bought brand that I never should have strayed from in the first place.  If you are looking for a product that makes your hair feel soft and limp, this product will indeed help you achieve that. However, if you are looking for product that helps holds your waves and enhance them, do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I love having beachy waves for the Summer time. This works great with my combination hair. I have naturally wavy hair with frizz. This helps keep my frizz at bay but encourages beachy waves! **I received a free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> OK...I really should have known better or at least thought about it......The picture is very deceiving in showing three bottles, which I thought were a great bargain at the price, however; just a picture of different angles of ONE bottle.  And as far as the product...it is OK, semi works as claimed, but will not repurchase.  I don&#x27;t know...the picture at a glance to me is simply very deceiving and I don&#x27;t thik I was the only one who thought 3 bottles.  So</li>
            <li> This Surf Spray REALLY makes my highlights POP!!!  I just received it &amp; had to try it immediately on my dry hair.  WOW!!  I look like I&#x27;ve been at the beach all day.  My highlights are so defined &amp; I got the highlights over a month ago.  My hair just does what it wants to-you can&#x27;t count on it in any kind of weather.  Now, I can just go with this spray &amp; let my hair do what it wants!  It even gave me volume on top of my head where my hair refuses to stick up a little so I don&#x27;t look like a flathead. I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  I like the smell &amp; it leaves my hair soft &amp; not crunchy. Love It!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this wave spray, it&#x27;s been to humid to have bone straight hair and who doesn&#x27;t want the beachy waves minus the hard hold that it. This Is why I am so happy to review this product. This It Haircare Surf Spray smells so good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard, it gives it texture and volume and the waves too. It is infused with Abyssinian oil and Algae triage complex. I will recommend this to all my friends, it is a treat product to have on hand and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I received this spray fro review. I love what this did to my hair! I have naturally curly hair but sometimes my hair just looks frizzy and not curly. I put this on while my har was wet and when it dried my hair had perfect beach waves! absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Very deceitful to show THREE bottles &amp; deliver ONE! -  Frauduent advertising -  you should be more clear!</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and great! The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering (scent wears off throughout the day anyways). Most of all, I enjoy the extra body the product adds especially when I curl or flatten my hair. I also like to use it as a hairspray substitute (just as a light hold hairspray) to tame the stray/baby. hairs.  The bottle it comes in is good size and will last at least a few months (unless you&#x27;re using this product religiously and daily).  The nice pump gives a good pump/spritz of product so you don&#x27;t need to pump too much to waste your product.  Overall, definitely a must have for those with fine, dull, limp hair and/or if you just want a cool hair product to use to primp up your hair from the usual.</li>
            <li> love it!!! Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair with lots of strays and this makes my clean hair behave with out feeling stuck or sticky like hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has wavy hair, and she sprays surf spray as she scrunches her hair and the result looks like salon styled beach hair, in literally 2 minutes she looks like she&#x27;s ready for a fancy date night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it SMELLS AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a promotional discount on this product, however, my reviews are always honest and unbiased regardless of price I paid.</li>
            <li> Great for all hair types!  This not sticky in anyway!  I sprayed it directly on my hand.. Not sticky! It has a fresh light scent. I make sure my hair is barely damp, flip my hair over and spray,working it through with my fingers only. Spray top using a scrunching technique. I let it air dry.  Gives volume and brings my curls back to life!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews. Most of them were positive. I was also looking at the ingredients and they were natural. My hair is short, below my ears. I used it the first time and it did not hold. I sprayed on a little bit more but..... I would recommend it for the great ingredients but otherwise, no hold for me</li>
            <li> Another surf spray that doesn&#x27;t really give you beach hair.</li>
            <li> Surf Spray Sold by Key Brands Inc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surfs up! Noting speaks summer like beachy waves; It Hair Care is now equipped to deliver effortless wind-swept locks without a trip to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;Get sexy touchable wave - enhancing, texturing spray to bring out hair&#x27;s natural body and bounce (not crunchy).&lt;br /&gt;A combination of marine- based performance ingredients including sea salt, Marine Sea Kelp and Algae Triage Complex enhances the body and structure of hair while nourishes, conditioning, strengthening and protecting hair.&lt;br /&gt;Abyssinian Oil delivers truly healthy-looking luster and smoothes the hair shaft for supremely soft bounce and no frizz bombshell waves.&lt;br /&gt;Castor Oil delivers anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties ensuring the long-term health of hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wavy Hair is the answer with Surf Spray.

This salon quality formula delivers texture, windblown volume and tons of waves. Fresh marines scent will leave your hair smelling amazing all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I love this Surf Spray I have tried other products similar to this in the past that leave my hair sticky but this spray does not. My hair looks amazing using this I just let my hair air dry and flip it over a few times and that&#x27;s it ready to go out the door, I will be ordering more before I run out of this product, Disclosure: Product was provided for review, thank you</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  I HAVE VERY FINE, LIMP HAIR.  I SPRAY THIS ON MY HAIR WHILE IT IS STILL SLIGHTLY DAMP AND THEN STYLE IT.  I LOVE IT!!  IT ACTUALLY GIVES MY HAIR BODY.  I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NOT HEARD ABOUT THIS BEFORE NOW.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great. It gives me the perfect beach waves every time and for that I will give it 4 stars. I&#x27;m taking a star away because it doesn&#x27;t smell good and the smell is strong at first but thankfully it doesn&#x27;t linger. The packaging was AWFUL though. Mine did not come with a lid and a quarter of the product was gone by the time it had arrived. This is the second hair care item I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon where it had leaked out all over the place. It&#x27;s really, really frustrating and makes me not want to purchase from here again. The convenience isn&#x27;t worth literally throwing money away.</li>
            <li> This is via Alex&#x27;s wife. This is the first time I have ever had a texturizing spray that actually made my hair look like it does when I come home from the beach. 100% worth the money, very very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> I got this at a discount in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick, naturally wavy/curly, frizzy hair. I wore my hair in a bun after washing it yesterday for work. I took it down and wet it a little, sprayed this in and wasn&#x27;t sure if it worked or not but right off the bat noticed the amazing smell so determined even if it didn&#x27;t work I&#x27;d use it for the smell alone. However, it did help tame my hair a bit! I think it would work better on someone with straight hair. I&#x27;m thinking about trying it again after I straighten my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m including a photo. The first picture in the image is before wetting my hair, middle is after I wet and sprayed this in and the last is about an hour later, after it fully dried!</li>
            <li> Nice spray! Smells nice and works well with my hair. Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me but I&#x27;m awful at doing anything with my hair. Plus I hate the smell of it</li>
            <li> I spray on wet hair and work it in, then blow dry. The hair feels silkier afterwards, less dry and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Make sure to shake and spray on wet hair.  I love this product because it is my choice to spray on my hair when i get out of the shower and go or i can spray on my wet hair and then blow dry.  This is really a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I recently got my hair cut into a pixie and was looking for something to style it with. This product is so easy to use-I just spray it on my damp hair and tousle a little bit. That&#x27;s it! It leaves a matte finish, which is great since sometimes my hair gets a little oily (especially now that it&#x27;s short!) Sometimes, it even looks ok after I’ve slept on it! It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crispy or sticky. Actually, after my hair dries, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I have surf spray in it- it just feels soft and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it smells nice too! (But not perfume-y at all, so guys could totally use it!)</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products right now! I love the way it makes my hair wavy, with no brittle-feeling, dryness or crunchiness. It&#x27;s so easy to use and go too. I just spray two spritzes on my damp hair, scrunch, and then go. It&#x27;s perfect for summer! It smells nice and leaves my hair looking and feeling great. The waves it gives my hair are soft and natural looking. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants soft waves that look like you just came back from the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received either at no or low cost for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> I was asked to review this product. I ordered this product and it came in just in time for us because we were headed to a business conference at the beach! What a great location to try this product. So I have very straight, thin hair. I love the look of the wind/beach waves for hair. So on my &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; day, I tried this product. I wasn&#x27;t able to &amp;#34;diffuse&amp;#34; with the blow dryer because I failed to bring it with me. So my hair ended up looking kind of stringy. It was quite thicker and more easy to manage in such a humid climate. My daughter was with me and she has naturally curly hair (go figure). This spray worked very very well for her hair. She basically took it away from me so I am having to purchase another bottle. She is a fanatic about her hair; refuses to use any product with sulfates. You successfully get her approval, your product is write on pointe! This was a definite winner! A+</li>
            <li> I had fun trying this product for a review.  I have curly hair and this product took away the frizz and gave my hair that at the beach look.</li>
            <li> I like to use a waver in my hair and to give it a more natural,tussled look I use this spray with it. It smells great and has several natural ingredients too. A little bit goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh my hair down much either. Overall, i am pleased with this spray and would recommend. I have attached photos with this review.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Thw seller I was able to review this for next to nothing!! I love the smell but have to use very sparingly or will leave a film feeling in your hair!</li>
            <li> Beach hair is always so sensual and slightly wild- and so very hard to replicate at home. This surf spray tries to help you rekindle that ocean-side romance. I love that it contains marine ingredients like sea salt, Marine Sea Kelp and Algae. These help build texture and body into your lock. It also includes Abyssinian Oil for shine and smoothing, so you don&#x27;t get that raggedy, TOO windblown look! I found that while this does texturize, it still leaves my hair touchably soft, you don&#x27;t have that hard crunchiness that many hair gels can leave behind. I also like that it can be used on both wet or dry hair- so you can revive your look in the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with this spray on my fine, curly hair. It helps give some definition and oomph.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair like other sprays or make my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I do not like to put any product on my hair really because i do not want to lose my shape of my curls and or weight them down. With this Surf spray It gives me such a light full looking hair style and my curls look just fab. I really love the texture scent and above all the formulation of this hair product. I love that it has ingredients including sea salt, Marine Sea Kelp and Algae Triage Complex enhances the body and structure of hair while nourishes, conditioning, strengthening and protecting hair. Also has Abyssinian Oil that helps smooth the hair shaft for supremely soft bounce and no frizz  waves. the Castor Oil delivers anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties ensuring the long-term health of hair and scalp and last but not least I look beautiful every time I use this product on my hair and I feel very satisfied as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product discounted for testing and review purposes, however my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair but my curls just turn into a ball of frizz when dried so I usually don&#x27;t get to actually wear my hair down with my natural curly hair dried unless I put in gel and hairspray which then just leaves my hair sticky and hard. This Surf Spray however doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or hard but it does keep my hair from frizzing up which is why I absolutely love this product! I like that you can use this on wet or dry hair! I also love how easy it is to use because you literally just spray some in your hair,work it in, and let it do it&#x27;s job! I didn&#x27;t notice any smell which a scent wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me either way. I love that I can now have my natural curly hair down and looking beautiful without any issues. I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> The Styling Spray really didn&#x27;t do too much for me, but it did smell good.  After reading what the ingredients were, I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with this product.  There were only only three ingredients that I wasn&#x27;t too happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate-20 can cause sensitivity and skin irritation, plus Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) can cause dermatitis, brief exposure to MIT is toxic in low concentrations during neural development, increasing the risk of seizures and visual abnormalities. Researchers have stated that the long-term neurological impacts of environmental exposure to MIT has not been determined.  I found this on the Ann Marie Gianni website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spray also has Blue 1/CI 42090, which is a certified water soluble cosmetic color.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;d rather not have any dyes in my products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Water, Sea Salt, Polysorbate-20, Fragrance/Parfum, Silicone Quaterni-Um-3, Trideceth-12, Glycerin, Pantenol, Citric Acid, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract, Crambe Abyssinica Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ricinus COmmunis (Castor) Bean Oil, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1/ CI 42090.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the label off and attached it to a dark background, so you could read the label, after I scanned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discounted price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and I love what it does to my curly hair! It makes it beautiful and shiny! Can&#x27;t go wrong buying thi spray! I got discounted for review</li>
            <li> Packaging was terrible. There was no cap like in picture and no plastic shrink wrap. Looked used. Smell isn&#x27;t great but works ok</li>
            <li> It smells good, but it didn&#x27;t give me any waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get out of the pool/water, I rinse the chlorine or salt water from my hair and apply a bit of conditioner to help protect it until I can get home to wash it thoroughly.  This gives my hair a really nice wave that I can&#x27;t reproduce by simply washing and applying conditioner at home.  (Maybe it&#x27;s the chemicals or the salt water.)  I was expecting something like this, and would have settled for less, but I got no wave at all.  My hair just feels stiffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside is that I decided to try it as a holding spray with a curling iron, and I like the way it works in that capacity.  Curls last longer and it isn&#x27;t sticky or crunchy.  I think using it with heat makes a difference.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I received  this product  in exchange  for a review. This is a fantastic  product! My hair looks so great and it doesn&#x27;t leave it oily.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair waves and smells really good!</li>
            <li> Nice scent. I enjoy this product. Helps to create waves in my fine straight hair. Love the color. Happy customer and will recommend.</li>
            <li> I have just started using the Surf Spray.  This is my second day but I will buy this again just for the pleasure of the fragrance.  Really a nice smell people.</li>
            <li> I once get something like this that smelled of rotten eggs and it costs me a pretty penny too. I hated it! This one though, this one I like!</li>
            <li> This was an impulse buy for me, but I was very surprised with the results. I have semi wavy hair if I let it air dry. I put this product on blow dried straight hair, and it created a great looking wave with lots of volume. It gives you a sexy beach or bed head look. It’s hard for me to get my wave looking good. I have tried gels, air drying it, mouse, you&lt;br /&gt;name it. This by far looks the best. It does make your hair a little gritty, as previous reviews say. When you brush your hair, the brush does stick a bit, but I think it’s well worth it. I wake up for work, and spray this stuff on my hair, and I&#x27;m out of the house.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for something that will make my hair have more texture. This does the trick it makes it wavy and stays that way through the day. My hair is very thick and long and hard to keep curls in it. Surf Spray keeps my curls in and makes my hair look great</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this spray after researching and reading the reviews.  Unfortunately it leaves my hair crunchy and feeling dirty, I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out!  I tried fewer sprays the next few times I used it, however I could just feel it drying out my hair with the same crunchy results.</li>
            <li> I use the spray directly onto wet hair and proceed to drying! My hair is always shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> It works great for my hair and keeps it looking nice</li>
            <li> This is a product that my wife loves. She says it gives her a &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> When I got this product the bottle was empty.....</li>
            <li> It adds volume to my hair when blow-drying.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells even better.</li>
            <li> Love how the product smells but I wish it had a bit more hold/texturizing properties. I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a spray that moisturized and added volume and I seen this on amazon so I said why not? I have thick wavy hair and calics on my bang area so my hair pretty much does what it wants. I&#x27;m a 49 yr old woman and as you get older your hair gets dry and course. I needed hair therapy.I washed my hair and sprayed surf spray on my hair and let it naturally dry and fluffed it with my fingers and within 2 wks I was&#x27;nt using conditioner in my hair which left it heavy and flat. Surf spray is infused with abyssinian oil. My hair is healthier and full of volume now. I love my hair  It&#x27;s soft and silky and I get compliments on how full and soft my hair is now. I highly recommend this product and it has a tropical scent to it! I received this gift for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Surf Spray by It Hair Styling performs as promised. It gave my wavy hair texture while not drying it out. I use when I wear my hair natural. It also  provides volume and hold. My hair looked just as good at the end of my work day as it did at the beginning..no more limp locks. I&#x27;m very impressed and highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the &amp;#34;surf&amp;#34; styling products. They all seem to do the same thing; add that just from the beach, wavy windblown look. They add a soft texture that nourashies. The difference with this product is it has marine ingredients. It also anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties to protect your hair and scalp. Works in both short and long hair. Received this product for review.</li>
            <li> The scent is light, not too heavy (in fact I barely noticed it), and the spray itself is also very lightweight and does not make your hair feel like it&#x27;s weighed down too much. I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair for the purpose of taking photos in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not a huge drastic difference, there is definitely a bit of beachy -wave look to her hair after using (and the same on mine as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottle arrived encased in a plastic bag, and unfortunately the bottle was wet all over so somehow some must have sprayed out in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good sized bottle should last awhile, and the spray came out with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice overall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for inspection and review</li>
            <li> Does not give me beach waves at all.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is amazing! I have always wanted a spray to just make my hair look effortlessly curly and wavy and this does a perfect job. It is perfect for summer time because your hair gets damp and humid a lot so not many hairstyles hold throughout the day but if you spray your hair with this spray, it will leave your hair looking carefree and stylish throughout the day. It is also perfect for beaches where there&#x27;s a lot of wind and you just need that messy, tousled hair with a bit of waves in it. I recommended using it different ways to see what hairstyles you can create with it. Blow drying your hair after wards can also give a nice affect. Brushing out your hair after applying it will loosen the waves and the rough texture of the hair. Try applying it on wet hair to see a grunge like/ wet affect as well. It&#x27;s an amazing product for such a low price so I definitely recommend people to buy This!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sample provided without any obligations</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a great deal of volume from this spray, but it did smell good and work well as a hair spray!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really give my blonde/half-straight that much wavyness, my hair feels funny when I use it</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a pretty good product, particularly as a spray. It doesn’t produce results&lt;br /&gt;that are have bad.</li>
            <li> It’s great for lots of body and curls. It’s kind of like my hair has ocean waves!!! Smells great and a little product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this forever and now I can&#x27;t get enough! It&#x27;s a dry spray so it gives that un-done look that I love without leaving my hair wet and crunchy. It is super easy to use and Surf&#x27;s Up! Surf spray is now a permanent part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and most of the time it frizzes up.  I saw Surf Spray on Amazon so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and it works better than any other spray I&#x27;ve tried. It makes my curls wavy and beautiful all day.  On rainy or humid days I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair frizzing up it holds up beautifully.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. It&#x27;s not for all hair textures but once it works for you it&#x27;s actually amazing.</li>
            <li> This is one of my must have products. As soon as it starts getting close to being empty I know it’s time to go buy another. It gives me quick waves and if I spray on more than I get more of a curly look. Also, I&#x27;ll scrunch my hair so it&#x27;ll help create more texture/curls. I find that it works best when the hair is dry rather than wet or damp.</li>
            <li> I think for the price, it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.</li>
            <li> This is a great thing for people who don’t want to style their hair every day. I got a great tip for styling hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Spray in dry hair&lt;br /&gt;2. Twist in 3 inch sections and pin to head&lt;br /&gt;3. Wait until dry ( If don’t have time to air dry, blow dry with hair drier and diffusor)&lt;br /&gt;4. Shake out hair and finger comb&lt;br /&gt;You can sleep on this, also, and DO NOT BRUSH!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I personally really loved this product when my hairdresser used it in my hair. Surf Spray gives your hair the texture and hold of ocean mist without actually making your hair &amp;#34;dirty.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it makes ur hair so soft and beautiful. I recommend this to every woman</li>
            <li> Not at all impressed, I really like another brand but thought that I would try this one since the reviews were so positive - this bottle was about $5 more expensive, smaller in volume, smelled like dirty feet, and left my hair feeling fine and smooth... no texture at all, just frizz that wouldn&#x27;t even stay behind my ears because it was so fine. Weird considering I have naturally wavy hair but this did absolutely nothing for me.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This smells good and works okay. I&#x27;ve used better but the pretty blue color makes me happy so 4 stars it is.</li>
            <li> Surf Spray gives you the beach blown hair without the sand. I have wavy hair so hair spray tends to make my hair stick together and get crunchy. Which is so not the business. Surf Spray is like a hair spray for people who want the fluff and volume of the good ole&#x27; aerosol cans but hate the crunchy sticky feel. I started the Surf Spray challenge amongst my friends and family and it truly impressed everyone that tried it. You&#x27;ll get sexy hair with this stuff. Everyone wants sexy hair, right?!</li>
            <li> I like Free and Clear because I am very sensitive to strong smells. It holds my hair in place but it is not sticky or hard to comb out.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a huge fan of surf spray.&lt;br /&gt;The surf spray by It Haircare works very well and smells awesome!&lt;br /&gt;You can use it with damp hair or on dry hair, depending on how you decide to style it. For quick beachy waves, my daughter likes to lightly use a curling wand and when she&#x27;s finished, she sprays on the Surf spray and kinds scrunches her hair up in her hands and boom, loose, wavy, hair! Use this and then finish spray and you&#x27;re all set to go hit the beach! Or where-ever you need to go, and look pretty!&lt;br /&gt;The surf spray is lightweight and does not make your hair feel sticky or weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Surf Spray for testing purposes and agreed to review the product. Excellent product, very comparable to those products in the salon and high end beauty stores.</li>
            <li> Love this spray! It gives a great beach wave look that lasts all day and also, smells good too!</li>
            <li> I live by this brand! It works so much better on curly, dry, and color treated hair. The results are amazing and long lasting</li>
            <li> The photo of 3 bottles is very deceptive. . .was expecting 3 bottles since the other photos showed the description, and the bottle size is quite small. My mistake, but Disappointed in the advertising presentation.  This review is about the ad, not the product which I have yet to try</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do much for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> i still prefer bumble and bumble salt spray but these are okay</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I liked it from the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It really works! Just a couple spritz and either twist or scrunch your hair and you&#x27;ve got cute beachy waves all day!</li>
            <li> After reading the directions for this I used it on freshly washed and dried hair. I really did not like the feeling that it left in my. It felt a little to oily for my liking. I decided to rewash my hair at that point. I wanted to give it another shot and used it on my second day hair. I have to say I preferred it much more on my second day hair then my freshly washed hair. With and nice even spritz, some scrunching with my hands and my diffuser I got a great look and texture. This is not something that I personally would use on a daily basis. Maybe a few times a month for an easy do when I don&#x27;t have much time.&lt;br /&gt;I DID RECEIVE THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW OF IT.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot from a spray but this actually did amazing!  I love how it makes my hair wavy and reminds me of how my hair gets when I get out of the ocean.  Love love love!  Will be getting it again for sure!</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for hair products because I have very curly hair and humid weather raises hell with my hair and this spray is the perfect answer when I want to wear it down but I don&#x27;t want it to become a giant fuzz ball (tumble weed)</li>
            <li> summer time is the best time to sport a summery beach waves. It&#x27;s more of a naturally curled, yet barely polished hair look.&lt;br /&gt;The problem with that look is that you need volume. For someone who have a very fine and straight hair, beach waves are really hard for me to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;But not anymore!! I have used so many mouse and volumizing hair products from the drugstore, but they make my hair heavy and flat.&lt;br /&gt;Im so glad I discovered this spray, it gives me the perfect hair volume and the perfect &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; hold too, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;I spray this with a slightly dampened hair before I start to blow dry it.&lt;br /&gt;I also spray it after I used a curly iron, it gives my hair the proper hold for my curls.&lt;br /&gt;I also loveee the scent, it smells so fresh like the ocean breeze.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not too strong and it doesnt bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very simple and straightforward, the spray dispenses the right amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this using a promo code for testing.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works! I&#x27;m amazed - I have super fine super straight hair that never holds a curl or wave. I put this on dry and scrunch it and it gives it body and texture. Love it for casual days and only takes about 30 seconds to do my hair! Also smells great!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is difficult to style. I can go straight or in a ponytail and that&#x27;s about it. So, when I was looking on YouTube several months ago for something that I could use in my hair that would hold a style, I saw some reviews and videos for something called Surf Spray. I watched the tips and advice and watched women with hair like mine finally become able to style it and have it hold in some form. When I had the chance to try IT Surf Spray I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use it the other night after I washed my hair. I sprayed and scrunched it through my towel dry hair and let it dry naturally the rest of the way. I have to say I was impressed. The look was nice, it held most of the day (which it never does with any other product I&#x27;ve used), and best of all it smelled nice. That is truly one of the hardest issues beyond styling that I have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a product that has a nice scent to it, holds on even baby fine hair, and keeps the style then try this surf spray.</li>
            <li> I got a beach spray sample in my birch box but that brand was wat to expensive, did a search and found this one and decided to try it out. It leaves my hair a little more stiffer than I&#x27;d like but other than that its pretty awesome. It last several up to 3 days in my hair all I have to do is wet it again. Smells good and works great, cant ask for anything more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with fine straight hair and this did Not do anything to make my hair wavy wet or dry!</li>
            <li> My hair is happy when I use my SURF spray! Worth the price as well as a great product!</li>
            <li> I love it so much! My hair looks so much better after using it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair products I have ever used. I have stick-straight, somewhat fine hair that never has any volume. It lays flat and that&#x27;s pretty much it. I&#x27;ve been dying for beach waves and volume but I have tried everything: salt sprays, mousses, texturizing pastes, thickening sprays, you name it. I picked this up on a lark and I am hooked. This is a dry spray so no heat is required, which is great for fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is great for flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Thought it came with the three bottles  Z</li>
