            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also found Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps to be a good alternative/complement to sulfur soaps.</li>

            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>and I just ordered two more.</li>
            <li>When the skin dries it tends to produce more oil to make up for the moisture that was lost, therefore causing more breakouts.</li>
            <li>Much better for me than benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>But I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Use alot of watter to remove the soap and make sure is remove, is does his effect when you used</li>
            <li>My niece had scabies and this soap helper better than the meds the doctor gave her, plus</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Sulfer is drying but it somehow keeping any more pimples from forming.</li>
            <li>I have used many products to relieve acne and blackheads, but most of them seem to work just okay or not at all.  </li>
            <li>I used this until it ran out and haven&#x27;t ordered more.</li>
            <li>Make sure to put lotion on after using this product.</li>
            <li>I have had great skin almost my whole life.</li>
            <li>your breakouts are way more under control.</li>
            <li>absolutely love it</li>
            <li>Love these soaps.</li>
            <li>As its a must for an older man who turned 48 and does great cleaning</li>
            <li>Aww yeahhh!!</li>
            <li>IT WORKS GREAT TO CLEAR UP ACNE BREAKOUTS.</li>
            <li>The lanolin make it better, keep my skin smooth and cover up the sulfur smell.</li>
            <li>The sulfur soap is so effective that if you do a light rinse with another mild soap, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>And, I don&#x27;t think my acne is the kind that is responding to it very much.</li>
            <li>I remember sniffing it for the first time and thinking that it did have kind of a pungent odor, but after using it once, I don&#x27;t even smell it anymore.  </li>
            <li>If it were just the soap and its fine ingredients, I&#x27;d tell you to go for it.</li>
            <li>I use it once a day and follow up with a light moisturizer (it is a bit drying to the skin).  </li>
            <li>soap is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>conditioning of my skin to removeand crease or light wrinkle: while the serum is on my face</li>
            <li>I add 3 drops of CVS 30ul of vitamin E oil &amp; 3 drops of liquid gold (100% Advanced Oil).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth trying!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant improvement in acne</li>
            <li>If you have problems with acnee or if you want to feel your face clean after you wash it then this soup is for you.</li>
            <li>I just washed my face and it was so clean</li>
            <li>Clears up my skin, makes it squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Stuff is amazing, natural and affordable.)</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;ve had good success with Joesoef&#x27;s sulfur soaps but these aren&#x27;t available on Amazon and are rather pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have combination skin as well as fair, so when I break out, my skin gets really red.  </li>
            <li>Also no bad smell as you would expect with sulfur.</li>
            <li>I was breaking out mildly on both my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>Works good love it cleared up my bumps easy in 4 days cleans skin good but dries it realy bad</li>
            <li>First I went makeup free, took recommended supplements, exercised, drank lots of water, ate healthier than I already do.</li>
            <li>I think that is really help my skin, specially the acne!</li>
            <li>This product is just as effective at reducing my breakouts and does not dry my face out.</li>
            <li>Most said it would clear acne up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bought this soap for my teenage son&#x27;s backne, I was looking for something as effective as the sulfur soap by Adovia.  </li>
            <li>that was worth the purchase alone.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I rarely if ever broke out in.</li>
            <li>While more time on the skin more the effect but harder to remove.</li>
            <li>Got this to wash nursing pads as the pads stated it should use this kind of specific soap</li>
            <li>I mean, incredible.  </li>
            <li>You just have to find the product that fits you just right.</li>
            <li>You just have to find the product that fits you just right.</li>
            <li>Cleared my face right up</li>
            <li>Just make sure you leave the soap on the skin a few min, but dont follow the 10min as is say the instructions, 2-4min is ok.</li>
            <li>To have clear skin and for so cheap, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t think too much about it and figured they&#x27;d go away on their own eventually if I left them alone.</li>
            <li>Works better than the expensive prescription products my dermatologist gave me for roscacea, which basically just made the skin around the outbreaks paler - thus making the acne stand out even more!!  </li>
            <li>It has such a nice clean fresh scent and amazingly it lasts a long time even with daily use.</li>
            <li>Redness was gone the first day</li>
            <li>The first week I used it, it extracted everything out of my face.  </li>
            <li>Really producing good skin results, brighter, clearer, marks less visible.</li>
            <li>They live on your skin, and burst when they get full.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap and I especially like the fact that it treats certain skin conditions.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing forget the other stuff!!I wish I&#x27;d known about this</li>
            <li>And you could only see them if the light hit my face right.</li>
            <li>Although my skin is not clear it looks sooo much better</li>
            <li>I think that people who say they broke out more was because their skin got dry</li>
            <li>The reason I am giving it a so-so review is that it is so soft, it turns to goo extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>I have another mild, natural oatmeal soap that I lather my body with after the sulfur soap.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t do that, there is a strong sulfur smell left.  </li>
            <li>Even throughout puberty my skin was pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hooked on this soap now and will certainly keep using it.</li>
            <li>The smell fades away once you&#x27;re dry, but I can still smell it pretty strongly if I don&#x27;t rinse with the oatmeal soap.  </li>
            <li>The product does what its supposed to but charging 6.99 for two bars of soap is a bit much.</li>
            <li>I have to say since I have been using this product I have really noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>This soap is gentle and I have never noticed a sulfur smell when I am using it, or afterward.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-drying and produces a very creamy lather.</li>
            <li>I would assume that there is so much glycerin in it</li>
            <li>Since then I have tried lots of things trying to get my smooth face back.</li>
            <li>Absolutely seeing improvement in my KP</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Clears up my skin FAST</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this product for her acne and it works really well for her.</li>
            <li>nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>Wish I would&#x27;ve known abt this soap so much sooner</li>
            <li>It has a slight sulfur order, but vanishes quickly if you use even a lightly scented body wash after.</li>
            <li>Then one day my mom showed up with this soap and let me tell you this $3 soap has done more for me then any other product did.</li>
            <li>The soap is mild and does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work just as fine as a natural/sensitive skin bar - it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>my back has never looked this good and in such a short time.</li>
            <li>I have had mild to moderate acne for 40 years.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a decent soap.  </li>
            <li>This soap has a very strong odor that stays on the body throughout the day and made my son self conscious at school and his back began to breakout again despite following the instructions..  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap if you have any skin issues or problems.</li>
            <li>The charge was too high.  </li>
            <li>i started getting into makeup after high school</li>
            <li>Also, because the sulfur is a natural exfoliant, it is helping gently remove skin</li>
            <li>I use it built into my normal shower routine.</li>
            <li>But, most of this soap is wasted along with what you paid for it.</li>
            <li>I gave it a few more goes.</li>
            <li>I gave it a few more goes.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my little sister who has a few oily skin and she said it worked great.</li>
            <li>I use[[ASIN:B004TURQMW New Grisi Bio Sulfur Soap with Lanolin for Acne Prone Skin (6pk)]]</li>
            <li>A friend advised me to order this product and now I can live with out it.</li>
            <li>It smells decent when it&#x27;s dry and fresh out of the package.  </li>
            <li>So, the routine that I do that helps with the smell is washing my hair first so that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my back.  </li>
            <li>I also use some other products (including intake, clean body...).</li>
            <li>Not perfect but good enough and much cheaper!</li>
            <li>Bathing with this soap, it seems less itchy and may last a day at the most.  </li>
            <li>Made my body&lt;br /&gt;break out in large red hives.</li>
            <li>I purchased this soap to alleviate the occasional pimples I get after eating certain foods.  </li>
            <li>and so far I do not see any improvements.</li>
            <li>It looks like a  sunburn, complete with raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li>Sulfur soap works very well---but at the same time, I gave up almost all dairy (except yogurt).</li>
            <li>but as of today, I can walk around my house shirtless without feel self conscious in front of my spouse --</li>
            <li>I also this summer developed tinea versicolor around my eyes...</li>
            <li>but I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I loved the R&amp;D product but it was expensive.</li>
            <li>My breakouts are under control and my scars are slowly but surely lighting up.</li>
            <li>(redness/ few random pimples).&lt;br /&gt;The pimples mostly end up dried out in a day or two and just &amp;#34;fall off&amp;#34;... which I&#x27;m happy with, much better than waiting for them to go down and leave red spots for a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within a day my face is back to normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, smooth and I hardly have to wear makeup.  </li>
            <li>Just beware because it will dry up your whole face.</li>
            <li>The Adovia soap is more expensive but worked really well.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is red all the time, even when it&#x27;s not irritated.  </li>
            <li>Within one day of using this product, I had deep cystic pimples that I never usually get on my cheeks, jawline, chin, forehead...</li>
            <li>my skin has been pretty clear and a lot less shiny since I started using it.</li>
            <li>With a help of almost obsessive (need to be) vacuuming with special filter and washing the bedding and clothing, I&#x27;m getting only few bites per night.  </li>
            <li>This stuff worked well to help clear up my teen&#x27;s face acne.  </li>
            <li>After several weeks of using this soap, my face is completely clear.  </li>
            <li>Overall it helped clear my skin about 70%.</li>
            <li>Basically every adult has them, especially if you have pets, but not everyone reacts to them.  </li>
            <li>It has decent scent and leaves your skin a bit dry.</li>
            <li>And even if it did smell bad in the shower, I wouldn&#x27;t care, because my soft, smooth, clear skin would be well worth</li>
            <li>I had tried proactive (which worked wonders for my face but couldn&#x27;t clear up my back which is my real only problem area), a 10% benzoyl peroxide solution that &amp;#34;helped&amp;#34; redness and the &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; until the day after I forgot the use it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased 3 bars thus far, and will continue to buy it as long as it continues to work.</li>
            <li>it was before, but it is still pretty obvious that I have rosacea and a little acne</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t smell it on myself after I&#x27;m dried off.  </li>

            <li> The lanolin make it better, keep my skin smooth and cover up the sulfur smell.</li>
            <li> The sulfur soap is so effective that if you do a light rinse with another mild soap, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> And, I don&#x27;t think my acne is the kind that is responding to it very much.</li>
            <li> I remember sniffing it for the first time and thinking that it did have kind of a pungent odor, but after using it once, I don&#x27;t even smell it anymore.  </li>
            <li> If it were just the soap and its fine ingredients, I&#x27;d tell you to go for it.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day and follow up with a light moisturizer (it is a bit drying to the skin).  </li>
            <li> soap is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> conditioning of my skin to removeand crease or light wrinkle: while the serum is on my face</li>
            <li> I add 3 drops of CVS 30ul of vitamin E oil &amp; 3 drops of liquid gold (100% Advanced Oil).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth trying!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant improvement in acne</li>
            <li> If you have problems with acnee or if you want to feel your face clean after you wash it then this soup is for you.</li>
            <li> I just washed my face and it was so clean</li>
            <li> Clears up my skin, makes it squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Stuff is amazing, natural and affordable.)</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;ve had good success with Joesoef&#x27;s sulfur soaps but these aren&#x27;t available on Amazon and are rather pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin as well as fair, so when I break out, my skin gets really red.  </li>
            <li> Also no bad smell as you would expect with sulfur.</li>
            <li> I was breaking out mildly on both my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> Works good love it cleared up my bumps easy in 4 days cleans skin good but dries it realy bad</li>
            <li> First I went makeup free, took recommended supplements, exercised, drank lots of water, ate healthier than I already do.</li>
            <li> I think that is really help my skin, specially the acne!</li>
            <li> This product is just as effective at reducing my breakouts and does not dry my face out.</li>
            <li> Most said it would clear acne up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my teenage son&#x27;s backne, I was looking for something as effective as the sulfur soap by Adovia.  </li>
            <li> that was worth the purchase alone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I rarely if ever broke out in.</li>
            <li> While more time on the skin more the effect but harder to remove.</li>
            <li> Got this to wash nursing pads as the pads stated it should use this kind of specific soap</li>
            <li> I mean, incredible.  </li>
            <li> You just have to find the product that fits you just right.</li>
            <li> You just have to find the product that fits you just right.</li>
            <li> Cleared my face right up</li>
            <li> Just make sure you leave the soap on the skin a few min, but dont follow the 10min as is say the instructions, 2-4min is ok.</li>
            <li> To have clear skin and for so cheap, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t think too much about it and figured they&#x27;d go away on their own eventually if I left them alone.</li>
            <li> Works better than the expensive prescription products my dermatologist gave me for roscacea, which basically just made the skin around the outbreaks paler - thus making the acne stand out even more!!  </li>
            <li> It has such a nice clean fresh scent and amazingly it lasts a long time even with daily use.</li>
            <li> Redness was gone the first day</li>
            <li> The first week I used it, it extracted everything out of my face.  </li>
            <li> Really producing good skin results, brighter, clearer, marks less visible.</li>
            <li> They live on your skin, and burst when they get full.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap and I especially like the fact that it treats certain skin conditions.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing forget the other stuff!!I wish I&#x27;d known about this</li>
            <li> And you could only see them if the light hit my face right.</li>
            <li> Although my skin is not clear it looks sooo much better</li>
            <li> I think that people who say they broke out more was because their skin got dry</li>
            <li> The reason I am giving it a so-so review is that it is so soft, it turns to goo extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> I have another mild, natural oatmeal soap that I lather my body with after the sulfur soap.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t do that, there is a strong sulfur smell left.  </li>
            <li> Even throughout puberty my skin was pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hooked on this soap now and will certainly keep using it.</li>
            <li> The smell fades away once you&#x27;re dry, but I can still smell it pretty strongly if I don&#x27;t rinse with the oatmeal soap.  </li>
            <li> The product does what its supposed to but charging 6.99 for two bars of soap is a bit much.</li>
            <li> I have to say since I have been using this product I have really noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> This soap is gentle and I have never noticed a sulfur smell when I am using it, or afterward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-drying and produces a very creamy lather.</li>
            <li> I would assume that there is so much glycerin in it</li>
            <li> Since then I have tried lots of things trying to get my smooth face back.</li>
            <li> Absolutely seeing improvement in my KP</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Clears up my skin FAST</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product for her acne and it works really well for her.</li>
            <li> nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> Wish I would&#x27;ve known abt this soap so much sooner</li>
            <li> It has a slight sulfur order, but vanishes quickly if you use even a lightly scented body wash after.</li>
            <li> Then one day my mom showed up with this soap and let me tell you this $3 soap has done more for me then any other product did.</li>
            <li> The soap is mild and does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work just as fine as a natural/sensitive skin bar - it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> my back has never looked this good and in such a short time.</li>
            <li> I have had mild to moderate acne for 40 years.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a decent soap.  </li>
            <li> This soap has a very strong odor that stays on the body throughout the day and made my son self conscious at school and his back began to breakout again despite following the instructions..  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap if you have any skin issues or problems.</li>
            <li> The charge was too high.  </li>
            <li> i started getting into makeup after high school</li>
            <li> Also, because the sulfur is a natural exfoliant, it is helping gently remove skin</li>
            <li> I use it built into my normal shower routine.</li>
            <li> But, most of this soap is wasted along with what you paid for it.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few more goes.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few more goes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little sister who has a few oily skin and she said it worked great.</li>
            <li> I use[[ASIN:B004TURQMW New Grisi Bio Sulfur Soap with Lanolin for Acne Prone Skin (6pk)]]</li>
            <li> A friend advised me to order this product and now I can live with out it.</li>
            <li> It smells decent when it&#x27;s dry and fresh out of the package.  </li>
            <li> So, the routine that I do that helps with the smell is washing my hair first so that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my back.  </li>
            <li> I also use some other products (including intake, clean body...).</li>
            <li> Not perfect but good enough and much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Bathing with this soap, it seems less itchy and may last a day at the most.  </li>
            <li> Made my body&lt;br /&gt;break out in large red hives.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap to alleviate the occasional pimples I get after eating certain foods.  </li>
            <li> and so far I do not see any improvements.</li>
            <li> It looks like a  sunburn, complete with raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> Sulfur soap works very well---but at the same time, I gave up almost all dairy (except yogurt).</li>
            <li> but as of today, I can walk around my house shirtless without feel self conscious in front of my spouse --</li>
            <li> I also this summer developed tinea versicolor around my eyes...</li>
            <li> but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I loved the R&amp;D product but it was expensive.</li>
            <li> My breakouts are under control and my scars are slowly but surely lighting up.</li>
            <li> (redness/ few random pimples).&lt;br /&gt;The pimples mostly end up dried out in a day or two and just &amp;#34;fall off&amp;#34;... which I&#x27;m happy with, much better than waiting for them to go down and leave red spots for a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a day my face is back to normal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, smooth and I hardly have to wear makeup.  </li>
            <li> Just beware because it will dry up your whole face.</li>
            <li> The Adovia soap is more expensive but worked really well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is red all the time, even when it&#x27;s not irritated.  </li>
            <li> Within one day of using this product, I had deep cystic pimples that I never usually get on my cheeks, jawline, chin, forehead...</li>
            <li> my skin has been pretty clear and a lot less shiny since I started using it.</li>
            <li> With a help of almost obsessive (need to be) vacuuming with special filter and washing the bedding and clothing, I&#x27;m getting only few bites per night.  </li>
            <li> This stuff worked well to help clear up my teen&#x27;s face acne.  </li>
            <li> After several weeks of using this soap, my face is completely clear.  </li>
            <li> Overall it helped clear my skin about 70%.</li>
            <li> Basically every adult has them, especially if you have pets, but not everyone reacts to them.  </li>
            <li> It has decent scent and leaves your skin a bit dry.</li>
            <li> And even if it did smell bad in the shower, I wouldn&#x27;t care, because my soft, smooth, clear skin would be well worth</li>
            <li> I had tried proactive (which worked wonders for my face but couldn&#x27;t clear up my back which is my real only problem area), a 10% benzoyl peroxide solution that &amp;#34;helped&amp;#34; redness and the &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; until the day after I forgot the use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 bars thus far, and will continue to buy it as long as it continues to work.</li>
            <li> it was before, but it is still pretty obvious that I have rosacea and a little acne</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t smell it on myself after I&#x27;m dried off.  </li>
            <li> but it only dried my skin leaving dead dark skin on top....</li>
            <li> Be aware this may dry out your skin excessively.  </li>
            <li> so haven&#x27;t really used it for acne or how viable it would be with all the cleanser and toners that are usually used in a skin care regime.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s taken me this long to find something that actually works.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell if it is working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sad because I much prefer the idea of using sulfur on my skin to other harsher alternatives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sad because I much prefer the idea of using sulfur on my skin to other harsher alternatives.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to discover that Walmart actually had the product and for $1.50 per bar. :-/</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this is a week long review.</li>
            <li> then it has in a veryy long time.</li>
            <li> Was extra drying which I should have expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy cheap, lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s so simple to use.  </li>
            <li> What is the diffenece between this product and the other soap by the same brand</li>
            <li> and I would have the occasional little breakout but nothing that a basic face wash couldn&#x27;t control.</li>
            <li> This soap will definitely dry up any acne or bacteria.</li>
            <li> The tar solved the dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> Still o had dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have dry patches when my pimples heal and my scars are fading.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used to combat dry skin and irritations.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my chest and back only.</li>
            <li> On the first day of use I noticed a difference, some pimples greatly decreased in size and it also lightened my acne scars.</li>
            <li> I even went as far as going to the doctors and buying an expensive cream that really only left tiny holes on my face.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for 5 days and only see a slight change.</li>
            <li> I still have some red marks and scars from previous breakouts that I cover, but it&#x27;s nothing like what I had to cover up.  </li>
            <li> After the shower my skin became very dry.</li>
            <li> stuff took care of the *deep* cystic acne and dried up the papules, leaving the skin smoother and clearer than before.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the faint smell to me.  </li>
            <li> Have to be careful because it does dry out your skin like it says on the box, but a little lotion helps that.</li>
            <li> /shine due to the hot/humid climate of Florida.  </li>
            <li> I found this as an alternative due to both products using sulfur.</li>
            <li> Bought this soap based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> normally so this made it 10x worse.</li>
            <li> This soap works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> This has never happened with any other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Helps with my extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> , I have been pulling off a LOT of dry dead skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the bumps are diminished, skin looks plump and dark spots and times versicolor is going away...</li>
            <li> The only down side is that the shield is also appear as soap scum on bathtub and surroundings.  </li>
            <li> They spread down my jawline and onto my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I could have gotten this product elsewhere for half the price.  </li>
            <li> Less itchiness &#x3D;</li>
            <li> less scratching &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I would have had way less hyperpigmentation from all the acne, and no permanent redness all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I bought this 2 pack about a month and half ago</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoon of Vegetable Glycerin, 1teaspoon of water and about half a teaspoon of 100%pure Vitamin C powder.</li>
            <li> After the first use a lot of the swollen painful bumps had gone down, and after using this soap for a week I noticed all the bumps and boils had healed and gone and no new ones are returning!</li>
            <li> rosacea isn&#x27;t the bumpy mess</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel a bit tight</li>
            <li> I figured sulfur soap would be much less harsh.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my shower in a little dish.</li>
            <li> I do recommend for psoriasis, It will not eliminate the psoriasis but will keep it in small and manageable state, you can use it in conjunction with any other psoriasis product.</li>
            <li> I use this soap everyday to wash my face.</li>
            <li> Waste of money in the end since this product can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> but you need to remove after a few min or</li>
            <li> This helps lighten the discolor skin and remove dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sulfur soap for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I did notice that it has helped keep it in check because I forgot it on vacation for a few days and my skin did not like that.</li>
            <li> It leaves behind a bit sulfur smell, but I figured applying a regular soap after using it, will help to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> I got it for acne and it made me break out worse, and felt like it left residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> I think it is at least partly due to years of benzoyl peroxide products.  </li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m using this soap for another 4 weeks with my face getting worse each day and only a small possibility that it might work eventually.</li>
            <li> When I used this on my face it caused a very odd breakout pattern.</li>
            <li> Also my skin did feel a little dry and itched (probably because I had some popped pimples which I don&#x27;t care because it says not to use on broken skin).</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap to see if it would help with excessive oil</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer here mentioned, this Grisi Sulfur Soap contains Lanolin, a component that a small percentage of the population are allergic to.</li>
            <li> There were small bumps everywhere.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to get the smell off my face as well, not sure I will be using this anymore.</li>
            <li> After doing some research on sulfur I finally decided to give it a try, although I felt afraid of being let down once again.</li>
            <li> This soap has a very heavy perfume smell.</li>
            <li> Even with all that effort, this soap falls apart and makes a real mess.</li>
            <li> The breakouts got SO bad I was freaking out trying new products every week.</li>
            <li> reviewers have complained about the smell.  </li>
            <li> If your body reacts to something in any negative way, you should probably limit or quit using it altogether.</li>
            <li> Used as a secondary item along with permethrin to get rid of mites.</li>
            <li> But until then this is helping me at least keep it from getting worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap has slowly help regain the confidence that the breakouts took away from me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m one of them, and would have to advise some caution before buying this over other non-Lanolin containing sulfur soaps.</li>
            <li> Seriously, just try it out.  </li>
            <li> Once I hit puberty I started to get painful bumps like acne on my inner thighs.</li>
            <li> any condition you have will be worse.</li>
            <li> I have tried pills from my derm which work, but kill your poor liver and some give you melasma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But a few months ago I got these awful little bumps on my temples.</li>
            <li> After every method failed I was getting 20 to 40 bites every night.  </li>
            <li> but it is definitely heals nasty bites faster.  </li>
            <li> For me, it works as well as the expensive wash my Dermatologist prescribed.</li>
            <li> You know that nasty mean-girl thing where someone will tape an advertisement for Weight Watchers or Clearasil to the locker of a heavy or acne-suffering person, as if she doesn&#x27;t know that she has a problem?  </li>
            <li> that suffers from sarcoptic mange.</li>
            <li> no one in my family suffers from it or anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, too.</li>
            <li> and it appeared just as bad all over again.</li>
            <li> I came across some bad reviews</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t even bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if I bought this through this vendor but despite the bad reviews</li>
            <li> I was desperate!  </li>
            <li> I feel like it removed all the crap (dirt, leftover makeup etc)</li>
            <li> The bites used to itch real bad for 3 days before they started to heal.  </li>
            <li> I see people with horrible acne</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very Good product. Although it smells of sulfur,it&#x27;s an excellent soap for taking care of skin. This soap will definitely dry up any acne or bacteria. Just beware because it will dry up your whole face. I highly recommend this soap if you have any skin issues or problems.</li>
            <li> Once I hit puberty I started to get painful bumps like acne on my inner thighs. Squeezing them hurt like holy hell and leaving them be was pain ful. After the first use a lot of the swollen painful bumps had gone down, and after using this soap for a week I noticed all the bumps and boils had healed and gone and no new ones are returning! Yay! I use it built into my normal shower routine. It has a slight sulfur order, but vanishes quickly if you use even a lightly scented body wash after. I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my teenage son&#x27;s backne, I was looking for something as effective as the sulfur soap by Adovia.  This soap has a very strong odor that stays on the body throughout the day and made my son self conscious at school and his back began to breakout again despite following the instructions..  The Adovia soap is more expensive but worked really well. I will be buying the Adovia soap for him in the future.</li>
            <li> When using this product i found that it caused me to break out even more, I dont know if it clogged my pores or what but it didnt work on my skin.</li>
            <li> Use daily for my face and neck. As its a must for an older man who turned 48 and does great cleaning</li>
            <li> If you have problems with acnee or if you want to feel your face clean after you wash it then this soup is for you. I use it for years and i love it</li>
            <li> What is the diffenece between this product and the other soap by the same brand but it just contains bio sulfur?? That is the one I use[[ASIN:B004TURQMW New Grisi Bio Sulfur Soap with Lanolin for Acne Prone Skin (6pk)]]</li>
            <li> The charge was too high.  I could have gotten this product elsewhere for half the price.  The product does what its supposed to but charging 6.99 for two bars of soap is a bit much. I was surprised to discover that Walmart actually had the product and for $1.50 per bar. :-/</li>
            <li> I have no problem with the soap itself (except for the smell of course)&lt;br /&gt;I also have no problem with the sulfur additive, in fact, that&#x27;s the reason I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;My problem is in how the sulfur is &amp;#34;applied&amp;#34; to your skin.  Yes, I know this is a soap, designed to be rinsed-off, but the directions suggest that this is applied, then left on the skin for 10 minutes before rinsing off.</li>
            <li> I brought this soap because I have been having acne break outs from taking biotin. I have been using this soap for about a week now and so far I do not see any improvements. However, I do understand it could take longer before seeing results so I will come back to update my review IF I start to see changes.  UPDATE : I have been using this soap for over a month now and I have to say it has cleared up my skin and I just ordered two more. IT WORKS GREAT TO CLEAR UP ACNE BREAKOUTS.</li>
            <li> It worked but when I stopped using it, the smell lingered in the bathroom for a month.  My roommate wondered what the heck I&#x27;d done in there to make it smell like that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap to see if it would help with excessive oil/shine due to the hot/humid climate of Florida.  I have to say since I have been using this product I have really noticed a difference.  I use it once a day and follow up with a light moisturizer (it is a bit drying to the skin).  It is great for break outs my skin has been pretty clear and a lot less shiny since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for rat mite bites.  After every method failed I was getting 20 to 40 bites every night.  I was desperate!  One site mentioned that Sulfur soap will promote faster healing and it&#x27;s toxic to mites!  I don&#x27;t know about latter as I still get bit but it is definitely heals nasty bites faster.  The bites used to itch real bad for 3 days before they started to heal.  Bathing with this soap, it seems less itchy and may last a day at the most.  Less itchiness &#x3D; less scratching &#x3D; start healing before they get out of control.  With a help of almost obsessive (need to be) vacuuming with special filter and washing the bedding and clothing, I&#x27;m getting only few bites per night.  I think I&#x27;m getting close to the end of this nightmare.  The soap leaves not so visible shield on skin to promote healing and possibly protect further bites or acne, for the majority users.  The only down side is that the shield is also appear as soap scum on bathtub and surroundings.  But it&#x27;s worth trying!</li>
            <li> You know that nasty mean-girl thing where someone will tape an advertisement for Weight Watchers or Clearasil to the locker of a heavy or acne-suffering person, as if she doesn&#x27;t know that she has a problem?  I want to pass this soap out to everyone I see with acne, but not to be mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is fantastic.  It keeps me from breaking out (in conjunction with another sulfur product (Acnevir)) and doesn&#x27;t make my skin red or irritated.  I have very sensitive skin that is red all the time, even when it&#x27;s not irritated.  It looks like a  sunburn, complete with raccoon eyes.  I think it is at least partly due to years of benzoyl peroxide products.  If I&#x27;d had this product (and the Acnevir) I would have had way less hyperpigmentation from all the acne, and no permanent redness all over my face.  Hopefully, these products will allow my skin to heal over time to something approaching normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained about the smell.  I remember sniffing it for the first time and thinking that it did have kind of a pungent odor, but after using it once, I don&#x27;t even smell it anymore.  I certainly don&#x27;t smell it on myself after I&#x27;m dried off.  And even if it did smell bad in the shower, I wouldn&#x27;t care, because my soft, smooth, clear skin would be well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grossness Alert! If anyone recognizes herself or himself in my description of my skin condition, you may have rosacea.  This is something I&#x27;ve never been told by a dermatologist, but learned from doing a lot of research: rosacea is caused by the demodex mite.  Basically every adult has them, especially if you have pets, but not everyone reacts to them.  They live on your skin, and burst when they get full.  Sulfur keeps the population under control, which means you don&#x27;t have the redness that is the allergic reaction to their saliva and stomach enzymes.</li>
            <li> I use this soap everyday to wash my face. I have minimum episodes of acne breakouts but I began using this product after I used Rodan and Fields Unblemish. I loved the R&amp;D product but it was expensive. I found this as an alternative due to both products using sulfur. This product is just as effective at reducing my breakouts and does not dry my face out. Also no bad smell as you would expect with sulfur.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I had used it about two years ago and it worked. I just washed my face and it was so clean I feel like it removed all the crap (dirt, leftover makeup etc) I rubbed my face before drying it and it even made squeeky sounds :p. I will continue to use it and will update. Also my skin did feel a little dry and itched (probably because I had some popped pimples which I don&#x27;t care because it says not to use on broken skin). I think that people who say they broke out more was because their skin got dry and they were not using a good moisturizer. When the skin dries it tends to produce more oil to make up for the moisture that was lost, therefore causing more breakouts. I use argan oil as a face moisturizer which works great! So I hope I don&#x27;t have that problem. I will update in a week to see how it&#x27;s worked. Hope this review helps those who want a solution but are scared of the breakouts.</li>
            <li> Sulfur soap is the best product that I&#x27;ve ever used. I had oily skin and cystic acne. I tried everything out there and this is the only thing that helped. I&#x27;ve used it for almost three years now and I&#x27;ll never use anything else again. (Also, I use witch hazel as my toner. Stuff is amazing, natural and affordable.)</li>
            <li> great product i could see great change in my 16 years old skin</li>
            <li> very good products and quick service Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have had mild to moderate acne for 40 years. It went from teenage acne, to one or two zits all the time and finally to rosacea. There&#x27;s some evidence that shows rosacea might be attributed to mites--since I work closely with dogs, I did a lot of research on what to use on mites. Sulfur soap works very well---but at the same time, I gave up almost all dairy (except yogurt). My skin is very nice, if I do say so--and I have no pimples anymore.  If your body reacts to something in any negative way, you should probably limit or quit using it altogether. I see people with horrible acne and I want to ask them if they drink cows&#x27; milk. This soap is gentle and I have never noticed a sulfur smell when I am using it, or afterward. It&#x27;s non-drying and produces a very creamy lather. The reason I am giving it a so-so review is that it is so soft, it turns to goo extremely quickly. I keep it in my shower in a little dish. If any water lands on it or sits in the dish, this soap will be a gelatinous mass that sheds big chunks all over the place. I even bought a package of those fibery scrubbers at Dollar Tree and made fold-over envelopes to slip in pieces of this soap for exfoliation and to try to keep it from going gummy. Even with all that effort, this soap falls apart and makes a real mess. If it were just the soap and its fine ingredients, I&#x27;d tell you to go for it. But, most of this soap is wasted along with what you paid for it. If this were a hard-milled soap, it would be perfect. I would assume that there is so much glycerin in it, it cannot stand up to water. Or, maybe it&#x27;s all that lanolin...? It&#x27;s too bad, too. It&#x27;s great on skin of any age.</li>
            <li> Bought this soap based on other reviews.  Most said it would clear acne up quickly.  Have been using it for 5 days and only see a slight change. Will continue to try it and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this is a week long review. I had tried proactive (which worked wonders for my face but couldn&#x27;t clear up my back which is my real only problem area), a 10% benzoyl peroxide solution that &amp;#34;helped&amp;#34; redness and the &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; until the day after I forgot the use it and it appeared just as bad all over again. Grisi sulfur bar was immediately welcomed in my bathroom as it smells perfectly fine, fragrance wise and my back has never looked this good and in such a short time. I&#x27;m going to continue using this and update my review but as of today, I can walk around my house shirtless without feel self conscious in front of my spouse -- that was worth the purchase alone.</li>
            <li> After doing some research on sulfur I finally decided to give it a try, although I felt afraid of being let down once again. I came across some bad reviews but It&#x27;s understandable, It&#x27;s not going to work for everyone. Thankfully, it has definitely worked for me and it has not even been a week. I can&#x27;t tell you guys how grateful I am that I found this. Although my skin is not clear it looks sooo much better then it has in a veryy long time. I use it in the morning just to wash my face but at night I actually follow the instructions and leave it on for 10 minutes. On the first day of use I noticed a difference, some pimples greatly decreased in size and it also lightened my acne scars. I&#x27;d say give a try and if it doesn&#x27;t work then it didn&#x27;t work but you won&#x27;t know until you give it a try. Hope someone finds this helpful.</li>
            <li> Within one day of using this product, I had deep cystic pimples that I never usually get on my cheeks, jawline, chin, forehead... My skin isn&#x27;t even bad normally so this made it 10x worse. I heard Lanolin is pore clogging so why would they put it in something like this? I&#x27;ve also heard it could be a purging effect from the Sulfur. But there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m using this soap for another 4 weeks with my face getting worse each day and only a small possibility that it might work eventually. Waste of money in the end since this product can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> This is the best solution for adult acne. Much better for me than benzoyl peroxide.  I had no idea this inexpensive product would do the trick.</li>
            <li> I love this product this is my second order. A friend advised me to order this product and now I can live with out it.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer here mentioned, this Grisi Sulfur Soap contains Lanolin, a component that a small percentage of the population are allergic to. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m one of them, and would have to advise some caution before buying this over other non-Lanolin containing sulfur soaps. Personally, I&#x27;ve had good success with Joesoef&#x27;s sulfur soaps but these aren&#x27;t available on Amazon and are rather pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps to be a good alternative/complement to sulfur soaps.</li>
            <li> My skin peeled off, and as I put, it was WONDERFUL.&lt;br /&gt;I have rosacea, and the cystic acne and papules that go with it.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff took care of the *deep* cystic acne and dried up the papules, leaving the skin smoother and clearer than before.&lt;br /&gt;For the two weeks or so I&#x27;ve combined this with Calc. Sulph and Natrum Muriaticum to help reduce acne/flair-ups, I have been pulling off a LOT of dry dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;My rosacea isn&#x27;t the bumpy mess it was before, but it is still pretty obvious that I have rosacea and a little acne (redness/ few random pimples).&lt;br /&gt;The pimples mostly end up dried out in a day or two and just &amp;#34;fall off&amp;#34;... which I&#x27;m happy with, much better than waiting for them to go down and leave red spots for a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say this stuff works will amazing for the price, and even if it doesn&#x27;t get better than this it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Be aware this may dry out your skin excessively.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a decent soap.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant improvement in acne but I also haven&#x27;t seen an increase.</li>
            <li> Aww yeahhh!! This product worked really good and my skin started clearing up quick...   I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I started breaking out almost 4 years ago when I started having kids. Since then I have tried lots of things trying to get my smooth face back. I was breaking out mildly on both my cheeks. Now my entire face looks like a pizza. I am breaking out in places I rarely if ever broke out in. I&#x27;ll be staying home this weekend because of it. It definitely did not work for me. Try it at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I had alot of bumps and boils in between my thighs and after about a week of using this twice a day, The bumps went away. I bought this 2 pack about a month and half ago and Im still using it, I guess because its only in one spot. But I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Absolutely seeing improvement in my KP</li>
            <li> This stuff worked well to help clear up my teen&#x27;s face acne.  I&#x27;ve purchased 3 bars thus far, and will continue to buy it as long as it continues to work.</li>
            <li> This help my skin problem suprisingly well. After the shower my skin became very dry. Stop use it for a while. Then  I brought a shampoo with tar. These two items go great together. The tar solved the dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> It began clearing up my son&#x27;s face in 2 days! Its awesome&amp;#34; just followed instructions. Redness was gone the first day</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and I had been looking for a 10% sulfur product that could help me, I fount it on this product. The lanolin make it better, keep my skin smooth and cover up the sulfur smell. Just make sure you leave the soap on the skin a few min, but dont follow the 10min as is say the instructions, 2-4min is ok. Use alot of watter to remove the soap and make sure is remove, is does his effect when you used but you need to remove after a few min or any condition you have will be worse. While more time on the skin more the effect but harder to remove. My niece had scabies and this soap helper better than the meds the doctor gave her, plus cheaper. I do recommend for psoriasis, It will not eliminate the psoriasis but will keep it in small and manageable state, you can use it in conjunction with any other psoriasis product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Clears up my skin FAST</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if I bought this through this vendor but despite the bad reviews THIS WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and never had breaks outs until my 30&#x27;s. I have always relied on Proactiv for this but it only dried my skin leaving dead dark skin on top....my skin tone is caramel.&lt;br /&gt;I was also having bumps deep under the skin which hurts like heck. I bought Activate Charcoal and use a capsule on my faces which brought out the pimple. Still o had dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay...I also this summer developed tinea versicolor around my eyes...I used cream and i must say Sulfer Soap is defeating both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sulfer is drying but it somehow keeping any more pimples from forming. It is making them go away yet I still use Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the drying skin: I make my own serum. 2 teaspoon of Vegetable Glycerin, 1teaspoon of water and about half a teaspoon of 100%pure Vitamin C powder. This helps lighten the discolor skin and remove dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;For conditioning of my skin to removeand crease or light wrinkle: while the serum is on my face I add 3 drops of CVS 30ul of vitamin E oil &amp; 3 drops of liquid gold (100% Advanced Oil).&lt;br /&gt;I sleep with a towel on my pillow.when I wake up n the morning and wash with Sumter Soap the bumps are diminished, skin looks plump and dark spots and times versicolor is going away...</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  Really producing good skin results, brighter, clearer, marks less visible.</li>
            <li> If you are in your twenties and still have acne, read on.  I have combination skin as well as fair, so when I break out, my skin gets really red.  I also tend to pick at my skin if I have blackheads or pimples.  I have used many products to relieve acne and blackheads, but most of them seem to work just okay or not at all.  I ordered this product because of everything I&#x27;ve read about the benefits of sulfur soap along with the reviews.  This soap works extremely well.  The first week I used it, it extracted everything out of my face.  So, I was continually breaking out, but the break outs would come to a head within one day and be gone within two days.  I also noticed that my blackheads were coming out.  This has never happened with any other product I&#x27;ve used.  Two weeks in, I had deeper acne coming to the surface.  If you can fight picking at this point, keep using the product.  By the third and fourth week, my skin was immaculate.  I mean, incredible.  It&#x27;s soft, smooth and I hardly have to wear makeup.  I still have some red marks and scars from previous breakouts that I cover, but it&#x27;s nothing like what I had to cover up.  Also, because the sulfur is a natural exfoliant, it is helping gently remove skin and I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have dry patches when my pimples heal and my scars are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing to review is the smell.  It smells decent when it&#x27;s dry and fresh out of the package.  However, there is a chalky smell to it after use/getting out of the shower.  I use it on my face, chest and back.  So, the routine that I do that helps with the smell is washing my hair first so that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my back.  Then, I wash with the sulfur soap.  I have another mild, natural oatmeal soap that I lather my body with after the sulfur soap.  The sulfur soap is so effective that if you do a light rinse with another mild soap, it&#x27;s fine.  I don&#x27;t wash my face with the oatmeal soap though.  Just my body.  This helps with thesmell big time.  If you don&#x27;t do that, there is a strong sulfur smell left.  It also will make your towel and bathroom have a lingering smell.  The smell fades away once you&#x27;re dry, but I can still smell it pretty strongly if I don&#x27;t rinse with the oatmeal soap.  I asked my boyfriend if he could smell it and he didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the way I smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is amazing.  It&#x27;s worth the faint smell to me.  To have clear skin and for so cheap, it&#x27;s worth it.  Give this soap a try.  It&#x27;s crazy cheap, lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s so simple to use.  I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s taken me this long to find something that actually works.  Seriously, just try it out.  The two pack is like $5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no kid, but still suffer from acne/roscacea on my cheeks and chin.  After several weeks of using this soap, my face is completely clear.  Works better than the expensive prescription products my dermatologist gave me for roscacea, which basically just made the skin around the outbreaks paler - thus making the acne stand out even more!!  The soap is mild and does not dry out my skin.  I would recommend this for anyone of any age that has skin problems.</li>
            <li> that suffers from sarcoptic mange.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing forget the other stuff!!I wish I&#x27;d known about this soap years ago it would have saved me a lot of money and my problem skin would have been gone,and now it is.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product for her acne and it works really well for her.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and I especially like the fact that it treats certain skin conditions. It has such a nice clean fresh scent and amazingly it lasts a long time even with daily use. I&#x27;m really hooked on this soap now and will certainly keep using it.</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic. I have been using it since I bought it and it works!!! Have to be careful because it does dry out your skin like it says on the box, but a little lotion helps that. Recommend!!</li>
            <li> Works well in cleansing skin and controlling inflammation. Very happy with product.  Has helped with both acne and redness and pimples</li>
            <li> Maybe my acne is caused by something that this can&#x27;t solve. The smell is gross. It seems to work just as fine as a natural/sensitive skin bar - it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin. I used this until it ran out and haven&#x27;t ordered more.</li>
            <li> Used as a secondary item along with permethrin to get rid of mites.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little sister who has a few oily skin and she said it worked great. It has decent scent and leaves your skin a bit dry. Make sure to put lotion on after using this product.</li>
            <li> This soap has a very heavy perfume smell. Made my body&lt;br /&gt;break out in large red hives. Tried to return, but returns are&lt;br /&gt;not allowed.</li>
            <li> My hormonal acne has been out of control since I graduated college. I have tried pills from my derm which work, but kill your poor liver and some give you melasma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have tried vitamins, detoxes, eliminating sugar and oily foods, water fasted, you name it. nothing really worked. This stuff seems to be working!</li>
            <li> Used to combat dry skin and irritations.  Works for me.  Recommend for use by my son who was&lt;br /&gt;instructed by a doctor to use this type soap.</li>
            <li> Works good love it cleared up my bumps easy in 4 days cleans skin good but dries it realy bad but it works!!!</li>
            <li> I have had great skin almost my whole life. Even throughout puberty my skin was pretty decent. No acne, just occasional breakouts. But a few months ago I got these awful little bumps on my temples. They weren&#x27;t zits and had nothing in them. They were skin colored and just felt like sandpaper. And you could only see them if the light hit my face right. So I didn&#x27;t think too much about it and figured they&#x27;d go away on their own eventually if I left them alone. But nope. They spread down my jawline and onto my cheeks. So the entire lower portion of my face was like a giant swath of sandpaper. Ugh! Then in a matter of days it turned into deep cystic acne. I had a friend look at me one day and think I had fallen off a bike or something because it looked like my cheek was gouged because it was so red and swollen. I have been trying EVERYTHING to get rid of it. First I went makeup free, took recommended supplements, exercised, drank lots of water, ate healthier than I already do. And definitely didn&#x27;t touch it. But none of that helped so I started looking into different products. I&#x27;ve been using this sulfur soap for a few months now. And, I don&#x27;t think my acne is the kind that is responding to it very much. I did notice that it has helped keep it in check because I forgot it on vacation for a few days and my skin did not like that. But it also hasn&#x27;t healed it. Still searching for the holy grail that will solve whatever it is that&#x27;s molesting my face. But until then this is helping me at least keep it from getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After trying this for a while I had to give it up and went a dermatologist. Now, finally, my acne is cleared up. I began using benzoyl peroxide wash during the time I was still recovering from it. But after it was cleared I tried using this again. I figured sulfur soap would be much less harsh. Nope. My skin broke out immediately. I figured maybe it was just a coincidence and tried it again at a later time. Same thing. I wanted it to work so I tried it again later on. Still a no go. Each time I used this my skin broke out. I gave it a few more goes. But after trying it multiple times I finally had to admit it couldn&#x27;t be caused by anything else. It was the soap. I&#x27;m pretty sad because I much prefer the idea of using sulfur on my skin to other harsher alternatives. However, I did find a sulfur scrub that my skin loves ([...]). So that isn&#x27;t to say you should rule out sulfur. You just have to find the product that fits you just right. And for me this wasn&#x27;t it.ried it again later on. Still a no go.

            <li> Cleared my face right up</li>
            <li> Be advised to only using this soap on your body acne and not your face acne. When I used this on my face it caused a very odd breakout pattern. There were small bumps everywhere. These bumps did not go away for several months and eventually turned into blackheads.</li>
            <li> Was extra drying which I should have expected. Not a discredit to the soap. But just not a match for my skin. Would be good for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> this soap works wonders for me. all you have to do is use it regularly and your breakouts are way more under control.</li>
            <li> This soap is beneficial to my skin that has problems but it is not a miracle. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Helps with my extremely oily skin. Have been using for several years now &amp; helps keep break-outs in check.</li>
            <li> The soap is wonderful. It smells great. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell if it is working but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> Got this to wash nursing pads as the pads stated it should use this kind of specific soap so haven&#x27;t really used it for acne or how viable it would be with all the cleanser and toners that are usually used in a skin care regime.</li>
            <li> Use it for acne...absolutely love it and it&#x27;s a great price. I used to get these at Walmart, but I don&#x27;t think they sell it anymore.</li>
            <li> I use this for Rosacea pimples mixed with some Salicylic Acid 2% acne wash. For me, it works as well as the expensive wash my Dermatologist prescribed. Not perfect but good enough and much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my chest and back only. It leaves behind a bit sulfur smell, but I figured applying a regular soap after using it, will help to get rid of the smell. After shower I also apply 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide. Overall it helped clear my skin about 70%.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap to alleviate the occasional pimples I get after eating certain foods.  I follow the directions ( ...leave it on your face for ten minutes...), and it works. I only do it twice a day, morning and night.  It makes my skin feel a bit tight but I use a great night moisturizer that replenishes my face with soothing oils.  Within a day my face is back to normal.</li>
            <li> Love these soaps. With the combination of my facial scrub my acne has cleared and my acne scars are disappearing.</li>
            <li> I think that is really help my skin, specially the acne! I also use some other products (including intake, clean body...). But I think it is a really good product for acne.</li>
            <li> So, I was the type to never get breakouts EVER no one in my family suffers from it or anything. i started getting into makeup after high school and I would have the occasional little breakout but nothing that a basic face wash couldn&#x27;t control. Then one day this face wash just gave up on me. The breakouts got SO bad I was freaking out trying new products every week. I even went as far as going to the doctors and buying an expensive cream that really only left tiny holes on my face. Then one day my mom showed up with this soap and let me tell you this $3 soap has done more for me then any other product did. This soap has slowly help regain the confidence that the breakouts took away from me. My breakouts are under control and my scars are slowly but surely lighting up. Give it a try. Wish I would&#x27;ve known abt this soap so much sooner</li>
            <li> Clears up my skin, makes it squeaky clean. Sometimes I can only leave it on for 3 minutes before washing it off, directions call for 10 minutes. I don&#x27;t notice there is a difference if I just do the 3 minutes rather than the 10. Great soap though and is lasting a while. The lather is so nice. I don&#x27;t mind the smell, I kind of like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good products. I have brought it about 3 months to keep mite from my sheet, it looks working</li>
            <li> This soap smells good while you are using it but then after the sulfur smell lingers with you. I got it for acne and it made me break out worse, and felt like it left residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped a great deal with my teenagers acne.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HORMONE PROBLEMS AND THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORKING FOR ME....</li>
            <li> I cannot even stand the smell of my own face when I use this product, but it does work. Takes forever to get the smell off my face as well, not sure I will be using this anymore.</li>
