            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner ...</li>
            <li>Smooth Application, nice color-</li>
            <li>I love that this product is creamy and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>If you like smooth creamy long wear eyeliner that works excellently on the eyebrows also</li>
            <li>Easy to apply,</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tried and true eyeliner.</li>
            <li>My dark brown is wonderful ~_~</li>
            <li>It sharpens well and goes on extremely smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is charcoal/brown and it goes on so smoothly that you almost think you are using liquid.</li>
            <li>Rich color.</li>
            <li>The colors are rich, and the ease of application can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>able to blend, but does not come off unless you really rub it off!</li>
            <li>It has never failed me!</li>
            <li>No other color compares, it is a super dark brown and compliments my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>the rare occasions I fell asleep with it on</li>
            <li>I love everything about this eyeliner is very soft and doesnt bother my eyes because I have very sensitive skin and eyes</li>
            <li>My Aunt really loves this Eyeliner and she is quite picky!</li>
            <li>and I love  that it will stay on my eyes all day even when I dont wash my face at night the next day I still have it on.</li>
            <li>It stays on pretty well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the first time I have used this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Nice dark brown.</li>
            <li>It really works for me.</li>
            <li>but if you really sweat or rub your eye, it will smudge.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Prestige Waterproof pencils don&#x27;t pull or tug on the eyelid like other waterproof brands and they draw a very smooth line that won&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>It takes too long to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; &amp; smudges too easy if you use a moisturizing  eye cream.</li>
            <li>This liner goes on easily without having to pull the delicate skin around the eye, stays on all day, and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>but I just make sure it&#x27;s sharp and use a soft hand.</li>
            <li>Better even than UD&#x27;s 24 hour liner; however, still not as long lasting as claimed.  </li>
            <li>I buy as many of these pencils as I can find, and I&#x27;m having trouble finding them.  </li>
            <li>Not too dark, and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>So when I could no longer find them in stores near me, I found them here.</li>
            <li>So far, I have not had to sharpen so cannot comment on that.</li>
            <li>It is soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyelid to apply.  </li>
            <li>I would only really need reapply this to my bottom lid, but i don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a water proof pencil and found this.</li>
            <li>I apply it on the upper lids near the lashes and then put a little dark brown eyeshadow on top just to seal it in.</li>
            <li>A nice dark brown, but not too dark as to look black.</li>
            <li>I got the waterproof because no matter what primer I use, after a certain age it seems my eye makeup has decided to not like where it is and go down the face.</li>

            <li> My Aunt really loves this Eyeliner and she is quite picky!</li>
            <li> I love prestige eyeliner and eyebrow pencils. I have been using them for years, wait...maybe a decade!... So when I could no longer find them in stores near me, I found them here. As I worry this might happen again, I have gotten a few extra just as back up. This pencil is great. A nice dark brown, but not too dark as to look black. In my experience with prestige, the color you see on the pencil is the color you see on your face. No sparkle to it, no extra sheen. It really works for me. Its the perfect consistency. Not too hard as to tug at the skin, not too creamy as to melt all over. I apply it on the upper lids near the lashes and then put a little dark brown eyeshadow on top just to seal it in. Some pencils have wood surrounding the color, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to, which is great as sometimes I don&#x27;t sharpen it and I don&#x27;t want to scratch my eyelid. I got the waterproof because no matter what primer I use, after a certain age it seems my eye makeup has decided to not like where it is and go down the face. This one does not move until I remove it. It is a great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> I work outside. This stays on &amp; in place! 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> It takes too long to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; &amp; smudges too easy if you use a moisturizing  eye cream. It also &amp;#34;leaks&amp;#34; into the lines at the corners of the eyes. Also, the casing is so hard it is very difficult to sharpen and the tip breaks while you are trying. I tossed it in the rubbish and will not buy from this line again.</li>
            <li> It is not waterproof. It is smudge proof. I don&#x27;t have raccoon eyes but I do have to reapply after a couple of hours. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Better than the MAC eyeliners I&#x27;ve bought. Tends to run still, but less than any other pencils Ii&#x27;ve tried. got one in my purse and one in my vanity table &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Better even than UD&#x27;s 24 hour liner; however, still not as long lasting as claimed.  Application is easy and can trace as thin or thick a line as one wishes. So far, I have not had to sharpen so cannot comment on that.</li>
            <li> I tried this product through Amazon and love it.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply, does not pull my skin, and stays on all day.  I love that this product is creamy and easy to apply.  I will continue to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> This liner goes on easily without having to pull the delicate skin around the eye, stays on all day, and the price is fantastic. It also does not irritate my eyes, as some other brands have done. All in all, this is an excellent waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tried and true eyeliner. No other color compares, it is a super dark brown and compliments my skin perfectly. It is waterproof as well and doesn&#x27;t smudge or run.</li>
            <li> I love it. It applies nicely. Rich color. Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a water proof pencil and found this. It has never failed me! I order 5 at a time knowing I never want to run out. It sharpens well and goes on extremely smoothly. It does go on heavier that some pencils but I just make sure it&#x27;s sharp and use a soft hand. No need to push down and contort your eye lid with this product. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome liner.  Waterproof  and long lasting until you remove it at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner ...no smears or smudges...the rare occasions I fell asleep with it on, I woke up with glamorous eyes the next morning.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this eyeliner is very soft and doesnt bother my eyes because I have very sensitive skin and eyes but this works great for my eyes and I love  that it will stay on my eyes all day even when I dont wash my face at night the next day I still have it on. I being using for 2 years now and wont change it for nothing alse</li>
            <li> This is perfect for lower liner. Not too dark, and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner pencil available.  It is soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyelid to apply.  The colors are rich, and the ease of application can&#x27;t be beat.  I buy as many of these pencils as I can find, and I&#x27;m having trouble finding them.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Should have stuck to the non waterproof liner.  I don&#x27;t care for how it goes on.</li>
            <li> Prestige Waterproof pencils don&#x27;t pull or tug on the eyelid like other waterproof brands and they draw a very smooth line that won&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> Nice dark brown. Will buy this again</li>
            <li> Smooth Application, nice color- awesome price!  It stays on pretty well but if you really sweat or rub your eye, it will smudge.  I would only really need reapply this to my bottom lid, but i don&#x27;t.  You do need a good sharpener as it has a crayon texture to it, so you need a really good tip.  I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you like smooth creamy long wear eyeliner that works excellently on the eyebrows also.. look no farther !! My dark brown is wonderful ~_~</li>
            <li> Great pencil and you can blend in with your shadow for that smokey eye look</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the first time I have used this eyeliner. It is charcoal/brown and it goes on so smoothly that you almost think you are using liquid. It makes the eye look larger and romantic.</li>
            <li> Stays put all day long!  Easy to apply, able to blend, but does not come off unless you really rub it off!</li>
