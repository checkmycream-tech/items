    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>is an excellent choice, but if your heart is set on a honeysuckle scented shampoo this might not be the one for you.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Suave is good quality for a more than fair price!</li>
            <li>If it smelled more like honeysuckle I&#x27;d happily give it five stars.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this line!</li>
            <li>but there it is, even back-to-nature shampoos seem to have them), but I have encountered no ill effects from using this one and usually I am very happy with Suave&#x27;s products, as I am with the Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, I am quite pleased!</li>
            <li>Great for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>scent is amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how supermarkets will charge $8+ for shampoos &amp;</li>
            <li>nice fragrance, seems to do as well as the pricier brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Suave and love the price.</li>
            <li>Really good foot hair and cheap</li>
            <li>They are cheap and really good.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and clean this provides and at a good price.</li>
            <li>Makes a good amount of suds and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo, excellent price especially for something that doesn&#x27;t contain parabens.</li>
            <li>They smelled good and got your hair clean.  </li>
            <li>Works okay, but the fragrance is really strong and smells like grandma-perfume (no offense, grandmas!)</li>
            <li>I love ginger</li>
            <li>Love the smell and way</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky, healthy, and looks shiny.</li>
            <li>I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>The smell is extremely refreshing, especially first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>you are on any meds and see you hair doesn&#x27;t quite look as healthy as you would like</li>
            <li>*love* the smell, and</li>
            <li>This particular shampoo smells great, without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>hair is clean, with a nice amount of body.</li>
            <li>I do like it, but I liked the original just fine.  </li>
            <li>Plus I love the light, citrus-scent.</li>
            <li>I like how my hair feels clean but not with the overly stripped feeling that many shampoos can give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a drugstore brand I&#x27;m pretty impressed and would recommend it to other long-haired folks who want something that balances their hair nicely without build-up.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling fresh, clean and healthy!</li>
            <li>and since I&#x27;ve been using this along with the conditioner I&#x27;ve been really happy with my hair in general.</li>
            <li>My hair is quite fine and tends to get greasy in about 20 hours</li>
            <li>Just as good as the expensive brands, easy to use, and smells great!</li>
            <li>Such a great value.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very creamy and lathers nicely but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stripped either.</li>
            <li>This one fit the bill nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good but inexpensive shampoo Suave Professionals Natural Infusion</li>
            <li>They were just fine the way they were for people who didn&#x27;t want to spend their hard-earned money on something to clean their hair.  </li>
            <li>It rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>A good deal overall!</li>
            <li>My hair feels, smells and is clean and fresh after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>In the winter I have a relatively dry scalp, and this really hydrates it and my scalp feels great after using it.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a nice shampoo</li>
            <li>but sometimes I pay extra for their professional line just because I like the more &#x27;grown-up&#x27; scents (like Rosemary and Mint) and was thrilled to see a Ginger/Honeysuckle option.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with the scent and how it soft it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s harder to find at a good price.</li>
            <li>I picked this particular formula because I have fine, curly, waist length hair and breakage</li>
            <li>I was so happy with the shampoo and conditioner, I also purchased the macadamia nut and white orchid oil spray, it makes my hair easier to comb, leaves it feeling silkier, healthier, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine textured hair down.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell very much like honeysuckle to me, however, it didn&#x27;t smell overpoweringly like ginger either.</li>
            <li>personal care products are even expansive on Amazon, so I&#x27;m glad I found the Suave products.</li>
            <li>the only reason why I gave this a one star deduction is because it this shampoo does make my hair more prone to static compared to their other shampoos</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll have better luck with it in the summer when the air isn&#x27;t as dry.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>I really like their Professionals line.</li>
            <li>Consequently, I was looking for a gentle shampoo that would not exacerbate any of the hair-falling-out issues.</li>
            <li>It does seem to be a fairly gentle shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;m certain that this has cut down on the breakage I am noticing better texture.</li>
            <li>This shampoo left my hair clean and shiny, so why didn&#x27;t I give it five stars?</li>
            <li>Having had long hair for most of my life I battle the never-ending fight with hair that just can&#x27;t handle growing to old age before snapping.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does an amazing job of cleansing without stripping and smells unbelievable</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get a few samples and I am glad I try them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new and improved Suave seems to lather a little better using less shampoo and may have some more scent.  </li>
            <li>I loved the scent which disapears when dry or at least is very feint.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers well, has a delicate, nice fragrance, and leaves hair soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle.</li>
            <li>I got a deep clean of my hair and scalp with small amount of shampoo, followed by a generous amount of conditioner and it stayed very clean for several days.</li>
            <li>The bottles are a bit inconvenient - they are so rigid you have to be a body builder to get all the product out - lol.</li>
            <li>Breakage is an old friend of mine.</li>
            <li>Ah, and it is sooo soft and sleek.</li>
            <li>I purchased three Suave Professional Shampoo, Conditioner And Natural Infusion</li>
            <li>It seems a little more creamy/slimy in comparison to their other shampoo&#x27;s and doesn&#x27;t seem to lather as much as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>It is now growing back in, but after being told I looked 10 years older than I did 2 years ago</li>
            <li>is certainly a noticeable problem when hair is two feet long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already a huge fan of Suave products and usually stick to their cheap-o 99 cent bottles (coconut or the ocean scent)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any change with breakage, but as long as it is gentle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout now for cheap Add-On products that I will order with my usual purchases on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair color is a copper-ish tone, and while this isn&#x27;t marketed as shampoo for hair color, I have not seen any major color stripping either.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and soft, but I still definitely have use a conditioner, no way around that.</li>
            <li>The only con is that I can usually go 3 days without a wash but using this shampoo and conditioner leaves my roots oily after 1 full day.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had some health issues in the past year that caused large quantities of hair to fall out.</li>
            <li> Suave Professionals Shampoo has come a long way…in price!  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry but didn&#x27;t leave it volumized either.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not make it greasy or dry it out.</li>
            <li> It has all the usual suspects as far as ingredients go, the sort that end in  </li>
            <li> The scent is a bit fake but not unpleasant</li>
            <li> I like it somewhat better than the Garnier Fructis product I was using (though that one wasn&#x27;t bad, either).</li>
            <li> It might seem silly to dock an entire star simply for smell (and don&#x27;t get me wrong, the shampoo smells just fine)</li>
            <li> Add in living in a dry climate with hard water and some color treating and my poor mane is looking pretty</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m managing to go every other day with the shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have had issues with other brands where the perfume is so heavy it gives me a headache until I rewash my hair.</li>
            <li> I have brittle, thin curly hair and this definitely helped with my split ends and tamed my curls into glossy tress&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I moved to the U.S. (from Germany) about two months ago and was shocked when I saw how much beauty/personal care products cost here.</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;m not sure what to make of the texture.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is a little weak, but it could be worse and be overpowering.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to wash it everyday because of the oil it leaves behind, then breakage solves itself and it&#x27;s a winner to me!</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t foam as much as ordinary shampoos, and my understanding is that the big, over-the-top foam is one sign of bad ingredients.</li>
            <li> and/or makes my bangs lay limp on my forehead :(.  </li>
            <li> Do not be afraid to try these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (And yes, I realize honeysuckle is a very difficult scent to recreate in a lab.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been a Suave family for a couple of decades, and have yet to be disappointed in the products we&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> This shampoo left my hair clean and shiny, so why didn&#x27;t I give it five stars? It didn&#x27;t smell very much like honeysuckle to me, however, it didn&#x27;t smell overpoweringly like ginger either. If it smelled more like honeysuckle I&#x27;d happily give it five stars. It might seem silly to dock an entire star simply for smell (and don&#x27;t get me wrong, the shampoo smells just fine) but if it&#x27;s going to advertise itself as honeysuckle shampoo then by golly I want it to smell like honeysuckle. (And yes, I realize honeysuckle is a very difficult scent to recreate in a lab.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it comparable to the Pantene Beautiful Lengths shampoo. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry but didn&#x27;t leave it volumized either. Overall it&#x27;s a nice shampoo but I would maybe try it in a different scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good but inexpensive shampoo Suave Professionals Natural Infusion is an excellent choice, but if your heart is set on a honeysuckle scented shampoo this might not be the one for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already a huge fan of Suave products and usually stick to their cheap-o 99 cent bottles (coconut or the ocean scent) but sometimes I pay extra for their professional line just because I like the more &#x27;grown-up&#x27; scents (like Rosemary and Mint) and was thrilled to see a Ginger/Honeysuckle option.  I love ginger everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is amazing though I&#x27;m not sure what to make of the texture.  It seems a little more creamy/slimy in comparison to their other shampoo&#x27;s and doesn&#x27;t seem to lather as much as I&#x27;d like.  Not a big deal -- the only reason why I gave this a one star deduction is because it this shampoo does make my hair more prone to static compared to their other shampoos and/or makes my bangs lay limp on my forehead :(.  Maybe I&#x27;ll have better luck with it in the summer when the air isn&#x27;t as dry.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and way it makes my hair feel. I use it w/ the leave in conditioner especially during the summer.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the expensive brands, easy to use, and smells great!</li>
            <li> I was using a salon brand that is 3x the price and I got a sample of this in the mail. I fell in love with the scent and how it soft it made my hair feel. The shampoo does an amazing job of cleansing without stripping and smells unbelievable and the conditioner actually detangles my hair.  My hair feels silky, healthy, and looks shiny. I was so happy with the shampoo and conditioner, I also purchased the macadamia nut and white orchid oil spray, it makes my hair easier to comb, leaves it feeling silkier, healthier, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine textured hair down. These products are now part of my permanent haircare regimen and they all together probably cost the same amount as one salon brand shampoo bottle. Such a great value.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use everyday, but you don&#x27;t have to. It&#x27;s scent is a little weak, but it could be worse and be overpowering.  I picked this particular formula because I have fine, curly, waist length hair and breakage is certainly a noticeable problem when hair is two feet long.  It leaves my hair shiny and soft, but I still definitely have use a conditioner, no way around that. I didn&#x27;t see any change with breakage, but as long as it is gentle and I don&#x27;t have to wash it everyday because of the oil it leaves behind, then breakage solves itself and it&#x27;s a winner to me!</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo, excellent price especially for something that doesn&#x27;t contain parabens. That&#x27;s harder to find at a good price. This gives a great lather and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> Breakage is an old friend of mine. Having had long hair for most of my life I battle the never-ending fight with hair that just can&#x27;t handle growing to old age before snapping. Add in living in a dry climate with hard water and some color treating and my poor mane is looking pretty haggard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;m certain that this has cut down on the breakage I am noticing better texture. My hair is quite fine and tends to get greasy in about 20 hours but I&#x27;m managing to go every other day with the shampoo! The shampoo is very creamy and lathers nicely but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stripped either. The scent is a bit fake but not unpleasant and since I&#x27;ve been using this along with the conditioner I&#x27;ve been really happy with my hair in general. For a drugstore brand I&#x27;m pretty impressed and would recommend it to other long-haired folks who want something that balances their hair nicely without build-up.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does give my hair body. It rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. Plus I love the light, citrus-scent. I like it somewhat better than the Garnier Fructis product I was using (though that one wasn&#x27;t bad, either). You get plenty for your money, too. A good deal overall!</li>
            <li> Suave Professionals Shampoo has come a long way…in price!  I have always like Suave shampoos.  They were just fine the way they were for people who didn&#x27;t want to spend their hard-earned money on something to clean their hair.  They smelled good and got your hair clean.  (The list price here was $4.39 at the time of this review)  This new and improved Suave seems to lather a little better using less shampoo and may have some more scent.  I do like it, but I liked the original just fine.  I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> nice fragrance, seems to do as well as the pricier brands. I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Suave and love the price.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine,thinning hair that I color. This shampoo does not make it greasy or dry it out. My scalp feels clean but not dry. I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo. My hair feels fuller and it looks great.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works well for my hair.</li>
            <li> I squeeze in my hand, rub on my head. It gets bubbly, then I rinse it and repeat- cleans my hair!</li>
            <li> Really good foot hair and cheap</li>
            <li> At age 50 I have a dryer scalp and don&#x27;t need to wash my hair daily, my hair is not colored so didn&#x27;t have to worry of color stripping away.  I got a deep clean of my hair and scalp with small amount of shampoo, followed by a generous amount of conditioner and it stayed very clean for several days. I loved the scent which disapears when dry or at least is very feint. 5 star packaging - product was taped shut and in plastic - no leaking. The bottles are a bit inconvenient - they are so rigid you have to be a body builder to get all the product out - lol.</li>
            <li> I have brittle, thin curly hair and this definitely helped with my split ends and tamed my curls into glossy tress&#x27;. The only con is that I can usually go 3 days without a wash but using this shampoo and conditioner leaves my roots oily after 1 full day.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been a Suave family for a couple of decades, and have yet to be disappointed in the products we&#x27;ve tried. I really like their Professionals line. This particular shampoo smells great, without being overpowering. I have had issues with other brands where the perfume is so heavy it gives me a headache until I rewash my hair. Not so with Suave, their use of fragrance has always been just enough without being too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is clean, with a nice amount of body. I don&#x27;t do a lot to my hair, just comb it out &amp; go, so I don&#x27;t put lots of different products on it. Suave works well for me &amp; the price is perfect.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle. My hair feels, smells and is clean and fresh after using this shampoo. Ah, and it is sooo soft and sleek. The smell is extremely refreshing, especially first thing in the morning. In the winter I have a relatively dry scalp, and this really hydrates it and my scalp feels great after using it. Give this one a try!!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and smells great. Great price too.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful and leaves hair in great shape</li>
            <li> I purchased three Suave Professional Shampoo, Conditioner And Natural Infusion the items are Awapuhi &amp;amp; Ginger. I was lucky enough to get a few samples and I am glad I try them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you are on any meds and see you hair doesn&#x27;t quite look as healthy as you would like or it is thinning, this is a great combination to use. Do not be afraid to try these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note after the Infusion dries it looks like you have strands of hair, comb or brush it through and you will look great.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers well, has a delicate, nice fragrance, and leaves hair soft and bouncy. It has all the usual suspects as far as ingredients go, the sort that end in  -ate (I&#x27;ve never quite worked out why shampoo as a simple cleanser needs the lengthy list of additives but there it is, even back-to-nature shampoos seem to have them), but I have encountered no ill effects from using this one and usually I am very happy with Suave&#x27;s products, as I am with the Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price~</li>
            <li> for the price I was amazed at how well this worked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some health issues in the past year that caused large quantities of hair to fall out. It is now growing back in, but after being told I looked 10 years older than I did 2 years ago (when I stopped coloring my hair), I colored my hair. Consequently, I was looking for a gentle shampoo that would not exacerbate any of the hair-falling-out issues. This one fit the bill nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made by Suave, so how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; it is I truly wouldn&#x27;t bet on. However, it doesn&#x27;t foam as much as ordinary shampoos, and my understanding is that the big, over-the-top foam is one sign of bad ingredients. I can say that I *love* the smell, and I like how my hair feels clean but not with the overly stripped feeling that many shampoos can give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair color is a copper-ish tone, and while this isn&#x27;t marketed as shampoo for hair color, I have not seen any major color stripping either. It does seem to be a fairly gentle shampoo. All-in-all, I am quite pleased!</li>
            <li> works great smells good not a lot of shampoo or conditioner required with this product</li>
            <li> I moved to the U.S. (from Germany) about two months ago and was shocked when I saw how much beauty/personal care products cost here. It&#x27;s amazing how supermarkets will charge $8+ for shampoos &amp; co. In Germany I get the same brands for a third of that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most personal care products are even expansive on Amazon, so I&#x27;m glad I found the Suave products. They are cheap and really good. This shampoo has a great scent and feels great. I&#x27;m always on the lookout now for cheap Add-On products that I will order with my usual purchases on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave is good quality for a more than fair price!</li>
            <li> Great for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Seems to suit my hair type. And so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but the fragrance is really strong and smells like grandma-perfume (no offense, grandmas!)</li>
