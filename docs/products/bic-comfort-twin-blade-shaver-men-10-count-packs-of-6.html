            <li>Best disposable razor that I have ever use.  </li>
            <li>Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>One of the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I have found this razor to be a very good razor.</li>
            <li>Amazon, keep up the good work!</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll find it a great value for the money.</li>
            <li>So happy to find them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found them to be a great value.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to find a very good BIC razor called the Comfort Twin.</li>
            <li>So, I need something really good to keep up with them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say these are a good alternative to some &amp;#34;higher tier&amp;#34; type of razors like Mach 3&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The BIC Comfort Twin has proven to be the best razor I have ever used and is very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>And, with the ridiculously high cost of most disposable shavers these days, this shaver is about the best bargain.</li>
            <li>The COMFORT TWIN has been the best by far, even when the conditioner strip dries out.  </li>
            <li>but I am growing a bit of a beard and needed something with more control (non flex) to shave with the grain on my neck cheeks and mustache.     </li>
            <li>many times.  </li>
            <li>A even better value when Amazon emails you with a 30% off coupon if you order two.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to be able to make the purchase on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>1 or 2 more shaves out of it without any friction.  </li>
            <li>Bic are the best disposable razors on the market, you don&#x27;t need 4 blades, 2 does the job just fine, they last lon too.</li>
            <li>Used with Edge Clean and Refreshing and not one cut or nick.</li>
            <li>He gets smooth shaves with them without irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used disposable shavers for decades, from the Gillette Good News to the orange handled Bic Sensitive.</li>
            <li>It was a good razor for a person with a sensitive face.</li>
            <li>Smooth clean shave every time.</li>
            <li>I usually use a Schick Quattro Midnight edition which is an excellent razor</li>
            <li>It gives me a clean close shave without any razor burn.  </li>
            <li>The Comfort Twin Blade has just the right grip and the right feel for me.</li>
            <li>but this razor really does work!</li>
            <li>First purchase...</li>
            <li>Nice sharp razors in bulk.</li>
            <li>It has been my favorite for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The other three 5 star ratings are right on, I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found these to shave very closely without cuts or nicks.  </li>
            <li>The Amazon photo of their product was the same razor as I liked, but when they arrived, the razor was different in its shape and color.</li>
            <li>I suspect that Gillette decided to not make them anymore because they did work too well and Gillette decided they could make more $$ buy producing more expensive</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li>Actually grabbed a USED razor of my standard brand after one of these shredded my face and it provided a better shave than these did new.     </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve used a little system to get the most out of each razor while getting a close shave.  </li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s more, a single shaver might last up to 3</li>
            <li>My only issue is that these are no longer available in retail shops, only online.</li>
            <li>The Bic Comfort Twin Sensitive Skin features an Aloe &amp; Vitamin E strip that also helps to reduce irritation or razor burn.</li>
            <li>Could be my skin is sensitive, dont know</li>
            <li>On the fifth and several subsequent days I make the first pass over my face with razor 1 and then use razor 2 for the closer shave.</li>
            <li>Bought these because Costco no longer carries the blue plastic double bladed Gillette disposables (in a large bag) which worked well.  </li>
            <li>Bic \\&quot;out of the bag\\&quot; does not give a complete shave requiring one to go over and over the same area again and again ...</li>
            <li>They give a much closer shave than other disposable razors in the same price range and as I said, can keep up with some more expensive ones.</li>

            <li> Like two other reviewers said, these razors have vanished from my local stores, and I too must go to Amazon to purchase.  </li>
            <li> My local grocery store no longer carries them (perhaps due to Amazon!).</li>
            <li> I last found that razor a few months ago at Walgreens in a 2- pack.</li>

            <li> I paid 1.17 for a twin pack at some random pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Tied with the CVS generic and BJ&#x27;s Berkely&amp;Jensen brand for worst shave</li>
            <li> These are so bad that I&#x27;m throwing away 8 of the 10 pack unused.     </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that all the places I purchase my hygiene/toiletries from stopped carrying this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These razors (at .54 each) are terrible.  </li>

            <li> The other three 5 star ratings are right on, I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  Just like them, I&#x27;m at Amazon because the local vendors no longer stock this item.  Amazon, keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.  It has been my favorite for a long time.  My local grocery store no longer carries them (perhaps due to Amazon!).</li>
            <li> I have used some Bics before with no luck but this razor really does work! I usually use a Schick Quattro Midnight edition which is an excellent razor but I am growing a bit of a beard and needed something with more control (non flex) to shave with the grain on my neck cheeks and mustache.     Used with Edge Clean and Refreshing and not one cut or nick. The Bic Comfort Twin Sensitive Skin features an Aloe &amp; Vitamin E strip that also helps to reduce irritation or razor burn. I paid 1.17 for a twin pack at some random pharmacy. Hopefully some local stores will carry it in bulk because I like it, and if not then there is always Amazon but the shipping fee. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Bought these because Costco no longer carries the blue plastic double bladed Gillette disposables (in a large bag) which worked well.  And could not find them online.  I suspect that Gillette decided to not make them anymore because they did work too well and Gillette decided they could make more $$ buy producing more expensive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors (at .54 each) are terrible.  One blade only (vs. Gillette two blades above.) Bic \\&quot;out of the bag\\&quot; does not give a complete shave requiring one to go over and over the same area again and again ... A 2nd shave with the same blade renders a ZERO result.</li>
            <li> Just bought these because they were on sale and what a mistake that was!    Tied with the CVS generic and BJ&#x27;s Berkely&amp;Jensen brand for worst shave I&#x27;ve ever had.    Actually grabbed a USED razor of my standard brand after one of these shredded my face and it provided a better shave than these did new.     Not going to mention my usual brand so no one thinks I&#x27;m a shill for another company bashing the competition. Just know that I&#x27;m not comparing this to some uber-expensive 3, 4, or 5 blade premier razor. My standard razor is just a simple disposable twin blade with lubrication strip just like these.     These are so bad that I&#x27;m throwing away 8 of the 10 pack unused.     You&#x27;ve been warned!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it - the whiskers just keep coming with a vengeance. So, I need something really good to keep up with them. I&#x27;ve used disposable shavers for decades, from the Gillette Good News to the orange handled Bic Sensitive. And, I&#x27;ve tried other types of Bic disposable shavers as well, including the Comfort 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Comfort Twin Blade has just the right grip and the right feel for me. And, with the ridiculously high cost of most disposable shavers these days, this shaver is about the best bargain. And what&#x27;s more, a single shaver might last up to 3 shaves without loss of comfort and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a while, suddenly I can&#x27;t find it at any of my nearby drug stores, so I have to order it from Amazon.  It gives me a clean close shave without any razor burn.  If you must shave, try this blade.  I think you&#x27;ll find it a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> My husband has a beard and just shaves his neck and cheek areas.  He loves the closeness and smoothness.  A razor usually last him one month.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp razors in bulk.</li>
            <li> Best disposable razor that I have ever use.  Smooth clean shave every time.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and delivered on time. I have purchased these razors before,&lt;br /&gt;so I knew how well they worked...and they can be used[[ASIN:B00070QF16 BIC Comfort 3 Advance Pivot Triple Blade Disposable Shaver, Men, 4-Count (Pack of 6)]] many times.  I use each&lt;br /&gt;razor about 5 times before I throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;Bought on from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bic are the best disposable razors on the market, you don&#x27;t need 4 blades, 2 does the job just fine, they last lon too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend these razors and I am not happy that I bought them.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these shavers. He gets smooth shaves with them without irritation. We&#x27;d been looking all over for them. So happy to find them.</li>
            <li> One of the best disposable razors I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;d say these are a good alternative to some &amp;#34;higher tier&amp;#34; type of razors like Mach 3&#x27;s. They give a much closer shave than other disposable razors in the same price range and as I said, can keep up with some more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find a very good BIC razor called the Comfort Twin. It was a good razor for a person with a sensitive face. I last found that razor a few months ago at Walgreens in a 2- pack. The Amazon photo of their product was the same razor as I liked, but when they arrived, the razor was different in its shape and color. I have found this razor to be a very good razor. I would buy the box of 60 razors again.</li>
            <li> Like two other reviewers said, these razors have vanished from my local stores, and I too must go to Amazon to purchase.  I grew up using these razors,  I&#x27;ve found them to be a great value.  A even better value when Amazon emails you with a 30% off coupon if you order two.</li>
            <li> The BIC Comfort Twin has proven to be the best razor I have ever used and is very reasonably priced.  I was disappointed that all the places I purchase my hygiene/toiletries from stopped carrying this product.  I was pleased to be able to make the purchase on Amazon.com.  First purchase...won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li> Could be my skin is sensitive, dont know but these ripped the heck out of my face. Don&#x27;t like them at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every type of disposable; with everything form 1-3 blades; with and without conditioner strips.  The COMFORT TWIN has been the best by far, even when the conditioner strip dries out.  I can still get 1 or 2 more shaves out of it without any friction.  My only issue is that these are no longer available in retail shops, only online.</li>
            <li> I used yo buy these at a Target.  This was after trying just about every disposable on the market.  I&#x27;ve found these to shave very closely without cuts or nicks.  They perform well, losing sharpness over about a week of shaving.  I have a heavy beard and like a close shave so I&#x27;ve used a little system to get the most out of each razor while getting a close shave.  I use the first razor for 4 shaves bad then I open a second one.  On the fifth and several subsequent days I make the first pass over my face with razor 1 and then use razor 2 for the closer shave.</li>
            <li> Hard to open the plastic cover over the blades.</li>
