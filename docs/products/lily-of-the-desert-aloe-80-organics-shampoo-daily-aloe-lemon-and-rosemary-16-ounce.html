    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The price is great, and I like that it&#x27;s organic as well.    </li>
            <li>I am one happy customer.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>Great value for the price.</li>
            <li>WITH GREAT CARE.</li>
            <li>Good suds, smells great.</li>
            <li>I just use the shampoo coupled with a good leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>However, it is almost too good at cleaning the hair-</li>
            <li>SHampoo smells good..</li>
            <li>Has ingredients as described and feels good after washing the hair.</li>
            <li>This product may be good for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I still use a conditioner after, and wouldn&#x27;t call this perfect, but it is a step in the right direction.  </li>
            <li>Please, for your own sake... take my advice as a \\&quot;former\\&quot; \\&quot;Lily Of The Desert\\&quot; believer and supporter...</li>
            <li>My new best shampoo!</li>
            <li>Smells good, similar to pinsol, but more citrus lemon grassy!!!</li>
            <li>I had read that lemon (one of the main ingredients) was very good for grease issues and the scalp, in addition to aloe, which is good for the skin, and rosemary, which smells amazing, and makes me feel more calm.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with the light,clean scent, and I shampoo with it daily.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>If you are in Canada the shipping will cost you 2-3 times more than the product itself.</li>
            <li>Feels very clean afterwords.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the smell is pretty nice, too.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo looking for a relatively cheap sulfate free shampoo and found this one.</li>
            <li>Pair this with their conditioner, and you really add great scent and effective cleansing to your daily shampoo routine.</li>
            <li>Lathers very well!!!</li>
            <li>but over a month&#x27;s time my hair&#x27;s felt significantly softer, shinier even.</li>
            <li>I had found an organic brand that didn&#x27;t make me break out but kept my hair clean, and then BB&amp;B stopped selling it.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;And yes, it does seem to clean your hair well.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised how much I liked this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Many products off of the drugstore shelf contained synthetic ingredients I really probably shouldn&#x27;t have been putting in my hair and my system, to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And as a bonus, it is pretty cheap</li>
            <li>But what I noticed the very first time I used</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>First off, there is a really rich lemony smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to pass it on to my boys since they have short hair, and I&#x27;ll feel great that they&#x27;re using a natural product!</li>
            <li>The hair seems to retain a lot more natural oils after use, but also seems pretty clean.  </li>
            <li>The company decided to change the formula to include more \\&quot;natural ingredients\\&quot;... as they so claimed to me.</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;s a shampoo problem, so I tried more natural shampoos.</li>
            <li>So, to make it worth shipping you have to buy at list 3 items at once</li>
            <li>I need to wash my hair nearly every day, and this has done a fine job of keeping my hair clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>ingredients look pretty safe as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>It leaves no residues and is even able to tackle tough greasy spots left by sub-par shampoos, which I find impressive for an organic brand.</li>
            <li>Smells great and no residue in my hair when I have had problems with tht in the past.</li>
            <li>Both products were SO inferior to the original formulation, that I actually threw away ALL the full bottles of product!</li>
            <li>it is organic and very reasonable in price.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair prone to greasiness and sensitive skin, so shampoo has been a troublesome area for me since puberty.</li>
            <li>My first organic shampoo.</li>
            <li>First because it cleans without drying out my hair.</li>
            <li>After running through various organic/sulfate-free labels, I think I&#x27;m satisfied with this one.   </li>
            <li>I guess this stuff was too gentle for my hair!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Both my wife and I were avid users of Aloe 80 conditioner (&amp; shampoo) --</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong, reminiscent of Pine-Sol.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product for the first few months of using it.</li>
            <li>I recently started washing with baking soda and so far that does a much better job of cleaning my hair at a much cheaper rate!</li>
            <li>However, the scent really wears off once you lather and rinse your hair.</li>
            <li>When I used this shampoo I noticed that my scalp became very flaky.  </li>
            <li>very slippery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Afterwards it leaves my hair and scalp feeling very dry and itchy, although very clean.</li>
            <li>So, for the purpose of their claiming to use more \\&quot;natural ingredients\\&quot; than their original formulation, they&#x27;ve moved from almost 100% functionality to possibly 5% (or less) functionality, in my opinion... and then decided to almost double their price for it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, for some people, this might be a great shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it to all my friends, especially those who have the same hair consistency as I do.</li>
            <li>Then I noticed my hair becoming sort of heavier and less shiny.</li>
            <li>People were complimenting me, asking me if I got a new haircut/hairstyle and from where.</li>
            <li>Always trying new things..</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and subtle.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim, looking for a decent natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>do NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this \\&quot;newly-formulated\\&quot;, highly inferior product!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Despite the positive reviews, I didn&#x27;t expect to actually have such promising results!</li>
            <li>I use another conditioner (but wish to try Aloe 80&#x27;s complimentary conditioner someday) and find it a must if you want to avoid tangly, dry hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really washes away all the salt and grime from the ocean, but is gentle on my hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a sizeable bottle of shampoo with neat, professional packaging.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never experienced this kind of impact from any shampoo.</li>
            <li>The consistency of this shampoo is thick and transparent - more like gel than creme.</li>
            <li>not smooth and manageable as the original formulation.</li>
            <li>In other words, their new \\&quot;more natural\\&quot; formulation in the real world of customer product satisfaction is now \\&quot;worthless!\\&quot; Both the shampoo &amp; conditioner make your hair feel dry, rough, and unmanageable!...</li>
            <li>I love this because it is natural and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like some other natural shampoos.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty difficult to lather up and only works into a thin lather at best.</li>
            <li>Having so much faith in their former products, I purchased several bottles of this \\&quot;newly-formulated\\&quot; conditioner and the \\&quot;newly-formulated\\&quot; shampoo.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this product but the only concern is that I feel my hair is pretty dry after shampooing.  </li>
            <li>found Lily of the Desert Aloe 80 Organics Shampoo at my local natural foods store.</li>
            <li>The BIG problem is, their new formulation lost ALL of its \\&quot;functionality\\&quot; and is hence receiving EXTREMELY negative reviews from customers all over the internet... and rightly so!</li>

            <li> I needed to switch shampoos, because I had stuck with one for too long, without alternating brands.</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel strange.</li>
            <li> I have never had dry scalp problems until using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> But if you have dry hair, and are looking for something organic, you may&lt;br /&gt;want</li>
            <li> I made the switch to Renpure&#x27;s body and shine shampoo, and that cured my dry scalp after a single use.</li>
            <li> conditioner contains Shea Butter and a lot of natural oils, which accounts for the fact that it&#x27;s very slick and makes anything it comes in contact w/</li>
            <li> it could maybe be used as a clarifying shampoo, to remove build up from other products.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily hair...</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to explore other Lily of the Desert products now also.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair</li>
            <li> By the time I knew it, my hair- even after fully washing, fully rinsing, and blowdrying (air drying was worse) was completely greasy.</li>
            <li> otherwise it is very expensive product to ship overall if you would like to try only one item or buy it with Conditioner - the same brand.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a lot less harsh than the other shampoos I had been using.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well with little amount.</li>
            <li> This shampoo went under my sink after being found guilty of causing instant dandruff!!</li>
            <li> NO MORE!</li>
            <li> My hair was beginning to show it was worse for wear, too.</li>
            <li> I have dandruff, and this has made it worse.  </li>
            <li> It was sticky, my scalp itched terribly and it was not easily combed.</li>
            <li> Very scarily slippery, as a matter of fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m sort of neutral about this shampoo. Its organic that&#x27;s why I got it.  It lathers well with little amount. It does seem to sting my eyes. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s getting in my eyes, but it still stings.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how much I liked this shampoo.  I am in the ocean a couple times a week, and I wash my hair every day.  This shampoo really washes away all the salt and grime from the ocean, but is gentle on my hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  The smell is nice and subtle.  It&#x27;s not overpowering and not too perfumey.  The price is great, and I like that it&#x27;s organic as well.    Overall, I have no complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> My first organic shampoo. Smells good, similar to pinsol, but more citrus lemon grassy!!! I love the way my hair feels. I just use the shampoo coupled with a good leave in conditioner. Lathers very well!!!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite shampoo.  First because it cleans without drying out my hair. I can shampoo every day.  Second it is organic and very reasonable in price.  I also like the scent.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I love this because it is natural and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like some other natural shampoos.  However, it is almost too good at cleaning the hair- it could maybe be used as a clarifying shampoo, to remove build up from other products.  For this reason, I&#x27;d just caution against trying to use it as a daily shampoo for longer hair- for me, it seems to deplete the hair just a bit.  I&#x27;m going to pass it on to my boys since they have short hair, and I&#x27;ll feel great that they&#x27;re using a natural product!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo looking for a relatively cheap sulfate free shampoo and found this one. Despite the positive reviews, I didn&#x27;t expect to actually have such promising results! First off, there is a really rich lemony smell. I believe one reviewer described it as \\&quot;smelling like mop.\\&quot; In fact, it is very reminiscent to Pinesol. However, the scent really wears off once you lather and rinse your hair. I actually don&#x27;t mind it at all. I use another conditioner (but wish to try Aloe 80&#x27;s complimentary conditioner someday) and find it a must if you want to avoid tangly, dry hair.  I have thick, coarse, wavy hair but over a month&#x27;s time my hair&#x27;s felt significantly softer, shinier even. People were complimenting me, asking me if I got a new haircut/hairstyle and from where. It definitely worked with frizz control; my unruly curls transformed into wavy, manageable locks! I&#x27;ve never experienced this kind of impact from any shampoo. I strongly recommend it to all my friends, especially those who have the same hair consistency as I do. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch to another shampoo again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a lot less harsh than the other shampoos I had been using.  I still use a conditioner after, and wouldn&#x27;t call this perfect, but it is a step in the right direction.  The hair seems to retain a lot more natural oils after use, but also seems pretty clean.  I still try to avoid using it every day.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair prone to greasiness and sensitive skin, so shampoo has been a troublesome area for me since puberty. I had found an organic brand that didn&#x27;t make me break out but kept my hair clean, and then BB&amp;B stopped selling it. Darn! After running through various organic/sulfate-free labels, I think I&#x27;m satisfied with this one.   I need to wash my hair nearly every day, and this has done a fine job of keeping my hair clean without drying it out. It leaves no residues and is even able to tackle tough greasy spots left by sub-par shampoos, which I find impressive for an organic brand. Oh, and the smell is pretty nice, too.  You&#x27;ll get a sizeable bottle of shampoo with neat, professional packaging. The shampoo is translucent (not pearled), has a thin consistency, a light reddish/pinkish/peach color, and lathers well. If you need an organic brand that cleans thoroughly, buy this one.</li>
            <li> When I used this shampoo I noticed that my scalp became very flaky.  I have never had dry scalp problems until using this shampoo.  This shampoo went under my sink after being found guilty of causing instant dandruff!! I made the switch to Renpure&#x27;s body and shine shampoo, and that cured my dry scalp after a single use.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product for the first few months of using it. Then I noticed my hair becoming sort of heavier and less shiny. By the time I knew it, my hair- even after fully washing, fully rinsing, and blowdrying (air drying was worse) was completely greasy. I guess this stuff was too gentle for my hair! I recently started washing with baking soda and so far that does a much better job of cleaning my hair at a much cheaper rate!</li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered an untried organic shampoo.  Always trying new things..I was so impressed with the light,clean scent, and I shampoo with it daily.  My hair is soft and shiney. (I also use a creme rinse). My new best shampoo!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Both my wife and I were avid users of Aloe 80 conditioner (&amp; shampoo) -- NO MORE! The company decided to change the formula to include more \\&quot;natural ingredients\\&quot;... as they so claimed to me. The BIG problem is, their new formulation lost ALL of its \\&quot;functionality\\&quot; and is hence receiving EXTREMELY negative reviews from customers all over the internet... and rightly so! Having so much faith in their former products, I purchased several bottles of this \\&quot;newly-formulated\\&quot; conditioner and the \\&quot;newly-formulated\\&quot; shampoo. Both products were SO inferior to the original formulation, that I actually threw away ALL the full bottles of product! So, for the purpose of their claiming to use more \\&quot;natural ingredients\\&quot; than their original formulation, they&#x27;ve moved from almost 100% functionality to possibly 5% (or less) functionality, in my opinion... and then decided to almost double their price for it! What a \\&quot;great\\&quot; marketing decision! In other words, their new \\&quot;more natural\\&quot; formulation in the real world of customer product satisfaction is now \\&quot;worthless!\\&quot; Both the shampoo &amp; conditioner make your hair feel dry, rough, and unmanageable!... not smooth and manageable as the original formulation. Please, for your own sake... take my advice as a \\&quot;former\\&quot; \\&quot;Lily Of The Desert\\&quot; believer and supporter... do NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this \\&quot;newly-formulated\\&quot;, highly inferior product!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My scalp always gets itchy overnight. I thought it&#x27;s a shampoo problem, so I tried more natural shampoos. But this shampoo makes no difference at curing the itchiness.</li>
            <li> I needed to switch shampoos, because I had stuck with one for too long, without alternating brands. My hair was beginning to show it was worse for wear, too. It was sticky, my scalp itched terribly and it was not easily combed. For starters, I knew I needed a shampoo with not quite as many chemicals and weird ingredients/components added for shelf life. Many products off of the drugstore shelf contained synthetic ingredients I really probably shouldn&#x27;t have been putting in my hair and my system, to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Lily of the Desert Aloe 80 Organics Shampoo at my local natural foods store. I had read that lemon (one of the main ingredients) was very good for grease issues and the scalp, in addition to aloe, which is good for the skin, and rosemary, which smells amazing, and makes me feel more calm. The consistency of this shampoo is thick and transparent - more like gel than creme. It gets the job done, and you feel it cleansing without stripping your scalp and hair. Pair this with their conditioner, and you really add great scent and effective cleansing to your daily shampoo routine. I also noticed  that my hair is smoother, softer and easier to comb through. It also looks shiny and healthier. I am one happy customer.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, looking for a decent natural shampoo. The scent is pretty strong, reminiscent of Pine-Sol. It is pretty difficult to lather up and only works into a thin lather at best. Afterwards it leaves my hair and scalp feeling very dry and itchy, although very clean. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily hair... I love this shampoo. Smells great and no residue in my hair when I have had problems with tht in the past.</li>
            <li> Good suds, smells great. Feels very clean afterwords.</li>
            <li> I have dandruff, and this has made it worse.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, for some people, this might be a great shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients look pretty safe as far as I can tell.  And as a bonus, it is pretty cheap considering what is in it.&lt;br /&gt;And yes, it does seem to clean your hair well.  But if you have dry hair, and are looking for something organic, you may&lt;br /&gt;want to look at something that has a half decent concentration of tea tree oil in it.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product but the only concern is that I feel my hair is pretty dry after shampooing.  I might try to use conditioner and update my review.</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel strange.</li>
            <li> SHampoo smells good.. lathers Well. and is moisturizing. I can use it as soap also. Leaves my hair manageable. I think I&#x27;m going to explore other Lily of the Desert products now also.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Has ingredients as described and feels good after washing the hair. Great value for the price. If you are in Canada the shipping will cost you 2-3 times more than the product itself. So, to make it worth shipping you have to buy at list 3 items at once otherwise it is very expensive product to ship overall if you would like to try only one item or buy it with Conditioner - the same brand.</li>
            <li> This product may be good for your hair.  I don&#x27;t know, &#x27;cuz I haven&#x27;t used it enough to say.  But what I noticed the very first time I used it was how slippery it made to floor of my shower.  Very scarily slippery, as a matter of fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner contains Shea Butter and a lot of natural oils, which accounts for the fact that it&#x27;s very slick and makes anything it comes in contact w/ very slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE WITH GREAT CARE.</li>
