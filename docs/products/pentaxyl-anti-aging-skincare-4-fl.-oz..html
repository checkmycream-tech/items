            <li> Best product on the market for reducing wrinkles and lines. I have tried many others and can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> Buying for my friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pentaxyl for over 10 years and I love it, I&#x27;m 52 years old and evryone I meet thinks I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s, I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> Excellent product, bought it as a gift and got great compliments.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, great quality. Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it and purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have used Pentaxyl for a couple of years and really like it.</li>
            <li> One of the best face creams I have used in a long time.  I had a friend that bought this first and her skin always looks phenominal so I bought some too. It really is a great product.  I worked for Estee Lauder for many years and this rivals any of their top of the line products!</li>
            <li> My original bottle I bought on ebay, to try out.  Two years later, and lots of other brands I&#x27;ve tried, this still is hands down the best.And I cant live without it now. I am 42 pale skin, blond hair blue eyes, with wrinkles around my eyes, lips and one large crease between my eyes. This takes most of that away.&lt;br /&gt;I use DHC oil to clean my face, then moisturize with Pentaxyl, before I put my make up on. I have used similar products with Matrixyl and Arginine. But none work as well. I have tried, Merlot Night Cream, KInerase, Strivectin SD,Dermalogica, Baby face and Obagi, Clinique, and ROC.&lt;br /&gt;All are in my make up drawer collecting dust. I know the company Market America is a pyramid type thing, but after all I have been through to find the right moisturizer, I have to over look that.&lt;br /&gt;I can only hope that they go commercial.....It&#x27;s the best thing out there!!!</li>
            <li> did not do anything noticeable. Don&#x27;t think it worked.</li>
            <li> Best skin product ever! This product was recommended to me by a natural path and after 30 years I final have clear skin.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about two months and am seeing results, imperfections are fading such as sun spots, lines are diminishing and my skin feels more firm, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. Would definitely recommend as a preventive for all ages from late teens and up!</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past to repair scar damage from severe poison oak and you can not even see the area that&lt;br /&gt;was effected on my leg. Pentaxyl cause the scars to fade away. I am now using it to get rid of the scar from my knee surgery.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it takes it away but at least I know it will dull it significantly if not entirely. I have also used Pentaxyl on old scars and&lt;br /&gt;it faded them away also. AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> Good Product. Not bad! :</li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick. I have been using this for a long time. It definitely does remove wrinkles and age spots over time with regular use. Only a small amount is needed at a time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent products. I Use it morning and evening as my daily regimen and I saw result in about 45 days. I am using it on my face and neck (face because of the discoloration and neck because of the wrinkles). It&#x27;s an anti-aging creme which has done wonders for me. It helps me reduce the appearance of wrinkles, furrows and stretch marks. It&#x27;s an excellent products because there&#x27;s no other creme like this one. It&#x27;s the all-in-one beauty wonder treatment for radiant, youthful looking skin and it will work for you if you&#x27;re consistent.</li>
