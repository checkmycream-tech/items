            <li>BEST PART IS,</li>
            <li>SO IT IS A GREAT BUY!</li>
            <li>I ordered this because a friend was raving about how wonderful it was.</li>
            <li>Very good on the skin.</li>
            <li>It smells so good!  </li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, it&#x27;s a good line of products</li>
            <li>This product smells wonderful and a capful produces a nice amount of bubbles.</li>
            <li>Great product, I&#x27;ll purchase again and again.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>SO WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE GOOSE</li>
            <li>IS GOOD FOR THE GANDER...</li>
            <li>Surprising b/c</li>

            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Bubble Bath!</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees!  </li>
            <li>Nice to trust a brand that you know doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of toxic junk in it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT FITS THE BILL NICELY.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad to say that she&#x27;s able to use this bubble bath!  </li>
            <li>We love this bubble bath.</li>
            <li>My daughter kept saying \\&quot;more bubbles, more bubbles\\&quot;....</li>
            <li>We love Burts Bees products, so it&#x27;s no wonder that we love this baby bath.  </li>
            <li>Mr. bubbles cheaper and works way better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE BURTS BEE</li>
            <li>For now I&#x27;ll just say that I (cautiously) love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Now one of his favorite things to do is a &amp;#34;fun bath&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>WHICH, I AM DELIGHTED TO ANNOUNCE, IS QUITE GENTLE</li>
            <li>My daughter loves these bubbles :)  Very nice scent, barely can smell it.  </li>
            <li>This is a very gentle bubble bath that my kids love!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tolerate strong perfumey soaps.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s tear free, which is important for babies.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;d rather have my kids enjoy the bubbles than have stinging eyes.  </li>
            <li>We even checked we our post office and had it confirmed that it never got to our address.</li>
            <li>FOR EVERYTHING ELSE, SO SLIPPED IN A TEAR FREE BUBBLE BATH/HAIR WASH ITEM ON ONE OF MY ORDERS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on her sensitive skin and smells very nice and light.</li>
            <li>AND MY HAIR SQUEEKY CLEAN,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that mild.</li>
            <li>I love this for bathing our 3 year old twins.  </li>
            <li>We love this bubble bath, we&#x27;ve been using it since our oldest was around 1 year old.  </li>
            <li>gets easily irritated skin (very sensitive) -</li>
            <li>So, I take my chances now with numbing agents because all kids, young and old, love bubble baths!</li>
            <li>where he grabs his Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee Bubble Bath and squirts copious amounts into the water, which ends in huge mounds of soft, tear-free bubbles-</li>
            <li>THAT ONCE I WAS OVER THE PHOBIA OF GETTING SOAP IN MY EYES, I WAS ABLE TO MOOVE BACK UP TO THE &amp;#34;BIG GIRL&amp;#34; SHAMPOO WITH NO PROBLEM.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>we go through a bottle every two or three weeks, not because a small amount doesn&#x27;t go far, but because the resulting bubbles are so great, my son wants to do this every day!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s causing the dry patches, will update if I am able to confirm.  </li>
            <li>If you see lemongrass or lemon oil, chances are, it&#x27;s a very uncomofrtable product if accidentally in the eyes.  </li>
            <li>She really needed a gentle, exfoliating bubble bath.</li>
            <li>so much, I bought some for myself.</li>
            <li>However, I think that a cheap bottle from the local grocery store would have worked just as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it looked like a more natural alternative to my Disney bubble bath (it freaks me out to read about potential urinary problems with prolonged use etc).</li>
            <li>clean and is as terrific as their body wash and lotion.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s got all kinds of special soaps and is constantly checking labels of things on the off chance that she can find something that won&#x27;t make her all itchy.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter is older, but still loves bubbles</li>
            <li>just think the selling company is not a serious one.</li>
            <li>This product, though it smelled nice, had hardly any bubbles.</li>
            <li>it is very natural.  </li>
            <li>She may be a fully grown lady, but everyone likes a bubble bath once in awhile...and for those with sensitive skin, I suggest giving this a try!</li>
            <li>I like that Burt&#x27;s Bees uses all natural ingredients in their products, but I wish they would add a light natural sent such as lavender, honeysuckle or pomegranate for us &amp;#34;Adult&amp;#34; who like to take a relaxing bubble bath after a long day.</li>
            <li>I also like the natural ingrediants in it.  </li>
            <li>My 1 year old loves her bath time.</li>
            <li>The trick with the bubbles is to pour some into the cap then hold the cap directly under the running water.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend of mine who has ultra sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I just gave my three year old granddaughter a bath using Burt&#x27;s Bubble Bath.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE DEVELOPED A PENCHANT FOR GETTING SHAMPOO IN MY EYES WHILE RINSING MY HAIR...</li>
            <li>She loves the bubbles, it did not burn her eyes when she splash like crazy, her skin was very soft, and she smelled as good as the day she was born.  </li>
            <li>I have personally put other natural baby products in my own eyes after a terrible experience at bath time, learning only then that &amp;#34;natural organic baby&amp;#34; does not mean tear free.  </li>

            <li> I love this for bathing our 3 year old twins.  It smells heavenly, and and I like that it is very natural.  As for bubbles, my boys seem to think there are plenty!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these bubbles :)  Very nice scent, barely can smell it.  Very good on the skin. Definitely would recommend this.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, it&#x27;s a good line of products and it&#x27;s tear free, which is important for babies.  One thing I didn&#x27;t know until reading other peoples reviews is that the agent used to make something tearfree is a numbing agent, so keep that in mind.

So, I take my chances now with numbing agents because all kids, young and old, love bubble baths!</li>
            <li> We love this bubble bath. Our daughter is older, but still loves bubbles -and gets easily irritated skin (very sensitive) - but she doesn&#x27;t seem to react to this. So we buy it on Amazon (a little less than in the store - and saves a trip)</li>
            <li> My mom has Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome, an auto-immune disorder that dries out the skin. She really needed a gentle, exfoliating bubble bath. She also dilutes it with water and uses as a face cleanser. It&#x27;s that mild. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Bubble Bath!</li>
            <li> The reason i gave it 1 star is because i never got it. The supplier took money from my card and said they delivered it. And they never did!!! After contacting the company numerous times they still told me to look and our neighbors, garage or other places. We even checked we our post office and had it confirmed that it never got to our address. So it was a bitter experience.&lt;br /&gt;Only after filing a complaint on Amazon we were refunded.&lt;br /&gt;I just think the selling company is not a serious one.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful and a capful produces a nice amount of bubbles. My 1 year old loves her bath time.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it looked like a more natural alternative to my Disney bubble bath (it freaks me out to read about potential urinary problems with prolonged use etc). Well, it seems like all bubble baths have that potential. So I might as well stick to Disney. Why? This product, though it smelled nice, had hardly any bubbles. We went through it in like a week. My daughter kept saying \\&quot;more bubbles, more bubbles\\&quot;....but the bubbles just didn&#x27;t happen. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter.  She loves the bubbles and NO tears.</li>
            <li> We love Burts Bees products, so it&#x27;s no wonder that we love this baby bath.  Nice to trust a brand that you know doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of toxic junk in it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this bubble bath since my daughter (now 3) was born. It&#x27;s gentle on her sensitive skin and smells very nice and light. The trick with the bubbles is to pour some into the cap then hold the cap directly under the running water. We only use 3 capfuls and have lots of bubbles that stick around the entire bath!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine who has ultra sensitive skin.  She&#x27;s got all kinds of special soaps and is constantly checking labels of things on the off chance that she can find something that won&#x27;t make her all itchy.  Got this on a whim...it wasn&#x27;t very expensive, and I figure &amp;#34;hey, if it doesn&#x27;t work, she can give it to a friend.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to say that she&#x27;s able to use this bubble bath!  She may be a fully grown lady, but everyone likes a bubble bath once in awhile...and for those with sensitive skin, I suggest giving this a try!</li>
            <li> I just gave my three year old granddaughter a bath using Burt&#x27;s Bubble Bath.  It smells so good!  She loves the bubbles, it did not burn her eyes when she splash like crazy, her skin was very soft, and she smelled as good as the day she was born.  Great product, I&#x27;ll purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> what else can i say but that my grandson loves bubbles in the tub. lol</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tolerate strong perfumey soaps.  So I use Burt&#x27;s Baby Bee on my baby.  Their bubble bath&lt;br /&gt;rinses clean and is as terrific as their body wash and lotion.  And leaves baby smelling like apricots.&lt;br /&gt;I like Baby Bee so much, I bought some for myself.</li>
            <li> Baby bubble bath changed the entire dynamic of bath time.  Now we can&#x27;t get the kid out!  Great product.</li>
            <li> This does not work well at all and stinks I would rather use hyper allogenic Mr. bubbles cheaper and works way better.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN SHOWERING AND WASHING MY HAIR IN THE SHOWER FOR YEAR, BUT LATELY, IT SEEMS, I HAVE DEVELOPED A PENCHANT FOR GETTING SHAMPOO IN MY EYES WHILE RINSING MY HAIR...DANG IT!  SO, WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, I FELL BACK ON THE &amp;#34;NO TEARS&amp;#34; BABY STUFF. I LOVE BURTS BEE FOR EVERYTHING ELSE, SO SLIPPED IN A TEAR FREE BUBBLE BATH/HAIR WASH ITEM ON ONE OF MY ORDERS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT FITS THE BILL NICELY. GETS ME AND MY HAIR SQUEEKY CLEAN, ADD THE CONDITIONER FOR THE HAIR AND WE ARE ALL DONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST PART IS, THAT ONCE I WAS OVER THE PHOBIA OF GETTING SOAP IN MY EYES, I WAS ABLE TO MOOVE BACK UP TO THE &amp;#34;BIG GIRL&amp;#34; SHAMPOO WITH NO PROBLEM. AND I STILL HAVE THE GOOD SMELLING BURTS BEES BUBBLE BATH HANDY WHICH, I AM DELIGHTED TO ANNOUNCE, IS QUITE GENTLE ON SENIOR SKIN. SO WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS GOOD FOR THE GANDER...OR...THE BABY STUFF IS WELL FORMULATED TO HANDLE SENIOR NEEDS ALSO!!! SO IT IS A GREAT BUY!</li>
            <li> Something is giving my baby dry patches on his legs, flame retardant sleepers are the #1 suspect but we started using this about the same time... so I&amp;#34;m also a big suspicious of this bubble bath.  Surprising b/c I love Burt&#x27;s Bees!  I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s causing the dry patches, will update if I am able to confirm.  For now I&#x27;ll just say that I (cautiously) love this stuff.</li>
            <li> We love this bubble bath, we&#x27;ve been using it since our oldest was around 1 year old.  Now one of his favorite things to do is a &amp;#34;fun bath&amp;#34; where he grabs his Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee Bubble Bath and squirts copious amounts into the water, which ends in huge mounds of soft, tear-free bubbles- we go through a bottle every two or three weeks, not because a small amount doesn&#x27;t go far, but because the resulting bubbles are so great, my son wants to do this every day!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it was worth the money. The product alone is pretty expensive, and then paired with shipping, it&#x27;s pretty steep. I ordered this because a friend was raving about how wonderful it was. Overall, it does the job.. However, I think that a cheap bottle from the local grocery store would have worked just as well.</li>
