            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed great Clippers WAHL has always been an awesome product</li>
            <li>They work great on ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a barber, so I know a good deal about  clippers.  </li>
            <li>and this machine looks and feels good and sturdy out of the package.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a good sturdy product.</li>
            <li>For the price ...it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
            <li>After two successful easy to use trims,I can tell you that it&#x27;s a good do-it-myself clipper.</li>
            <li>BUT I was scared off by the feeling that I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to successfully shave my own head with it.</li>
            <li>The clippers also came with many scratches on the exterior.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s gets the job done.</li>
            <li>this is geared more to designs in the head instead of just a haircut.  </li>
            <li>Now, using a number 1 or 2 attachment whack off the top.  </li>
            <li>These clippers cut very easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>I purchased this with high hopes after reading some good reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used mine for years and it always works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it cuts my hair fine...</li>
            <li>If You  pay attention to your angle of attack and rate of feed you will get a smooth cut with no problemo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it anywhere as much as I planned when I first bought this, but it is a great working clipper and good attachments - especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The blade on this shaver cuts close and clean.  </li>
            <li>these were not bad for the price,  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the noise level is not bad.  </li>
            <li>The guards that came with the machine also don&#x27;t fit exactly right, they are made for clippers that are wider.</li>
            <li>If what you want is really short (but not completely bald) hair, this is perfect.  </li>

            <li>I went back to the old one that is still going strong after many years.</li>
            <li>also it gets really hot after 5 minutes of using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s standard width, I suppose, but it just didn&#x27;t seem like I would be able to manipulate it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thinking i would save 12 dollars each time for a haircut i bought this machine the first time i used it</li>

            <li>It gets warm (not hot) if you have it on for over 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>This 00 blade gives a much close cut than the regular 0 blade that comes with most clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These clippers are unbelievably loud and get very hot during the haircut.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This was replacing an older model, just don&#x27;t make them like they use to -</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t care much for loud noise and hotness then get one</li>
            <li>It was suppose to be a new product and it does not seem to be at all.</li>
            <li>You can barely read the brand \\&quot;WAHL\\&quot; on them since its scratched so much.</li>

            <li>This Clipper is OK it cuts hair at the weak hair area really good, but at the thick hair area is not the same quality  </li>

            <li>u can go to the barber shop and it could easilly be fixed.</li>
            <li>I use the closest 00 to bald myself completely.  </li>
            <li>do need to be careful when first using it because  this clipper comes with a 00 blade</li>
            <li>Use the 00 setting and cut a wide \\&quot;bowl\\&quot; swath all around as high as you want to go</li>
            <li>If you used the 1/2 setting on top it usually requires little to no blending.  </li>
            <li>If you want a hair clipper that would take the hair down to skin then get the Balding clippers as these are much like those regular clippers.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I bought this product thinking to save money on the barber but I should have just stuck with going to the barber. These clippers are unbelievably loud and get very hot during the haircut. My son was crying halfway through his haircut from the blades burning him. Also they only cut the hair in one direction. Bottom line, not a good product.</li>
            <li> These clippers cut very easily and smoothly. They work great on ethnic hair. I would recommend them to anyone who likes to keep their hair cut real short or bald.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a barber, so I know a good deal about  clippers.  these were not bad for the price,  they were solid,  but I would not recommend them for a barber shop.  For a barber shop I would rate it a three,  but for home use I would definitely rate it a five</li>
            <li> The clippers came with the wrong guards. I was suppose to get guard sizes #1-#5 but instead they sent me #1/2 - #4. Obviously the package was opened up and the guards were switched out. The guards that came with the machine also don&#x27;t fit exactly right, they are made for clippers that are wider. The clippers also came with many scratches on the exterior. You can barely read the brand \\&quot;WAHL\\&quot; on them since its scratched so much. It was suppose to be a new product and it does not seem to be at all. Is this comment box the only way of contacting this seller \\&quot;AMAZON LLC\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> This Clipper is OK it cuts hair at the weak hair area really good, but at the thick hair area is not the same quality  it took around 8 minutes to do it myself and this thing is very loud really loud, its noisy,  i used to use a german Moser clipper, this thing is 5 to 6 times louder than Moser. i&#x3D;also it gets really hot after 5 minutes of using. if you don&#x27;t care much for loud noise and hotness then get one</li>
            <li> If what you want is really short (but not completely bald) hair, this is perfect.  I&#x27;ve used mine for years and it always works fine.</li>
            <li> I got my item on time but its faulty. The shaver can be power on but its not able to cut. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I purchased this with high hopes after reading some good reviews. The Wahl name makes me think \\&quot;quality\\&quot; and this machine looks and feels good and sturdy out of the package. BUT I was scared off by the feeling that I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to successfully shave my own head with it. The prospect was daunting what with warnings about clipping the skin and the large number of not-needed attachments and the small width of the shaving head. It&#x27;s standard width, I suppose, but it just didn&#x27;t seem like I would be able to manipulate it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the fault is that my reaction to it was off-putting. Your feelings could well be different from mine. I&#x27;m just saying that if you are somewhat doubtful about doing the task yourself, then perhaps you aren&#x27;t ready for this type of machine. I sent it back and ordered a Remington Shortcut Clipper (SCC-100R) in spite of numerous reviews which complain about battery troubles. After two successful easy to use trims,I can tell you that it&#x27;s a good do-it-myself clipper. And if the battery fails to perform I&#x27;ll return it within the two-year&#x27;s manufacturer warranty for a replacement...or maybe not:&lt;br /&gt;on the Amazon info. page there&#x27;s was a note that this model is discontinued. I called the company and their rep. said he didn&#x27;t have any info on it being discontinued and it is in stock currently. I hope that Remington improves the battery system and keeps making it.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I use this hair cutting kit to cut hair of my 19 mo son. I have used it for about 2-3 months. Works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s gets the job done. I do have to go over my head at least twice to have my head evenly faded....But it&#x27;s a machine and machines do break down in a matter time (especially machines made in China) as I have owned at least 5 clippers in the past 10 years and they all haven broken down...Excluding this one, which I&#x27;m posting a review for.</li>
            <li> thinking i would save 12 dollars each time for a haircut i bought this machine the first time i used it it pulled my hair so bad my scalp was red, i had to shave my head. thinking i would have to adjust the settings i did mess around with it alittle bit and same thing, i think its remanufactured because the blades arent that sharp, just becareful test a area in wich u can go to the barber shop and it could easilly be fixed.</li>
            <li> How knew these were so inexpensive.  I don&#x27;t use it anywhere as much as I planned when I first bought this, but it is a great working clipper and good attachments - especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of cutting my hair to military standards.  Unfortunately, the blade isn&#x27;t thin like the Wahl Balding.  The packing shows haircut styles such as fades and high &#x27;n tight. And I assumed that the hair clipper would do that. But instead, it would leave about 1/8&amp;#34; of hair. Aside from the blade, it&#x27;s a quiet clipper with less vibrations. If you want a hair clipper that would take the hair down to skin then get the Balding clippers as these are much like those regular clippers.</li>
            <li> This item was never used by us. It came scratch up and not &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;. So I can&#x27;t tell you how it worked.</li>
            <li> Not the quality I was expecting.  This was replacing an older model, just don&#x27;t make them like they use to - this is geared more to designs in the head instead of just a haircut.  If all you want is something that will make designs, I guess this is it.  I went back to the old one that is still going strong after many years.</li>
            <li> The blade on this shaver cuts close and clean.  No more trips to the barber for me.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed great Clippers WAHL has always been an awesome product this  is no exception also made in the USA</li>
            <li> Ela cumpre exatamente o que é proposto. Material, construçao e acabamento sao bons. Eu a indico para quem quer raspar a cabeça em casa.</li>
            <li> This clipper won&#x27;t even come close to balding. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good sturdy product. Anyone who said it&#x27;s easy to cut yourself with this clipper is doing something wrong. I even tried and couldn&#x27;t do it. Also, It was missing some attachments. I notified the seller immediately and never heard back from them. Stir clear.</li>
            <li> I have owned and used this clipper at least once a week for over 5 years and it has served me well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get noisy if you don&#x27;t oil it occasionally.  Otherwise, the noise level is not bad.  It gets warm (not hot) if you have it on for over 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to be careful when first using it because  this clipper comes with a 00 blade and you can nick your self if you are careless.  If You  pay attention to your angle of attack and rate of feed you will get a smooth cut with no problemo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no attachments on the cutting head you can still adjust the cut with a lever from about 00 (balding) to a little over 1/2.  I use the closest 00 to bald myself completely.  It takes less than 4 minutes and I can do it without a mirror.  This 00 blade gives a much close cut than the regular 0 blade that comes with most clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to do a Marine style fade:  Use the 00 setting and cut a wide \\&quot;bowl\\&quot; swath all around as high as you want to go (you need a mirror for this) and then bald the bottom.  Now, using a number 1 or 2 attachment whack off the top.  Then take off all attachments and adjust to 1/2 and blend in the fade.  This takes some practice if you used a number 1 or 2.  If you used the 1/2 setting on top it usually requires little to no blending.  If you screw up just  cut it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My local barber charges $9 to do this.  Do it 3 times and it&#x27;s paid for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a bald look without the hassle of shaving this is the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the reason for this late review is because I was here looking for a replacement blade for my clipper but I&#x27;m not sure it even needs it.</li>
