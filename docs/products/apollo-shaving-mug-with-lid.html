            <li>Very light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my soap very fresh and looks great.</li>
            <li>Great for buffing clean &amp; placing underneath allowing for easy foaming with shaving brush..</li>
            <li>Nice bowl that looks great alongside my stainless steel razor and stand.</li>
            <li>It comes in a very cheap cardboard box that is supposed to look gift wrapped.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a very nice piece.</li>
            <li>but that is okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this bowl; it is the centerpiece of my shaving set in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>the led cud fit beater on the boll !</li>
            <li>so i could have one for all three of the soaps i use most.</li>
            <li>I received this product discounted price :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>great product and very durable.</li>
            <li>Top notch quality, the picture doesn&#x27;t do justice, it is more stainless steel look with a great luster and shine, not aluminumish as it looks in their picture.</li>
            <li>It looks more steel thanâ€‹ aluminium like it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li>Makes your bathroom look elegant.</li>
            <li>you for good item and fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large and sophisticated design than you think</li>
            <li>Very quality is good.</li>
            <li>Thanks for shaving bowl just received great and fast service and no problems thanks to all and will use again shaving bowl great for soap and keeps it altogether</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleanup is also easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to remove it when you need to by just pushing on the side of the shaving soap.</li>
            <li>The width of the bowl makes it easy to work up a lather using my shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Lathers up easily.</li>
            <li>beautiful ,made to last</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price; probably would have had buyers remorse as in the end</li>
            <li>In the light there&#x27;s lots of fine hairline scratches all over it.</li>
            <li>it looks cheap.  </li>
            <li>Found the bowl to be well made and constructed in a manner and of a material that made easy to keep clean and lather well.</li>
            <li>Great company to do business with and will use them again in the future</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and keep polished.</li>
            <li>My husband is thrilled with his new saving system.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner at this type of shaving, I purchased the bowl and apollo brush and razor stand, very solid with good weight.</li>
            <li>Okay, this is a decent shaving bowl that is stainless and works fine.  </li>
            <li>I will say it again the bowl had fine scratches on the outside of it not the top but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip: be sure to pour out excess wearer from bowl when finished shaving to keep the shaving soap from getting too soft.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>but now it has grown on me, specially because it is very practical.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed when I needed it  Super fast service.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewer expected, but for me it&#x27;s the perfect size and weight.</li>
            <li>Ok, my public service announcement is done and I have done my civic duty to save others money.  </li>
            <li>I guess you can do that with a coffee mug, but the extra room around the soap disk lets you maneuver the brush a bit better.</li>
            <li>One trick -- set it in a pan of water (surrounded by the hot water), put the puck of your choice in, and boil the water.</li>
            <li>Looks nice with my other supplies.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the result of my polishing it with the provided cloth; the scratches are in a steady distinct pattern as the result of machine polishing.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could make it even better is a little more weight.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s stainless), like my chrome plated one did.</li>
            <li>Then the bowl itself is very flimsy metal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really way over priced.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>; they sent a few follow up emails to see how I liked the item.  </li>
            <li>Had a issue with the first bowl, contacted the seller about it and received a quick reply, they dropped a new shipment and I received my new product two days later!</li>
            <li>This is not that old yellow Old Spice mug with the red plastic top my father had.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>opening is large enough to hold tabac and mitchell wool fat refills.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Big enough for the large shaving soaps.</li>
            <li>Because of the durability and ease of care when handing stainless steel, I expect this bowl to last for a very very long time.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s sturdy and spacious; an Art of Shaving soap drops right in and actually floats loosely inside (not the fault of Apollo obviously and not a big deal).  </li>

            <li> this &amp;#34;Apollo&amp;#34; branded stainless bowl is the identical bowl to the Schone sold here on Amazon that cost $6 less with Prime shipping as well!  </li>
            <li> I am shocked at the other good reviews for this item.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to review right now, since I&#x27;ve only had it a few days.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s like this, but for something new these small details affect the presentation.  </li>
            <li> Reason for my 4 stars only was due to price alone.  </li>
            <li> The soap sits at the bottom and has some room around it so that you can swirl a shaving brush and load the center and side bristles with soap.</li>
            <li> wet the bottom with 1/16 inch of water, place your soap in there while it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting from Apollo products .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall not really what I&#x27;m looking for .</li>
            <li> Will be used for other purposes. ^^</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s made of very thin stainless steel .</li>
            <li> Adds a bit of sparkle to a bland bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> little tip:</li>
            <li> Even came with a small polishing cloth.</li>
            <li> I had a wood container that was too shallow and hated getting the soap all around the edges or sides and having to clean and wipe that up.</li>
            <li> Initially I was not too crazy about the shape of this container</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> given as gift he really liked it</li>
            <li> Very nice. Great product.</li>
            <li> beautiful ,made to last</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a very nice piece. However, after a couple of weeks, it began to tarnish on the inside. The rust then starts to mix in with the soap. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to review right now, since I&#x27;ve only had it a few days. I&#x27;m hoping that it won&#x27;t rust out (it&#x27;s stainless), like my chrome plated one did.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I am shocked at the other good reviews for this item.  It&#x27;s $26 and has the look and feel of something that should cost five dollars.  I&#x27;m not joking.  It comes in a very cheap cardboard box that is supposed to look gift wrapped.  it looks cheap.  Then the bowl itself is very flimsy metal.  It&#x27;s really way over priced.</li>
            <li> Wish it had some type of non-slip coating on the bottom of the jar otherwise it works perfectly. I squeeze out my tube soaps into it so I can use my brush. Good price for the quality.</li>
            <li> Okay, this is a decent shaving bowl that is stainless and works fine.  I do wish it were a tad heavier duty but that is okay.  Now here is the CAVEAT for all to listen to closely.................this &amp;#34;Apollo&amp;#34; branded stainless bowl is the identical bowl to the Schone sold here on Amazon that cost $6 less with Prime shipping as well!  So save $6 and get the Schone one!  Ok, my public service announcement is done and I have done my civic duty to save others money.  I just picked up a Schone and they are the same in one!  Reason for my 4 stars only was due to price alone.  They should be identically priced in my estimation rather than $6 apart!</li>
            <li> Solid construction, don&#x27;t settle for anything else. Keeps my soap moist between shaves. I&#x27;m a beginner at this type of shaving, I purchased the bowl and apollo brush and razor stand, very solid with good weight. The lifetime warranty is what sold me. Very good products.</li>
            <li> Found the bowl to be well made and constructed in a manner and of a material that made easy to keep clean and lather well. The only thing that could make it even better is a little more weight.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold my shaving soap and to load my brush. I had a wood container that was too shallow and hated getting the soap all around the edges or sides and having to clean and wipe that up. Initially I was not too crazy about the shape of this container but now it has grown on me, specially because it is very practical. The soap sits at the bottom and has some room around it so that you can swirl a shaving brush and load the center and side bristles with soap. I guess you can do that with a coffee mug, but the extra room around the soap disk lets you maneuver the brush a bit better. I do make my lather in a separate bowl though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is also easy. Pour some water in there, swirl it around and pour it out. done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little tip: wet the bottom with 1/16 inch of water, place your soap in there while it&#x27;s wet and once it dries it will be suctioned to the bottom. It&#x27;s really easy to remove it when you need to by just pushing on the side of the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I love this bowl; it is the centerpiece of my shaving set in the bathroom. When polished well, this thing shines bright! It holds my puck with room to spare!</li>
            <li> Really nice product, you can feel the good quality.</li>
            <li> the led cud fit beater on the boll !</li>
            <li> Nice looking bowl. Gives class to your toiletries shelf.</li>
            <li> Thanks for shaving bowl just received great and fast service and no problems thanks to all and will use again shaving bowl great for soap and keeps it altogether</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap dish</li>
            <li> Really nice product. Fast delivery. Very light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my soap very fresh and looks great.</li>
            <li> Very quality is good. Will be used for other purposes. ^^</li>
            <li> This shaving bowl is attractive, functional and well made. Because of the durability and ease of care when handing stainless steel, I expect this bowl to last for a very very long time. The width of the bowl makes it easy to work up a lather using my shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Great product. Had a issue with the first bowl, contacted the seller about it and received a quick reply, they dropped a new shipment and I received my new product two days later! Works great and looks even better.</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition! Very nice quality.</li>
            <li> good bowl but a bit pricy</li>
            <li> Awesome shaving bowl. I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewer expected, but for me it&#x27;s the perfect size and weight. One trick -- set it in a pan of water (surrounded by the hot water), put the puck of your choice in, and boil the water. The puck melts and conforms to the bowl. Perfect bowl and looks great on the counter.</li>
            <li> Very nice - easy to store and work with. Looks great.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised. Quality and finish of the bowl and lid are nice. Even came with a small polishing cloth. Lathers up easily. Looks nice with my other supplies. Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> The bowl keeps my shaving soap from drying out between shaves. That&#x27;s why I bought it, and it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: be sure to pour out excess wearer from bowl when finished shaving to keep the shaving soap from getting too soft.</li>
            <li> Adds a bit of sparkle to a bland bathroom counter. Product arrived on time, no damage, and as described.</li>
            <li> My husband is thrilled with his new saving system.  The bowl is excellent quality,  looks good, and is a perfect fit for the shaving soap that I also purchased. Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the cloth that comes with it.. Great for buffing clean &amp; placing underneath allowing for easy foaming with shaving brush..</li>
            <li> beautiful piece, well crafted, even comes with a polishing cloth. Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Looks great on my vanity..</li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting from Apollo products . Returned this item do to manufacturing faults .&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made of very thin stainless steel . On the good side , the bowl is a nice size and has a good fitting lid .&lt;br /&gt;Overall not really what I&#x27;m looking for .</li>
            <li> Very light weight. opening is large enough to hold tabac and mitchell wool fat refills. looked so good i bought 3 so i could have one for all three of the soaps i use most.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.  Keeps my soap very fresh and looks great.  Fast delivery.  Great company to do business with and will use them again in the future</li>
            <li> I received this product discounted price :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for good item and fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large and sophisticated design than you think&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied lovable&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s located in my bathroom</li>
            <li> great product and very durable.</li>
            <li> Big enough for the large shaving soaps. Beautifully made and polished to a beautiful finish. Easy to clean and keep polished. Deep enough to keep the lather contained without spilling over the sides. Nothing to criticize.</li>
            <li> Quality product...nice size for the shelf</li>
            <li> Excellent Quality, the lid seals well, hence keeping the soap from drying out. I use it to store my shaving soap rather then using it as a lathering bowl. Top notch quality, the picture doesn&#x27;t do justice, it is more stainless steel look with a great luster and shine, not aluminumish as it looks in their picture.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It looks more steel thanâ€‹ aluminium like it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> I will say it again the bowl had fine scratches on the outside of it not the top but the bowl you ask for a response so i gave you a honest one not the one you want to here it&#x27;s just a shaving bowl...</li>
            <li> Just what I needed when I needed it  Super fast service.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied, very happy with quality.</li>
            <li> Beautify bowl.  Added a touch of class to my bathroom sink</li>
            <li> Nice appearance. Hubby has not used yet.</li>
            <li> Nice bowl that looks great alongside my stainless steel razor and stand. Bought it while on sale at the same price as the cheaper brands. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price; probably would have had buyers remorse as in the end it&#x27;s still just a bowl.</li>
            <li> Great customer service from the company itself; they sent a few follow up emails to see how I liked the item.  It&#x27;s a very nice looking polished metal shaving bowl that&#x27;s sturdy and spacious; an Art of Shaving soap drops right in and actually floats loosely inside (not the fault of Apollo obviously and not a big deal).  The bowl has a beautiful high-mirror finish; but that&#x27;s also where it looses some points.  In the light there&#x27;s lots of fine hairline scratches all over it. This isn&#x27;t the result of my polishing it with the provided cloth; the scratches are in a steady distinct pattern as the result of machine polishing. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just mine that&#x27;s like this, but for something new these small details affect the presentation.  Again, doesn&#x27;t affect the functionality and am still very happy with the bowl.</li>
            <li> WOW! The picture does not do this product justice. Cover fits well so soap stays moist. Makes your bathroom look elegant. This is not that old yellow Old Spice mug with the red plastic top my father had.</li>
