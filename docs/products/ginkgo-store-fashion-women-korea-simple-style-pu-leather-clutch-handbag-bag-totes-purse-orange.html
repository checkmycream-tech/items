            <li>Excellent bag for the money, and would get more in other colors.</li>
            <li>This bag was super cheap but looked great and was just the right size.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been great</li>
            <li>Gave this purse to my 6 year old great niece to play with the inside looked like a toy</li>
            <li>Sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li>Its a beautiful red color.</li>
            <li>red is beautiful....</li>
            <li>but the inside fabric is cheap.</li>
            <li>it is so cheap and the inside is even cheaper plastic</li>
            <li>you can fit a lot of stuff inside of it</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought another color.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, Cheap don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li>I liked this purse so much</li>
            <li>Great for that occasional use.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Really cheap looking.</li>
            <li>Was hoping to be happy being that I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the other 2</li>
            <li>smaller than i thought but very nice</li>
            <li>I originally purchased to replace a bag that held file folders.</li>
            <li>worth the price !</li>
            <li>Super cheap price that belies the quality of this bag.</li>
            <li>I wanted a nice red handbag and I love this bag.</li>
            <li>Love the inside pocket for my smart phone.</li>
            <li>Bonus is that this one looks good enough to carry to the office, too.</li>
            <li>Good red color.</li>
            <li>and I direct them to Amazon to purchase their own.</li>
            <li>For the price, though, you really can&#x27;t ask more.    </li>
            <li>It is nice for the price but the liner is flimsy and LOUD aka crinkly.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have been bigger, but it&#x27;s still a good size.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; also started scratching and tearing up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Super value for the money.</li>
            <li>This purse goes perfect with a red dress that I purchased and matches it like they were made out of thy4e same dye lot.</li>
            <li>- The bag has lot of room, it looks very pretty and has been super convenient.</li>
            <li>made, nice leather, interior is better than expected, I think it is a smart purchase!</li>
            <li>For the price, it is a great little bag.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a red purse for a while and couldn&#x27;t find one in stores that I liked.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, if you can be patient it is worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the red one and the color is nice.</li>
            <li>use this back to work and it looks nice.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore my little purse, its cute, very convenient pockets and simply adorable and girly!!</li>
            <li>Sturdy handles and magnetic closures make this right sized bag a summertime winner.</li>
            <li>it is just right for an evening at the mall or any occassion.</li>
            <li>I wanted a red bag and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, since this would not be an everyday day bag; perfect choice!</li>
            <li>This item shipped from china, but came very fast.</li>
            <li>I personally would have liked a pocket on the outside too to keep my phone for easy access.</li>
            <li>This tote is Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The outside is okay</li>
            <li>but it is more of a darker red color.</li>
            <li>However, I do love the red!!</li>
            <li>it is ok the inner parts not what i expect thought</li>
            <li>I love this purse, but after carrying it daily for just over a year, the handles have started cracking and one of the straps is pulling away from the body of the purse.  </li>
            <li>it is not expensive bag</li>
            <li>On my first day using it</li>
            <li>Use it to carry many of my personal items, my phone and my tablet.  </li>
            <li>Love the striped lining and overall size.  </li>
            <li>The color is the same as what it is in the picture and seems ok.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like advertise.  </li>
            <li>Love these purses, this is the second one I have bought.  </li>
            <li>The color is hot, so you automatically keep your eye on your purse.  </li>
            <li>It has a crackly lining but also sturdy and a brown and white band around the top of the lining that clashes and is very visible.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new red purse!</li>
            <li>If you like the color red; you will love this vivid shade in a handbag.</li>
            <li>What a nice little surprise.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the low price scare you in missing out on this great bag.</li>
            <li>it is really a joke in my opinion</li>
            <li>For the price of this bag I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much.  </li>
            <li>Very fashionable.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I would miss having a shoulder strap.  </li>
            <li>Medium size but roomy and has a very well structured shape.</li>
            <li>The straps are a little smaller than I thought but other than that the bag is great!</li>
            <li>Better quality than more expensive bags</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this bag.</li>
            <li>I am a purse horder, love the little handle bags and love that I can change  colors everyday.  </li>
            <li>For the money I paid I got it very quickly and looks more expensive than it was.</li>
            <li>The purse is big enough to fit a tablet, phone, a book, waterbottle and is wide to store items comfortably.  </li>
            <li>but the outside of the purse is uneven, the zippers don&#x27;t zip all the way, the inside of the pocket were it is supposed to have a pocket is sewn with very cheap thread.</li>
            <li>I can fit everything I need in this little treasure</li>
            <li>The inner zippered centered pocket doesn&#x27;t really divide the purse into 2 halves.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly  surprised  </li>
            <li>They are surprised at my answer.</li>
            <li>I will say I viewed at least 20 or more handbags before I ordered this one</li>
            <li>This is so classy looking</li>
            <li>Initially the zipper on the middle pocket was a bit sticky but after opening/closing a few times it now glides very easily.</li>
            <li>Getting my orders quickly has spoiled me, so I was a little surprised at the time it took to ship (two weeks)</li>
            <li>A cheap, small, plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry about the size it is large enough to hold your basic needs: wallet, cosmetic bag, cell phone, and keys.</li>
            <li>This new review VOIDS the prior one.</li>
            <li>Overall the bag is nice, a little different than expected.  </li>
            <li>Really like this bag, the handles were a little too short, but, i can live with that.</li>
            <li>The red is a true little red wagon red.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough for necessities but small enough to be used in both a professional and fun way</li>

            <li> Was hoping to be happy being that I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the other 2</li>
            <li> smaller than i thought but very nice</li>

            <li> Bonus is that this one looks good enough to carry to the office, too.</li>
            <li> Good red color.</li>
            <li> and I direct them to Amazon to purchase their own.</li>
            <li> For the price, though, you really can&#x27;t ask more.    </li>
            <li> It is nice for the price but the liner is flimsy and LOUD aka crinkly.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have been bigger, but it&#x27;s still a good size.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; also started scratching and tearing up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Super value for the money.</li>
            <li> This purse goes perfect with a red dress that I purchased and matches it like they were made out of thy4e same dye lot.</li>
            <li> - The bag has lot of room, it looks very pretty and has been super convenient.</li>
            <li> made, nice leather, interior is better than expected, I think it is a smart purchase!</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a great little bag.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a red purse for a while and couldn&#x27;t find one in stores that I liked.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, if you can be patient it is worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the red one and the color is nice.</li>
            <li> use this back to work and it looks nice.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore my little purse, its cute, very convenient pockets and simply adorable and girly!!</li>
            <li> Sturdy handles and magnetic closures make this right sized bag a summertime winner.</li>
            <li> it is just right for an evening at the mall or any occassion.</li>
            <li> I wanted a red bag and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, since this would not be an everyday day bag; perfect choice!</li>
            <li> This item shipped from china, but came very fast.</li>
            <li> I personally would have liked a pocket on the outside too to keep my phone for easy access.</li>
            <li> This tote is Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The outside is okay</li>
            <li> but it is more of a darker red color.</li>
            <li> However, I do love the red!!</li>
            <li> it is ok the inner parts not what i expect thought</li>
            <li> I love this purse, but after carrying it daily for just over a year, the handles have started cracking and one of the straps is pulling away from the body of the purse.  </li>
            <li> it is not expensive bag</li>
            <li> On my first day using it</li>
            <li> Use it to carry many of my personal items, my phone and my tablet.  </li>
            <li> Love the striped lining and overall size.  </li>
            <li> The color is the same as what it is in the picture and seems ok.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like advertise.  </li>
            <li> Love these purses, this is the second one I have bought.  </li>
            <li> The color is hot, so you automatically keep your eye on your purse.  </li>
            <li> It has a crackly lining but also sturdy and a brown and white band around the top of the lining that clashes and is very visible.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new red purse!</li>
            <li> If you like the color red; you will love this vivid shade in a handbag.</li>
            <li> What a nice little surprise.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the low price scare you in missing out on this great bag.</li>
            <li> it is really a joke in my opinion</li>
            <li> For the price of this bag I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much.  </li>
            <li> Very fashionable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I would miss having a shoulder strap.  </li>
            <li> Medium size but roomy and has a very well structured shape.</li>
            <li> The straps are a little smaller than I thought but other than that the bag is great!</li>
            <li> Better quality than more expensive bags</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this bag.</li>
            <li> I am a purse horder, love the little handle bags and love that I can change  colors everyday.  </li>
            <li> For the money I paid I got it very quickly and looks more expensive than it was.</li>
            <li> The purse is big enough to fit a tablet, phone, a book, waterbottle and is wide to store items comfortably.  </li>
            <li> but the outside of the purse is uneven, the zippers don&#x27;t zip all the way, the inside of the pocket were it is supposed to have a pocket is sewn with very cheap thread.</li>
            <li> I can fit everything I need in this little treasure</li>
            <li> The inner zippered centered pocket doesn&#x27;t really divide the purse into 2 halves.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly  surprised  </li>
            <li> They are surprised at my answer.</li>
            <li> I will say I viewed at least 20 or more handbags before I ordered this one</li>
            <li> This is so classy looking</li>
            <li> Initially the zipper on the middle pocket was a bit sticky but after opening/closing a few times it now glides very easily.</li>
            <li> Getting my orders quickly has spoiled me, so I was a little surprised at the time it took to ship (two weeks)</li>
            <li> A cheap, small, plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about the size it is large enough to hold your basic needs: wallet, cosmetic bag, cell phone, and keys.</li>
            <li> This new review VOIDS the prior one.</li>
            <li> Overall the bag is nice, a little different than expected.  </li>
            <li> Really like this bag, the handles were a little too short, but, i can live with that.</li>
            <li> The red is a true little red wagon red.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough for necessities but small enough to be used in both a professional and fun way</li>
            <li> Bag looks like an expensive leather bag and this price is super!</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I expected..</li>
            <li> I expected bigger one.</li>
            <li> It has a zipper compartment in the middle and one on the side (inside) with two pockets to accommodate your phone and glasses on the other side (inside).  </li>
            <li> Not too deep so that I can&#x27;t find little things that have settled to the bottom.</li>
            <li> I also ordered pink color and gave it to my friend..</li>
            <li> Is not a Large tote.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t attach to the bottom and so items can float from one side to the other under the zippered center pocket.</li>
            <li> She wears a little pink cap and carries her pink bag.</li>
            <li> this bag is not worth $2</li>
            <li> I have another like it in black, so I&#x27;ll plan on getting another one in a year.  </li>
            <li> I bought a black one too but haven&#x27;t used it yet.  </li>
            <li> I just dont like the odd smell.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead walking down the street with it</li>
            <li> Only couple comments -- the handles are small and so it is hard to put it on the shoulder.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy little tote.  </li>
            <li> Have bought 5 of these little bags.  </li>
            <li> I carry it everyday.  </li>
            <li> But it can work to take around some small items.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would give it as the birthday gift that I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> I will probably order a black one too!!</li>
            <li> They should be at least 2 inches longer.  </li>
            <li> I thought this bad would be bigger.</li>
            <li> I figured for $10.00 how could I go wrong?</li>
            <li> The bottom (inside) is a bit awkward where they&#x27;ve pieced the lining together but not a problem.  </li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in size and i nterior of purse tacky looking.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great looking purse.  I get tons of compliments and I love the feel of the leather.</li>
            <li> Super cheap price that belies the quality of this bag. For $15 I should buy every color. Anyway, I was looking for a bag I could grab and go. Bonus is that this one looks good enough to carry to the office, too. Sturdy handles and magnetic closures make this right sized bag a summertime winner.</li>
            <li> What a nice little surprise. This tote is Exactly as described. The quality, for the price, is great.  I can fit everything I need in this little treasure and it&#x27;s adorable and easy to carry.  Getting my orders quickly has spoiled me, so I was a little surprised at the time it took to ship (two weeks) but, I can still remember when a 6-8 week wait was the norm.  I would definitely recommend this. NOTE: Save yourself some time and order one in every color you like!</li>
            <li> The outside is okay but the inside fabric is cheap. I&#x27;ll be re-gifting that! Save your money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> Great size and color!</li>
            <li> The quality for the price is excellent! I LOVE the rich color and the beautiful lining! Longer handles would have made this a five-star handbag; cannot put it on my shoulder. I originally purchased to replace a bag that held file folders. This one doesn&#x27;t however it helped me realize that I don&#x27;t need to carry so many anyway! LOL! I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it!</li>
            <li> I love this bag it is just right for an evening at the mall or any occassion. I love the Color it&#x27;s. Sturdy and strong. I just love it</li>
            <li> Overall I like this purse.  It has a zipper compartment in the middle and one on the side (inside) with two pockets to accommodate your phone and glasses on the other side (inside).  The bottom (inside) is a bit awkward where they&#x27;ve pieced the lining together but not a problem.  I&#x27;ve carried it for about a month now and it shows no signs of wear.  I&#x27;d buy it again or for a friend.  Love the bright colors.  My sister has it in blue which caught my eye and she told me where to get it.  I wish it had one or two pockets on the outside...possibly on the ends.  That&#x27;s what my favorite purses have...I love to keep my phone and sunglasses in them.</li>
            <li> This handbag is terrific. It&#x27;s jazzy and perfect for work or play. Has good room for all my stuff and then some. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bag looks like an expensive leather bag and this price is super! Good red color. Could use a heavier duty zipper.</li>
            <li> lovedit !! great gift.</li>
            <li> smaller than i thought but very nice</li>
            <li> I am just loving these handbags. I now have four and want one on every color.</li>
            <li> this bag is not worth $2 it is so cheap and the inside is even cheaper plastic it is really a joke in my opinion I wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead walking down the street with it</li>
            <li> I have already had to get another purse because the handles tore away from the sides of the purse.  The &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; also started scratching and tearing up quickly.  It was a wonderful price, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a minimalist but needed a slightly bigger bag than I was carrying. This bag is perfect - perfect length, perfect color, and love the middle zip pocket and snap closure side areas! Initially the zipper on the middle pocket was a bit sticky but after opening/closing a few times it now glides very easily. I get so many compliments on the bag and I direct them to Amazon to purchase their own. It&#x27;s been a great addition and fulfilled my needs!</li>
            <li> The purse it very cheaply made and the stitching is coming undone. The color was not what it was like in the picture. I thought the color was more of a salmon color but it is more of a darker red color. I gave the purse away to my grandmother.</li>
            <li> I love this bag and have received loads of compliments.  A friend recommended to me and I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Better quality than more expensive bags</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new red purse! It&#x27;s very sturdy and has the perfect amount of pockets. I would recommend and will definitely buy from again!</li>
            <li> On time delivery.  Prettier than the photo.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. A cheap, small, plastic bag. But it can work to take around some small items.</li>
            <li> Great color it is a nice addition to my purse collection  you can fit a lot of stuff inside of it</li>
            <li> Overall the bag is nice, a little different than expected.  Not sure if I would give it as the birthday gift that I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> Lots of room inside and the purse looks nicer than it should for the price.  I would like the interior pocket to be deeper and connect to the bottom of the bag.  The biggest issue is the straps.  They should be at least 2 inches longer.  I can only carry this in my hand, briefcase style.  I wanted something to wear on my elbow.  The red is a true little red wagon red.</li>
            <li> Lots of room and pockets. Ordered yellow also. Its a beautiful red color. Sturdy and durable. I love the sripes on the inside.</li>
            <li> For the price of this bag I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much.  Surprisingly, I love this bag.  It&#x27;s cute, it&#x27;s lightweight, it has a divider&lt;br /&gt;to put keys, lip gloss, etc.  I liked it so much I bought another color.  Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE BAG, ITS NOT TOTALLY BIG ENOUGH FOR ME, I CARRY IT WHEN I&amp;#34;M  WEARING RED. I LIKE THE HANDLES.</li>
            <li> I love this handbag...I was looking for a red purse for a while and couldn&#x27;t find one in stores that I liked.  I figured for $10.00 how could I go wrong? I carry it everyday.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Cheap, Cheap don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments on this puse</li>
            <li> This purse took approximately 4 weeks to arrive; however, shipping was free.  Nevertheless, if you can be patient it is worth the wait.  It is the perfect size for me, and appears to be well made.  If it holds up well, I will order another one in another color.  However, I do love the red!!</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I expected..</li>
            <li> The perfect red! Great size. Super value for the money. I wanted a red bag and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, since this would not be an everyday day bag; perfect choice! Looks great with my jeans and dress clothes. Don&#x27;t let the low price scare you in missing out on this great bag.</li>
            <li> This purse goes perfect with a red dress that I purchased and matches it like they were made out of thy4e same dye lot. Lots of room&lt;br /&gt;Martha</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy little tote.  Mine is orange.  Kind of a sherbet color of orange.  It has a crackly lining but also sturdy and a brown and white band around the top of the lining that clashes and is very visible.</li>
            <li> I like the purse. I ordered the red one and the color is nice. Only couple comments -- the handles are small and so it is hard to put it on the shoulder. The bag has to be carried in the hand by the handles. The inner zippered centered pocket doesn&#x27;t really divide the purse into 2 halves. It doesn&#x27;t attach to the bottom and so items can float from one side to the other under the zippered center pocket. This item shipped from china, but came very fast. The purse is big enough to fit a tablet, phone, a book, waterbottle and is wide to store items comfortably.  I personally would have liked a pocket on the outside too to keep my phone for easy access.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week since I bought this bag. So far it&#x27;s been great - The bag has lot of room, it looks very pretty and has been super convenient. Works great for the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore my little purse, its cute, very convenient pockets and simply adorable and girly!!</li>
            <li> Good quality bag. Very fashionable.</li>
            <li> This bag was super cheap but looked great and was just the right size.</li>
            <li> I  recently  purchased 3 Ginkgo Sotre Fashion Women Korean Simple PU leather  clutch handbag  bag,  Pleasantly  surprised  at  the  quality of  my  purchases. They  came in  several  different  colors, price  is a  bargain  for  the  value. My purchases are  for  gifts, and I  know  the  recipients  will be  pleased  with  their  handbags.  I  will not  hesitate  to  order  from  this  seller again. Shipped  on  schedule, nice  selection of  colors, priced  right!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lainiep12</li>
            <li> it is ok the inner parts not what i expect thought but it works on what i want. worth the price !</li>
            <li> I bought 4 handbags of the same style, different colors to go with different moods.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much I would miss having a shoulder strap.  That is why it gets 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this purse, but after carrying it daily for just over a year, the handles have started cracking and one of the straps is pulling away from the body of the purse.  I have another like it in black, so I&#x27;ll plan on getting another one in a year.  For the price, though, you really can&#x27;t ask more.    Amended:  I have just learned the purse and practically all of the ones here are made in China.  I am boycotting, as much as possible, things made in China.  I will NOT be buying another one like this or any if they are made in China.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to start making my own.  It&#x27;s good I can crochet and sew.</li>
            <li> I love this handbag, it is so nicely made. Several of my friends have asked me where I purchased it from and what was the cost. They are surprised at my answer. I will say I viewed at least 20 or more handbags before I ordered this one and I am so happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> I thought this bad would be bigger. It is nice for the price but the liner is flimsy and LOUD aka crinkly.</li>
            <li> Really like this bag, the handles were a little too short, but, i can live with that.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in size and i nterior of purse tacky looking. I guess i thought would be larger. Gave it away</li>
            <li> use this back to work and it looks nice. I can use this for every day and sometimes on the weekends</li>
            <li> This is a great purse. It has just enough compartments to keep glasses, phone, keys, and a zip up pocket for make-up! It is just perfect and I love the color.</li>
            <li> it is not expensive bag so it is go to anywhere bag.. love it.  I also ordered pink color and gave it to my friend.. she loves it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I got it.  It doesn&#x27;t look like leather but at this price I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  I am very pleased with it, however.  It is roomy and has handy pockets.</li>
            <li> Not leather but so cute. My mom now has it in three colors and receives compliments all the time. They know her as the &amp;#34;lady in pink&amp;#34; at her oncologist office. She wears a little pink cap and carries her pink bag. Also purchased or her in red and blue. She loves them all</li>
            <li> The straps are a little smaller than I thought but other than that the bag is great! I love it.. On my first day using it i got a ton of compliments! For the money I paid I got it very quickly and looks more expensive than it was.</li>
            <li> I love this purse!  Perfect size!!  I bought a black one too but haven&#x27;t used it yet.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Use it to carry many of my personal items, my phone and my tablet.  Not too deep so that I can&#x27;t find little things that have settled to the bottom. Love the inside pocket for my smart phone.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and nicely lined inside, if you like a &amp;#34;tote&amp;#34; style bag that doesn&#x27;t close. Excellent bag for the money, and would get more in other colors.</li>
            <li> Have bought 5 of these little bags.  For $8 they are perfect.  I am a purse horder, love the little handle bags and love that I can change  colors everyday.  Works for me</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I thought</li>
            <li> The bag is a great size. I don&#x27;t like the liner on the inside and I don&#x27;t like how short the straps are. Its good for the price though.</li>
            <li> Very handy purse, not a hug size, but holds a lot.  Love the striped lining and overall size.  May get another color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  It has plastic in all the inside and look very cheap. At the picture looks different but when I saw it I gave it away.  This new review VOIDS the prior one.</li>
            <li> All 4 of the bottom buttons all fell of within the frist week,  the lining has already began to tear .</li>
            <li> This is so classy looking and I love the way it feels carrying it.  I recommend this to be a must have</li>
            <li> If you like the color red; you will love this vivid shade in a handbag.Don&#x27;t worry about the size it is large enough to hold your basic needs: wallet, cosmetic bag, cell phone, and keys. The quality of the handbag is very good, the handles appear sturdy,the interior is light colored, shiny and very feasible.Considering the price of this handbag you will probably want more than one. The hardest decision is which shade; since their are so many beautiful colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> I received my purse yesterday. Was hoping to be happy being that I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the other 2 I had already purchased.&lt;br /&gt;The red is beautiful....but the outside of the purse is uneven, the zippers don&#x27;t zip all the way, the inside of the pocket were it is supposed to have a pocket is sewn with very cheap thread. You definitely get what you pay for-</li>
            <li> I like the style of the purse and the color of course. The zipper isn&#x27;t the best or stronger; it gets stuck often.</li>
            <li> I liked this purse so much I also bought a blue one.  Bought with a gift certificate given as a birthday gift.  At a bargain price!</li>
            <li> I expected bigger one. The color is the same as what it is in the picture and seems ok. I just dont like the odd smell. But for the price i paid it is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like advertise.  Like this a lot.</li>
            <li> Really a cute purse.  Is not a Large tote.  Lovely striped lining.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!  Love these purses, this is the second one I have bought.  Great for that occasional use.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price.  It&#x27;s big enough for necessities but small enough to be used in both a professional and fun way</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL HAND BAGS I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a great little bag.  The color is hot, so you automatically keep your eye on your purse.  Definitely not for the runway,  but perfect for running out to get groceries!</li>
            <li> Gave this purse to my 6 year old great niece to play with the inside looked like a toy</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice red handbag and I love this bag. Medium size but roomy and has a very well structured shape. I will probably order a black one too!! I highly recommend this bag.</li>
            <li> Cheap. Not leather. Really cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Quality is superb and price is very good for my credit card  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Well made, nice leather, interior is better than expected, I think it is a smart purchase!</li>
            <li> I ordered this bag just because i didn&#x27;t have a red bag to go with my red shoes.  I thought it would have been bigger, but it&#x27;s still a good size.</li>
