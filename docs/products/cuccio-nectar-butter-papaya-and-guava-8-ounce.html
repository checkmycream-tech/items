            <li>so like I said.. make your own conclusion.</li>
            <li>This stuff is nice.  </li>
            <li>I like Epicuren better.</li>
            <li>This is the MOST hydrating lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>My favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this butter.</li>
            <li>I was already familiar with the product and needed more.  </li>
            <li>This absorbs beautifully and leaves my hands feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and silky without being overly greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky going on and light, absorbing easily.  </li>
            <li>I like a pretty strong smelling lotion</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re all delightfully mild.</li>
            <li>but this one is super mild.</li>
            <li>This is a nice thick cream- very good for dry hands.  </li>
            <li>Goes on nicely, smells good, doesn&#x27;t work for dry skin as well as other products.  </li>
            <li>My daddy first gave me my first jar</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot be without it!</li>
            <li>The texture of this body butter is exactly that, butter.</li>
            <li>First off, the smell of this lotion is very plastic.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a tad bit sticky if too much is used</li>
            <li>This product is absorbed into the skin almost instantly.</li>
            <li>I think the other one will be fine.</li>

            <li>I was able to find this cheaper on line than what I had paid for in the past.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>how it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>My skin gets pretty dry living in Arizona</li>
            <li>Plus I live in Colorado, which is high altitude and dry air.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not left with that oily feeling and yet your skin feels soft and pliable.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is great! I use it every night and it has improved the condition of my hands and cuticles 100% I live in a very dry climate and my hands always looked dry and scaly - no more. This product really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this butter since my manicurist gave me a jar for Christmas.  It&#x27;s silky going on and light, absorbing easily.  I was so happy to find it at Amazon and happy to see it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> First off, the smell of this lotion is very plastic. Also, when you use the lotion it gets chunky and rolls into balls that flake off. It does not moisturize whatsoever. I will never buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, smells good, doesn&#x27;t work for dry skin as well as other products.  I like Epicuren better.</li>
            <li> My daddy first gave me my first jar and then I have been purchasing-LOVE this product</li>
            <li> The smell is great, I like the texture and how it makes my skin soft. When applied but it&#x27;s a tad bit sticky if too much is used but once it soaks in it does a great job at softening.</li>
            <li> This product is absorbed into the skin almost instantly. You&#x27;re not left with that oily feeling and yet your skin feels soft and pliable. I&#x27;ve tried three different smells and they&#x27;re all delightfully mild.</li>
            <li> The product is great, I have used it before and the seller was prompt in getting the product mailed. I was able to find this cheaper on line than what I had paid for in the past.  However, I paid over $9.00 for this product..and when I received the product it had price tags of $6.00.  I contact the seller and they said it was the wholesale price.  I think the seller made a mistake and should have removed the tags.. so like I said.. make your own conclusion.</li>
            <li> I was already familiar with the product and needed more.  This was the only place I could find to get it.</li>
            <li> This is the MOST hydrating lotion I have ever used.  My esthetician introduced me to it several years ago and I was immediately hooked!  I am in my late 50&#x27;s and especially like to use it on my neck and hands.  I absolutely cannot be without it!</li>
            <li> The texture of this body butter is exactly that, butter. It&#x27;s smooth and silky without being overly greasy. My skin gets pretty dry living in Arizona and I&#x27;m constantly needing lotion. This absorbs beautifully and leaves my hands feeling super soft. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is the scent. I like a pretty strong smelling lotion but this one is super mild. So if that&#x27;s what you prefer this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works for me.  Plus I live in Colorado, which is high altitude and dry air.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without this body butter.  Additionally it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave one feeling greasy.  I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This is a nice thick cream- very good for dry hands.  My cuticles tend to get very dry &amp; are helped by rubbing this into them a couple times a day.  It makes my hands very soft.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent. Will buy forever.</li>
            <li> Before opening either container I noticed that one was a lighter peach color than the other and seemed \\&quot;runnier\\&quot; in moving the container. The seals on both containers were broken. The lighter color one smells like oil when it gets rancid. I think the other one will be fine. If I could find this product in a store I would not be ordering it on line. This is a hastle and I don&#x27;t need one more hastle! Can I return the bad one or am I going to get stuck paying shipment and handling charges for inferior quality product? So you congratulate me for posting a review and do not address the dissatisfaction or offer an answer or solution??? Wow! How wonderful!!!!!</li>
            <li> Thought this was a face lotion, but is for the hands and body</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice.  You feel softer within hours.  My husband even likes it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this butter. I use it every night before bed. It smells so good and it lasts on my skin until morning. I would recommend!</li>
