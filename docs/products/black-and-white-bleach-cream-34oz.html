    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful product I woll bu</li>
            <li>Price very good.</li>
            <li>This was a great price &amp; I&#x27;ve used it 3 nights and seen a difference  already.</li>
            <li>I have had no reaction and it works great.</li>
            <li>Good timing too.</li>
            <li>I have used this since I was a kid and have always loved te results.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, where are the good ratings coming from?</li>
            <li>The results were  amazing</li>
            <li>This product while it may have side effects has been effective for me</li>
            <li>There are a lot of products out there that claim to do this kind of thing</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>, I wish I can tell you more add my kik for more: siater23tay</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I see no difference on skin for light age spots.</li>
            <li>Most is absorbed into my skin the morning, and I just wipe of the excess in the morning.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s hella cheap.</li>
            <li>I only use the cream once a day instead of the recommended twice a day because of some irritation I experienced on my cheeks(strangely just my cheeks even though i applied some to my chin and forehead area as well).</li>
            <li>This particular product works great if you have the ability to keep putting it on like it should be; You just have to have a set schedule I suppose... my life is too hectic to get in a certain routine.</li>
            <li>This stuff right here works!</li>
            <li>Love how fast it works.</li>
            <li>It took some time, but I would say in about two weeks of faithful use I could really start seeing my face look brighter and had a better skin texture also</li>
            <li>I wash my face good with REALLY warm water,to open my pores, and pat it moist, but not dry.  </li>
            <li>My mistake was that I continued to pop pimples making more scars ( I know young and dumb).Overall</li>
            <li>so you have to decide if its worth the risk to you.</li>
            <li>too small, but works great</li>
            <li>On the left side of the face (right where the sun hits us as we drive, good endorsement to always wear sun screen) there was a pesky sun spot that would have required a few more go backs to the dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>In which left many acne scars and marks.</li>
            <li>When I am consistent, it works well.</li>
            <li>it can work pretty fast!</li>
            <li>Sadly no results for me.</li>
            <li>I first used it when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>I bet its probably a ploy for you to come back and buy more.</li>
            <li>it takes time don&#x27;t rush it and don&#x27;t use to much!</li>
            <li>I was told by a customer it really works so I am using it for the first yime.</li>
            <li>The first week went great, I saw the acne scars lighten, and actually had a slight breakout that improved seemingly overnight.</li>
            <li>Product worked very well, spots lightened in 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I will give 4 stars as my freckles on my face really really lighten..</li>
            <li>very impress product n</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get why there is so much hype about this product.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t work as much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Works very well on discolorations.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I am sure it works for a lot other people, but it didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also better than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried (Ambi,etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have age spots, so that wasn&#x27;t an issue, but my freckles have faded, and I am pleased that my acne scars have lightened and are less noticeable now.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product if you are looking for something that clears up acne spots etc.</li>
            <li>As for me, I will continue using it, although just for spot treatment instead of my whole face, and definitely not everyday.</li>
            <li>As an adult, I have tried many different things to heal these areas with little success.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was just too you to have old lady liver spots!</li>
            <li>i been using these products since I was 17 years old.</li>
            <li>It gradually evens out my complexion and is not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>It works very well over a short period of time.</li>
            <li>but this is the only one I have found that really is concentrated and works well.</li>
            <li>So, I guess if one is consistent and uses sunblock religiously, or avoids total sun...</li>
            <li>I had my entire face treated with lasers to remove 50 years of sunspots,at a dermatologist&#x27;s office, under intense fluorescent lighting once initially and then a follow up.</li>
            <li>I believe my older acne scars are starting to fade as well but only time will tell</li>
            <li>It is less expensive and more effective than any other brand lightening cream I have tried - and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!</li>
            <li>but I can already see a difference in the reduction of some newer acne scars which are now barely visible.</li>
            <li>It is not working as fast as other posts stated.</li>
            <li>Make sure you only put it on the spots else you will make it worse.</li>
            <li>For me (51 Caucasian) this has work very well to remove age spots and dark patches on my skin.</li>
            <li>Now I took the rest and mixed it in with this other product I bought that works very well.</li>

            <li> This product helped clear up my acne black spots plus when I was in a car accident; I was left with scars because of a air bag.</li>
            <li> but I can 100% at this time say that the cream definitely works for newer (less than 2 months old) acne scars.</li>
            <li> By the third week, I definitely saw the lightening effect, especially when applying my makeup, my regular foundation seemed so dark when I put it on.</li>
            <li> but i did many researches on different bleaching creams and this product can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has impacted my health long term, but it has heightened my sense of self esteem and confidence in eth</li>
            <li> they were a bit smaller thatn what i expected</li>
            <li> It works but it takes a long time</li>
            <li> As an African American these spots are nearly black on my brown skin.</li>
            <li> There is the concern about the active ingredient being potentially cancinogenic</li>
            <li> I have horrendous dark spots left over covering both of my cheeks from years of cystic acne.</li>
            <li> being a Japanese, maybe mt skin is too dark.</li>
            <li> I personally see results in a couple days as I let the product sit on my dark spots rather than blending it in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking several weeks to start seeing results but it is beginning to lighten the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Second week, I had to take a break and reduce use to just a few times, my skin dried out and seemed sensitive.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve always kept a tube of Black &amp; White Bleaching Cream in the house.  </li>
            <li> but I usually buy a couple at a time so that I have enough to last for a while.</li>
            <li> but then it just stops working and its such a little tube you have to keep buying it .</li>
            <li> put this cream on morning and night and absolutely no fading occurred.</li>
            <li> It has been the only one that does what it&#x27;s suppose to do without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used this and a few other creams on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have used other over the counter products that literally worked what seems like over night.</li>
            <li> i am a African American woman that suffers from acne since i was abt 9 years old.</li>
            <li> But if I miss a dose, or go out in sun without sun block, (usually when driving), the pigment comes back with a vengeance!</li>
            <li> It also was banned from other countries.</li>
            <li> but other than that i recommend it</li>
            <li> If I get lazy, IT&#x27;S BACK!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 4 weeks and have seen very minimal results.</li>
            <li> Results on this product were very minimal...</li>
            <li> Whenever I get any breakout or dark spot on my face, I rub this cream on the spot  twice a day and the spot is always lighter within a week.  </li>
            <li> and I had laser treatments on my face which caused dark marks.</li>
            <li> It works on dark spots</li>
            <li> I used it to lighten the dark spots (took about 5 weeks) and then stopped, and am diligent about sun screen</li>
            <li> I had these dark spots around my temple from my glasses.</li>
            <li> My skin scabs, peels and voila dark spots are gone or reduced.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> I used it and my daughter also used it to fade a dark spot.</li>
            <li> I use it on dark spots, bruises, and sun-burned skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely ridiculous to sell something in such a small tube.</li>
            <li> Maybe just a few times per month.</li>
            <li> wasted my money have used all</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It is not easily seen and needs no cover up.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I cant believe they sell this small tube.</li>
            <li> At least nothing I notice.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped the product nicely, no damages.</li>
            <li> I mean I was using it in one area for a couple of days and saw no change in skin color</li>
            <li> This is really not fair</li>
            <li> Take a guess, it was a nightmare because it is not a good product for bleaching at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish I can just take you guys of this page because the product is for people who contacts with ghosts evil other stuff such as people who died and trying to wake the to a diff person, so please don&#x27;t use it cause my friend used it and he got skin cancer , hope this helps</li>
            <li> I hate trying expensive new products....seems they don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> - You see i have really bad skin discoloration, its dark around my mouth and i looked into skin bleaching to get my skin lighter.-</li>
            <li> I used it and saw scary blotches on my face and what i had to do to correct the problem.</li>
            <li> Then I put on a Generous amount of the cr&amp;egrave;me all over my face, like cold cream, and go to bed.  </li>
            <li> Downfall of this product is that (silly me) when applying, I accidentally lightened my eyebrows as well!</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t find it in stores now.</li>
            <li> Maintenance of twice a day forever is very inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> Sorry!!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use pancake base.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This item was working... however, I don&#x27;t personally have the patience or persistance to keep up with this for the rest of my life.  Maintenance of twice a day forever is very inconvenient.  This particular product works great if you have the ability to keep putting it on like it should be; You just have to have a set schedule I suppose... my life is too hectic to get in a certain routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 3 months and it has literally done nothing for me. At least nothing I notice. I have horrendous dark spots left over covering both of my cheeks from years of cystic acne. As an African American these spots are nearly black on my brown skin. Embarrassing! I have used other over the counter products that literally worked what seems like over night. My mistake was that I continued to pop pimples making more scars ( I know young and dumb).Overall this product did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product I woll bu</li>
            <li> i am a African American woman that suffers from acne since i was abt 9 years old. In which left many acne scars and marks. i been using these products since I was 17 years old. This product helped clear up my acne black spots plus when I was in a car accident; I was left with scars because of a air bag. I highly reccomend this product if you are looking for something that clears up acne spots etc.</li>
            <li> It works but not if you take  meds I am type 2 diabetic and my chemistry and this ointment  did not work well together</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to try and fade some acne scars that had darkened in recent years. As an adult, I have tried many different things to heal these areas with little success. I tried this product for three weeks. The first week went great, I saw the acne scars lighten, and actually had a slight breakout that improved seemingly overnight. It even lightened the mole on my neck (bonus!). Second week, I had to take a break and reduce use to just a few times, my skin dried out and seemed sensitive. I had to rehydrate for a couple of days. By the third week, I definitely saw the lightening effect, especially when applying my makeup, my regular foundation seemed so dark when I put it on. So I stopped using it. I don&#x27;t have age spots, so that wasn&#x27;t an issue, but my freckles have faded, and I am pleased that my acne scars have lightened and are less noticeable now. Downfall of this product is that (silly me) when applying, I accidentally lightened my eyebrows as well! Don&#x27;t let that happen to you, take my advice and avoid your eyebrows!   All in all, I do like this product, and I do recommend it. As for me, I will continue using it, although just for spot treatment instead of my whole face, and definitely not everyday. Maybe just a few times per month.</li>
            <li> too small, but works great</li>
            <li> have age spots on my hands. put this cream on morning and night and absolutely no fading occurred. wasted my money have used all but the pinch left.</li>
            <li> I use this product off and on for a scar (pigmentation) on my hand from an oven burn. When I am consistent, it works well. But if I miss a dose, or go out in sun without sun block, (usually when driving), the pigment comes back with a vengeance! So, I guess if one is consistent and uses sunblock religiously, or avoids total sun... it can work pretty fast! It is only 2%, but I did notice a change sooner than I imagined.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve always kept a tube of Black &amp; White Bleaching Cream in the house.  Whenever I get any breakout or dark spot on my face, I rub this cream on the spot  twice a day and the spot is always lighter within a week.  It always works for me.</li>
            <li> Love how fast it works. But dont go outside without sunscreen on</li>
            <li> Been using it for over  3 months twice a day morning and night. I see no difference on skin for light age spots. Not sure what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> being a Japanese, maybe mt skin is too dark. I used it for 3 months, no improvement.</li>
            <li> I hate trying expensive new products....seems they don&#x27;t work for me. This was a great price &amp; I&#x27;ve used it 3 nights and seen a difference  already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it haven&#x27;t seen the change yet still using it. I was told by a customer it really works so I am using it for the first yime.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am Italian I have had acne scars and I had laser treatments on my face which caused dark marks. I used this and all is gone! I read the reviews and they say it can cause cancer. Well my dad died of bladder cancer from food poisoning so what I am not gonna eat? This product while it may have side effects has been effective for me it has boosted my self esteem and taken away my embarrassment and I don&#x27;t have to use pancake base. With beauty products one has to try them to see how they react and how they work. I have had no reaction and it works great.</li>
            <li> Sadly no results for me.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream for quite a while, but it did not work for me. I am sure it works for a lot other people, but it didn&#x27;t do it for me. Sorry!!</li>
            <li> I use this product every night before I go to bed.  I don&#x27;t use it as prescribed I guess, because I use a GENEROUS amount on my face at night.  I wash my face good with REALLY warm water,to open my pores, and pat it moist, but not dry.  Then I put on a Generous amount of the cr&amp;egrave;me all over my face, like cold cream, and go to bed.  Most is absorbed into my skin the morning, and I just wipe of the excess in the morning.  I do this faithfully every night like a ritual and I have noticed my skin improved immensely.  It took some time, but I would say in about two weeks of faithful use I could really start seeing my face look brighter and had a better skin texture also, I didn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; look anymore.</li>
            <li> It started to work it seemed and peel skin.. then it stopped working.. It don&#x27;t recommend this product at all... to me it does not work!!</li>
            <li> product is as described. It works on dark spots</li>
            <li> For me (51 Caucasian) this has work very well to remove age spots and dark patches on my skin. It is less expensive and more effective than any other brand lightening cream I have tried - and I&#x27;ve tried a lot! There is the concern about the active ingredient being potentially cancinogenic so you have to decide if its worth the risk to you. I used it to lighten the dark spots (took about 5 weeks) and then stopped, and am diligent about sun screen so they don&#x27;t reappear. I don&#x27;t know if it has impacted my health long term, but it has heightened my sense of self esteem and confidence in eth short run. I felt like I was just too you to have old lady liver spots!</li>
            <li> Product worked very well, spots lightened in 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> they were a bit smaller thatn what i expected</li>
            <li> I love this product. I first used it when I was a teenager. I had these dark spots around my temple from my glasses. Took about 2-3 weeks and they were gone. Too bad I can&#x27;t find it in stores now.</li>
            <li> This is the only bleaching cream I use. It has been the only one that does what it&#x27;s suppose to do without irritating my sensitive skin. It gradually evens out my complexion and is not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff right here works! It takes no time to see results. I personally see results in a couple days as I let the product sit on my dark spots rather than blending it in. My skin scabs, peels and voila dark spots are gone or reduced.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it&#x27;s hella cheap. It&#x27;s also better than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried (Ambi,etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret buying it!</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this product. I did not research the product fully prior to ordering.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this product but i did many researches on different bleaching creams and this product can be dangerous. It contains Hydroquinone which can cause skin cancer. It also was banned from other countries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for 2 weeks but I can already see a difference in the reduction of some newer acne scars which are now barely visible. I only use the cream once a day instead of the recommended twice a day because of some irritation I experienced on my cheeks(strangely just my cheeks even though i applied some to my chin and forehead area as well). I believe my older acne scars are starting to fade as well but only time will tell but I can 100% at this time say that the cream definitely works for newer (less than 2 months old) acne scars.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results . I used it and my daughter also used it to fade a dark spot. Waste of time and money</li>
            <li> I use it on dark spots, bruises, and sun-burned skin. It works very well over a short period of time. I wish the tube was larger but I usually buy a couple at a time so that I have enough to last for a while. I would definitely recommend this product for discolorations. The seller shipped the product nicely, no damages. Good timing too.</li>
            <li> I will give 4 stars as my freckles on my face really really lighten..very impress product n will use again...luv it !@@@</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking several weeks to start seeing results but it is beginning to lighten the dark spots.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used this product religiously but it doesn&#x27;t even work. I don&#x27;t get why there is so much hype about this product.</li>
            <li> This is really not fair I wish I can just take you guys of this page because the product is for people who contacts with ghosts evil other stuff such as people who died and trying to wake the to a diff person, so please don&#x27;t use it cause my friend used it and he got skin cancer , hope this helps , I wish I can tell you more add my kik for more: siater23tay</li>
            <li> It is not working as fast as other posts stated. I have been using it for 4 weeks and have seen very minimal results.</li>
            <li> Results on this product were very minimal...I mean I was using it in one area for a couple of days and saw no change in skin color whats so ever. Now I took the rest and mixed it in with this other product I bought that works very well. Dont think I will purchase this again</li>
            <li> i bought this a while ago.... like last year and it worked for a while but your skin gets used to it so it doesn&#x27;t work as much. - You see i have really bad skin discoloration, its dark around my mouth and i looked into skin bleaching to get my skin lighter.- it worked for a couple of weeks and you actually see results but then it just stops working and its such a little tube you have to keep buying it . but other than that i recommend it</li>
            <li> I have used this since I was a kid and have always loved te results. I used this and a few other creams on a daily basis. Thanks</li>
            <li> I CANT BELIEVE I BOUGHT THIS. What was i thinking? I cant believe they sell this small tube.I bet its probably a ploy for you to come back and buy more.Absolutely ridiculous to sell something in such a small tube.How in the world would u know if it works? Take a guess, it was a nightmare because it is not a good product for bleaching at all.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend anyone using this.Furthermore, where are the good ratings coming from? I used it and saw scary blotches on my face and what i had to do to correct the problem. Geesh! had to use cocoa butter soap and cocoa butter creams to go back to my complexion.I imagine people probably mix this with something else to get a desired effect, but it is still a Rip off with this company.</li>
            <li> It works but it takes a long time</li>
            <li> Creamy consistency.  Not oily like some products.  Works very well on discolorations.&lt;br /&gt;Does not irritate the skin.  Price very good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. it takes time don&#x27;t rush it and don&#x27;t use to much! Make sure you only put it on the spots else you will make it worse.</li>
            <li> This did nothing to bleach, lighten or anything that I was looking for it to do.  It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I had my entire face treated with lasers to remove 50 years of sunspots,at a dermatologist&#x27;s office, under intense fluorescent lighting once initially and then a follow up. The results were  amazing and it took ten years off my age. But there was a hold out! On the left side of the face (right where the sun hits us as we drive, good endorsement to always wear sun screen) there was a pesky sun spot that would have required a few more go backs to the dermatologist&#x27;s office. For one spot? Heck no. So I rub this cream into that pesky spot before I put my sunscreen and make up on in the morning and I rub a dab on at night before the night time face ritual. It keeps the spot \\&quot;at bay\\&quot;. It is not easily seen and needs no cover up. If I get lazy, IT&#x27;S BACK! If you don&#x27;t like \\&quot;freckles\\&quot; on your nose, I have a friend who uses this product daily for that. There are a lot of products out there that claim to do this kind of thing but this is the only one I have found that really is concentrated and works well.</li>
