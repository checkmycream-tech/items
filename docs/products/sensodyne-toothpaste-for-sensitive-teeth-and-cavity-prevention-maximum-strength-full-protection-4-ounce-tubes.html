            <li>Being particularly stubborn, I did my best to ignore the pain and fully brush my teeth and gums with it, but then quickly and thoroughly rinsed my mouth out.  </li>
            <li>I have tried different Versoin of Sensodyne and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and was glad to find it here.</li>
            <li>Julia reviewe is better.</li>
            <li>I used to not be be able to eat ice cream or drink coffee.  </li>
            <li>use for many year, love it</li>
            <li>Thanks to GlaxoSmithKline and great of amazon.</li>
            <li>The colgate flavor is way better and we feel it helps even more with our gum sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff, and would recommend it to anyone with sensitivity problems :)</li>
            <li>price on Amazon is very good, I compared it to Costco for the same size packaging and Amazon price is better.</li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>He recommended Sensodyne and, even though it&#x27;s taken longer than I expected (almost a month) to make a difference, it&#x27;s really wonderful!!!  </li>
            <li>Tastes great and works both in whitening and for my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It is a good sensitive teeth toothpaste, but I believe the Sensodyne with whitening works better at whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li>Nothing like drinking warm tea or iced tea and having a tooth nerve jump straight up into your head!  </li>
            <li>So I opted for this type of Sensodyne, which I like just fine.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and love this product.</li>
            <li>Got a free &amp;#34;crest complete&amp;#34; at the dentist and the pain disappeared immediately.</li>
            <li>It desensitizes you teeth and lets you enjoy life.  </li>
            <li>so when I find and item he ONLY uses and for a great price, I jump on it</li>
            <li>and he gave me a free sample of Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li>What I do know is that I will not be using this toothpaste again, and I will have to try switching to the original formula Sensodyne for sensitivity relief.</li>
            <li>As a former Crest and Colgate user, I&#x27;ve found this product to be very good and superior to the other products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tube of toothpaste that keeps your teeth clean, but also reduces, or eliminates sensitivity.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste generates a nice foam (not too much and not too little) and has a pleasant feel to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various versions of Sensodyne, and this version is the best so far, because it offers COMPLETE defense from the various tooth antagonists while still providing the excellent Sensodyne tooth sensitivity protection.</li>
            <li>Package arrived right on time, &amp; the toothpaste cleans well, tastes good &amp; helps to lessen those occasional tooth sensitivities.</li>
            <li>As usual, product is good!</li>
            <li>I and my girlfriend did not feel very good after we use it for couple weeks - some white stuff appeared in oral mucosa; maybe we&#x60;ll go back to Colgate.</li>
            <li>these are for my father, he is more 70 years old.</li>
            <li>I smiled big at the relief.</li>
            <li>I recently had to have a root canal and was sure I would need a couple more since 2 more began &#x27;acting up.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>I have been using Sensodyne for over a year now and my extremely sensitive teeth have been so much better.</li>
            <li>And the price is right.  </li>
            <li>Some complain about the taste, I find it just right as I am used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The product description is misleading as a very important detail is omitted; The toothpaste includes extra whitening.</li>
            <li>and I can eat ice cream or drink hot chocolate without any pain.  </li>
            <li>Some leave a funny taste in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many different brands, but sensodyne is a winner among all of them.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the whitening aspects of this toothpaste, but my teeth do look pretty white and healthy.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>

            <li>Fast delivery.</li>

            <li>but because it really help the sensitivity I now use Sensodyne in the evening, and Orange Mango in the morning.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Very very, highly recommend this is you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>, This really works well for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original Sensodyne works well and really helps my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this toothpaste and he says it helps with his sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I had pretty sensitive teeth (especially with hot drinks), and now I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>We used this toothpaste for a long time, because we do have some gum sensitivity but we tried the colgate 3d radiant white and it was so much better.  </li>
            <li>It worked on a very sensitive filling I have.  </li>
            <li>This is a second review, since my first &amp;#34;draft&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t pass Amazon inspection, although I am at pains to understand why.  </li>
            <li>Recently I have had a couple of fillings and other dental work and need to baby my teeth as the dental work made them even more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>When you break it down, you save a significant amount of cash when you buy in bulk.</li>
            <li>And he has sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>No I am old.</li>
            <li>Are your teeth sensitive?</li>
            <li>, my teeth are sensitive sooooo</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, do not hesitate to try it.</li>
            <li>Had a sensitive spot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Colgate for sensitive teeth and it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and got this because my regular toothpaste was causing severe pain.</li>
            <li>FINALLY, they came out with one that actually foams decently.</li>
            <li>It can also be used for general Purposes.</li>
            <li>After checking my search engine of choice, I have come to learn that this is the soft tissue&#x27;s response to what is essentially a chemical burn.</li>
            <li>So I tried several Sensodyne Toothpastes before, yet have settled on this one and will be continuing to use the Sensodyne For Sensitive Teeth and Cavity Prevention for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, my teeth have become more sensitive to cold beverages.  </li>
            <li>I always have had sensitive teeth, but have had trouble sticking to sensodyne because they weren&#x27;t as foamy as other toothpastes (I like my mouth to feel VERY fresh).</li>
            <li>It is not permanent so if the toothpaste helps one needs to use it every day once a day (he recommended to use before going to sleep at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the sensitivity to hot and cold significantly diminished in about 4 days and ordered this order of Sensodyne</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just a few days of rubbing this paste on the sensitive tooth, my problem completely disappeared and I have not had any problems since!  </li>
            <li>This is dead tissue sloughing off en masse from what I believe may be the whitening agent in the paste, though I don&#x27;t know for certain.</li>

            <li> This is a second review, since my first &amp;#34;draft&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t pass Amazon inspection, although I am at pains to understand why.  </li>
            <li> Recently I have had a couple of fillings and other dental work and need to baby my teeth as the dental work made them even more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> When you break it down, you save a significant amount of cash when you buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> And he has sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> No I am old.</li>
            <li> Are your teeth sensitive?</li>
            <li> , my teeth are sensitive sooooo</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, do not hesitate to try it.</li>
            <li> Had a sensitive spot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Colgate for sensitive teeth and it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and got this because my regular toothpaste was causing severe pain.</li>
            <li> FINALLY, they came out with one that actually foams decently.</li>
            <li> It can also be used for general Purposes.</li>
            <li> After checking my search engine of choice, I have come to learn that this is the soft tissue&#x27;s response to what is essentially a chemical burn.</li>
            <li> So I tried several Sensodyne Toothpastes before, yet have settled on this one and will be continuing to use the Sensodyne For Sensitive Teeth and Cavity Prevention for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my teeth have become more sensitive to cold beverages.  </li>
            <li> I always have had sensitive teeth, but have had trouble sticking to sensodyne because they weren&#x27;t as foamy as other toothpastes (I like my mouth to feel VERY fresh).</li>
            <li> It is not permanent so if the toothpaste helps one needs to use it every day once a day (he recommended to use before going to sleep at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the sensitivity to hot and cold significantly diminished in about 4 days and ordered this order of Sensodyne</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a few days of rubbing this paste on the sensitive tooth, my problem completely disappeared and I have not had any problems since!  </li>
            <li> This is dead tissue sloughing off en masse from what I believe may be the whitening agent in the paste, though I don&#x27;t know for certain.</li>
            <li> Usually I do not buy name brand items as I prefer to save the money, but I have found NO other sensitive teeth toothpaste (including other name brands) that work as well as this does, and I retest different brands every few years.</li>
            <li> Have used Sensodyne products for years and don&#x27;t like this one as much as the pronamel or plain sensodyne.  </li>
            <li> Sensodyne Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth and .... came well packaged with 1 other teeth related product.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I awoke one morning with a very sensitive upper front tooth.  </li>
            <li> So I began using the original Sesodyne toothpaste and found the taste pretty bad, but stayed with it.</li>
            <li> For me, I have always had very sensitive teeth to hot and cold and just fussy and sensitive teeth altogether.</li>
            <li> And finally, unlike some other nasty flavors, this one tastes great!</li>
            <li> less sensitive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me it has a strong minty flavor.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical when my dentist suggested a sensitive toothpaste, thinking how can toothpaste be different?  </li>
            <li> is it does seem to be more expensive than other toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li> I have had tooth sensitivity for a long time.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for just a few days, my teeth became less sensitive (even with the recent dental work).</li>
            <li> My whole family suffers from sensitive teeth and this product is the only toothpaste that works.  </li>
            <li> sure however, that whatever sensitivity-relieving product you purchase (whether Sensodyne or others) contains the active ingredient Potassium Nitrate (5%), which will fill in the areas in the tooth that are exposed to the cold elements.</li>
            <li> It fell slightly stinging in my mouth, and afterwards there was a white slimy residue in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Hours later, I noticed an odd mucus had formed on the inside of my lips and cheeks.</li>
            <li> about 2 months ago I developed sensitivity to hot and cold foods.  </li>
            <li> When this sensitivity did not go away in a few weeks I went to see my dentist who probed my teeth with various torture devices and told me that I have no cavities, cracks, or exposed gums.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this at the same time I ordered a heavy duty whitening kit (one of the ones with the accelerating lights).</li>
            <li> I found that using small plastic &amp;#34;gum picks&amp;#34; dipped into the paste and gently brushed between the teeth, as well as swishing the foam around the teeth, helps too.</li>
            <li> and i would recomend this to other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and it has never let me down.  </li>
            <li> Switched back to Sensodyne and no more pain!</li>
            <li> Hopefully, this works well for others, and I continue to buy the Sensodyne brand in a less stringent tube.</li>
            <li> The teeth on one side of my mouth would hurt when I ate something that was cold or hot.  </li>
            <li> When the tubules are exposed they conduct cold or hot temperatures to the nerves and it is perceived as pain by the tooth nerves.</li>
            <li> Once I used a sample for a few days......</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was puzzled by this, as I had never had trouble with teeth sensitivity before, but on the advice of my Dad (a dentist)</li>
            <li> And the instant I began brushing, I knew I had made a poor choice.</li>
            <li> Poor dental hygiene as a child and teen and a taste for everything from soda to iced tea to coffee made my teeth quite sensitive, and whenever that sensitivity got too bad I would switch to a tube of Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used that kit before, and my teeth were so sensitive that breathing through my mouth when it&#x27;s cold outside was agony, let alone biting into cold fruit, eating ice cream, etc.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any pain from cold water, brushing my teeth, or eating hot or cold foods and drinks.</li>
            <li> But the agent that causes the bubbles in tooth paste was actually caustic to my mouth causing sores.</li>
            <li> This process is not immediate, he said it will take approximately 1 to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My dentist instructed me to use this toothpaste to prevent painful teeth due to fluoride in toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Sorry in advance to all the dentists selling really expensive prescription toothpastes for my review.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dentist to prevent teeth sensitivity to cold, etc.</li>
            <li> Immediate relief of cold sensitivity- tested while brushing my teeth in rinsing with cold water.</li>
            <li> Each time a cold substance (even a rush of air) passed over that tooth, it would send a jolt of pain through my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that using Sensodyne has helped to reduce and, at times, eliminate this sensitivity to cold beverages.  </li>
            <li> and whenever I eat or drink something cold my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li> In fact, my dentist was selling me a very expensive prescription toothpaste to combat it.  </li>
            <li> I found this to be exceedingly annoying (to flinch every time my teeth bumped an ice cube)</li>
            <li> and I smoke, so I use a lot of whitening products, and I end up with A LOT of very painful sensitivity.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed in this purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Recommended by dentist to prevent teeth sensitivity to cold, etc.</li>
            <li> My whole family suffers from sensitive teeth and this product is the only toothpaste that works.  The flavor is not over powering and I can eat ice cream or drink hot chocolate without any pain.  My dentist check-ups grade is an A+</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and got this because my regular toothpaste was causing severe pain. Within a week of using this the pain was gone. I tried a whitening toothpaste for a week and pain came back. Switched back to Sensodyne and no more pain!</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best deals of the best toothpastes out there. Sensodyne doesn&#x27;t need to be explained. What needs to be analyzed is the price of this product. When you break it down, you save a significant amount of cash when you buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> Have used Sensodyne products for years and don&#x27;t like this one as much as the pronamel or plain sensodyne.  Probably would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My teeth are super-sensitive (hence the reliance on Sensodyne).  This particular &amp;#34;Full Protection&amp;#34; model did not work well for me.  It fell slightly stinging in my mouth, and afterwards there was a white slimy residue in my mouth.  Hopefully, this works well for others, and I continue to buy the Sensodyne brand in a less stringent tube.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> Our favorite brand and we always reorder from here.</li>
            <li> This is a second review, since my first &amp;#34;draft&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t pass Amazon inspection, although I am at pains to understand why.  I will try one more time to say that I originally subscribed to the Sensodyne gel, but after two deliveries, they jacked up the price to the point where it was more expensive (almost $7 a tube) than I could buy at my corner pharmacy.  So I opted for this type of Sensodyne, which I like just fine.  And the price is right.  If this review doesn&#x27;t make it, I am not trying again!</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed in this purchase. After several weeks of doing it as instructed, my tooth still aches. Dentist says it&#x27;s only sensitivity. Got a free &amp;#34;crest complete&amp;#34; at the dentist and the pain disappeared immediately.</li>
            <li> I have had tooth sensitivity for a long time.  In fact, my dentist was selling me a very expensive prescription toothpaste to combat it.  I decided to try this instead.  I would say it works better than the more expensive prescription kind.  I am not going to stop using it to see if the tooth pain returns so you will have to decide if it is all in my head or I have really found relief from this great product.  Sorry in advance to all the dentists selling really expensive prescription toothpastes for my review.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne is a very effective toothpaste for people like me who have ground off most of their enamal.  Some leave a funny taste in your mouth.  This is the best tasting I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> these are for my father, he is more 70 years old. And he has sensitive teeth. This toothpaste does help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various versions of Sensodyne, and this version is the best so far, because it offers COMPLETE defense from the various tooth antagonists while still providing the excellent Sensodyne tooth sensitivity protection. And finally, unlike some other nasty flavors, this one tastes great! If you are looking for COMPLETE sensitive teeth protection, this Full Protection Sensodyne is THE ONE to get.</li>
            <li> These are the medium tubes of sensodyne. I highly recommend the product. My tooth sensitivity is almost nonexistent. And it takes me a couple months (3-4 months) to go through a tube.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth and .... came well packaged with 1 other teeth related product. I am LOVING this product. Immediate relief of cold sensitivity- tested while brushing my teeth in rinsing with cold water. I smiled big at the relief. YES, I will order this product again!!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical when my dentist suggested a sensitive toothpaste, thinking how can toothpaste be different?  Once I used a sample for a few days......I noticed a difference, hence my recent purchase.  I love everything about this toothpaste....only reason for the four star is the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; seller!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and it has never let me down.  It is great for sensitive teeth.  It also helps your white teeth shine.  It removes coffee stains.  I drink it almost every day and my teeth are white.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I awoke one morning with a very sensitive upper front tooth.  Each time a cold substance (even a rush of air) passed over that tooth, it would send a jolt of pain through my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was puzzled by this, as I had never had trouble with teeth sensitivity before, but on the advice of my Dad (a dentist) I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days of rubbing this paste on the sensitive tooth, my problem completely disappeared and I have not had any problems since!  I now alternate brushing with this product and a better-tasting paste (the chalky taste is the one downside of Sensodyne) and that system seems to prevent any sensitivity from developing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure however, that whatever sensitivity-relieving product you purchase (whether Sensodyne or others) contains the active ingredient Potassium Nitrate (5%), which will fill in the areas in the tooth that are exposed to the cold elements.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums. Use to use regular toothpaste, etc.... But the agent that causes the bubbles in tooth paste was actually caustic to my mouth causing sores. No issue with this product .... No I am old.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne works.  It desensitizes you teeth and lets you enjoy life.  My dentist recommended it many years ago and it works.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different brands, but sensodyne is a winner among all of them. The best quality and plus it is recommended by dentists .</li>
            <li> Unlike many purchases in life that come with wild pronouncements of how they will change your life, and how wonderful they are, Sensodyne is just that. It&#x27;s a tube of toothpaste that keeps your teeth clean, but also reduces, or eliminates sensitivity. And it does that perfectly. I had pretty sensitive teeth (especially with hot drinks), and now I don&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t comment on the whitening aspects of this toothpaste, but my teeth do look pretty white and healthy. This is the only toothpaste I buy now because it does what it says it will do and it does it well. Tastes OK too.&lt;br /&gt;Completely recommended.</li>
            <li> Good value on amazon. Good paste or so it seems.</li>
            <li> I always have had sensitive teeth, but have had trouble sticking to sensodyne because they weren&#x27;t as foamy as other toothpastes (I like my mouth to feel VERY fresh). FINALLY, they came out with one that actually foams decently.</li>
            <li> I recently had to have a root canal and was sure I would need a couple more since 2 more began &#x27;acting up.&#x27;  Nothing like drinking warm tea or iced tea and having a tooth nerve jump straight up into your head!  My orthodontist tested and retested, finally telling me that, with age and gum retraction, it happens....  one of the perks of being 71.  He recommended Sensodyne and, even though it&#x27;s taken longer than I expected (almost a month) to make a difference, it&#x27;s really wonderful!!!  I can now sip, chew, etc. without any shocks.  Be sure not to miss the 2x a day brushing and keep with it.  I found that using small plastic &amp;#34;gum picks&amp;#34; dipped into the paste and gently brushed between the teeth, as well as swishing the foam around the teeth, helps too.</li>
            <li> Love having this available on Subscribe and Save!  I&#x27;ll never go to Costco again!</li>
            <li> Are your teeth sensitive? Then this toothpaste is for you! It also helps freshen breath beyond what I thought was even possible. I guarantee you&#x27;ll be happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I and my girlfriend did not feel very good after we use it for couple weeks - some white stuff appeared in oral mucosa; maybe we&#x60;ll go back to Colgate.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and works both in whitening and for my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> uhhh, would be nice if they told you there was BLEACH in this tooth paste, my teeth are sensitive sooooo i can&#x27;t do bleach!  total bummer!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Sensodyne toothpaste off and on for years. Poor dental hygiene as a child and teen and a taste for everything from soda to iced tea to coffee made my teeth quite sensitive, and whenever that sensitivity got too bad I would switch to a tube of Sensodyne. It has always worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My use of this particular Whitening formulation was a first for me. And the instant I began brushing, I knew I had made a poor choice. There was a severe pain in my mouth. This wasn&#x27;t just the &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; feeling of, say, gargling with Listerine. This was legit burning pain. Being particularly stubborn, I did my best to ignore the pain and fully brush my teeth and gums with it, but then quickly and thoroughly rinsed my mouth out.  Hours later, I noticed an odd mucus had formed on the inside of my lips and cheeks. After checking my search engine of choice, I have come to learn that this is the soft tissue&#x27;s response to what is essentially a chemical burn. This is dead tissue sloughing off en masse from what I believe may be the whitening agent in the paste, though I don&#x27;t know for certain. What I do know is that I will not be using this toothpaste again, and I will have to try switching to the original formula Sensodyne for sensitivity relief.</li>
            <li> I have tried different Versoin of Sensodyne and this one is the best.If you are looking for COMPLETE sensitive teeth protection, this Full Protection Sensodyne is THE ONE to get.</li>
            <li> Great product...will continue to use.  It worked on a very sensitive filling I have.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It is a good sensitive teeth toothpaste, but I believe the Sensodyne with whitening works better at whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price, This really works well for sensitive teeth.It can also be used for general Purposes. Pleasant tasting toothpaste.</li>
            <li> You have to look like a hawk to see it in the photo, since the writeup does not mention it, but this is Sensodyne WHITENING toothpaste.  Unlike Original Sensodyne, the whitening version is the devil on sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Sensodyne works well and really helps my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The product description is misleading as a very important detail is omitted; The toothpaste includes extra whitening. I have been using sensodyne for 10 years and like the product, however, i did not want to buy the version with extra whitening.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne REALLY does what it says. If you have sensitive teeth, do not hesitate to try it. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and was glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> Great price for the item.</li>
            <li> For me, I have always had very sensitive teeth to hot and cold and just fussy and sensitive teeth altogether. Always had to watch what I ate and drank as I had to baby my fussy teeth! So I began using the original Sesodyne toothpaste and found the taste pretty bad, but stayed with it. So I tried several Sensodyne Toothpastes before, yet have settled on this one and will be continuing to use the Sensodyne For Sensitive Teeth and Cavity Prevention for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Recently I have had a couple of fillings and other dental work and need to baby my teeth as the dental work made them even more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;2) After using this product for just a few days, my teeth became less sensitive (even with the recent dental work). And I feel that my teeth have benefitted from this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;3) Some complain about the taste, I find it just right as I am used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very very, highly recommend this is you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> A great oral care product</li>
            <li> I have been using Sensodyne for over a year now and my extremely sensitive teeth have been so much better. I haven&#x27;t had any pain from cold water, brushing my teeth, or eating hot or cold foods and drinks.</li>
            <li> very hard to find this exact kind of toothpaste and my fiance is very particular so when I find and item he ONLY uses and for a great price, I jump on it</li>
            <li> I never had any issues with my teeth until about 2 months ago I developed sensitivity to hot and cold foods.  The teeth on one side of my mouth would hurt when I ate something that was cold or hot.  I could not pin point any particular tooth that caused the pain.  The pain stopped when I stopped eating. When this sensitivity did not go away in a few weeks I went to see my dentist who probed my teeth with various torture devices and told me that I have no cavities, cracks, or exposed gums.  He said that the problem  is likely caused by teeth grinding and is often helped by Sensodyne toothpaste.  He gave me a sample toothpaste to see if it will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist explained that the toothpaste works by filling in dentinal tubules that communicate with nerves in the teeth.  When the tubules are exposed they conduct cold or hot temperatures to the nerves and it is perceived as pain by the tooth nerves. The toothpaste temporary fills the tubules and prevents the sensitivity. This process is not immediate, he said it will take approximately 1 to 2 weeks. It is not permanent so if the toothpaste helps one needs to use it every day once a day (he recommended to use before going to sleep at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the sensitivity to hot and cold significantly diminished in about 4 days and ordered this order of Sensodyne toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste contains Fluoride and tooth whitening.  Unfortunately for me it has a strong minty flavor.  I don&#x27;t like mint flavor and has been using a non-mint toothpaste [[ASIN:B004M9COKY Tom&#x27;s of Maine Orange Mango ]] but because it really help the sensitivity I now use Sensodyne in the evening, and Orange Mango in the morning.  The toothpaste generates a nice foam (not too much and not too little) and has a pleasant feel to it.  And if you like mint flavor you will like how it taste, not only what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is very good, I compared it to Costco for the same size packaging and Amazon price is better. I am attaching the photo which shows the packaging and toothpaste itself on a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewe is better. I am attaching the photo which shows the packaging and toothpaste itself on a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> As usual, product is good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Sensodyne fan, &amp; getting a pack of four at a time, with subscribe &amp; save, is so convenient. Package arrived right on time, &amp; the toothpaste cleans well, tastes good &amp; helps to lessen those occasional tooth sensitivities.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this all the time. It definitely makes our&lt;br /&gt;teeth less sensitive. We are both in our sixties.</li>
            <li> Already noticing a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.. It is helping with the sensitivity of my teeth too. Happy to find a great toothpaste that works!</li>
            <li> We have been using Sensodyne for years and years. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Usually I do not buy name brand items as I prefer to save the money, but I have found NO other sensitive teeth toothpaste (including other name brands) that work as well as this does, and I retest different brands every few years.</li>
            <li> When I was a youth, I ate too much candy and drank too much soda, I now have very sensitive teeth.  I used to not be be able to eat ice cream or drink coffee.  I found this to be exceedingly annoying (to flinch every time my teeth bumped an ice cube) so I talked to my Dentist and he gave me a free sample of Sensodyne.  In three days I was sold!  I noticed a decrease in the sensitivity of my teeth and a very nice minty flavor in my mouth.  This is my 3rd batch from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always tried to cut costs on this expensive toothpaste i.e. dollar store brands, buying on sale but this was the best way to buy this expensive product</li>
            <li> My dentist instructed me to use this toothpaste to prevent painful teeth due to fluoride in toothpaste. I bought the four pack because I trust my dentist and he highly recommended the toothpaste. My teeth are no longer in pain and I have now found the toothpaste I will use indefinitely. I recommend it highly to anyone who is having dental problems.</li>
            <li> Great price for a pack of 4! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Had a sensitive spot. Don&#x27;t feel it as much after a few months using this. It&#x27;s good stuff I&#x27;d say</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Colgate for sensitive teeth and it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as Sensodyne.  I have trie the various flavors of Sensodyne and I like all of them.</li>
            <li> As a former Crest and Colgate user, I&#x27;ve found this product to be very good and superior to the other products.  As I have gotten older, my teeth have become more sensitive to cold beverages.  I find that using Sensodyne has helped to reduce and, at times, eliminate this sensitivity to cold beverages.  I believe I&#x27;ll be using the product for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have for this product is it does seem to be more expensive than other toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li> use for many year, love it</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a nice thick, smooth consistency. The flavor is good and it is effective in reducing sensitivity to hot and cold on the teeth of everyone in the family.</li>
            <li> The sensodyne Toothpaste is very great. it can  protection to teeth. Thanks to GlaxoSmithKline and great of amazon.</li>
            <li> We used this toothpaste for a long time, because we do have some gum sensitivity but we tried the colgate 3d radiant white and it was so much better.  The colgate flavor is way better and we feel it helps even more with our gum sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is just what I was looking for. I have really sensitive teeth and whenever I eat or drink something cold my teeth hurt. After using this toothpaste for a week the pain has stopped and I can eat ice cream with no worries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brush my teeth with it twice a day and that gives the best results.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this toothpaste and he says it helps with his sensitive teeth.  I bought it in bulk to stock up.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste has a type of cap i have never seen before. its a twist on, 1/4 turn cap. toothpaste works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and I smoke, so I use a lot of whitening products, and I end up with A LOT of very painful sensitivity. I ordered this at the same time I ordered a heavy duty whitening kit (one of the ones with the accelerating lights). I&#x27;ve used that kit before, and my teeth were so sensitive that breathing through my mouth when it&#x27;s cold outside was agony, let alone biting into cold fruit, eating ice cream, etc. Since I started the kit this time around, I&#x27;ve been using Sensodyne along with it. Not only do I not have ANY sensitivity, but my teeth are even whiter than they would have been with just the kit. I LOVE this stuff, and would recommend it to anyone with sensitivity problems :)</li>
            <li> This product did arrive on time and i would recomend this to other.  I do notice a difference using this product on my teeth.  If you have sensitive teeth I would highly recomend this product.</li>
