            <li>I needed a curling iron and being a huge twilight fan I decided to try this one.</li>
            <li>I bought this item a few days ago, and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>shiney n smooth.</li>
            <li>With this curling iron it provides smooth non frizzy curls.</li>
            <li>My updos come out amazing and other stylist in the salon were amazed how good it is, so they purchased one to.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, fuss-free cord, easy to use.</li>
            <li>She is a big twilight lover and was thrilled to receive it!</li>
            <li>My favorite hot tools curling iron broke</li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have healthy wavey hair, and the curls come out very frizzy.</li>
            <li>recently used this iron again after first flat ironing my hair and was slightly more impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I love Twilight and love this curling iron, but if you are looking for a more pronounced tightly curled look then this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>Good for your collection or nice to have on hand as a traveling iron, if you don&#x27;t like the idea of toting around your vastly more expensive one.ly/dry</li>
            <li>Good for your collection or nice to have on hand as a traveling iron, if you don&#x27;t like the idea of toting around your vastly more expensive one.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job for the price; it just requires a little bit more effort if you have thicker/curlier hair.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job for the price; it just requires a little bit more effort if you have thicker/curlier hair.</li>
            <li>I also think this would be a nice edition for any tween or teen girl who is in to Twilight and likes curling their hair.</li>
            <li>I am a professional stylist and I have worked with many curling irons.</li>
            <li>It works alright, but not quite as good as my other iron had.</li>
            <li>It heats up quick, and really does produce a pretty curl.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend for it&#x27;s ability to do what it says, and it looks really cool too.</li>
            <li>Perfect curls in mere minutes.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d recommend straightening it the first day and curling it the next.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is pin straight and really hard to curl, but this iron gives me great &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; waves.  </li>
            <li>It is a great cheaply priced, expensively made styling tool that I recommend to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li>With shorter layers it will give more of a curled look but still soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>The large barrel gives full, soft curls, exactly like Bella&#x27;s in the movie.</li>
            <li>The color of the iron it is a deep plum purple, very true to the photos.  </li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t fallen in love with a single curling or flat iron, but I&#x27;ve found ones that make styling my hair more livable.</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty fast, and you can change the temperature setting.</li>
            <li>I grab up my hair in large chunks and twirl them around this thing (WHICH HAS A TWIRLING CORD TO KEEP FROM GETTING TANGLED, OMG,</li>
            <li>If you want loose natural looking curls or want to create a little wave to your hair this is the perfect curling iron.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this product from big lots for $19 and I love this curling iron!</li>
            <li>When the curling iron is plugged in it is automatically on and a red light will appear.</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well and is all we hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>I really like this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast n leaves my hair</li>
            <li>I really like that I can adjust the heat setting</li>
            <li>Turns out she really likes it.</li>
            <li>A couple of other drawbacks from this method, though, is that I have a harder time keeping the curl (an issue most of you girls with naturally straight hair are familiar with) and that it is VERY time consuming!</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and at a high temp.  </li>
            <li>Gives hair nice volume and subtle waves.</li>
            <li>Its a must have very professional looking curls</li>
            <li>Curls were very soft</li>
            <li>Gets hot enough</li>
            <li>I still had a hard time smoothly styling each section of hair without feeling dried out, straying away from the more silky look</li>
            <li>they were nearly out of the Edward Detailer iron.  </li>
            <li>I use CHI&#x27;s Silk Infusion as a heat protectant before coming anywhere near my hair with any sort of heated tool, but I found even with that</li>
            <li>This caused my hair to lose a bit of volume, but as volume is something that tends to come naturally with my type of hair, I&#x27;m not too concerned with that.</li>
            <li>For those who need to get out the door early and beat traffic, this iron is a major time saver.</li>
            <li>It has an adjustable temperature control which on its lowest setting is 300 degrees, mid setting 375, and high setting 430.</li>
            <li>so it is not to high or to low</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend, especially for Twilight fans.</li>
            <li>these are bound to be a major hit this christmas!  </li>
            <li>the only drawback is that my curls don&#x27;t last all day like i really want them to.  </li>
            <li>it has a lot of heat settings which is a major plus.</li>
            <li>However, a way around the time issue is to wash and straighten your hair the night before and then just curl it in the morning; or, if you have curly/dry hair and wash your hair every other day, I&#x27;d recommend straightening it the first day and curling it the next.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the barrel size (as I&#x27;m not into smaller/tighter curls) because you can use it for a loose curl style or just to give your hair a bit of wave, instead of just being bone straight.</li>
            <li>I like the barrel size (as I&#x27;m not into smaller/tighter curls) because you can use it for a loose curl style or just to give your hair a bit of wave, instead of just being bone straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a Twilight fan at all, but a local store was changing stock, this was half-price, and I didn&#x27;t have this particular barrel size--a total impulse buy</li>
            <li>It allows me to choose an actual degree rather than low, medium, or high.</li>
            <li>i bought it last week at a local store where i live.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;ve gotten with certain other styling tools.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;ve gotten with certain other styling tools.</li>
            <li>has several left in stock , which actually surprised me a bit.</li>
            <li>have a full head of pretty thick, wavy curls and have struggled all my life trying to tame it.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty black cherry colored handle and the barrell has twilight  Limited Edition printed on it.</li>
            <li>I saw these limited edition styling products at Big Lots for $19 each and, admittedly, I&#x27;m into things that stray away from being generic; so, at first I scoffed at the Twilight-themed beauty products, but as the plating on my previous curling iron (that I&#x27;ve had for about 5 years) was starting to wear off, causing me anxiety to use it in fear of damaging my hair due to the exposed metal, I figured $19 for a new curling iron (even if it is Twilight) isn&#x27;t breaking my bank.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It has an adjustable temperature control which on its lowest setting is 300 degrees, mid setting 375, and high setting 430.</li>
            <li> so it is not to high or to low</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend, especially for Twilight fans.</li>

            <li> However, a way around the time issue is to wash and straighten your hair the night before and then just curl it in the morning; or, if you have curly/dry hair and wash your hair every other day, I&#x27;d recommend straightening it the first day and curling it the next.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the barrel size (as I&#x27;m not into smaller/tighter curls) because you can use it for a loose curl style or just to give your hair a bit of wave, instead of just being bone straight.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i bought it last week at a local store where i live.  ok , here&#x27;s my review.&lt;br /&gt;i love the way it looks.  it has a lot of heat settings which is a major plus. it can be used for any hair type because of the mulitple heat settings.  my hair is very difficult to curl because of it being so fine yet very thick.  i love that my hair curls easily with this product.  the curls stay too.  longer than some other brands of curling irons.  the only drawback is that my curls don&#x27;t last all day like i really want them to.  (lol)  the color purple that it comes in is simply gorgeous.  the handle is just right not too awkward to hold and definitely not slippery either. it has a nice feel to it over all.  i&#x27;m really glad i bought it before it sells out. these are bound to be a major hit this christmas!  the store where i bought it has several left in stock , which actually surprised me a bit. they were nearly out of the Edward Detailer iron.  i give this product 5 stars.  this curling iron is very good quality.  i hope it lasts a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> Amazing curling iron curls my hair very well heats up very fast good design cheap price I paid 20 bucks for well worth my money also come with cute styling card  I love it</li>
            <li> I needed a curling iron and when I came across this Twilight Limited Edition Ceramic Styling iron, my choice was made. I am a huge Twilight fan so I had to have it. It does create big loose waves like Bella&#x27;s hair in Breaking Dawn part 1. The curling iron&#x27;s barrel is approx 1 1/2\\&quot; in diameter. It has a pretty black cherry colored handle and the barrell has twilight  Limited Edition printed on it. It has an adjustable temperature control which on its lowest setting is 300 degrees, mid setting 375, and high setting 430. It can be set in between the temps, there is a series of 5 dots in between the 300 to 375 and 5 dots in between 375 to 430 setting. When the curling iron is plugged in it is automatically on and a red light will appear. It heats up within seconds and there is no automatic shut off. The cord is 9ft long and is softer than the usual curling iron or blow dryer cord. It doesn&#x27;t kink up when you wrap it around the iron to store it. The curling iron handle is contoured and easy to use. If you want loose natural looking curls or want to create a little wave to your hair this is the perfect curling iron. With shorter layers it will give more of a curled look but still soft and natural looking. I love Twilight and love this curling iron, but if you are looking for a more pronounced tightly curled look then this isn&#x27;t for you. I also think this would be a nice edition for any tween or teen girl who is in to Twilight and likes curling their hair. Check out the Twilight Limited Edition brushes, too. They are awesome.</li>
            <li> The hair- curler is beautifully shaped. The color is dreamy. It heats up quickly. The large barrel gives full, soft curls, exactly like Bella&#x27;s in the movie. There&#x27;s a styling card in the package. There are videos online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, great product. Very happy with the iron.</li>
            <li> Love love this curling iron. Glad I bought it :-)</li>
            <li> Very good curling iron!</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well and is all we hoped it would be.  I would recommend this product again.  The colouring suits the product and is every girls dream if you are a fan of twilight.</li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron. It heats up pretty fast, and you can change the temperature setting. I usually use a straightener for my hair, so I am still getting used to using it and holding it so I don&#x27;t get burned. I would say that&#x27;s the only draw back, but it may just be user error. I feel like it also smooths hair while curling it. I would recommend this product to a friend :)</li>
            <li> I bought this item a few days ago, and I am very happy with it. I was looking for a not too expensive replacement curling iron that had a high enough heat setting and would work in my thick, long hair. This works great! It heats up quick, and really does produce a pretty curl.  I use it every day. I highly recommend for it&#x27;s ability to do what it says, and it looks really cool too. I like the purple and silver colors.</li>
            <li> I love it! Heats up fast n leaves my hair shiney n smooth. Easy to use and cleans us easily, cord storage is a breeze thanks to the brilliant Velcro strap. Great product for a great value!</li>
            <li> this curling iron is difficult to pull through hair.. hair stick to it I hate it.. doent work well at all</li>
            <li> It worked of about a year, a little less, then it shorted out and started sparking. Had to throw it out. It also has a tendency to burn your hair even if on the lowest heat setting.</li>
            <li> Awesome curling iron. Its a must have very professional looking curls</li>
            <li> Love it . I haven&#x27;t found a curler that works this good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a Twilight fan at all, but a local store was changing stock, this was half-price, and I didn&#x27;t have this particular barrel size--a total impulse buy but it was around $11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is awesome! Comfortable to hold, good temp control, didn&#x27;t singe or pull my hair, just a really good product. Curls were very soft but I was going for more volume at the roots than a mass of curls, and it delivered.</li>
            <li> For those who need to get out the door early and beat traffic, this iron is a major time saver. Heats quickly, fuss-free cord, easy to use. Gives hair nice volume and subtle waves. The color of the iron it is a deep plum purple, very true to the photos.  Good quality for the price, well-constructed, I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The wire is very long &amp; does not get twisted.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my daughter for Christmas and she just loved it.  She is a big twilight lover and was thrilled to receive it!</li>
            <li> All I can say is that if I were stuck on an island with electricity, I would want this styling iron with me.  It&#x27;s awesome!  I hadn&#x27;t used a curling iron in 14 years until this Thanksgiving because when I was 12 I grabbed the wrong end of a curling iron on Thanksgiving Day and ended up in the ER with 2nd degree burns, which hurt the worst by the way.  2nd degree burns are no joke and will scare you from using styling tools, trust me.  Anyway, the barrel on this thing is perfect for large curls.  I grab up my hair in large chunks and twirl them around this thing (WHICH HAS A TWIRLING CORD TO KEEP FROM GETTING TANGLED, OMG, NO WAY, YES!) and hold the hair there for 10 seconds.  Perfect curls in mere minutes.  There are options on this iron that will leave you wanting to use it every single day.  Yea, your typical on and off button... and you can choose the temperature with a range of over 100 degrees between the lowest and highest setting which is well over 400 degrees.  If you had to pay $40.00 for this curling iron, you wouldn&#x27;t regret it.  It is a great cheaply priced, expensively made styling tool that I recommend to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I hated this curling iron its the worse one i ever seen in my life. I don;t recommened anyone to buy it. It doesn&#x27;t curl your hair at all. its jus  not worth 17.99 to 30 bucks at all.</li>
            <li> Great iron. My hair is pin straight and really hard to curl, but this iron gives me great &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; waves.  Heats up fast and at a high temp.  I bought it because of the price, not because it was Twilight.</li>
            <li> I am a professional stylist and I have worked with many curling irons. I have to say this is an amazing curling iron. My clients at the salon I work at are very pleased with the type of curl it gives. With this curling iron it provides smooth non frizzy curls. My updos come out amazing and other stylist in the salon were amazed how good it is, so they purchased one to. You will be pleased with this curling iron as I am and my clients and fellow co workers. Love love it !!</li>
            <li> I needed a curling iron and being a huge twilight fan I decided to try this one. I ended up buying two because I wanted one a as a collector&#x27;s item. It worked so well!!!!! My curls were big beautiful waves. I got massive comments at work.</li>
            <li> LOVE this curling iron!  Perfect for nice, big curls and waves!</li>
            <li> The styling iron works great and looks cute.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron that I have ever owned.  Heats quickly and gives a really good curl to hair</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product from big lots for $19 and I love this curling iron! My favorite hot tools curling iron broke therefore I needed a replacement and this works just the same! Love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling because it had so many great reviews and I am happy to report that this curling is a keeper! I have always had a hard time to get my hair to take a curl and keep it but not anymore! I really like that I can adjust the heat setting so it is not to high or to low and I like the big barrel size since I do have long hair and can now get the long curls in it. you can adjust the temperature from 300 to 430 degrees but I recommend starting out on the low side and gradually adjusting the heat until you find the setting for the hair so as you don&#x27;t fry your hair and cause a lot of damage.  The cord is a good length so I can stand away from the mirror as I am styling with no issue and I like that there is a velcro wrap to keep the cord bundled up when I am not using it so I can put in a drawer and not clutter up my vanity top!! If you are looking for a good curling iron that is not going to break your wallet this is the one!!! Yes I would recommend  this to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not a fan of Twilight, but this is a decent little curling iron. I saw these limited edition styling products at Big Lots for $19 each and, admittedly, I&#x27;m into things that stray away from being generic; so, at first I scoffed at the Twilight-themed beauty products, but as the plating on my previous curling iron (that I&#x27;ve had for about 5 years) was starting to wear off, causing me anxiety to use it in fear of damaging my hair due to the exposed metal, I figured $19 for a new curling iron (even if it is Twilight) isn&#x27;t breaking my bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a full head of pretty thick, wavy curls and have struggled all my life trying to tame it. I still haven&#x27;t fallen in love with a single curling or flat iron, but I&#x27;ve found ones that make styling my hair more livable. I&#x27;ve used this curling iron a couple times after air drying to tame the frizz and give it a bit of style. It works alright, but not quite as good as my other iron had. I use CHI&#x27;s Silk Infusion as a heat protectant before coming anywhere near my hair with any sort of heated tool, but I found even with that I still had a hard time smoothly styling each section of hair without feeling dried out, straying away from the more silky look I desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently used this iron again after first flat ironing my hair and was slightly more impressed with the results. Since the frizz was already reduced from straightening it, I found it was a lot smoother and easier to curl each section. This caused my hair to lose a bit of volume, but as volume is something that tends to come naturally with my type of hair, I&#x27;m not too concerned with that. A couple of other drawbacks from this method, though, is that I have a harder time keeping the curl (an issue most of you girls with naturally straight hair are familiar with) and that it is VERY time consuming! However, a way around the time issue is to wash and straighten your hair the night before and then just curl it in the morning; or, if you have curly/dry hair and wash your hair every other day, I&#x27;d recommend straightening it the first day and curling it the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 Stars. It does a pretty good job for the price; it just requires a little bit more effort if you have thicker/curlier hair. It has adjustable heat settings, so you can accommodate your hair type. I like the barrel size (as I&#x27;m not into smaller/tighter curls) because you can use it for a loose curl style or just to give your hair a bit of wave, instead of just being bone straight. I like the design. And even on one of the highest settings I haven&#x27;t yet experienced that \\&quot;burning smell\\&quot; I&#x27;ve gotten with certain other styling tools. Good for your collection or nice to have on hand as a traveling iron, if you don&#x27;t like the idea of toting around your vastly more expensive one.ly/dry hair and wash your hair every other day, I&#x27;d recommend straightening it the first day and curling it the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 Stars.

            <li> Wife needed a curling iron in a pinch and this was the only one we could get overtighted and delivered on a Saturday. Turns out she really likes it. Gets hot enough</li>
            <li> I love the setting adjuster on the side of the handle. It allows me to choose an actual degree rather than low, medium, or high. This iron creates beautiful curls and waves. It heats and cools very quickly, hardly any wait time for either. Highly Recommend, especially for Twilight fans.</li>
            <li> I have healthy wavey hair, and the curls come out very frizzy. They also don&#x27;t last all day. I wish I would&#x27;ve bought a different one. QUALITY SUCKS!</li>
