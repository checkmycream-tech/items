            <li>We received this product at a discounted price for the purpose of unbiased testing and reviewing, and both agree that these are the best heavy-duty, industrial toenail clippers we have come across.</li>

            <li>These are nearly perfect.</li>

            <li>and they really do work great.</li>
            <li>More of a wire cutter.  </li>
            <li>a built-in locking mechanism to make the clippers more compact and safe for storage when they are not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like how the handle is ergonomic and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The spring is not too strong.</li>
            <li>Fine quality on an item that sells retail for twice the price..</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, which is perfect for removing toenails and getting into the smallest nooks and crannies to clean out lint/</li>
            <li>This is HUGE.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product that works effectively and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>handles are long and easy to grip, so our hands have good control over the clippers.</li>
            <li>The functionality is incredible, but the aesthetic can be a turn-off to those who are not familiar with these kinds of heavy-duty clippers.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, it feels good, it cuts well, it is very well made but it is also one day old, in my possession.</li>

            <li>The Old Mountain Goat knows when I find something really good - 5 Stars for Equinox International!</li>
            <li>Looks exactly how it looks on the picture.</li>
            <li>Non-rusting stainless won&#x27;t hold an edge.</li>
            <li>Really gets the ingrown edges of a nail.</li>
            <li>I got these heavy duty clippers at a discount in exchange for my honest review so here it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a great locking mechanism to help with safety, however I found it a bit difficult to get it unlocked.</li>
            <li>now I have a new job - opening these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are sharp, easy to squeeze so you can cut the nail without using every bit of strength you have, well packaged in a soft vinyl case, and the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>These cut cleanly; they don&#x27;t snag my woolen socks or feel rough after clipping.</li>
            <li>If this product was designed to be a little bit smaller and more delicate-looking, it would absolutely be a 5 star review hands</li>
            <li>As I said earlier, time will tell the absolute truth.</li>
            <li>Yes, these are a little bit intimidating and even scary-looking at first, but they actually work very well!</li>

            <li> the amount of clients who come in each day, this toenail clipper has really withstood the excessive amount of usage well.</li>
            <li> , becomes much easier, especially when trying to cut a thick toenail.</li>

            <li> To big, at least for my toe nails</li>
            <li> To begin with, this product LOOKS scary, but it&#x27;s actually very well designed and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well made and very sharp.  </li>
            <li> I compared it to the one I purchased a few years ago, and from my p.o.v., there is no comparison.</li>
            <li> It is heavy duty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used heavy curved toenail scissors for 35 years.</li>
            <li> They just haven&#x27;t been tough enough for my nails lately.</li>
            <li> heavy duty nail clipper is just what the MR. needs!</li>
            <li> A few have even been offended, thinking that we are implying they have thick or hard-to-work-with nails.</li>
            <li> to open for me, impossible for my wife.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clipped his thick toenails in a jiffy!</li>
            <li> If you have thick toenails you HAVE to get these!</li>
            <li> Cutting is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Opening them up, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li> Anyone that complains that they are awkward hasn&#x27;t cut their nails with scissors; now -that- is awkward.</li>
            <li> Have to hold at inconvenient and ialmost impossible angle.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I got these heavy duty clippers at a discount in exchange for my honest review so here it is. These clippers really are heavy duty they are quite heavy period actually. They are sharp and I did use them once and they really do work great. Recommend this for everyone but needs it especially girls getting their nails done and whatnot keeps your nails nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> Cutting is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Opening them up, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to open for me, impossible for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;So now I have a new job - opening these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They do work incredibly well though.</li>
            <li> This Heavy Duty Toenail Clipper is made very well. I compared it to the one I purchased a few years ago, and from my p.o.v., there is no comparison. The Equinox is a heavier grade of steel and I do like some added weight, since handling it, becomes much easier, especially when trying to cut a thick toenail. Time, will of course, tell and longevity is definitely a factor. I am hoping it will stay somewhat sharp, as the years move on. This is a major problem with most, if not all of them. If the steel is a very hard steel, then obviously, the cutters will stay sharper, much longer. In conclusion, it feels good, it cuts well, it is very well made but it is also one day old, in my possession. As I said earlier, time will tell the absolute truth.</li>
            <li> Well designed and sharp.  Good product.</li>
            <li> The Old Mountain Goat knows when I find something really good - 5 Stars for Equinox International!</li>
            <li> Not really a nail cutter at all.  More of a wire cutter.  Not that sharp, doesn&#x27;t do good job.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received this item during a promotion and all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This heavy duty nail clipper is just what the MR. needs! He has some stubborn toenails, and this thing (&lt;br /&gt;although looks a tad intimidating) does the trick. Clipped his thick toenails in a jiffy! It is heavy duty and I like how the handle is ergonomic and easy to use.</li>
            <li> To big, at least for my toe nails</li>
            <li> If you have thick toenails you HAVE to get these! They are sharp, easy to squeeze so you can cut the nail without using every bit of strength you have, well packaged in a soft vinyl case, and the price cannot be beat. Great product, price and delivery.</li>
            <li> Yes, these are a little bit intimidating and even scary-looking at first, but they actually work very well! My mom and I own a hair and nail studio, so we are quite familiar with different nail products. We received this product at a discounted price for the purpose of unbiased testing and reviewing, and both agree that these are the best heavy-duty, industrial toenail clippers we have come across. They are very sharp, which is perfect for removing toenails and getting into the smallest nooks and crannies to clean out lint/debris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles are long and easy to grip, so our hands have good control over the clippers. The spring and the interval distance between the handles is great for gripping, and there is a built-in locking mechanism to make the clippers more compact and safe for storage when they are not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4 1/2 star review instead of 5 is that because this clipper is larger than the typical toenail clipper, clients are always intimidated and scared of the employees using it on them. A few have even been offended, thinking that we are implying they have thick or hard-to-work-with nails. If this product was designed to be a little bit smaller and more delicate-looking, it would absolutely be a 5 star review hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the amount of clients who come in each day, this toenail clipper has really withstood the excessive amount of usage well. The functionality is incredible, but the aesthetic can be a turn-off to those who are not familiar with these kinds of heavy-duty clippers.</li>
            <li> Well made and very sharp.  They work!</li>
            <li> This is HUGE. Toenail clipper for an elephant I suppose</li>
            <li> Not a $45.00 precision doctor&#x27;s clipper, but it&#x27;ll last me 30 years (I&#x27;m 70). The finish is a bit rough... but the blades come together perfectly. I bought two pair; they are both nice. I&#x27;ve used heavy curved toenail scissors for 35 years. They just haven&#x27;t been tough enough for my nails lately. Some middle aged people like me have a doctor trim their nails; seriously. These are nearly perfect. Anyone that complains that they are awkward hasn&#x27;t cut their nails with scissors; now -that- is awkward. These cut cleanly; they don&#x27;t snag my woolen socks or feel rough after clipping. The spring is not too strong. The clip that holds them closed releases automatically when you squeeze them slightly. Let them dry thoroughly, and throw away the plastic pouch. Non-rusting stainless won&#x27;t hold an edge.</li>
            <li> I like the larger size because of my manly hands.</li>
            <li> Fine quality on an item that sells retail for twice the price..</li>
            <li> is not as advertised in that it will not reach all parts of nail on edge. Have to hold at inconvenient and ialmost impossible angle.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly how it looks on the picture. Really gets the ingrown edges of a nail.</li>
            <li> To begin with, this product LOOKS scary, but it&#x27;s actually very well designed and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a great locking mechanism to help with safety, however I found it a bit difficult to get it unlocked. This is a high quality product that works effectively and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive these toenail clippers at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
