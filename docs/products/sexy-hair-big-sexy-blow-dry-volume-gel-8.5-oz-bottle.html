            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I have the knack of it now and love this gel.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot, but I don&#x27;t love it, but maybe that&#x27;s because I need a haircut.</li>
            <li>Still better than mousse and things like that.</li>

            <li>is better for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS HAIR GEL.  </li>
            <li>IT MAKES MY HAIR CURL BETTER AND KEEP THE HOLD LONGER.</li>
            <li>I am thinking that maybe a hair thickener would work better for me.</li>
            <li>More of a styling aid as opposed to a holding gel.</li>
            <li>It does the trick in the morning and with my hair it stays for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the product and as I said I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>This product has helped my thinning hair have more body.</li>
            <li>I have had much better luck with their &amp;#34;Dense&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Root Pump Plus&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this hair gel to add texture to my hair while still leaving my hair flexible to the touch.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>this product is ok</li>
            <li>The gel is light weight and does its job!</li>
            <li>It is just as effective as that cheap guy gel.</li>
            <li>Maybe i will just reuse the pump bottle :)</li>
            <li>The product I received does not seem to be authentic.</li>
            <li>the squirt top will not work</li>
            <li>This product works okay for the most part.</li>
            <li>It okay though.</li>
            <li>so if you use it be sure to use a moisturizing or leave in conditioner to help alleviate dryness.</li>
            <li>I love this company.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more volume with  this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>Maybe you guys will have better luck.</li>
            <li>I had never used this line of products and wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work like I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>I love all the products.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for those that want more lift and fullness to their hair.</li>
            <li>I can even find this at CVS, but get a better deal through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would be better off with Pantene.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it and couldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li>My hair has the most volume ever.</li>
            <li>Loved the smell and almost bought this at ULTA at a higher price.  </li>
            <li>The root hair pump and the new volumizer is great.</li>
            <li>My fine follicles love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and it gives me a lot more volume.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and pictured and absolutely much more cost effective than purchasing in the salon or store.  </li>
            <li>(it looks heat damaged easily), so I had to figure something out.</li>
            <li>it helps give it volumn and easy to style my hair with this product</li>
            <li>I use it with my Big Sexy Shampoo and Conditioner and am 100 percent happy with the product line.</li>
            <li>it is really easy to use</li>
            <li>This product seems to work, easy to use and don&#x27;t forget to put it on the roots ....</li>
            <li>I  apply 1 pump before blow drying and helps my hair feel more full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cursed with baby fine hair, which is stubborn and doesn&#x27;t like to do what I want it to..</li>
            <li>(I have baby fine hair).  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it does exactly what I need to give my hair more body and umf when i blow-dry it</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of body to it.</li>
            <li>Adds volume to my fine hair</li>
            <li>perfwct product for my fine hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it for people with fine hair looking for lift.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve used all kinds of mouse and gel in order to give my fine hair some body.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair fuller and adds texture (i have fine hair).  </li>
            <li>Works fine but not one of the bests.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length fine hair &amp; have difficulty finding a product that can give it volume while still taming flyaways.</li>
            <li>I ordered this gel because I have fine, no body hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this gel, it makes my hair smell really good and gives a nice full volume look after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>One huge stipulation however-</li>
            <li>I have pretty normal hair anyways, but this does a great job and looks like i put a ton of teasing in.</li>
            <li>Smooth shipping &amp; transaction.</li>
            <li>I like the light feeling of a gel on my hair.</li>
            <li>do like how light weight this gel was</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li>Great product, definitely  recommended.</li>
            <li>The Best Product I&#x27;ve ever used for adding volume to limp hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I need to use a bit more of the product than others I&#x27;ve used, but I don&#x27;t mind because the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>I have loved Big Sexy hairsprays so decided to try this.</li>
            <li>This stuff left my air full &amp; looking great with NO product feel.</li>
            <li>wow the volume is fantastic, will be ordering many times over!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny! ...</li>
            <li>Have very fine straight hair</li>
            <li>This is a great product when I dry my hair.</li>
            <li>Plus, it rinses clean from my hair after shampooing.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>The volume it did give was nothing special or anything that made me go \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>You do have to work with it to get the right consistency, but once you do it will plump up your fine hair and help it hold style and curl.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I thought it was great, the second time I realized it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>didnt really get the bigg and sexy look</li>
            <li>No bad smells associated with this product.</li>
            <li>As long as I use just the right amount my hair looks great.</li>
            <li>Particularly, in areas where I need the most boost.</li>
            <li>Made my hair super crusty and greasy.</li>
            <li>The second bottle I purchased was ok was a GEL and is working ok.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before deciding to purchase the Big Sexy Hair Volume gel.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>I could barely get through my morning blow-drying routine before my hair took on a life of its own.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and gives it great volume.</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of volume products in the past and I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be any good.</li>
            <li>Now, on the way to work I run my car&#x27;s air on high with light heat and that seems to do the trick in a more gentle fashion,</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair, and this works wonders on my bob.</li>
            <li>i use this brand for my straight and baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The product works great - was leaking a little bit when delivered though.</li>
            <li>, it works great and you can pump a little or alot.</li>
            <li>Makes hair fuller and they look and stay fresh for days, just brush in the morning and fullness comes back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Makes my hair nice and big.</li>
            <li>My mother has thinning hair and can rarely use product in her hair.  </li>
            <li>This works 10 times better than the powder, and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair 10 times to get it completely out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and works great with other products.</li>
            <li>felt more like just a regular hair gel to me, nothing special, nothing that could justify me paying for another bottle..</li>
            <li>or i&#x27;m not using it right</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve noticed that right where I&#x27;m using it my scalp has been itchy.</li>
            <li>I use it right before I use my curling iron</li>
            <li>and I need the money to pay for the Doctors who are taking care of my right jaw that has been in severe pain for 3 decades.  </li>
            <li>with an Amazon subscription, the price is right.</li>
            <li>I loved that it didn&#x27;t way my hair down.</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase this product again!</li>
            <li>for HUGE volume, nothing beats Sexy Hair Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, really adds that extra oomph!!  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair &amp; an oily, sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>When I first used Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel, I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this at first, but now like it very much.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to find out yourself how much is appropriate for your hair, but you can apply a second pump as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first got this Gel as part of a \\&quot;Big Sexy Hair\\&quot; package at a hair salon.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>At first I had to keep testing the amount I used.</li>
            <li>i use it everytime after showering before blow drying and it really helps give me the volume i&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li>Love this when my hair is short.</li>
            <li>My first foray into using hair products and I like this a lot.  </li>
            <li>my wife threw it away after first use</li>
            <li>If you want BIG, no...HUGE Texas 1980&#x27;s hair, this is for you! :)</li>
            <li>Have been using this gel for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>it was Big Sexy Hair.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I am such a snob about being able to detect product in my hair.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s exactly what I have going on.</li>
            <li>I have long very fine lifeless hair, so to make it do anything</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in so much pain toward the Doctors, for example, Dr. Ayers, who told me my right ear is inflame and</li>
            <li>so it was flat where the hair is heaviest which is on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>Sure the Packaging is cute and easy to use pump, but not cute enough to buy again.</li>
            <li>I use the Sexy Hair Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel and it makes my hair easier to style and stay in place.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product because it makes my hair look twice as thick as it really is.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of the Big Sexy products and I really like thewm.</li>
            <li>I have a really sensitive skin and this is the first product that not only adds volume, but also is good for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle of sexy hair blow dry gel I purchased</li>
            <li>This product, however does nothing positive for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love all Big Sexy Hair products and I really like this even for just let my hair air dry to waves.</li>
            <li>The other product I have found useful is SExy</li>
            <li>far as the shipping of the product, one came just fine and the other had leakage on the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>However, in my most recent attempts to learn how to style hair, my primary goal was to give my roots a little more lift than I have naturally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with how my hair looks and feels after using just a little of this (I&#x27;d say I used about half a pump for my shoulder length locks).</li>
            <li>I just use a flat iron product and flat iron to smooth the top layer, and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, if anything, when I used it and blew my hair dry, my hair was straight, more lim, and thinner-feeling than ever.  </li>
            <li>This product works fine as your basic gel mouse</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product very highly.  </li>
            <li>I give three stars because it did help a little bit, but it just didn&#x27;t meet my own expectations.</li>
            <li>&amp; i actually have to wonder if it is the real product that i was sent, or just the bottle filled with something else.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Too much, and you&#x27;ll end up with the gelled hair look.</li>
            <li>I was really upset that I couldn&#x27;t find this product again</li>
            <li>This really does what it says.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t add much volume.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really add THAT much volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to preface this by saying that I have never been a very girly girl.</li>
            <li>This is one product that really works for volume.  </li>
            <li>It comes highly recommended by me, and I&#x27;m a hair snob!</li>
            <li>Product delivered fast.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that it gives as much volume as I would like.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but I think they need to be more careful in their wrapping.  </li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Sexy Hair Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel gives my hair the exact volume I need to give my hair a volume that last for days.  </li>
            <li>(I blow dry with my head down) love the shampoo and conditioner too : )</li>
            <li>If I use it to tame fly aways when I have a chignon it is essential tonyse sparingly or it will make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>I am in severe pain in both my right jaw and my right ear for the last 3 decades</li>
            <li>I have used other products which give much more volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, not sticky, and produces great body.  </li>
            <li>The new one is more watery but works almost the same, the old version made my thin hair more thick which I liked better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve yet find a dry shampoo or any kind of styling product prior</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get it cheaper than on amazon as far as i&#x27;m aware.</li>
            <li>It does not have the same texture and consistency of the Big and Sexy Volumizing Gel which I have purchased from other retailers on many occasions.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t build up on your hair and the keeps the static down.</li>
            <li>This gel seems to give a little lift to my fine hair, just right in the front.</li>
            <li>But if I use the gel first and then blow dry, I get much more volume when I want big hair days.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use whenever I want to have more volume, but will probably try something different next time for more volume and less itching.</li>
            <li>The older</li>
            <li>i surprised the first time I put it on wet hair after a shower, my hair was HUGE.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to those of you with &amp;#34;cat fur&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recomment it.</li>
            <li>and it does have a little more volume, but I haven&#x27;t seen drastic changes in volume.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the same as any gel.</li>
            <li>Those with normal to oily hair may not have this problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not sticky and heavy like most gels.  </li>
            <li>The nice volume stays for at least 2 days.</li>
            <li>My hair is always super soft, so when I use a product if it leaves my clean hair oily, stiff, or gunky...</li>
            <li>I use the Big Sexy Hair Blow Dry Volume Gel.</li>
            <li>But the sellers definitely sent this right away</li>
            <li>Great price and my hair is very thin, so if works for me it would work for anyone.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it before putting in hot rollers for some extra &#x27;umph&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This &#x27;new&#x27; formula makes my hair feel like hay/straw, or I have A LOT of hair spray in.</li>
            <li>Only problem was that the top was not screwed on tight and some of the product leaked out which didn&#x27;t make me very</li>
            <li>my hair is very soft..</li>
            <li>Holds my hairstyle throughout the day and does not have an overpowering scent which I am very sensitive to</li>
            <li>Now, I use a microfiber towel to wrap my hair after the shower to get as much water out as possible, then two squirts of Sexy Big Hair Blow Dry Gel.  </li>
            <li>and I need to have this product that I paid for and to please credit the money to the exact J.P. Morgan credit card it was paid for with with my permission only.  </li>
            <li>Only a tiny bit is needed and I only use it on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>not sticky, light weight, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different inexpensive products &amp; thought I needed to try a more expensive professional product this time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, for special occasions when you want a dramatic amount of volume, this product will get you there easily.</li>
            <li>I had tried a long succession of mousses, gels, and spritzes but could never get my hair to look right.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this in the hopes that I could give my fine hair a little added volume.</li>
            <li>No need to apply too much as a little is just fine.  </li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everyday, non-drying, volumizing, I prefer to use Redken&#x27;s Body Full Volume Spray (lots of fullness, without the dryness -- but it won&#x27;t get you as BIGGGGG as Big Sexy), or I use Wen&#x27;s Volumizing Spray (another nice volumizing product, but a bit less dramatic than the Redken -- but also</li>
            <li>I have found that less is more, especially close to my roots.</li>
            <li>Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel gives my hair the extra &amp;#34;ooomp&amp;#34; it needs to hold a style.  </li>
            <li>I think anyone can use this because its clear in color.</li>
            <li>Not only do I look like I have twice as much hair</li>
            <li>Definitely made my hair look much fuller and healthier.</li>
            <li>must say that the picture and description (the ingredients) are old version of this product.</li>
            <li>to help hold my natural curl.  </li>
            <li>Hair feels natural and not sticky.</li>
            <li>Never met a product that actually did work for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>have tried a lot of volumizers, and this one by far out performs them all.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want hair THAT big.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t flake.  </li>
            <li>Not sticky and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>the Volume Gods sent their powers directly to my hair.</li>
            <li>My routine is to blow dry first, then put hair gel on.</li>
            <li>i always look for products that will do something with my hair because its straight flat</li>
            <li>My hair goes flat with too much product.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that has very little body.  </li>
            <li>I do find that it makes my hair more coarse than usual</li>
            <li>most products leave my hair sticky and nasty but i love how this works and the shipping was fast!!</li>
            <li>The price was less than the local stores, and my shipping was free.  </li>
            <li>Wanted something light weight that wouldn&#x27;t be sticky if I decided to just scrunch in and let dry with minimal blow drying  </li>
            <li>I just put some more in everyday and blow dry it!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I add with other products to add a little more volume.</li>
            <li>This has worked well for me on my thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Mouse is generally easier to apply and don&#x27;t cause breakage.</li>
            <li>This product does give my thin stringy hair more body.  </li>
            <li>I have very thin straight hair, I also have the big sexy hair powder as well.</li>
            <li>just average volume like any other cheap volumizing mousse could accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did not loose a</li>
            <li>I do have long thick hair and this one gives me a good lift (since my hair is heavy too).</li>
            <li>His hair is always unruly but this not only gives it a little more texture, it also provides a little bit of hold</li>
            <li>I have long naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Each bottle lasts a long time (unless of course you&#x27;re doing a full hair application) so expect your investment to last you a few months-</li>
            <li>It works well with blow drying, keeps the frizzies down but didn&#x27;t really add volume.  </li>
            <li>It does not add any volume, in fact even using the tiniest amount seems to really weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>If I use to much it will weight it down and make my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li>About a year ago, my scalp started scaling (little round dandruff) in addition to just becoming oily 24 hours after washing.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel thicker and maintains a slight curl for a whole day.</li>
            <li>Fine hair is a tough balancing act</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY hair products over the years to try to make my hair look thick and full, including the really expensive salon products.</li>
            <li>7 minutes later my hair is dry, soft, and thicker.  </li>
            <li>Personally I let my hair dry naturally and then comb it through.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels light and not sticky at all, which I&#x27;ve found with other gels in the past.</li>
            <li>It is low weight if u have thin hair or fine hair.  </li>
            <li>only gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because I have naturally blonde hair, and this product makes my hair look a little more dull.  </li>

            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> I have the knack of it now and love this gel.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, but I don&#x27;t love it, but maybe that&#x27;s because I need a haircut.</li>
            <li> Still better than mousse and things like that.</li>

            <li> It does the trick in the morning and with my hair it stays for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love the product and as I said I have been using it for years.</li>

            <li> I have had much better luck with their &amp;#34;Dense&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Root Pump Plus&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li> I love to use this hair gel to add texture to my hair while still leaving my hair flexible to the touch.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> this product is ok</li>
            <li> The gel is light weight and does its job!</li>
            <li> It is just as effective as that cheap guy gel.</li>
            <li> Maybe i will just reuse the pump bottle :)</li>
            <li> The product I received does not seem to be authentic.</li>
            <li> the squirt top will not work</li>
            <li> This product works okay for the most part.</li>
            <li> It okay though.</li>
            <li> so if you use it be sure to use a moisturizing or leave in conditioner to help alleviate dryness.</li>
            <li> I love this company.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more volume with  this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> Maybe you guys will have better luck.</li>
            <li> I had never used this line of products and wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work like I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I love all the products.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for those that want more lift and fullness to their hair.</li>
            <li> I can even find this at CVS, but get a better deal through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would be better off with Pantene.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it and couldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> My hair has the most volume ever.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell and almost bought this at ULTA at a higher price.  </li>
            <li> The root hair pump and the new volumizer is great.</li>
            <li> My fine follicles love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and it gives me a lot more volume.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described and pictured and absolutely much more cost effective than purchasing in the salon or store.  </li>
            <li> (it looks heat damaged easily), so I had to figure something out.</li>
            <li> it helps give it volumn and easy to style my hair with this product</li>
            <li> I use it with my Big Sexy Shampoo and Conditioner and am 100 percent happy with the product line.</li>
            <li> it is really easy to use</li>
            <li> This product seems to work, easy to use and don&#x27;t forget to put it on the roots ....</li>
            <li> I  apply 1 pump before blow drying and helps my hair feel more full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cursed with baby fine hair, which is stubborn and doesn&#x27;t like to do what I want it to..</li>
            <li> (I have baby fine hair).  </li>
            <li> I love this product, it does exactly what I need to give my hair more body and umf when i blow-dry it</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of body to it.</li>
            <li> Adds volume to my fine hair</li>
            <li> perfwct product for my fine hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for people with fine hair looking for lift.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve used all kinds of mouse and gel in order to give my fine hair some body.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair fuller and adds texture (i have fine hair).  </li>
            <li> Works fine but not one of the bests.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length fine hair &amp; have difficulty finding a product that can give it volume while still taming flyaways.</li>
            <li> I ordered this gel because I have fine, no body hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this gel, it makes my hair smell really good and gives a nice full volume look after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> One huge stipulation however-</li>
            <li> I have pretty normal hair anyways, but this does a great job and looks like i put a ton of teasing in.</li>
            <li> Smooth shipping &amp; transaction.</li>
            <li> I like the light feeling of a gel on my hair.</li>
            <li> do like how light weight this gel was</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li> Great product, definitely  recommended.</li>
            <li> The Best Product I&#x27;ve ever used for adding volume to limp hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I need to use a bit more of the product than others I&#x27;ve used, but I don&#x27;t mind because the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have loved Big Sexy hairsprays so decided to try this.</li>
            <li> This stuff left my air full &amp; looking great with NO product feel.</li>
            <li> wow the volume is fantastic, will be ordering many times over!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny! ...</li>
            <li> Have very fine straight hair</li>
            <li> This is a great product when I dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Plus, it rinses clean from my hair after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> The volume it did give was nothing special or anything that made me go \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> You do have to work with it to get the right consistency, but once you do it will plump up your fine hair and help it hold style and curl.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I thought it was great, the second time I realized it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> didnt really get the bigg and sexy look</li>
            <li> No bad smells associated with this product.</li>
            <li> As long as I use just the right amount my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Particularly, in areas where I need the most boost.</li>
            <li> Made my hair super crusty and greasy.</li>
            <li> The second bottle I purchased was ok was a GEL and is working ok.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before deciding to purchase the Big Sexy Hair Volume gel.</li>
            <li> I like it very much!</li>
            <li> I could barely get through my morning blow-drying routine before my hair took on a life of its own.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and gives it great volume.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of volume products in the past and I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be any good.</li>
            <li> Now, on the way to work I run my car&#x27;s air on high with light heat and that seems to do the trick in a more gentle fashion,</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine hair, and this works wonders on my bob.</li>
            <li> i use this brand for my straight and baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The product works great - was leaking a little bit when delivered though.</li>
            <li> , it works great and you can pump a little or alot.</li>
            <li> Makes hair fuller and they look and stay fresh for days, just brush in the morning and fullness comes back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Makes my hair nice and big.</li>
            <li> My mother has thinning hair and can rarely use product in her hair.  </li>
            <li> This works 10 times better than the powder, and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair 10 times to get it completely out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight and works great with other products.</li>
            <li> felt more like just a regular hair gel to me, nothing special, nothing that could justify me paying for another bottle..</li>
            <li> or i&#x27;m not using it right</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve noticed that right where I&#x27;m using it my scalp has been itchy.</li>
            <li> I use it right before I use my curling iron</li>
            <li> and I need the money to pay for the Doctors who are taking care of my right jaw that has been in severe pain for 3 decades.  </li>
            <li> with an Amazon subscription, the price is right.</li>
            <li> I loved that it didn&#x27;t way my hair down.</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> for HUGE volume, nothing beats Sexy Hair Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, really adds that extra oomph!!  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair &amp; an oily, sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> When I first used Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel, I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at first, but now like it very much.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to find out yourself how much is appropriate for your hair, but you can apply a second pump as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first got this Gel as part of a \\&quot;Big Sexy Hair\\&quot; package at a hair salon.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> At first I had to keep testing the amount I used.</li>
            <li> i use it everytime after showering before blow drying and it really helps give me the volume i&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li> Love this when my hair is short.</li>
            <li> My first foray into using hair products and I like this a lot.  </li>
            <li> my wife threw it away after first use</li>
            <li> If you want BIG, no...HUGE Texas 1980&#x27;s hair, this is for you! :)</li>
            <li> Have been using this gel for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li> it was Big Sexy Hair.  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I am such a snob about being able to detect product in my hair.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s exactly what I have going on.</li>
            <li> I have long very fine lifeless hair, so to make it do anything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in so much pain toward the Doctors, for example, Dr. Ayers, who told me my right ear is inflame and</li>
            <li> so it was flat where the hair is heaviest which is on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> Sure the Packaging is cute and easy to use pump, but not cute enough to buy again.</li>
            <li> I use the Sexy Hair Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel and it makes my hair easier to style and stay in place.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product because it makes my hair look twice as thick as it really is.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of the Big Sexy products and I really like thewm.</li>
            <li> I have a really sensitive skin and this is the first product that not only adds volume, but also is good for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle of sexy hair blow dry gel I purchased</li>
            <li> This product, however does nothing positive for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love all Big Sexy Hair products and I really like this even for just let my hair air dry to waves.</li>
            <li> The other product I have found useful is SExy</li>
            <li> far as the shipping of the product, one came just fine and the other had leakage on the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> However, in my most recent attempts to learn how to style hair, my primary goal was to give my roots a little more lift than I have naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with how my hair looks and feels after using just a little of this (I&#x27;d say I used about half a pump for my shoulder length locks).</li>
            <li> I just use a flat iron product and flat iron to smooth the top layer, and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, if anything, when I used it and blew my hair dry, my hair was straight, more lim, and thinner-feeling than ever.  </li>
            <li> This product works fine as your basic gel mouse</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product very highly.  </li>
            <li> I give three stars because it did help a little bit, but it just didn&#x27;t meet my own expectations.</li>
            <li> &amp; i actually have to wonder if it is the real product that i was sent, or just the bottle filled with something else.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Too much, and you&#x27;ll end up with the gelled hair look.</li>
            <li> I was really upset that I couldn&#x27;t find this product again</li>
            <li> This really does what it says.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t add much volume.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really add THAT much volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to preface this by saying that I have never been a very girly girl.</li>
            <li> This is one product that really works for volume.  </li>
            <li> It comes highly recommended by me, and I&#x27;m a hair snob!</li>
            <li> Product delivered fast.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it gives as much volume as I would like.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but I think they need to be more careful in their wrapping.  </li>
            <li> It really works</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Sexy Hair Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel gives my hair the exact volume I need to give my hair a volume that last for days.  </li>
            <li> (I blow dry with my head down) love the shampoo and conditioner too : )</li>
            <li> If I use it to tame fly aways when I have a chignon it is essential tonyse sparingly or it will make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I am in severe pain in both my right jaw and my right ear for the last 3 decades</li>
            <li> I have used other products which give much more volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, not sticky, and produces great body.  </li>
            <li> The new one is more watery but works almost the same, the old version made my thin hair more thick which I liked better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve yet find a dry shampoo or any kind of styling product prior</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it cheaper than on amazon as far as i&#x27;m aware.</li>
            <li> It does not have the same texture and consistency of the Big and Sexy Volumizing Gel which I have purchased from other retailers on many occasions.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t build up on your hair and the keeps the static down.</li>
            <li> This gel seems to give a little lift to my fine hair, just right in the front.</li>
            <li> But if I use the gel first and then blow dry, I get much more volume when I want big hair days.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use whenever I want to have more volume, but will probably try something different next time for more volume and less itching.</li>
            <li> The older</li>
            <li> i surprised the first time I put it on wet hair after a shower, my hair was HUGE.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to those of you with &amp;#34;cat fur&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recomment it.</li>
            <li> and it does have a little more volume, but I haven&#x27;t seen drastic changes in volume.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the same as any gel.</li>
            <li> Those with normal to oily hair may not have this problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and heavy like most gels.  </li>
            <li> The nice volume stays for at least 2 days.</li>
            <li> My hair is always super soft, so when I use a product if it leaves my clean hair oily, stiff, or gunky...</li>
            <li> I use the Big Sexy Hair Blow Dry Volume Gel.</li>
            <li> But the sellers definitely sent this right away</li>
            <li> Great price and my hair is very thin, so if works for me it would work for anyone.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it before putting in hot rollers for some extra &#x27;umph&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;new&#x27; formula makes my hair feel like hay/straw, or I have A LOT of hair spray in.</li>
            <li> Only problem was that the top was not screwed on tight and some of the product leaked out which didn&#x27;t make me very</li>
            <li> my hair is very soft..</li>
            <li> Holds my hairstyle throughout the day and does not have an overpowering scent which I am very sensitive to</li>
            <li> Now, I use a microfiber towel to wrap my hair after the shower to get as much water out as possible, then two squirts of Sexy Big Hair Blow Dry Gel.  </li>
            <li> and I need to have this product that I paid for and to please credit the money to the exact J.P. Morgan credit card it was paid for with with my permission only.  </li>
            <li> Only a tiny bit is needed and I only use it on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> not sticky, light weight, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different inexpensive products &amp; thought I needed to try a more expensive professional product this time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, for special occasions when you want a dramatic amount of volume, this product will get you there easily.</li>
            <li> I had tried a long succession of mousses, gels, and spritzes but could never get my hair to look right.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this in the hopes that I could give my fine hair a little added volume.</li>
            <li> No need to apply too much as a little is just fine.  </li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everyday, non-drying, volumizing, I prefer to use Redken&#x27;s Body Full Volume Spray (lots of fullness, without the dryness -- but it won&#x27;t get you as BIGGGGG as Big Sexy), or I use Wen&#x27;s Volumizing Spray (another nice volumizing product, but a bit less dramatic than the Redken -- but also</li>
            <li> I have found that less is more, especially close to my roots.</li>
            <li> Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel gives my hair the extra &amp;#34;ooomp&amp;#34; it needs to hold a style.  </li>
            <li> I think anyone can use this because its clear in color.</li>
            <li> Not only do I look like I have twice as much hair</li>
            <li> Definitely made my hair look much fuller and healthier.</li>
            <li> must say that the picture and description (the ingredients) are old version of this product.</li>
            <li> to help hold my natural curl.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels natural and not sticky.</li>
            <li> Never met a product that actually did work for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> have tried a lot of volumizers, and this one by far out performs them all.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want hair THAT big.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t flake.  </li>
            <li> Not sticky and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> the Volume Gods sent their powers directly to my hair.</li>
            <li> My routine is to blow dry first, then put hair gel on.</li>
            <li> i always look for products that will do something with my hair because its straight flat</li>
            <li> My hair goes flat with too much product.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that has very little body.  </li>
            <li> I do find that it makes my hair more coarse than usual</li>
            <li> most products leave my hair sticky and nasty but i love how this works and the shipping was fast!!</li>
            <li> The price was less than the local stores, and my shipping was free.  </li>
            <li> Wanted something light weight that wouldn&#x27;t be sticky if I decided to just scrunch in and let dry with minimal blow drying  </li>
            <li> I just put some more in everyday and blow dry it!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I add with other products to add a little more volume.</li>
            <li> This has worked well for me on my thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Mouse is generally easier to apply and don&#x27;t cause breakage.</li>
            <li> This product does give my thin stringy hair more body.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin straight hair, I also have the big sexy hair powder as well.</li>
            <li> just average volume like any other cheap volumizing mousse could accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did not loose a</li>
            <li> I do have long thick hair and this one gives me a good lift (since my hair is heavy too).</li>
            <li> His hair is always unruly but this not only gives it a little more texture, it also provides a little bit of hold</li>
            <li> I have long naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Each bottle lasts a long time (unless of course you&#x27;re doing a full hair application) so expect your investment to last you a few months-</li>
            <li> It works well with blow drying, keeps the frizzies down but didn&#x27;t really add volume.  </li>
            <li> It does not add any volume, in fact even using the tiniest amount seems to really weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> If I use to much it will weight it down and make my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> About a year ago, my scalp started scaling (little round dandruff) in addition to just becoming oily 24 hours after washing.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel thicker and maintains a slight curl for a whole day.</li>
            <li> Fine hair is a tough balancing act</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY hair products over the years to try to make my hair look thick and full, including the really expensive salon products.</li>
            <li> 7 minutes later my hair is dry, soft, and thicker.  </li>
            <li> Personally I let my hair dry naturally and then comb it through.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels light and not sticky at all, which I&#x27;ve found with other gels in the past.</li>
            <li> It is low weight if u have thin hair or fine hair.  </li>
            <li> only gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because I have naturally blonde hair, and this product makes my hair look a little more dull.  </li>
            <li> I put it in my hair when it&#x27;s wet and blow it dry to increase volume before I finish off with a high hold matte paste.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, half the size of the last, exact product I ordered but was the same cost.</li>
            <li> If you focus application on the roots however and use the right amount, you can hardly feel it once it dries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Big Sexy Hair products are a miracle for my hair, which is very thin because of health issues.  </li>
            <li> my hair still looks flat the next day.</li>
            <li> I dry with a large round brush.  </li>
            <li> considering I paid nearly $20 for the bottle, it still was not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, this regiment meant extremely flat hair-</li>
            <li> My hair was looking as flat as it did on my no-wash days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product and last long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product makes my hair fly-away and/or flat.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but it tends to fall flat because of its texture.  </li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> , it left no residue, wasn&#x27;t sticky, no scent and after my hair was dry</li>
            <li> I have super thin hair.</li>
            <li> This only gave my hair a very small amount of volume and not even at the roots where I really need help.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my hair like some other products do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to it, I&#x27;m having a hard time manuvering around with this much volume on my head...</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way....if you use too much, then it tends to weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> maybe because i have really long hair</li>
            <li> I will attest that the volume holds all day long without being crunchy.  </li>
            <li> And it lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and after sleeping on my hair the only thng I could do was wash it again, everyday!</li>
            <li> With just one pump, it will transform my &amp;#34;long thick, HEAVY, weighted down at the crown&amp;#34; hair into BIG, FULL,</li>
            <li> and if I blow dry it after showering, I look like Thing 1 or Thing 2.  </li>
            <li> but i spread it through my roots and halfway through my hair and blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> one squirt works for my blow dry</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair dry or frizzy looking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair but just apply it over damp hair and leave it that way.</li>
            <li> Just throw it in and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> IT DOESNT DRY MY HAIR OUT EITHER.</li>
            <li> I apply it with damp hair, let it air dry while putting on my makeup then blow dry the rest of the way before putting in the rollers.</li>
            <li> you apply this to damp hair, massage through out then blow dry.</li>
            <li> and I swear it makes my hair dry faster.  </li>
            <li> However, after a month of using it, I noticed my hair started feeling dry and then the ends of my hair started sticking up.  </li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair tangled and dry looking.</li>
            <li> I even use it if I&#x27;m not going to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I used it after I took a shower then blow dry it.</li>
            <li> As someone that suffers with flat fine hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a smell, good or bad and the texture is somewhere between a gel and plain water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and buying it thru Amazon and using prime makes it less expensive than buying it in a salon.</li>
            <li> use it on a wet hair, one pump in the crown of the head, blow dry</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair feeling very dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li> It could be due to the fact that I&#x27;m pregnant and nothing seems to be working for my hair right now, but it made my hair feel heavy, dirty, and hard to brush.</li>
            <li> Too bad they&#x27;re not making this product any more - buy while you can.</li>
            <li> Sleek when I want it sleek, big and fluffy when I want a throwback look.</li>
            <li> You can feel the thickness when your hair is still wet</li>
            <li> when wet.  </li>
            <li> Even with my very long hair, a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> It gives me enough control without being too stiff.</li>
            <li> I rub this into my root, flip my hair upside down and blow dry.</li>
            <li> it did not weigh my hair down or dry it out, but</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine hair that always fell flat within an hour of being washed and dried.</li>
            <li> I use just a small amount of this (if you use more than a pea-sized amount, hair tends to look dirty and stringy, so that is a drawback), at the roots before drying.  </li>
            <li> I just just a small amount on my barely damp hair and blow dry for a few minutes..</li>
            <li> A little of this gel goes a long way.</li>

            <li> the product was shipped with my other purchases, so packing was done well.  </li>
            <li> This product allows me to wash every other day</li>
            <li> I like their other products though.</li>
            <li> not sure if i would  buy this again my hair dresser actually reccomended this product</li>
            <li> I use other products from this line...suck as the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped that this gel would help me attain this goal, but even though it did help a little bit, I was not a fan of the dry crackly texture my roots had after I was done blowdrying.</li>
            <li> Just one little pump of the bottle into your palm, and work the gel into the roots of your hair -- blow dry while you style and it gives the roots of the hair some substance.  </li>
            <li> Works well for my flat hair though there is a small learning curve to using this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s no miracle, but it works and it&#x27;s a lot less invasive than other volumizing products.</li>
            <li> Not worth my time to return the product.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have rather thin hair, and I like this product because it gives me that extra volume that I want after a blow dry, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> In fact, after an hour or two it just seems to weigh my hair down.</li>

            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s worse than some.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get any of it out because the pump is broken.</li>
            <li> I could go buy another pump but that would mean I have to leave my house and amazon prime has rendered my legs useless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have fine hair &amp; an oily, sensitive scalp. About a year ago, my scalp started scaling (little round dandruff) in addition to just becoming oily 24 hours after washing. It got so bad I had to stop using my volumizing shampoos, which were drying out my scalp and worsening the condition. All I can use now is a medicated dandruff shampoo and moisturizing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this regiment meant extremely flat hair- and that was not going to fly! My hair was looking as flat as it did on my no-wash days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a solution. One huge stipulation however- I *hate* the feeling of product in my hair. It&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve yet find a dry shampoo or any kind of styling product prior (that includes BSH&#x27;s Root Pump!). Sprays and aerosols always change the feel and consistency of my hair, making it feel matted and gunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this in Target and bought it on a whim. I actually don&#x27;t blow dry my hair (it looks heat damaged easily), so I had to figure something out. Now, on the way to work I run my car&#x27;s air on high with light heat and that seems to do the trick in a more gentle fashion, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, even if I let it just airdry, this gel still helps boost my roots. I pump a quarter-sized amount and spread it among my fingertips, then run them repeatedly through my roots about my head- combing about an inch up from my scalp. Particularly, in areas where I need the most boost. You&#x27;ll have to find out yourself how much is appropriate for your hair, but you can apply a second pump as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too much, and you&#x27;ll end up with the gelled hair look. Too little, and there&#x27;s no effect. If you focus application on the roots however and use the right amount, you can hardly feel it once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s no miracle, but it works and it&#x27;s a lot less invasive than other volumizing products. Each bottle lasts a long time (unless of course you&#x27;re doing a full hair application) so expect your investment to last you a few months- atTarget I paid almost $20 for a bottle, so this is a great price in comparison.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cursed with baby fine hair, which is stubborn and doesn&#x27;t like to do what I want it to.. I&#x27;m really impressed with how my hair looks and feels after using just a little of this (I&#x27;d say I used about half a pump for my shoulder length locks). Not only do I look like I have twice as much hair as I usually do, it&#x27;s shiny and a lot of the flyaways have been tamed - even on a humid June day.  It feels light and not sticky at all, which I&#x27;ve found with other gels in the past. Highly recommend to those of you with &amp;#34;cat fur&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Gel for a few months.  It is a great product because it makes my hair look twice as thick as it really is.</li>
            <li> Have used this for some time, and this has been repeat order.  Great price and my hair is very thin, so if works for me it would work for anyone.</li>
            <li> Do not buy it drys out your hair and make it very difficult to brush the next day don&#x27;t think I will be buying ever again very disappointed</li>
            <li> Definitely made my hair look much fuller and healthier. Gave me more body than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before. Will be my go to gel from now on. Smooth shipping &amp; transaction. Will be reordering.</li>
            <li> Luv it. Perfect if you want a soft, lighter hold. I have straight, fine hair, and this works wonders on my bob. Sleek when I want it sleek, big and fluffy when I want a throwback look. It&#x27;s the only gel I use.</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine hair that always fell flat within an hour of being washed and dried. This product makes my hair feel thicker and maintains a slight curl for a whole day. It&#x27;s the best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I first got this Gel as part of a \\&quot;Big Sexy Hair\\&quot; package at a hair salon.  I loved that it didn&#x27;t way my hair down. (I have baby fine hair).  I was really upset that I couldn&#x27;t find this product again so I finally ordered this online because it is \\&quot;THAT GOOD\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This really does what it says.  My hair is fully and bouncy.  I love it.</li>
            <li> My fine follicles love this stuff.  I have hair just past the shoulders and if I blow dry it after showering, I look like Thing 1 or Thing 2.  Now, I use a microfiber towel to wrap my hair after the shower to get as much water out as possible, then two squirts of Sexy Big Hair Blow Dry Gel.  7 minutes later my hair is dry, soft, and thicker.  I just use a flat iron product and flat iron to smooth the top layer, and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband also uses this.  His hair is always unruly but this not only gives it a little more texture, it also provides a little bit of hold so he comes home from work with his hair still looking like he just left the house.  No wing tips or exposed thin areas, either.</li>
            <li> This product works fine as your basic gel mouse but it doesn&#x27;t add much volume. In fact, after an hour or two it just seems to weigh my hair down. Use sparingly and don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> Does its job. I rub this into my root, flip my hair upside down and blow dry. Works well for my flat hair though there is a small learning curve to using this product.</li>
            <li> Provides volume for styling as well</li>
            <li> maybe because i have really long hair or i&#x27;m not using it right but i spread it through my roots and halfway through my hair and blow dry my hair and it doesn&#x27;t really add THAT much volume. my hair still looks flat the next day.</li>
            <li> hsve used for several years. a good product for fine hair</li>
            <li> As someone that suffers with flat fine hair I was skeptical of this product, but I must say that it has delivered. You do have to work with it to get the right consistency, but once you do it will plump up your fine hair and help it hold style and curl.</li>
            <li> one squirt works for my blow dry and I think it&#x27;s definitely working and it was a good buy compared to retail.</li>
            <li> i always look for products that will do something with my hair because its straight flat and i hate it! most products leave my hair sticky and nasty but i love how this works and the shipping was fast!! i received my package in 2 days. i highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to preface this by saying that I have never been a very girly girl. I have been known on multiple occasions to chop my hair off pixie-cut style to avoid having to deal with the hassle of styling. However, in my most recent attempts to learn how to style hair, my primary goal was to give my roots a little more lift than I have naturally. (As my hair is very thick and heavy, it is not as inclined to rise up as it is to drag down.) I had hoped that this gel would help me attain this goal, but even though it did help a little bit, I was not a fan of the dry crackly texture my roots had after I was done blowdrying. I&#x27;m not really sure what the stars use to get their hair to defy gravity like it does, but this stuff isn&#x27;t it. I give three stars because it did help a little bit, but it just didn&#x27;t meet my own expectations.</li>
            <li> The product worked, the dispenser did not.  Irritated that I must remove cap everytime I want to use the gel.</li>
            <li> I have rather thin hair, and I like this product because it gives me that extra volume that I want after a blow dry, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Delivery is awful.  The lids were not on tight.... thus I lost part of the product.  Not worth my time to return the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many volumizing products but this one rocks! Makes hair fuller and they look and stay fresh for days, just brush in the morning and fullness comes back.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on a wet hair, one pump in the crown of the head, blow dry and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product and last long time.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that the picture and description (the ingredients) are old version of this product. The new one is more watery but works almost the same, the old version made my thin hair more thick which I liked better.</li>
            <li> the product was shipped with my other purchases, so packing was done well.  The price was less than the local stores, and my shipping was free.  Great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for several months and like it.  It doesn&#x27;t build up on your hair and the keeps the static down.</li>
            <li> A little of this gel goes a long way. At first I had to keep testing the amount I used. Too much and styling was difficult and too little was a waste of product and the the time it took to style my hair. I have the knack of it now and love this gel.</li>
            <li> A lot of product, way cheaper than the grocery store (I compared). Can&#x27;t get it cheaper than on amazon as far as i&#x27;m aware. The product works great - was leaking a little bit when delivered though. Makes my hair nice and big. I like it a lot, but I don&#x27;t love it, but maybe that&#x27;s because I need a haircut. Still better than mousse and things like that.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! I have thin, fine hair and after sleeping on my hair the only thng I could do was wash it again, everyday! This product allows me to wash every other day I just put some more in everyday and blow dry it! It saves on my coloring too!! THIS STUFF ROCKS!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Product arrived on time. I like the light feeling of a gel on my hair. I know there is no product that is going to make my hair thick again but this product gives the illusion of thickness. It provides volume with no stickiness or extra weight. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair dry or frizzy looking.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of volume products in the past and I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be any good. Boy was i surprised the first time I put it on wet hair after a shower, my hair was HUGE. I have pretty normal hair anyways, but this does a great job and looks like i put a ton of teasing in. Love it!</li>
            <li> Definitely increases hair volume. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair but just apply it over damp hair and leave it that way. Whenever I got out, I just have to comb it and the hair volume just explodes. The only drawback is that it&#x27;s gel based. Mouse is generally easier to apply and don&#x27;t cause breakage.</li>
            <li> Made my hair super crusty and greasy. I must be doing it wrong.For now I am not the biggest fan but I might have to try it again later.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  You do not need a lot of the product to achieve volume, and I have had compliments on my hair when styled with this.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent for adding volume to fine hair.  love..love..love</li>
            <li> Best volumizing product I have found. Does not dry out my hair like some other products do. I use it after every shampoo.</li>
            <li> so far so good. i use it everytime after showering before blow drying and it really helps give me the volume i&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li> Love this when my hair is short. Gives me tones of body.</li>
            <li> Makes my scalp itich, wd like to return it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or leave a lot of residue on my hair but definitely gives it volume.</li>
            <li> I have loved Big Sexy hairsprays so decided to try this. Made my hair feel dirty and dried out, even when using a very small amount. Didn&#x27;t notice a hug difference in volume either. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> My first foray into using hair products and I like this a lot.  Works best for the top and back of my hair ... if it gets in the front, it makes the bangs look a bit greasy after a day ...</li>
            <li> My friend is a cosmetologist.  I hate him for giving me this sample lol.  It is low weight if u have thin hair or fine hair.  My hair goes flat with too much product.  It is affordable.  Just throw it in and blow dry.  I will attest that the volume holds all day long without being crunchy.  My mother has thinning hair and can rarely use product in her hair.  This is one product that really works for volume.  It comes highly recommended by me, and I&#x27;m a hair snob!</li>
            <li> I have super thin hair. However, this helps adds volume to my hair. And it&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and it gives me a lot more volume.  I would recommend this product very highly.  My hair is short and I used to use a curling iron on it and I don&#x27;t have to which is better for my hair.  All I have to do is put it on my hair after I shampoo it and style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was on time.  Only problem was that the top was not screwed on tight and some of the product leaked out which didn&#x27;t make me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still giving it five stars because of the product but delivery I would have given two stars.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with products weighing my think hair down. This did not. It added a little body and volume to my limp hair.  Recommend it. Sometimes I add with other products to add a little more volume.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ll stick with my Pantene gel. Just made my hair heavy and limp. I like their other products though.</li>
            <li> You think I&#x27;d learn...I got no extra fullness or body from this product. It&#x27;s no better than any other volumizing product I&#x27;ve ever tried. In fact, it&#x27;s worse than some. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does exactly what I need to give my hair more body and umf when i blow-dry it</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS HAIR GEL.  IT MAKES MY HAIR THICKER AND IT HOLDS GOOD BUT IT ISNT A STIFF HOLD. IT MAKES MY HAIR CURL BETTER AND KEEP THE HOLD LONGER. IT DOESNT DRY MY HAIR OUT EITHER. IT MAKES MY HAIR LOOK HEALTHY!!</li>
            <li> Use this product in my hair almost every day.  It gives it good volume and makes it easy to manage.</li>
            <li> terrible! my wife threw it away after first use</li>
            <li> It seems like an ordinary hair gel to me. Nothing special. Not even a volume on my hair. It&#x27;s trash.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me, so I returned it. I am thinking that maybe a hair thickener would work better for me.</li>
            <li> this stuff did nothing for my hair.  does not give extra volume only makes my hair even flatter.  use very little on the roots and hair and it still does nothing.  zero volume.</li>
            <li> This gel seems to give a little lift to my fine hair, just right in the front. Although I&#x27;ve noticed that right where I&#x27;m using it my scalp has been itchy. I think whatever the ingredient is that is supposed to make the hair &#x27;volumized&#x27; is drying out that part of my scalp.It doesn&#x27;t have a smell, good or bad and the texture is somewhere between a gel and plain water. I like the pump, it works great and you can pump a little or alot. I will continue to use whenever I want to have more volume, but will probably try something different next time for more volume and less itching.</li>
            <li> This only gave my hair a very small amount of volume and not even at the roots where I really need help. The volume it did give was nothing special or anything that made me go \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;...it was just...\\&quot;meh\\&quot;,  just average volume like any other cheap volumizing mousse could accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;I do like how light weight this gel was, it left no residue, wasn&#x27;t sticky, no scent and after my hair was dry it did not weigh my hair down or dry it out, but considering I paid nearly $20 for the bottle, it still was not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;This felt more like just a regular hair gel to me, nothing special, nothing that could justify me paying for another bottle..it&#x27;s just a disappointment. I&#x27;m still debating whether or not I even want to keep the bottle or try and return it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this gives the perfect boost in volume while leaving my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Wanted something light weight that wouldn&#x27;t be sticky if I decided to just scrunch in and let dry with minimal blow drying  to help hold my natural curl.  Loved the smell and almost bought this at ULTA at a higher price.  It works well with blow drying, keeps the frizzies down but didn&#x27;t really add volume.  Pros- not sticky, light weight, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  Cons-not a gel that will hold any type of &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look.  More of a styling aid as opposed to a holding gel.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I thought it was great, the second time I realized it wasn&#x27;t for me. It could be due to the fact that I&#x27;m pregnant and nothing seems to be working for my hair right now, but it made my hair feel heavy, dirty, and hard to brush. It was a tangled mess after being at work for a few hours and looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in days. Im gonna hang on to this and see if it works post baby though.</li>
            <li> It is awful. This &#x27;new&#x27; formula makes my hair feel like hay/straw, or I have A LOT of hair spray in. My hair also tangles like crazy when using this. Not something I would ever recommend.</li>
            <li> This gel is awesome!  I have thin, flat hair and this gel doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Just a little amount will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a beauty supply store based on a recommendation from the clerk.  After using it 4 or 5 times, i finally just threw the bottle away.  It did nothing!  No volume, no moisturizing, no shine, no body.  So the search continues.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of the Big Sexy products and I really like thewm. This is one I will not buy again. The product makes my hair fly-away and/or flat. Go figure:(</li>
            <li> I love all Big Sexy Hair products and I really like this even for just let my hair air dry to waves.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for people who consider their hair &amp;#34;too flat&amp;#34; like me. It makes your hair fluffy and voluminous! Also, leaves NO residue on the hair when dried.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product.  It works well with my hair and I appreciate the larger sized bottle.  Price is great!</li>
            <li> On time delivery, great price.</li>
            <li> Great stuff to give your hair lift when blow drying.  Great product.  Highly recommend.  Hair feels natural and not sticky.</li>
            <li> It does the trick in the morning and with my hair it stays for most of the day.  Never met a product that actually did work for the whole day.  It&#x27;s easy to use and buying it thru Amazon and using prime makes it less expensive than buying it in a salon.</li>
            <li> I love this gel, it makes my hair smell really good and gives a nice full volume look after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of body to it. I  apply 1 pump before blow drying and helps my hair feel more full.</li>
            <li> My hair is flat and boring and when I use this stuff combined with their volumizing mouse it seriously comes to life!!!! I love it and it&#x27;s the only product I will spend my money on.</li>
            <li> I use the line of this product and my hair looks great.  Great product and I use it in moderation.</li>
            <li> Adds volume to my fine hair</li>
            <li> Made hair sticky and did not uplift at all.</li>
            <li> Product delivered fast.  Exactly as described and pictured and absolutely much more cost effective than purchasing in the salon or store.  Good gel that holds and gives my hair body.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks!! Pumps my hair up (I blow dry with my head down) love the shampoo and conditioner too : )</li>
            <li> I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied to roots it does give volume.  And it lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet I don&#x27;t think that it gives as much volume as I would like. I have used other products which give much more volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product but don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the same as any gel. A little disappointed, I didn&#x27;t notice any extra volume</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 to 15 years.  The older I get the thinner my hair gets and ii has no body whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;After I wash my hair I use the Big Sexy Hair Blow Dry Volume Gel. Personally I let my hair dry naturally and then comb it through.&lt;br /&gt;It gives it great body and fullness and if I want to get fancy and have some curls I use the curling iron and as soon as I remove the iron from the curl my hair springs back with lots of fullness and body. I love the product and as I said I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my thinning hair have more body. Thanks</li>
            <li> it works great! my hair has lasting volume all day. Happy with the shipment and packaging. Great product, definitely  recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to tell you how this stuff works but I couldn&#x27;t get any of it out because the pump is broken. I could go buy another pump but that would mean I have to leave my house and amazon prime has rendered my legs useless. Maybe I could buy a pump on amazon prime, brb.</li>
            <li> perfwct product for my fine hair&lt;br /&gt;price is good</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I use it right before I use my curling iron and it helps to keep the curls in all day.  Two squirts and blend it through my hair.</li>
            <li> I rated this a 5 because this stuff is awesome!!!Gives you alot of volume and bounce! Just put a little it doesnt take alot</li>
            <li> works as intended, makes my coarse asian air voluminous with the help of a blow dryer</li>
            <li> I have used many of the &amp;#34;Big Sexy Hair&amp;#34; brand products with good results.  This product, however does nothing positive for my hair.  It does not add any volume, in fact even using the tiniest amount seems to really weigh my hair down.  It also leaves my hair feeling very dry and damaged.  I have had much better luck with their &amp;#34;Dense&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Root Pump Plus&amp;#34; products.  Dont waste your money on this one.  Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Even with my very long hair, a little seems to go a long way. I have found that less is more, especially close to my roots. I mainly use it before putting in hot rollers for some extra &#x27;umph&#x27;. I apply it with damp hair, let it air dry while putting on my makeup then blow dry the rest of the way before putting in the rollers. Does the trick without weighing it down!</li>
            <li> I love to use this hair gel to add texture to my hair while still leaving my hair flexible to the touch. It adds body and volume, especially if you use it in conjunction with a blow dryer. My routine is to blow dry first, then put hair gel on. But if I use the gel first and then blow dry, I get much more volume when I want big hair days. Does not have a scent and does not get clumpy on me. Would recommend trying it anyone.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product. I put it in my hair when it&#x27;s wet and blow it dry to increase volume before I finish off with a high hold matte paste. Love it.</li>
            <li> I need to be reimbursed for this because I do not own it and I need the money to pay for the Doctors who are taking care of my right jaw that has been in severe pain for 3 decades.  I am now prescribed a steroid for the pain and that is not even working I&#x27;m in so much pain toward the Doctors, for example, Dr. Ayers, who told me my right ear is inflame and Dr. Joe Benich had to write me a script for eardrops which are not helping.  I am in severe pain in both my right jaw and my right ear for the last 3 decades and I need to have this product that I paid for and to please credit the money to the exact J.P. Morgan credit card it was paid for with with my permission only.  Kristin Anne Ringewald 1/2/1972</li>
            <li> I tried this and it made my hair look a little fuller but didn&#x27;t help with the hold so it was flat where the hair is heaviest which is on the top of my head.  It gave body but no lift and hold.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for people with fine hair looking for lift.</li>
            <li> This did NOT add volume to my hair.  In fact, if anything, when I used it and blew my hair dry, my hair was straight, more lim, and thinner-feeling than ever.  VERY disappointed.  Profoundly disappointed.  This is not good.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair. This product gives me a lot of volume without stiffness or weighing my hair down</li>
            <li> This stuff left my air full &amp; looking great with NO product feel. It also helps hold curl in, bonus!</li>
            <li> this product is ok didnt really get the bigg and sexy look i thought i would get as i have a stacked wedge hair cut and wanted a lift at the crown not sure if i would  buy this again my hair dresser actually reccomended this product</li>
            <li> This is my fav!! The gel is light weight and does its job! If you want volume without having to use a heavy mouse. Try this product!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product when I dry my hair. If I use it to tame fly aways when I have a chignon it is essential tonyse sparingly or it will make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> Overpriced!!  It is just as effective as that cheap guy gel. Sure the Packaging is cute and easy to use pump, but not cute enough to buy again. Maybe i will just reuse the pump bottle :)</li>
            <li> Too bad they&#x27;re not making this product any more - buy while you can.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the hopes that I could give my fine hair a little added volume. This product added some texture but left my hair feeling dirty and weighed down. It does have a nice scent. Just didn&#x27;t work for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I have long very fine lifeless hair, so to make it do anything usually takes a lot of work, that being said, my room mate had a bottle of this so I gave it try after i jumped out of the shower. you apply this to damp hair, massage through out then blow dry. i use a round brush and wow the volume is fantastic, will be ordering many times over!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this helps alot getting some body in my hair! The other product I have found useful is SExy Hair Blow It Up</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, not sticky, and produces great body.  I have very fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  Plus, it rinses clean from my hair after shampooing.  I will certainly purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> my hair dresser suggeste i use this brand for my straight and baby fine hair.  it helps give it volumn and easy to style my hair with this product</li>
            <li> The product is great.  It gives a lot of body to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shipping of the product, one came just fine and the other had leakage on the top of the bottle.  I did not loose a lot&lt;br /&gt;of product but I think they need to be more careful in their wrapping.  The product came in very good time to me.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, half the size of the last, exact product I ordered but was the same cost.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair the volume I need.</li>
            <li> I found this gel several years ago and have been using it since. It gives me enough control without being too stiff.</li>
            <li> I use other products from this line...suck as the shampoo and conditioner.  All work well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This does give you a fuller look.  No need to apply too much as a little is just fine.  I put it in the palms of my hand...and rub it through from roots to end.  Love It!!</li>
            <li> The product I received does not seem to be authentic. It does not have the same texture and consistency of the Big and Sexy Volumizing Gel which I have purchased from other retailers on many occasions. This gel I received is not good. It is watery and clumped up in my hair. I would be wary of purchasing from this outlet.</li>
            <li> This is great for volume and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all sticky. The down fall is the squirt top will not work so I have to open it everytime. But definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> For your blow dryer, it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> This is great product for finely-textured hair.  I have a lot of hair, but it tends to fall flat because of its texture.  I use just a small amount of this (if you use more than a pea-sized amount, hair tends to look dirty and stringy, so that is a drawback), at the roots before drying.  I dry with a large round brush.  It works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because I have naturally blonde hair, and this product makes my hair look a little more dull.  I can avoid this if I only use a TINY bit.</li>
            <li> If you want BIG, no...HUGE Texas 1980&#x27;s hair, this is for you! :)&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of volumizers, and this one by far out performs them all. With just one pump, it will transform my &amp;#34;long thick, HEAVY, weighted down at the crown&amp;#34; hair into BIG, FULL, Va Va Va Voom hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I do not reach for this product that often because:&lt;br /&gt;1- I really don&#x27;t want hair THAT big. lol&lt;br /&gt;2- My hair is bleached/highlighted, and I find that this product does tend to make it a bit dull, and dry feeling. I always end up having to go over my hair with either some coconut oil or some silicone drops to help de-poof it a bit, and to add shine/softness. Those with normal to oily hair may not have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;3- I find I need to wash my hair out the day after using this product (it is just too dry/difficult to brush or re-style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so that seems like a lot of &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34;. So, why the 5 star review then?&lt;br /&gt;Well, I gave this 5 stars because it DOES do what it says it does -- it VOLUMIZES like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!).&lt;br /&gt;So, for special occasions when you want a dramatic amount of volume, this product will get you there easily. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everyday, non-drying, volumizing, I prefer to use Redken&#x27;s Body Full Volume Spray (lots of fullness, without the dryness -- but it won&#x27;t get you as BIGGGGG as Big Sexy), or I use Wen&#x27;s Volumizing Spray (another nice volumizing product, but a bit less dramatic than the Redken -- but also non-drying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for HUGE volume, nothing beats Sexy Hair Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel. Nothing! lol</li>
            <li> My go to for volume boost in my angled bob haircut. A little goes a long way so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Have been using this gel for several years and love it.  I have oily hair, but this gel doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> This product works okay for the most part. I do find that it makes my hair more coarse than usual and it does have a little more volume, but I haven&#x27;t seen drastic changes in volume. It okay though.</li>
            <li> I like this product. As long as I use just the right amount my hair looks great. If I use to much it will weight it down and make my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve used all kinds of mouse and gel in order to give my fine hair some body.  From the drug store brands to the most expensive salon brands nothing worked as well as this.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel I will use.  It&#x27;s not heavy and doesn&#x27;t flake.  Leaves my hair fuller and adds texture (i have fine hair).  I use it with my Big Sexy Shampoo and Conditioner and am 100 percent happy with the product line.</li>
            <li> After reading criticisms that this dries your hair out, I was nervous. I don&#x27;t have this problem at all! It&#x27;s very lightweight and works great with other products. You can feel the thickness when your hair is still wet and I swear it makes my hair dry faster.  I put it on my roots and brush it through the rest. It&#x27;s worth every penny! ...oh yeah, and it smells like a salon!</li>
            <li> Sexy Hair Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel gives my hair the exact volume I need to give my hair a volume that last for days.  It is not sticky and heavy like most gels.  I highly recomment it.</li>
            <li> When I first used Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel, I really liked it.  However, after a month of using it, I noticed my hair started feeling dry and then the ends of my hair started sticking up.  While I was using this, I was also using the same product line of shampoo and conditioner which may have contributed to the drying effect. Yes, the product does bodify your hair.  Fine hair is a tough balancing act so if you use it be sure to use a moisturizing or leave in conditioner to help alleviate dryness.</li>
            <li> I love this company. The root hair pump and the new volumizer is great. I was hoping for more volume with  this product.</li>
            <li> The first bottle of sexy hair blow dry gel I purchased was like WATER not even close to a GEL. The second bottle I purchased was ok was a GEL and is working ok.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at first, but now like it very much.  I just just a small amount on my barely damp hair and blow dry for a few minutes.. The nice volume stays for at least 2 days.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing !! It really works</li>
            <li> I have very thin straight hair, I also have the big sexy hair powder as well. This works 10 times better than the powder, and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair 10 times to get it completely out. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel.  And it does make it feel thicker.  very happy with order</li>
            <li> my hair is very soft..nothing works on my hair except this one... it is really easy to use especially I am in a hurry in the morning.</li>
            <li> I had tried a long succession of mousses, gels, and spritzes but could never get my hair to look right.  Finally I thought to ask my stylist what she uses, and surprise - it was Big Sexy Hair.  It gives volume without weighing down my hair.  It is quite pricy to purchase in the drug store but with an Amazon subscription, the price is right.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair tangled and dry looking. I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with it. But the sellers definitely sent this right away and I was happy about the delivery.</li>
            <li> The Best Product I&#x27;ve ever used for adding volume to limp hair.  This definitely works and it is not gummy or sticky.  This one is a keeper.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again and again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me. Maybe you guys will have better luck.</li>
            <li> It really works! I will admit I did not realize how small an 8 oz bottle is...but the product does work well!</li>
            <li> I had never used this line of products and wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work like I wanted it to. To my surprise it worked great!  I like that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and gives it great volume. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great product.  My stylist used it and my hair styled so nicely with it, so I bought some!  Will continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after using the spray and play hairspray and big volume conditioner from this line.  I love all the products.  This has worked well for me on my thick, fine hair. I am such a snob about being able to detect product in my hair.  My hair is always super soft, so when I use a product if it leaves my clean hair oily, stiff, or gunky...it&#x27;s out!  This has passed the test.  It works well without feeling like I have any product in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long naturally curly hair.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve used in years.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy, but takes my curls and cuts the frizz.  PLEASE never stop making this!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different styling gels and this one holds up well. I do have long thick hair and this one gives me a good lift (since my hair is heavy too). I would recommend this product for those that want more lift and fullness to their hair. No bad smells associated with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product, have used it for years! Have very fine straight hair and this gel doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Not sticky and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> Big Sexy Hair products are a miracle for my hair, which is very thin because of health issues.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do with out them!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that I would not have an allergic reaction to it and I did not.  it works well.  Holds my hairstyle throughout the day and does not have an overpowering scent which I am very sensitive to so I am extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works fine but not one of the bests.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY hair products over the years to try to make my hair look thick and full, including the really expensive salon products. This works. I&#x27;ve found that I need to use a bit more of the product than others I&#x27;ve used, but I don&#x27;t mind because the results are worth it. Not only do I have thin hair, but what I have is baby-fine. This gives it volume and thickens it. I even use it if I&#x27;m not going to blow dry my hair. I can even find this at CVS, but get a better deal through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am so incredibly disappointed in this product. I have shoulder-length fine hair &amp; have difficulty finding a product that can give it volume while still taming flyaways. I&#x27;ve used many different inexpensive products &amp; thought I needed to try a more expensive professional product this time. I read many reviews before deciding to purchase the Big Sexy Hair Volume gel. I chose this product because the reviews were so wonderful. However, using this gel gives me about the same result as if I didn&#x27;t use anything at all in my hair. I&#x27;ve used different amounts, I&#x27;ve tried to use it differently, but it&#x27;s just like using water. Its actually shocking. It has no scent &amp; i actually have to wonder if it is the real product that i was sent, or just the bottle filled with something else. I am so disappointed &amp; would NOT recommend this product to anyone. I would be better off with Pantene.</li>
            <li> I have thin, short hair and it&#x27;s very hard to style and stay in place.  I use the Sexy Hair Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel and it makes my hair easier to style and stay in place.  I like it very much!</li>
            <li> This product does give my thin stringy hair more body.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, really adds that extra oomph!!  Only a tiny bit is needed and I only use it on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that has very little body.  Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel gives my hair the extra &amp;#34;ooomp&amp;#34; it needs to hold a style.  Just one little pump of the bottle into your palm, and work the gel into the roots of your hair -- blow dry while you style and it gives the roots of the hair some substance.  A little dab goes a long way....if you use too much, then it tends to weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best price anywhere. The product lifts your roots and isn&#x27;t sticky at all. Love it, love it and couldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li> I used it after I took a shower then blow dry it. It works wonderfully. My hair has the most volume ever. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product seems to work, easy to use and don&#x27;t forget to put it on the roots ....when wet.  I think anyone can use this because its clear in color.</li>
            <li> This product here, AMAZING. My hair is dull, flat, and lifeless. Picture seaweed on a rock- that&#x27;s exactly what I have going on. Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried tons of \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; products, none of them work, they just leave a film or a sticky residue and I have to wash it again. So I tried this stuff and it was like the Volume Gods sent their powers directly to my hair. I could barely get through my morning blow-drying routine before my hair took on a life of its own. I&#x27;m still getting used to it, I&#x27;m having a hard time manuvering around with this much volume on my head... I had to start taking the bus because I wasn&#x27;t able to get inside my car, but it WORKS!!!! Plus, I have extra volume to share......</li>
            <li> I ordered this gel because I have fine, no body hair.  This gel helps to put volume in your hair and doesn&#x27;t make it stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and was looking for something that would add a little volume.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products, including those you add when washing hair, to those that you leave in your hair.  I have a really sensitive skin and this is the first product that not only adds volume, but also is good for my sensitive skin.  I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since using this product.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
