            <li>And I always get so many compliments when I wear it.</li>

            <li>but once it was on I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>okay maybe it wasn&#x27;t quite two months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hippie at heart and I love these headbands.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Item is cute</li>
            <li>Looks super cute!</li>
            <li>but you can just put it back in easily. :D</li>
            <li>Flowers came crushed, but fit amazingly and is great quality!</li>
            <li>I was able to easily adjust it with some threat and a needle.</li>
            <li>love it, but the flowers come off easy.</li>
            <li>Super cute flower crown and its really adorable and looks just like it does in the photo</li>
            <li>It is well made, super cute and fits on my head.  </li>
            <li>Super cute, but the flowers don&#x27;t stay on that well.</li>
            <li>came before schedule but looks cheap</li>
            <li>And cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay , good for a grown girl , to big for a baby !</li>
            <li>The flowers broke off extremely quick , in a one day period .</li>
            <li>This was my favorite head band from Amazon so far!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty and durable</li>
            <li>its still very kawaii!</li>
            <li>Cute - dresses up an outfit in a simple way.  </li>
            <li>So pretty m.</li>
            <li>I ordered them in pretty much ever color.</li>
            <li>6 tiny flowers made of paper, its easy to pull them off</li>
            <li>Came a little smushed, but ended up being super cute</li>
            <li>Flowers are tiny looks cheap.</li>
            <li>It did take awhile however for the low price +free shipping +</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of these in different colors.</li>
            <li>so I took a tiny rubber band and tied the back together to make it stay better on my head and makes it tighter.</li>
            <li>I wish the flowers were more firmly attached because they come loose easily if bumped.  </li>
            <li>high quality&#x3D; #bestheadbandpurchase</li>
            <li>Love the braided band and the little leaf details!</li>
            <li>my 15 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>For the price I honestly expected it to look cheapy, but it&#x27;s actually really well done even with the paper flowers!</li>
            <li>Such High quality for such a steal!</li>
            <li>Little Hot Glue Can&#x27;t Fix</li>

            <li> Bad quality , when I opened the envelope two flowers felt off</li>
