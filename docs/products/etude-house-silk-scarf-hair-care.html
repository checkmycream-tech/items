            <li>I use this twice a week, it’s easy to distribute through my hair due to the consistency, one bottle lasts me over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>

            <li>After the first use it left my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I combine it with Organix Coconut Oil for shine (this when wet, coconut oil when dry) and that seems to be a winning combo.</li>
            <li>This smells amazing, but if you have thick, coarse, curly hair</li>
            <li>and it does make my hair soft</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny.  </li>

            <li>I have coarse, thick hair and have tried many a hair product.  </li>
            <li>However beware when you get the product out, its purple and very watery, so be extremely careful.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way so using all 3 is doable and worth the outcome ^.~</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t apply too much pressure because once you open the cap, the product can just drip down without even applying any pressure to the bottle.</li>

            <li> This stuff is truly amazing, it has made my hair so much softer! Love it</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, but if you have thick, coarse, curly hair like I do, it might not be heavy/thick enough for you to use alone. I have to follow up with a heavier leave-in or else my hair is left fuzzy and my curls are not defined. I still use it because I love the smell and it does make my hair soft, I just need to combine it with a leave-in made for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Just got this today, it smells wonderful! Definitely like this brand.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft but product is a bit watery :P</li>
            <li> Boy, I really like a number of the Etude House products I&#x27;ve tried and this one is another favorite!  After shampooing, I apply and leave on while I finish showering.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny.  I have coarse, thick hair and have tried many a hair product.  This is one of my favorites.  Really helps to keep the frizz under control.</li>
            <li> I am in Love with Etude House products. For the first time in.my life I could run my fingers through my hair without a serum. This stuff is amazing not to mention the yummy smell. Not only does this make your hair Silky Smooth and smell amazing but the package it comes in is adorable. Well one more Etude House product I can&#x27;t live without now. Thank God it is affordable! I have course not wavy or curly hair bit frizzy. It is also long. I only needed a bit of product to do my whole head. My falls about 3 inches past my bra line. Oh my love love this</li>
            <li> This hair mask smells incredible! Unfortunately, if you have long thick hair like me, you will use this up quickly. Other than that, it really does make my hair feel so soft and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!! Leaves my hair extremely soft!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than expected and in good packaging. It smells lovely and leaves the hair so so softy and shinny. I have a long straight hair and sometimes it gets frizzy with the weather but this mask just solve that problem.</li>
            <li> Leaves mt hair soft and shiny. Would&#x27;nt switch to any other deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> this product is like a miracle in a tube it works really well and has a verry nice smell.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  It smells soooo good.  Kind of watery, but it makes it easier to spread.  Makes my hair so soft and silky..like silk! :) Keep up the good work Etude House :D</li>
            <li> This product is incredible! My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft since high school despite using Morocco argon oil and nexus hair treatment.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and I love the scent</li>
            <li> Bought this awhile ago and have been using it for about a week now and I love the smell of it and how soft my hair is after. I will be buying this again when I get close to running out with the one I have (I have short thick hair but I don&#x27;t need much to cover my head maybe a cups worth, I would say however that a person with longer thick hair might have to use more)</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd tube I have ordered. I have dry hair due to all the dyeing I&#x27;ve done in the past but this hair treatment from Etudes has definitely helped my hair be more softer and moisturize.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the summer- I have fine wavy/curly hair- and it keeps me from turning into a puff ball. It does not make my hair *thicker* or *shinier* but it looks healthier by default when it is not crazy and frizzy. It works- it rained on me and my hair stayed frizz-free, and it lasted through lots of summer thunderstorms. I combine it with Organix Coconut Oil for shine (this when wet, coconut oil when dry) and that seems to be a winning combo.</li>
            <li> Love it! My hair is so soft and silky after I use it.</li>
            <li> I just got my package in the mail and I have to say, I love it ! After the first use it left my hair so soft and silky. Since I have thick and long hair I use up a lot of product, will come back and purchase more !</li>
            <li> Etude House Silk Scarf Moist Hair Treatment 200ml  I will be changing my hair care products to Silk Scarf. This stuff is AMAZING, I tried it on my own hair and my 2 daughters one that had very dry hair from bleaching and the other had hair damage she is trying to repair. Mine is just coloring but curly so the frizz factor is all over my head haha, this product proved its self against all 3 hair types leaving them all silky soft and smooth frizz free even after a night of sleep, I am impressed 100% my daughter is now ordering some for herself .I used 3 products Etude House Silk Scarf Moist Hair Mist also the silk scarf hair treatment and hair serum in combo to get this out come.  A little goes a long way so using all 3 is doable and worth the outcome ^.~</li>
            <li> It is just ok.  It was quite runnier than I would have imagined and it did not leave my hair as soft as I would have hoped for.The packaing is cute but that is about it.  I will not buy again</li>
            <li> It has a really nice aroma. However beware when you get the product out, its purple and very watery, so be extremely careful. Don&#x27;t apply too much pressure because once you open the cap, the product can just drip down without even applying any pressure to the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this hair treatment, I&#x27;m on my second bottle and getting ready to order my 3rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Bumble and Bumble Hairdresser&#x27;s Invisible Oil Conditioner, which was about the same size but costs over $30. That product smelled awful and it didn&#x27;t make any difference. That was a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this Etude House hair product the last several months, the condition of my hair is less brittle, feels softer and I like the smell.  I&#x27;m going to try the moisture pack next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that it&#x27;s not a thick consistency or a paste, it feels the same as if you watered down your regular conditioner to try to eek out every last drop of material from the bottle .  But just because it’s a thin consistency doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work.  I have medium length, thick hair and color treatments have made my hair coarse and brittle. I use this twice a week, it’s easy to distribute through my hair due to the consistency, one bottle lasts me over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect your hair to be &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34;...if you&#x27;re going to continue to damage your hair then you can&#x27;t expect this or any other product to bring miracles.</li>
            <li> This product smells really great. It came on tme and everything. My hair is less frizzy and smoother, but my head looks flat now lmao. But it really makes ur hair soft and lovely after one use.</li>
