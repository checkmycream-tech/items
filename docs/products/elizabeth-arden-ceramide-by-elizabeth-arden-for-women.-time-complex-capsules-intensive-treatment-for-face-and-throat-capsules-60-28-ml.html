            <li>I love them and hope they never stop making them.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite EA product and it is $25 cheaper than department stores.</li>
            <li>The capsules stick to one another but they are easy to separate and use.  </li>
            <li>if I got the real department store deal or just a Discounted warehouse deal kind of product.</li>
            <li>Feels good on my skin so far.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on so smooth and is absorbed so quickly.  </li>
            <li>But they seem to work just like fresh one do.</li>
            <li>I used to have a bunch of lines when I smiled and now I only have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>hahaha if i&#x27;m loaded, I will buy lots and apply it all over my body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the whole capsule which covers my face, neck and finish with hands.</li>

            <li>The capsules in this product are in Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s old packaging.  </li>
            <li>My sister worked at Arden and later was a regional manager,and she always said they had problems with people not using up the whole capsule at once.</li>
            <li>By the way, the old ones for face or eyes,can be used,all over.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t started using THIS supply yet, but I have been using this product for at least one year, and I Love it.</li>
            <li>Make your face soooooo soft</li>
            <li>The new ones, have vitamin-C, in them, and are a little more harsh on my face.</li>
            <li>These look like old and dried little bit more.</li>
            <li>For older women like me whose skin is extremely dry.</li>
            <li>Just started using it for the first time and less than a week</li>
            <li>The few ocassions that I have run out, my skin positively knows the difference.  </li>

            <li> I have started using Ceramide Gold Caps for some time now, about 2years. And i love it!&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Arden seems to have reformulated the formula and it seems slightly thinner and lighter, of course not compromising the efficacy. Which is perfect for me as the environment I&#x27;m living at now is humid.&lt;br /&gt;What is like most about the Gold Caps is how my face feels in the morning. Plump, moisturized and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I read and realized some of you use a single capsule multiple times. I would advice you not to! Why? The Gold Caps are made of vegetal material (could be swallowed, but do not try this at home). It is to preserve the efficacy of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;However, due to my humid climate, the outside of the caps turn mouldy after a while. But fret not, the formula in the caps is well protected and to prevent this, place it in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;I too find that its too much for merely the face in a capsule, so I apply it on my face, but on my neck and shoulders or even my nail cuticle. It VERY quickly absorbed due to its light formula. I would not call it &#x27;oily&#x27;, but rather &#x27;matt&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried it on the tip of my hair! hahaha if i&#x27;m loaded, I will buy lots and apply it all over my body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;peace!</li>
            <li> Put this on after washing your face.  I apply the leftover to the tops of my hands.  Use on your forehead, around eyes, face, lips and don&#x27;t forget your neck!!      Never had trouble absorbing.  I&#x27;m 45 and am fighting the wrinkles.  I use this once a day after washing my face.  Doesn&#x27;t have a great smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger either.  Sometimes I use it on my husband&#x27;s face and tell him it&#x27;s his \\&quot;beauty treatment\\&quot;.  He&#x27;s a great sport! It feels so good when you&#x27;ve been at the beach with the saltwater and sun....come in and replenish your skin!</li>
            <li> The capsules in this product are in Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s old packaging.  The capsules stick to one another but they are easy to separate and use.  In my opinion these capsules have been around a while.  But they seem to work just like fresh one do.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer there is and I will never stop using it.</li>
            <li> Facial skin absorbs this oil quickly - making my face feel and look years younger.  I receive compliments on my skin all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> Ladies please, stop using these capsules for multiple uses.They are preservative free,which is one of the reasons I have always used them.They are almost guaranteed not to irritate you&#x27;re face.That goess for the old face or eye or the new ones.My sister worked at Arden and later was a regional manager,and she always said they had problems with people not using up the whole capsule at once. That is why, they are in capsules,instead of a bottle.If you are like me, and prefer the old ones, they really are quite cheap now.By the way, the old ones for face or eyes,can be used,all over.I never liked, the old eye ones, and have always used the old ceramide face capsules on my face as well as eyes.This also helps with money.The new ones, have vitamin-C, in them, and are a little more harsh on my face.Anyway, the company say.s they are single dose for a reason,if they are left open, bacteria can be introduced,and I know we don&#x27;t want that.Sorry, if you did&#x27;nt know.</li>
            <li> This product was too old to sell The outside was very hard and the product inside was thick. I would not have sold this to anyone</li>
            <li> Very light. Feels good on my skin so far.  Just started using it for the first time and less than a week so ...</li>
            <li> very good product... will purchase again</li>
            <li> Good produce...love it</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years, am now over age 65 &amp; my skin has NO WRINKLES. I use it immediately after a shower, 3 X a week.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t started using THIS supply yet, but I have been using this product for at least one year, and I Love it. Hope I am ALWAYS able to find it!</li>
            <li> I just got this at my local store and after 1 week of usage, my skin is firmer and my pores are smaller. I also got the eye ceramide from Elizabeth Arden and my wrinkly eyes disappeared. I used to have a bunch of lines when I smiled and now I only have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I did read some of the reviews in regards about the consistency and smell. Mine is watery and smell bad as well. So, I&#x27;m not sure if I got the real department store deal or just a Discounted warehouse deal kind of product.</li>
            <li> Been purchasing this product for a long time.  This purchase and delivery was very good.  The delivery was timely, the product was fresh, etc. No problems with this order.</li>
            <li> For older women like me whose skin is extremely dry. I use this first thing in the mornings and I feel my skin drawing in the oil and making my face feel so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Nothing beats the feel of this facial and neck serum.  I use the whole capsule which covers my face, neck and finish with hands.</li>
            <li> I have been using Elizabeth Arden Ceramide time complex capsules for 25 years now and I love them!  The few ocassions that I have run out, my skin positively knows the difference.  I love the way it goes on so smooth and is absorbed so quickly.  It gives me such a nice base for any makeup I put on.  I love them and hope they never stop making them.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Great product.</li>
            <li> repeat purchase as a gift</li>
            <li> good product, but it is very hard to open it by hand, have to use scissor</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden is the best! Used it for years and would not use anything else. It is a bit expensive though.</li>
            <li> These capsules little dry than the other one that I purchased from other store. These look like old and dried little bit more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite EA product and it is $25 cheaper than department stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using E Arden products for many years, I have found many good prices and deals on Amazon. Tjis was shipped quickly and at a good price. The ceramide beads are the best</li>
            <li> Make your face soooooo soft</li>
            <li> Fifty-Off rocks!!! There was a little missunderstanding with my order and everything got resolved IMMEDIATELY.</li>
