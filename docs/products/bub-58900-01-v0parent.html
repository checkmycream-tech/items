            <li>Smells good too!!</li>
            <li>One of the best body washes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about what products I use to bathe or groom with and this body lotion is great.</li>
            <li>Builds a great lather, and has a great, invigorating scent that helps wake me up in the morning.</li>
            <li>Bought this item as a gift for my husband, and he loved it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as good, but I still like it.</li>
            <li>I LOVED the smell.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, but</li>
            <li>I had bought this for my husband and he seems to be very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I ws very impressed with this product, very nice fragrance, lathers beautifully and minimal</li>
            <li>While this body wash smells amazing ...</li>
            <li>It has a nice lather but you need a nice size squeeze to do so.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice but the value just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, but keeps me smelling good all day.  </li>
            <li>It has a refreshing and manly scent.</li>
            <li>Probably my favorite smelling body wash.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather well, and the smell is okay</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy this unless something better comes along.</li>
            <li>the package arrived with tape across the top of the lid and no safety seal on the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s products and use many of them.  </li>
            <li>Once I had it in the shower though, that&#x27;s where the love ended.</li>
            <li>This body wash is OK</li>
            <li>I like this body wash better than any I have tried.  </li>
            <li>but the smell just isn&#x27;t that appealing but</li>
            <li>Also, did not have a seal on the bottle top?  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty nice size bottle for the price too.</li>
            <li>I like it, but wish it were available in additional aromas.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get straight to the point: this body scrub is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice strong masculine scent and leaves me feeling squeeky clean.</li>
            <li>I use this product in my morning shower and it leaves me feeling and smelling clean all day.</li>
            <li>Normally the Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff is pretty good, but this soap didn&#x27;t do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique but not bad.</li>
            <li>Love this product it does exactly what I need which leaves a clean citrus scent that is fresh and manly</li>
            <li>Smells good but at the same time I can&#x27;t quite describe the scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is a fair rating as the product works well enough</li>
            <li>Overall, it does get you clean, but I&#x27;ll be looking for something else that lathers better and has a better scent.</li>
            <li>Clean, crisp manly scent.&lt;br /&gt;Quality of \\&quot;clean</li>
            <li>I have to use so much of it because it doesn&#x27;t leather up easily.</li>
            <li>Its a shame you have to pay more for a natural product.</li>
            <li>Normally if I am not crazy about a product I will use it up and never buy it again, this is so offensive to me</li>
            <li>No residue either, lathers and rinses right off.</li>
            <li>This product was right up our alley.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s going right into the trash.</li>
            <li>I was not crazy about the smell when I first opened it</li>
            <li>But this body wash is very, very watery, doesn&#x27;t lather at all</li>
            <li>The instant you use this you will feel more manly and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I was deployed to the desert when I ordered this and, by the time it reached me, the top was busted open</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li>One of the big pluses for me is that it washes off easily.</li>
            <li>I do, however, like the smell and especially like the fact that I can use it knowing it is free of the harmful chemicals that so irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>This ... not so much.</li>
            <li>i really do feel cleaner after i use it</li>
            <li>I also thought it went on rather roughly, not as smooth as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>According to him, it lathers up easily and doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin.</li>
            <li>However, I do recommend trying another natural brand first.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a backup to my favorite body wash which is Jack Black.</li>
            <li>But, if you&#x27;re the delicate kind of guy who prefers cheese pizza because \\&quot;the Works\\&quot; has too much flavor, you&#x27;re not gonna like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, and I can definitely see some people getting emotionally distressed over it.</li>
            <li>Usually no complaints equals he likes it.</li>
            <li>Compared to other commercial products out there, I found this product to have a very mild smell.</li>
            <li>natural, moderately-priced,  and moderately-manly body wash.</li>
            <li>Smells manly and natural.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t lather well, even though I used a loofa, and it really didn&#x27;t leave me much cleaner, perhaps due to the lack of a lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the smell and a little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li>As a 30 year old male, I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I like this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves you feeling refreshed, has a pleasant but not overbearing scent, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling artificial and/or drenched in some chemical solution.</li>
            <li>It washed off clean, but the smell was not very good.</li>
            <li>That said I plan on using this long term as my new washing soap.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t lather particularly well.&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to what some other reviews have said</li>

            <li> and I only had half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> , I find that this DOES dry your skin somewhat.</li>
            <li> I started using this because other products tended to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It registers low on the EWG.com skin care site and doesnt seem to have a bunch of harsh chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Minus</li>
            <li> Con is consistency is too thin and It doesn&#x27;t lather particularly well.</li>

            <li> It is typical of Burt&#x27;s Bees and has a smell that will never be called alluring.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat expensive, but sometimes expensive really is better.</li>
            <li> but a little too earthy for my tastes.</li>
            <li> It’s a little to pachouli-like smelling to me</li>
            <li> You quite possibly will go buy an axe, because chainsaws aren&#x27;t manly enough, and start cutting trees down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;&#x27;s not a strong smell though.</li>
            <li> After working up a sweat from cutting trees down, this will wash the wood chips from your beard and leave your skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> this bottle seems a little watered down and thin compared to my small bottle from a sampler kit I had.</li>
            <li> …it lathers up well, but I can’t get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves the scent too, and it sticks around for a little while after the shower (although subtly).</li>
            <li> The worst part of it was the overpoweringly strong smell.</li>
            <li> I think that my husband likes it, as he hasnt complained about it at all.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was cleaning myself with Pine-Sol, which is definitely not a good thing.</li>
            <li> First of all I received this item 16 days after I ordered it, the smell is awful</li>
            <li> the one star as it is a bit thin.  </li>
            <li> but when I got into the shower the steam and heat seemed to make it even worse.</li>
            <li> too bad they are so hard to find</li>
            <li> it smells like a mixture of random flowers</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not that bad.</li>
            <li> but I find the smell very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My wife hated it as well.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this soap. It has a refreshing and manly scent. Leaves skin feeling smooth and not dry. Only draw back is the price. This bottle lasts me about three weeks of daily showering. It has a nice lather but you need a nice size squeeze to do so.  Its a shame you have to pay more for a natural product.</li>
            <li> An all- natural, moderately-priced,  and moderately-manly body wash. I like it, but wish it were available in additional aromas.</li>
            <li> I had bought this for my husband and he seems to be very pleased with it. According to him, it lathers up easily and doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin. And, he loves the smell. All in all, a keeper!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get straight to the point: this body scrub is amazing. As a 30 year old male, I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I like this product. It leaves you feeling refreshed, has a pleasant but not overbearing scent, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling artificial and/or drenched in some chemical solution. One of the big pluses for me is that it washes off easily. I use this product in my morning shower and it leaves me feeling and smelling clean all day. Once again, the Burt&#x27;s Bees for Men line delivers. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells good but at the same time I can&#x27;t quite describe the scent. It&#x27;s unique but not bad.</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite smelling body wash. And the best value too. No residue either, lathers and rinses right off. too bad they are so hard to find</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband. I have tried to get rid of all the toxic products and switch to less chemical ones. This product was right up our alley. It registers low on the EWG.com skin care site and doesnt seem to have a bunch of harsh chemicals in it. I love the smell of it too. This is a pretty nice size bottle for the price too. I think that my husband likes it, as he hasnt complained about it at all. Usually no complaints equals he likes it. I dont think that smell is overpowering at all. Compared to other commercial products out there, I found this product to have a very mild smell.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a gift for my husband, and he loved it. Smelled great! I would definitely recommend this product to someone else, and would this product again.</li>
            <li> I find this soap to be  a bit overrated. It doesn&#x27;t lather well, and the smell is okay but a little too earthy for my tastes. It&#x27;&#x27;s not a strong smell though. Overall, it does get you clean, but I&#x27;ll be looking for something else that lathers better and has a better scent.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a month or so as a body/hair wash.  Love the smell and a little goes a long ways.  Minus the one star as it is a bit thin.  You get used to it but a thicker base would lather a little better.  That said I plan on using this long term as my new washing soap.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for body wash with a fru fru smell...this is not it.  It is typical of Burt&#x27;s Bees and has a smell that will never be called alluring.  I do, however, like the smell and especially like the fact that I can use it knowing it is free of the harmful chemicals that so irritate my skin.  Will continue to buy this unless something better comes along.</li>
            <li> Smells manly and natural. The instant you use this you will feel more manly and refreshed. You quite possibly will go buy an axe, because chainsaws aren&#x27;t manly enough, and start cutting trees down. After working up a sweat from cutting trees down, this will wash the wood chips from your beard and leave your skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> First of all I received this item 16 days after I ordered it, the smell is awful it smells like a mixture of random flowers, I tried it once and it does not lather on your skin plus as soon as you&#x27;re out of the shower there is no smell of it on your skin at all, save your money and don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did !</li>
            <li> Probably a personal preference, but I don&#x27;t like the smell or the viscosity of this product.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Burts Bees products, and this is no exception. I ordered this for my husband, and I&#x27;ll keep ordering it for him</li>
            <li> I have to use so much of it because it doesn&#x27;t leather up easily. It feels diluted. The smell is not that bad.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Con is consistency is too thin and It doesn&#x27;t lather particularly well.</li>
            <li> It washed off clean, but the smell was not very good. My wife hated it as well.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was disappointed.  While this body wash smells amazing ... that&#x27;s about it.  The lather factor is almost non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s shaving cream however is AH-MAZING!!  This ... not so much.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  Normally the Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff is pretty good, but this soap didn&#x27;t do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;First the package arrived with tape across the top of the lid and no safety seal on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this soap does not produce any lather, AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, smells like a household cleaner to me.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s products and use many of them.  But this body wash is very, very watery, doesn&#x27;t lather at all and it takes quite a lot to properly wash.  The scent is nice but the value just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin. Smells good too!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a backup to my favorite body wash which is Jack Black. It isn&#x27;t as good, but I still like it. Here&#x27;s the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells great. Clean, crisp manly scent.&lt;br /&gt;Quality of \\&quot;clean feel\\&quot; is terrific&lt;br /&gt;Seems to last a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Its consistency is too thin.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather particularly well.&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to what some other reviews have said, I find that this DOES dry your skin somewhat. As a result, it will probably have to be retired in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I was deployed to the desert when I ordered this and, by the time it reached me, the top was busted open and I only had half a bottle left. I do not know how the seller would have handled the situation because I never contacted them about it so this review is solely my thoughts on the product. I LOVED the smell. Once I had it in the shower though, that&#x27;s where the love ended. It didn&#x27;t lather well, even though I used a loofa, and it really didn&#x27;t leave me much cleaner, perhaps due to the lack of a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one to anyone but I wouldn&#x27;t try to run anyone away from it either. However, I do recommend trying another natural brand first.</li>
            <li> gift I always give my son-in-law. he loves it. . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, but it ultimately didn&#x27;t work for me. The worst part of it was the overpoweringly strong smell. I felt like I was cleaning myself with Pine-Sol, which is definitely not a good thing. After a while, the smell would even start stinging my eyes. I also thought it went on rather roughly, not as smooth as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Smell is a personal thing, but this is just my opinion. I don&#x27;t know if this is a fair rating as the product works well enough but I find the smell very unpleasant. I was hoping for a citrus scent but this just smell funky to me. I was not crazy about the smell when I first opened it but when I got into the shower the steam and heat seemed to make it even worse. Normally if I am not crazy about a product I will use it up and never buy it again, this is so offensive to me it&#x27;s going right into the trash.</li>
            <li> I use this product in conjuction with Burts Bees Deodorandt and Burts Bees aftershave lotion.  The scent is mild, but keeps me smelling good all day.  I started using this because other products tended to dry out my skin.  I don&#x27;t have that problem with this body wash.</li>
            <li> This body wash is OK…it lathers up well, but I can’t get past the smell.  It’s a little to pachouli-like smelling to me and I can’t stand that fragrance.  It lingers on your skin for awhile.</li>
            <li> Love this product it does exactly what I need which leaves a clean citrus scent that is fresh and manly</li>
            <li> I like this body wash better than any I have tried.  Somewhat expensive, but sometimes expensive really is better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about what products I use to bathe or groom with and this body lotion is great. Nice strong masculine scent and leaves me feeling squeeky clean.</li>
            <li> i really do feel cleaner after i use it but the smell just isn&#x27;t that appealing but like my title indicates its alright.</li>
            <li> I ws very impressed with this product, very nice fragrance, lathers beautifully and minimal amount does wonders...</li>
            <li> One of the best body washes I&#x27;ve ever used. Builds a great lather, and has a great, invigorating scent that helps wake me up in the morning. Girlfriend loves the scent too, and it sticks around for a little while after the shower (although subtly). But, if you&#x27;re the delicate kind of guy who prefers cheese pizza because \\&quot;the Works\\&quot; has too much flavor, you&#x27;re not gonna like this stuff. The smell is strong, and I can definitely see some people getting emotionally distressed over it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but this bottle seems a little watered down and thin compared to my small bottle from a sampler kit I had. Also, did not have a seal on the bottle top?  Maybe they don&#x27;t use one?</li>
