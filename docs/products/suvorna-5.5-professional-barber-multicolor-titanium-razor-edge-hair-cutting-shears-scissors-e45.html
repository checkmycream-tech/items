            <li>It was so much more than I was expecting !</li>
            <li>I needed a backup pair of shears to be able to send my good ones to the sharpener.  </li>

            <li>The shear blades are made of 440C grade steel, which is better than the RAZECO&#x27;s 420 grade.  </li>
            <li>I might have rated these a 5, but for two things: I need to use the shears a bit longer to gauge their durability, and the maker has to update their website so they don&#x27;t mislead consumers by advertising a better case then is shipped with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 440C contains the most carbon.  </li>

            <li>these shears are right on the edge of comfort for me, for my wife that is not the case they fit her</li>
            <li>It is important to keep in mind that at this price, you are not buying top of the line professional grade shears.  </li>

            <li>Very nice very sharp scissors .</li>

            <li>These scissors are not only functional but amazing looking.</li>
            <li>So far I have used them five times only but I am happy with them.</li>

            <li>I love them, they are light, sharp, smooth.</li>
            <li>Extremely sharp and good looking.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>We have only used the scissors one time; however, so far so good.  </li>
            <li>To compare these to $300 or higher shears is not realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is for shipping, but you can use it if you like for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Survorna also sells a higher level product line.  </li>
            <li>After 440 grade steel, you are looking at higher grade shears.  </li>

            <li>I ordered these because they were reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>the grip pads don&#x27;t stay in very well</li>

            <li>day\\&quot;) you will probably like these very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shear length is 5.5\\&quot; and they are constructed of J2 420C stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>A stainless steel grade of 420 is considered to be \\&quot;cutlery grade.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes it the hardest of the 440 grades, and harder than the 420, so the 440 lends itself to better edge-retention.  </li>

            <li>I was so excited to use my shears on my next day at work</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I have large hands just normal sized and</li>
            <li>They are razor sharp, finely built and constructed, and worthy of professional use.  </li>
            <li>As with most \\&quot;economy&#x27; shears I would anticipate they will dull a bit quicker than higher grade products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so well they convinced me I am capable of cutting my own hair!</li>
            <li>Very sharp, found that out the hard way, lol.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;pro\\&quot; line sells for only a little more than the economy line.  </li>
            <li>They also include a clear, plastic tip cover.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if a professional hairstylist would prefer these.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my 16 yr old daughter for Christmas, per her request.</li>
            <li>I have a young son and just wanted to be the one to cut his hair.</li>
            <li>Completely gone.</li>
            <li>far as the product itself, these multi-colored shears are the e45 RAZECO model.  </li>
            <li>Again, at the price point, I do not think you can compare either product line to professional grade shears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>you are wondering about steel grades in general: 440 stainless steel comes several sub-grades, the most common being 440A, 440B, and 440C.  </li>

            <li>She has small hands and these fit her well.  </li>
            <li>Other differences, depending on the exact model: the finger rest is curved (but not detachable), the thumb hole can swivel, and the case is nicer.  </li>
            <li>If you are a working professional who cuts on a regular, I would suggest these only as a backup/emergency pair.  </li>

            <li> I used these shears to cut my husband&#x27;s and my children&#x27;s hair. It works very well and much better than any drugstore haircutting scissors that I have purchased. They are slightly heavy and I don&#x27;t know if a professional hairstylist would prefer these. However, if you&#x27;ve never used professional scissors, I think you&#x27;ll be very impressed with the precision.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 16 yr old daughter for Christmas, per her request. She loves them. Sharp, easy to use, nice case to keep them protected. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a professional stylist and work in a salon everyday.  I needed a backup pair of shears to be able to send my good ones to the sharpener.  I got these and immediately they fell apart.  The very first time I used them in the salon!  I planned on returning them.  I got industrius one morning and pieced  them back together (Minor mechanic).  Now that they are mechanically stable I realized the they do not point cut at ALL.  The non-pointy ends are as useless as safety scissors from first grade.  They sit in my Jowell case, pretty and pretty useless.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in my hand. Perfect length of blades. Very nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> We have only used the scissors one time; however, so far so good.  I am not a good judge of scissors though. I have a young son and just wanted to be the one to cut his hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter a hairdresser was flying in from Florida and couldn&#x27;t bring her scissors onboard.  I ordered these because they were reasonably priced.  She cut all of my families hair with them and claimed they were every bit as good as her $300 pair.  They were nice and sharp and there was no pulling.  Excellent find!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use my shears on my next day at work and when I received my packaged I opened the used and warn packaging to discover NO SHEARS!!!!! Completely gone. So livid. When I order a product I would like to have the product!!</li>
            <li> Loved them. Perfect size for my small hands. Very sharp, found that out the hard way, lol. Beautiful colors. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the secondary rings didn&#x27;t fit the shears oddly enough. But luckily the rings already in fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Nice feel, good fit, sharp scissors.  Would recommend and buy again.  Fair price as well.  Grandkids love the &amp;#34;rainbow&amp;#34; scissors!</li>
            <li> These scissors are beautiful, so sharp and cut like butter.  The tension adjustment is easy to maneuver and stays put once adjusted.  The thumb and finger rings fall out constantly so I just chucked them in the bin, otherwise I don&#x27;t have a single complaint about the scissors.</li>
            <li> If you have small hands they would be fine, although could be sharper. I brought them and haven&#x27;t used them since.</li>
            <li> Their sharp, watch your fingers you might loose one... I have big hands, and they were made for petite hands.</li>
            <li> They just cut so well they convinced me I am capable of cutting my own hair! I love them and the color is great</li>
            <li> I love these shears. I use them at beauty school. They are perfect for a beginner. Everyone comments on how cute they are.</li>
            <li> Very nice very sharp scissors . Love them.</li>
            <li> Great and sharp and cute! the grip pads don&#x27;t stay in very well but that is not a big deal for personal use. Someone cutting all day using often may find that a bit of a hassle but it is also fine without the grip pads.</li>
            <li> I really liked these shears mainly the anodized color but they cut very nicely they have stayed sharp through countless hair cuts now and seem comfortable my one and only gripe is that the loops for your fingers are made for women or some one with small fingers. I don&#x27;t feel like I have large hands just normal sized and these shears are right on the edge of comfort for me, for my wife that is not the case they fit her just right and the rubber grips helps too! I would recommend to others as long as you have smaller hands. Quality is good though!!</li>
            <li> So far these csissors work great! I am not a hair dresser I just happen to cut my sons, husband and mom&#x27;s hair. I love them, they are light, sharp, smooth. They accommodate nicely to my hands, they don&#x27;t slip. I really like them. The only reason I don&#x27;t give them five starts is because the little rubber inserts don&#x27;t stay, they fall all the time so I just use them without it. But don&#x27;t let that detour you from buying these product, it is perfect for what I use them. So far I have used them five times only but I am happy with them.</li>
            <li> Not so good. Rubber rings in finger holes fall out constantly causing you to adjust taking longer with cuts. If you have larger fingers this would&lt;br /&gt;work well for you!</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift for my grandmother who has been cutting and styling hair for over forty years.  She mentioned that she heard about these titanium scissors and that she wanted to give them a shot.  I found this product on Amazon and trusting the reviews I decided to purchase these for her as a gift.  She is delighted with them and I am delighted with the purchase.  They are razor sharp, finely built and constructed, and worthy of professional use.  Great product.</li>
            <li> These scissors are not only functional but amazing looking. My two year old thinks they are too cool. They help when I am trimming her bangs because she watches the colors! Perfect product for us! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I love these scissors they are very colorful and they work very well they are the best scissors in the world😆👍💜</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a better pair of scissors for the money.  Extremely sharp and good looking.</li>
            <li> Used on my own hair.  Friend cutting hair said they were fantastic.  I have a hair helmet and they cut though it like butter.</li>
            <li> These shears are easy to hold, cut precisely, and are attractive.  My customers are surprised that barber implements are &amp;#34;so pretty!&amp;#34;  and they seem to think they get a better hair cut with the fancy shears</li>
            <li> Great quality and very cool looking!</li>
            <li> It was so much more than I was expecting ! Excellent quality, as well as beautiful.  Unique.  I am going to order another pair, as the ones I bought already were a gift. It made me want my own! Also, order arrived faster than expected</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife (to cut *my* hair).  She has small hands and these fit her well.  The cutting surfaces are very sharp.  She loves these scissors.</li>
            <li> Nice hair cutting scissors! These are very sharp and easy to hold! Best pair I have used yet!</li>
            <li> Beautiful,perfect, thanks</li>
            <li> Beautiful scissors - great to use and great colour.  Nice and sharp</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t really as sharp as I would expect hair-cutting scissors to be.  I could have just used regular scissors...</li>
            <li> Love love love&lt;br /&gt;Excellent price and quality</li>
            <li> I purchased these shears for my wife, who is a licensed beautician.  It is important to keep in mind that at this price, you are not buying top of the line professional grade shears.  To compare these to $300 or higher shears is not realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shears appear to be well made.  They are sharp, handle nicely and cut well.  As with most \\&quot;economy&#x27; shears I would anticipate they will dull a bit quicker than higher grade products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses these as a backup.  If you are a working professional who cuts on a regular, I would suggest these only as a backup/emergency pair.  If, on the other hand, you plan to use these for yourself, your family, or other light use (something less frequent that \\&quot;every day\\&quot;) you will probably like these very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself, these multi-colored shears are the e45 RAZECO model.  The shear length is 5.5\\&quot; and they are constructed of J2 420C stainless steel.  They are \\&quot;titanium coated\\&quot; but its debatable what, if any, durability this adds.  It should add some hardness to help retain sharpness, but a coating is simply not as good as a blade which contains titanium.  The shears have a removable finger rest as well as rubber inserts to cushion the finger holes. A stainless steel grade of 420 is considered to be \\&quot;cutlery grade.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package include a black vinyl triangle \\&quot;pouch\\&quot;, not a case, so be advised should you visit the manufacturer&#x27;s web site and see the nicer case in the product description.  They also include a clear, plastic tip cover.  This is for shipping, but you can use it if you like for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Survorna also sells a higher level product line.  Those are the RAZPRO line.  The shear blades are made of 440C grade steel, which is better than the RAZECO&#x27;s 420 grade.  Other differences, depending on the exact model: the finger rest is curved (but not detachable), the thumb hole can swivel, and the case is nicer.  The \\&quot;pro\\&quot; line sells for only a little more than the economy line.  Again, at the price point, I do not think you can compare either product line to professional grade shears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, and light usage, I think these scissors are more than adequate, and the non-daily user will be quite pleased with the performance.  I might have rated these a 5, but for two things: I need to use the shears a bit longer to gauge their durability, and the maker has to update their website so they don&#x27;t mislead consumers by advertising a better case then is shipped with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering about steel grades in general: 440 stainless steel comes several sub-grades, the most common being 440A, 440B, and 440C.  The 440C contains the most carbon.  This makes it the hardest of the 440 grades, and harder than the 420, so the 440 lends itself to better edge-retention.  After 440 grade steel, you are looking at higher grade shears.  The next grade up is S (contains cobalt), then V (contains vanadium and/or titanium), and ATS (contains cobalt, vanadium and titanium).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;Steel grade is just one important aspect of a shears&#x27; quality.  The tempering process and overall workmanship also weigh heavily into the performance and life-span of the product.economy line.
