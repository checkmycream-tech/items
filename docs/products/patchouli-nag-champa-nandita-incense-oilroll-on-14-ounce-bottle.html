            <li>I also love Vitiver, but it smells musty on me without adding something to the mix.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, and had lasting power.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li>to be safe....</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>You will absolutely love this scent ...</li>
            <li>So many to choose from, Really glad I picked this one.</li>
            <li>I purchased this oil out of curiosity since I love this brand of oils.  </li>
            <li>My sister love&#x27;s it better then the one she buy&#x27;s.b</li>
            <li>/&gt;After it faded, it had a great scent, but very very soft.  </li>
            <li>versatile scent that I think many people would enjoy.</li>
            <li>Strong but not sickeningly  so, IMHO.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>I am a huge patchouli fan.</li>
            <li>Another reason I enjoy using oils over toilette water.</li>
            <li>Great oils for a romantic liaison?</li>
            <li>In fact, it smells more like nag champa with notes of patchouli; if you want something more patchouli-smelling, you probably want to just get straight up patchouli, as nag champa is a scent which can overpower all else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone always turns their head when I come near and says that something smells so good.</li>
            <li>the heady smell of nag champa is a favorite of mine, and this stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I found this scent to be particulary strong with a warm undercurrent and a hint of a spiritual overtone.  </li>
            <li>Company ships quickly.</li>
            <li>Very pleased overall.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t even notice it, and he hates everything and compliments rarely.  </li>
            <li>liked the fact that it came with two different orifices - a roll-on and a dropper -</li>
            <li>Patchouli is, of course, an old favorite.</li>
            <li>Rub my palms together again to warm up the last of it</li>
            <li>It has both a masculine &amp; feminine feel to it, so it is appropriate for either sex to wear.</li>
            <li>It smells very incense-y and sweet, but not to sweet.</li>
            <li>It wear&#x27;s off very fast.</li>
            <li>When I first smelled this/put it on, I was quite dubious.  </li>
            <li>I would have given it a higher rating if it would have had a longer, noticeable staying power beyond an hour.</li>
            <li>I love lavendar, but it is intense for daily wear.</li>
            <li>It came with a choice of applicator tops which was nice, though confusing to me that none of them were a true &amp;#34;roll on&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing on everyone - male and female.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>To me, this doesn&#x27;t smell much like Nag Champa or patchouli.</li>
            <li>I am really stuck on their Patchouli Vetivert oil</li>
            <li>It is much to floral for me.</li>
            <li>Other Nag Champa oil smells too feminine to my wife and daughters, but when I wear this scent, they love it.</li>
            <li>This leads me to believe that it smells decent on</li>
            <li>I chose the one that is like the standard &amp;#34;one drop at a time&amp;#34; that you would find on most essential oil</li>
            <li>and then looking at my four star rating and wondering how someone could compare a smell in a perfume to urine and then rate it highly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend product</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this oil~</li>
            <li>If you keep rolling it on, within ten minutes the odor becomes extremely strong - so be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>Great scent, long wearing and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Out of all the products i have recently purchased only  \\&quot; Patchouli 100% Natural Herbal Soap 4 oz made with Pure Essential Oils Gift Set Sold by Fabulous Frannie\\&quot;  Smells like the Patchouli</li>
            <li>Stinky unless you are aiming for &amp;#34;eau de old woman&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to get close to me to smell it, so only a lover or someone hugging you would really experience the smell.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like the smell as much as if I had mixed them myself.</li>
            <li>They last quite a long time and you don&#x27;t need too much</li>
            <li>It smelled like a really soft patchouli and nag champa incense, with maybe a tiny hint of vanilla.  </li>
            <li>This essential oil is very strong, so it will last a long time because you only need a small drop.</li>
            <li>adore both of these fragrances and it seemed only natural that I would appreciate them mixed.</li>

            <li> Not what I expected- very strong and the bottle is cheap.... Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of the nag champa</li>
            <li> that in mind, if you make this purchase and use it as a scent - ONLY USE A LITTLE.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way ...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I like their Musk and other oils</li>
            <li> I also layer it with other oils to kick it up a bit and change to fragrance.</li>
            <li> It smells like patchouli and nag champa, but also has this weird sharp scent, similar (but not exactly like) urine.  </li>
            <li> Light &amp; powdery with the spicey base note of patchouli.</li>
            <li> i remember from my past....</li>
            <li> Sadly yet another product that has absolutely no similarity to the smell of Patchouli.</li>
            <li> dude would be the first one to say he hated it.  </li>
            <li> the nag champa scent comes through well defined, followed by a subtle patchouli note.</li>
            <li> so we figured what could go wrong with this blend.  </li>
            <li> oh well..:(</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the prefect scent for work, play, day or evening wear. Light &amp; powdery with the spicey base note of patchouli.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful. I have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell.</li>
            <li> Stinky unless you are aiming for &amp;#34;eau de old woman&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Smells amazing on everyone - male and female.  I&#x27;m always getting complemented and asked what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff!!! Have 2 Have It!!! Great Company!!</li>
            <li> When I first smelled this/put it on, I was quite dubious.  It smells like patchouli and nag champa, but also has this weird sharp scent, similar (but not exactly like) urine.  I realize you&#x27;re reading that and then looking at my four star rating and wondering how someone could compare a smell in a perfume to urine and then rate it highly.  Read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dude would be the first one to say he hated it.  He didn&#x27;t even notice it, and he hates everything and compliments rarely.  This leads me to believe that it smells decent on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it faded, it had a great scent, but very very soft.  You&#x27;d have to get close to me to smell it, so only a lover or someone hugging you would really experience the smell.  It smelled like a really soft patchouli and nag champa incense, with maybe a tiny hint of vanilla.  And even when I scrubbed in the shower with a loofah, the scent was still on me the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased.  I just don&#x27;t like the initial scent.  But after it fades, it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> I love this scent... the heady smell of nag champa is a favorite of mine, and this stuff is the real deal.  In fact, it smells more like nag champa with notes of patchouli; if you want something more patchouli-smelling, you probably want to just get straight up patchouli, as nag champa is a scent which can overpower all else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, if you make this purchase and use it as a scent - ONLY USE A LITTLE.  It will last you all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that it came with two different orifices - a roll-on and a dropper - so you can use it to dispense the oil into an oil simmerer.  Very good idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> On-time delivery.The product is excellent.Highly recommend product</li>
            <li> When rolling this product on, it seems like there is no smell and it&#x27;s not working. If you keep rolling it on, within ten minutes the odor becomes extremely strong - so be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful...the nag champa scent comes through well defined, followed by a subtle patchouli note. I highly reccommend this oil~</li>
            <li> Not what I expected- very strong and the bottle is cheap.... Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love lavendar, but it is intense for daily wear. I also love Vitiver, but it smells musty on me without adding something to the mix. Patchouli is, of course, an old favorite. This product, however, is the most heavenly scent I have ever experienced. I put a drop in one palm, rub my hands together and rub it on pulse points, my feet, and anywhere else I feel like it. Rub my palms together again to warm up the last of it and then pet both my dogs all over. THEY even smell great, but it is not so strong on them to bother them. My husband is always telling me how good I smell!</li>
            <li> I found this scent to be particulary strong with a warm undercurrent and a hint of a spiritual overtone.  It has both a masculine &amp; feminine feel to it, so it is appropriate for either sex to wear. I would have given it a higher rating if it would have had a longer, noticeable staying power beyond an hour.</li>
            <li> This oil is a winner.  I purchased out for my husband and he loves it too.  He loves Patchouli and Nag Champa separately so we figured what could go wrong with this blend.  It smells wonderful, and had lasting power.  Packaging was great, the shipping time was quick.  We would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Other Nag Champa oil smells too feminine to my wife and daughters, but when I wear this scent, they love it.</li>
            <li> I just got this oil in the mail. When I finally got the bottle open (the stopper broke off in the bottle, hooray for dental picks!) I took a whiff and didn&#x27;t like the scent. I tried it on anyway and I&#x27;m so glad I did (hooray for body chemistry)! To me, this doesn&#x27;t smell much like Nag Champa or patchouli. It smells very incense-y and sweet, but not to sweet. It does smell a bit powdery so I guess that&#x27;s supposed to be the Nag Champa. This is a very nice scent and I will repurchase it.</li>
            <li> These oils are absolutely the most awesome oils ever.  They last quite a long time and you don&#x27;t need too much</li>
            <li> The smell of this oil....is basically only Nag Champa....I don&#x27;t smell any patchouli...at all!.....so..I guess I should have just ordered the patchouli...to be safe....oh well..:(</li>
            <li> Sadly yet another product that has absolutely no similarity to the smell of Patchouli. Out of all the products i have recently purchased only  \\&quot; Patchouli 100% Natural Herbal Soap 4 oz made with Pure Essential Oils Gift Set Sold by Fabulous Frannie\\&quot;  Smells like the Patchouli i remember from my past....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. this stuff stings like Hell if you use it as a roll on deodorant, so be warned!</li>
            <li> Love it.  I&#x27;m a &#x27;60&#x27;s patchouly girl and this puts me back in the day.  Use a tiny bit &#x27;cuz it&#x27;s strong. People always ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.  I would recommend this to any of you patchouly lovers!</li>
            <li> Love it. I often have people ask what I am wearing &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a wonderful sent&amp;#34;. Company ships quickly.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the smell as much as if I had mixed them myself.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this combination!!!  If you like Patchouli &amp; Nag Champa ... don&#x27;t even think about it ... GET IT!  You will absolutely love this scent ... a little goes a long way ... beautiful marriage of scents.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! Everyone always turns their head when I come near and says that something smells so good. Surprise - it is always me and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the fragrance of this oil. It came with a choice of applicator tops which was nice, though confusing to me that none of them were a true &amp;#34;roll on&amp;#34;. I chose the one that is like the standard &amp;#34;one drop at a time&amp;#34; that you would find on most essential oil bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore both of these fragrances and it seemed only natural that I would appreciate them mixed. This blend has good staying power. Strong but not sickeningly  so, IMHO. My husband likes it on me, so it&#x27;s passed the ultimate test indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A versatile scent that I think many people would enjoy. Very pleased overall.</li>
            <li> I am a huge patchouli fan. Been using the oil since the 70s. Just recently found NagChampa so when I found the 2 scents together I had to try it. I love it! One of my daughters told me I smell like incense. I love incense so that was a compliment! A little goes a long way. Another reason I enjoy using oils over toilette water. Does last all day</li>
            <li> got the wrong one this one is more baby powdered, my mom likes the one with coconut oil in it.</li>
            <li> So many to choose from, Really glad I picked this one. Smells wonderful!! Nice quality oil.  Update: The scent does not last long. It wear&#x27;s off very fast.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is very strong, so it will last a long time because you only need a small drop. LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great oils for a romantic liaison?</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil out of curiosity since I love this brand of oils.  I am really stuck on their Patchouli Vetivert oil and I like their Musk and other oils, so I thought I would try this too.  this would work on people who like Nag Champa, but it just did not work for my body chemistry.  It is much to floral for me.</li>
            <li> My sister love&#x27;s it better then the one she buy&#x27;s.b</li>
            <li> This is a very strong smelling roll-on blend they gave my husband a headache</li>
            <li> I wear this oil blend often.  I also layer it with other oils to kick it up a bit and change to fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of the nag champa scent- I wanted to try something different and I am thrilled with this. Great scent, long wearing and a little goes a long way. I always get asked what I am wearing.</li>
