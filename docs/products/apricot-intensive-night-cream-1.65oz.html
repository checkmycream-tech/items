            <li>I love this product and am so happy to find it here.</li>
            <li>There are some lotions and creams I like, but they seem to disappear into my skin (which feels great, but then my skin needs more after a couple hours).   </li>
            <li>My skin feels so nice after applying&lt;br /&gt;it &amp; still feels good in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it!  </li>
            <li>so I am really glad I found it on here!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Has a silky, nice feel though.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, moisturizes well, and chemical free!  </li>
            <li>One of the best all natural night creams on the market.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a good long time with magnificent results!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant and mild scent that smells almost like baby lotion.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of strong</li>
            <li>While both Lancome and Rejuvi products are excellent, NEITHER got rid of the very fine lines starting to form under and around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I just love this company.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for almost 20 years, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to drift off to the smell of cheap perfume!</li>
            <li>I love the way it keeps my skin moist for hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m off to try more Earth Science items.</li>
            <li>Just love this product.</li>
            <li>, maybe it&#x27;s always wearing a hat, maybe not; but I have better skin than some 30 year-olds</li>
            <li>It also does not seem to sit on top of the skin like a coating.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my skin looks and feels more hydrated after using this for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely cream.  </li>
            <li>I have been using about a year and love it.</li>
            <li>Not in love with it</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but had to because this cream works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve used it day/night for about six wks now.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I was hoping for a light apricot scent, but couldn&#x27;t detect anything, but the cream itself is nice.  </li>
            <li>I would order again, but wish they&#x27;d put a bit more apricot in it.</li>
            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love this cream.</li>
            <li>The best part that I love about this 2-step system: it&#x27;s really simple and they&#x27;re both eco-friendly products.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 1 week every night before bed and my skin has changed for the better.</li>
            <li>But most of all, I have noticed my skin just looks better and more radiant.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say more than that for a product.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>Love everything about it.</li>
            <li>But, I will not be able to use it on my face.</li>
            <li>Second order, great night moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Nice,  smooth,  rich cream.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a cruelty free product.</li>
            <li>I am frequently told that I have great skin and asked what products I use on it.</li>
            <li>; too, no bad chemicals!</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but lasts all of 15-20 seconds.</li>
            <li>I have issues with strong fragrances and oily products and have not had a problem with this in either regard.</li>
            <li>It seems to diminish the fine little&lt;</li>
            <li>It is great that shipping is free for individual products on Amazon.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;for cheap price.</li>
            <li>Feels lathering and smooth on the face.</li>
            <li>This is a big win.</li>
            <li>One application again of this lotion (also applied it to my elbows, hands, and feet) and everything was smooth as silk again.  </li>
            <li>With this cream I wake up with smooth unlined skin.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to have found it, and I have bought several jars now.</li>
            <li>It always blends in smoothly and my skin looks refreshed and renewed in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, softens my skin &amp; does not cause any breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the level of moisture I get from this cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, light, non-greasy, and seems to really work to keep wrinkles and dryness to a minimum.</li>
            <li>It erased fine wrinkles and significantly softened what remained.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and it applies very easily.</li>
            <li>For it to be so rich it does not leave my combo skin overly oily and</li>
            <li>This cream is listed as a night time cream, but I use it in the morning and it is great all day long.  </li>
            <li>After two months of consistent use, I have not seen any reduction in fine lines, but my skin is soft, so I think it&#x27;s a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is a great cream, with helped me with my dry face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and it meets all my expectations for a good night cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a comforting and smooth scent, not too powerful either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First discovered this product at Whole Foods, but found better price on Amazon, of course.</li>
            <li>Being loyal to my tried &amp; true Lancome, I didn&#x27;t continue using this product.  </li>
            <li>I first tried it from an all natural shop and just loved it right away.  </li>
            <li>No funky fragrance or oily film, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent is probably mild in terms of scented things, but to me it smells like I have a grandma sitting on my face when I&#x27;m trying to go to bed.</li>
            <li>If you are normal skin this might be ok for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for dry skin, face and hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hands down by far the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>This night cream is moderately heavy, but the skin soaks it up and feels great afterward.</li>
            <li>Learning that it is a \\&quot;cruelty free,\\&quot; all natural product as well is all the better.  </li>
            <li>and I need a facial moisturizer that is both effective and won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Formula seems to have changed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use it because it&#x27;s still the most natural moisturizer our there.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this has helped my skin to look younger as well.</li>
            <li>and I rarely can find it in the stores</li>
            <li>You also need a pea sized amount that gets absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews but had to for this.</li>
            <li>I like the smooth, light yet rich quality of this facial cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested several other hydration creams from Burts Bees and Avalon Organics, and I think this is truly the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products in-between and they just aren&#x27;t as good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Just the right weight.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, rich, thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very natural product, no bad stuff in it!</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been trying to fight my face acne at the young age of 24, and this past year I was on an escapade to determine the best product out there for my skin.</li>
            <li>Very gentle smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to coat my face on a hot summer night.</li>
            <li>Might be ok if done essential oil was added...</li>
            <li>This is my favorite facial cream.</li>
            <li>Great cream - thick but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have used many brands of facial cream, both day and night.</li>
            <li>Great, thick cream.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with this - its an all around excellent product.</li>
            <li>The jar lasts for about 3 weeks (depending on your usage) if you use it consistently every night.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>(AND I do go outdoors; for the first 40 years of my life, without sun screen).  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>Much like Eucerin Original Formula for the body, this stuff is like 12-year old skin in a bottle, but for your face!  </li>
            <li>what did it do, it made face very smooth and took dry spots away</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for someone in a dry climate, (DC is super humid in Summer) or someone who is looking for a good dry skin fix for the winter.</li>
            <li>It has a medium texture - not too greasy but certainly thicker than a daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was always jealous of how other people&#x27;s faces looked so radiantly clean and beautifully free from acne.</li>
            <li>the fine lines were gone - instantly!  </li>
            <li>and I noticed that I don&#x27;t use as much too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>I was amazed, nearly astonished at how smooth and healthy looking all my facial skin appeared, but especially so under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>in via subscribe and save on Amazon makes it much cheaper for me than buying it in a health food store</li>
            <li>Non-offensive scent and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really like it besides it is affordable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich/emollient cream (but not greasy), locks in the moisture all day/night, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause break</li>
            <li>I really like this line of skin care.  </li>
            <li>It is very hydrating without clogging pores.  </li>
            <li>Once you apply it to your face for the night, your face will stay moisten &amp; hydrated well until the morning and ready for you to start your day.</li>
            <li>Very affordable this way, and I never have to worry about running out.</li>
            <li>now my face is much clearer.</li>
            <li>So far, this is the right moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li>It is rich and deeply moisturizing for the whole night.</li>
            <li>with the weather mild at present, the cream is ok but remains to be seen how we cope with the extreme heat and hot north winds yet to come.</li>
            <li>I searched a long time and tried many products over the years, and this one by far is a keeper!</li>
            <li>Plus, a little goes a long way, so this is an extra great value!</li>
            <li>This was just ok, It was not very moisturizing for older skin.</li>
            <li>Love this, I ordered some other products from Earth Science can&#x27;t wait to try them all.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this book at the store and it was double the price.</li>
            <li>Very gentle with all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Does a decent job of moisterizing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild enough to use around my eyes as well.</li>
            <li>Great creme if you like thick, emollient, extra moisture.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several face products and finally found Earth Science, which I have now been using for many years.</li>
            <li>and it REALLY works, especially if you put it on at night right after washing your face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I actually notice a difference, which is rare.</li>
            <li>Seems like a nice night cream; however, it is stated to be &amp;#34;INTENSIVE&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t feel it is that thick or creamy.</li>
            <li>Dry skin from high altitude, winter heating, or natural course of ageing, this cream is soothing and filled with nutrients to give your skin a glowing appeal.</li>
            <li>The product appears in a tangerine colored glass jar and the product itself has a nice subtle scent to it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>To top it all off, it&#x27;s not expensive and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It  is pretty thick too, but if you apply while your face is damp, it rubs in easily</li>
            <li>The fewer and more basic the ingredients the better, and beauty doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive or surgical.</li>
            <li>This is definitely among the first things</li>
            <li>feels much better - no more &amp;#34;tightness&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t remember any pain the first time I used it, but the 2nd time-</li>
            <li>No one single product will do all things for all people, but for the price this is certainly worth giving it a try.  </li>
            <li>The price isn&#x27;t too bad, however after I ran out I switched to vanicream because the amount you get for the price is far better and it does moisturize better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I discovered it a while back at Whole Foods, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore there near me.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff smells like old lady.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I had bee n looking for a natural one</li>
            <li>I would probably love it if it didn&#x27;t have a bit of a bothersome scent (at least to me</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so far-</li>
            <li>When you put it on you can just FEEL the quality; it doesn&#x27;t stick like a mask or sheen like an oil, but just melts into your face and makes your skin feel soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>Within a couple days use, it improved the appearance of my skin considerably -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hydration creams really can be a remedial solution for acne prone skin, especially when your skin is not getting the nutrients it needs.</li>
            <li>And its SO soft.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to scents, I wouldn&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li>I love it because it keeps my sensitive skin moisturized and nourished without leaving it greasy or icky.  </li>
            <li>Application of this night cream by Earth Science is so easy where just a little dab of this stuff really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich, thick, and creamy</li>
            <li>This product is very rich and goes on thick</li>
            <li>I use this cream only, it makes my skin looks young and soft, i am 40, normal skin.</li>
            <li>This cream is NOT greasy and it really helps my skin all day long.   </li>
            <li>After a few days with Lancome &amp; Rejuvi, the fine lines were back.  </li>
            <li>I do like it, the cream really moisturizes my dry spots.</li>
            <li>This moisturizes well and does not seem to evaporate or absorb into the skin so much that it feels dry afterwards like a lot of skin creams.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this is one of the only natural products that I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li>Go easy on it though because it only takes a small amount.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good one for the cold winter months when your skin is extra dry.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m old enough to have been a hippie.  </li>
            <li>so good- am using it at night and during the day in this cold weather- skin</li>
            <li>when I wake in the morning my skin feels balanced (not dry or oily)</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin, and this product outperforms every fancy moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This stuff is super thick &amp; moisturizes all day &amp; night long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you only need a little to cover a large  area.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very nice night cream</li>
            <li> This night cream is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Great exceptional for the price night cream that I use day and night.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that would be good for my pores.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> Fair price.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Livestrong.com has some good acne maintenance tips.</li>
            <li> smells good, and feels good on Face</li>
            <li> If you truly want to take good care of your skin use Earth Science.</li>
            <li> I use Retin-A and needed something that would moisturizer and hydrate my skin, both of which this product does exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> I love this product and am so happy to find it here.</li>
            <li> There are some lotions and creams I like, but they seem to disappear into my skin (which feels great, but then my skin needs more after a couple hours).   </li>
            <li> My skin feels so nice after applying&lt;br /&gt;it &amp; still feels good in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it!  </li>
            <li> so I am really glad I found it on here!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Has a silky, nice feel though.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell, moisturizes well, and chemical free!  </li>
            <li> One of the best all natural night creams on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a good long time with magnificent results!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant and mild scent that smells almost like baby lotion.</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of strong</li>
            <li> While both Lancome and Rejuvi products are excellent, NEITHER got rid of the very fine lines starting to form under and around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I just love this company.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for almost 20 years, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to drift off to the smell of cheap perfume!</li>
            <li> I love the way it keeps my skin moist for hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m off to try more Earth Science items.</li>
            <li> Just love this product.</li>
            <li> , maybe it&#x27;s always wearing a hat, maybe not; but I have better skin than some 30 year-olds</li>
            <li> It also does not seem to sit on top of the skin like a coating.  </li>
            <li> I feel like my skin looks and feels more hydrated after using this for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely cream.  </li>
            <li> I have been using about a year and love it.</li>
            <li> Not in love with it</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but had to because this cream works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve used it day/night for about six wks now.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was hoping for a light apricot scent, but couldn&#x27;t detect anything, but the cream itself is nice.  </li>
            <li> I would order again, but wish they&#x27;d put a bit more apricot in it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love this cream.</li>
            <li> The best part that I love about this 2-step system: it&#x27;s really simple and they&#x27;re both eco-friendly products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 1 week every night before bed and my skin has changed for the better.</li>
            <li> But most of all, I have noticed my skin just looks better and more radiant.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say more than that for a product.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> But, I will not be able to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Second order, great night moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Nice,  smooth,  rich cream.</li>
            <li> I love that it is a cruelty free product.</li>
            <li> I am frequently told that I have great skin and asked what products I use on it.</li>
            <li> ; too, no bad chemicals!</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but lasts all of 15-20 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have issues with strong fragrances and oily products and have not had a problem with this in either regard.</li>
            <li> It seems to diminish the fine little&lt;</li>
            <li> It is great that shipping is free for individual products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;for cheap price.</li>
            <li> Feels lathering and smooth on the face.</li>
            <li> This is a big win.</li>
            <li> One application again of this lotion (also applied it to my elbows, hands, and feet) and everything was smooth as silk again.  </li>
            <li> With this cream I wake up with smooth unlined skin.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to have found it, and I have bought several jars now.</li>
            <li> It always blends in smoothly and my skin looks refreshed and renewed in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, softens my skin &amp; does not cause any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the level of moisture I get from this cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, light, non-greasy, and seems to really work to keep wrinkles and dryness to a minimum.</li>
            <li> It erased fine wrinkles and significantly softened what remained.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and it applies very easily.</li>
            <li> For it to be so rich it does not leave my combo skin overly oily and</li>
            <li> This cream is listed as a night time cream, but I use it in the morning and it is great all day long.  </li>
            <li> After two months of consistent use, I have not seen any reduction in fine lines, but my skin is soft, so I think it&#x27;s a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream, with helped me with my dry face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and it meets all my expectations for a good night cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a comforting and smooth scent, not too powerful either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First discovered this product at Whole Foods, but found better price on Amazon, of course.</li>
            <li> Being loyal to my tried &amp; true Lancome, I didn&#x27;t continue using this product.  </li>
            <li> I first tried it from an all natural shop and just loved it right away.  </li>
            <li> No funky fragrance or oily film, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The scent is probably mild in terms of scented things, but to me it smells like I have a grandma sitting on my face when I&#x27;m trying to go to bed.</li>
            <li> If you are normal skin this might be ok for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for dry skin, face and hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hands down by far the best on the market.  </li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> This night cream is moderately heavy, but the skin soaks it up and feels great afterward.</li>
            <li> Learning that it is a \\&quot;cruelty free,\\&quot; all natural product as well is all the better.  </li>
            <li> and I need a facial moisturizer that is both effective and won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Formula seems to have changed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use it because it&#x27;s still the most natural moisturizer our there.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this has helped my skin to look younger as well.</li>
            <li> and I rarely can find it in the stores</li>
            <li> You also need a pea sized amount that gets absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but had to for this.</li>
            <li> I like the smooth, light yet rich quality of this facial cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested several other hydration creams from Burts Bees and Avalon Organics, and I think this is truly the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products in-between and they just aren&#x27;t as good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Just the right weight.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, rich, thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very natural product, no bad stuff in it!</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been trying to fight my face acne at the young age of 24, and this past year I was on an escapade to determine the best product out there for my skin.</li>
            <li> Very gentle smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to coat my face on a hot summer night.</li>
            <li> Might be ok if done essential oil was added...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial cream.</li>
            <li> Great cream - thick but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have used many brands of facial cream, both day and night.</li>
            <li> Great, thick cream.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this - its an all around excellent product.</li>
            <li> The jar lasts for about 3 weeks (depending on your usage) if you use it consistently every night.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> (AND I do go outdoors; for the first 40 years of my life, without sun screen).  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> Much like Eucerin Original Formula for the body, this stuff is like 12-year old skin in a bottle, but for your face!  </li>
            <li> what did it do, it made face very smooth and took dry spots away</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for someone in a dry climate, (DC is super humid in Summer) or someone who is looking for a good dry skin fix for the winter.</li>
            <li> It has a medium texture - not too greasy but certainly thicker than a daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was always jealous of how other people&#x27;s faces looked so radiantly clean and beautifully free from acne.</li>
            <li> the fine lines were gone - instantly!  </li>
            <li> and I noticed that I don&#x27;t use as much too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> I was amazed, nearly astonished at how smooth and healthy looking all my facial skin appeared, but especially so under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> in via subscribe and save on Amazon makes it much cheaper for me than buying it in a health food store</li>
            <li> Non-offensive scent and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really like it besides it is affordable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rich/emollient cream (but not greasy), locks in the moisture all day/night, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause break</li>
            <li> I really like this line of skin care.  </li>
            <li> It is very hydrating without clogging pores.  </li>
            <li> Once you apply it to your face for the night, your face will stay moisten &amp; hydrated well until the morning and ready for you to start your day.</li>
            <li> Very affordable this way, and I never have to worry about running out.</li>
            <li> now my face is much clearer.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the right moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li> It is rich and deeply moisturizing for the whole night.</li>
            <li> with the weather mild at present, the cream is ok but remains to be seen how we cope with the extreme heat and hot north winds yet to come.</li>
            <li> I searched a long time and tried many products over the years, and this one by far is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Plus, a little goes a long way, so this is an extra great value!</li>
            <li> This was just ok, It was not very moisturizing for older skin.</li>
            <li> Love this, I ordered some other products from Earth Science can&#x27;t wait to try them all.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this book at the store and it was double the price.</li>
            <li> Very gentle with all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Does a decent job of moisterizing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild enough to use around my eyes as well.</li>
            <li> Great creme if you like thick, emollient, extra moisture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several face products and finally found Earth Science, which I have now been using for many years.</li>
            <li> and it REALLY works, especially if you put it on at night right after washing your face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I actually notice a difference, which is rare.</li>
            <li> Seems like a nice night cream; however, it is stated to be &amp;#34;INTENSIVE&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t feel it is that thick or creamy.</li>
            <li> Dry skin from high altitude, winter heating, or natural course of ageing, this cream is soothing and filled with nutrients to give your skin a glowing appeal.</li>
            <li> The product appears in a tangerine colored glass jar and the product itself has a nice subtle scent to it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> To top it all off, it&#x27;s not expensive and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It  is pretty thick too, but if you apply while your face is damp, it rubs in easily</li>
            <li> The fewer and more basic the ingredients the better, and beauty doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive or surgical.</li>
            <li> This is definitely among the first things</li>
            <li> feels much better - no more &amp;#34;tightness&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t remember any pain the first time I used it, but the 2nd time-</li>
            <li> No one single product will do all things for all people, but for the price this is certainly worth giving it a try.  </li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t too bad, however after I ran out I switched to vanicream because the amount you get for the price is far better and it does moisturize better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I discovered it a while back at Whole Foods, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore there near me.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff smells like old lady.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had bee n looking for a natural one</li>
            <li> I would probably love it if it didn&#x27;t have a bit of a bothersome scent (at least to me</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so far-</li>
            <li> When you put it on you can just FEEL the quality; it doesn&#x27;t stick like a mask or sheen like an oil, but just melts into your face and makes your skin feel soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> Within a couple days use, it improved the appearance of my skin considerably -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hydration creams really can be a remedial solution for acne prone skin, especially when your skin is not getting the nutrients it needs.</li>
            <li> And its SO soft.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to scents, I wouldn&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> I love it because it keeps my sensitive skin moisturized and nourished without leaving it greasy or icky.  </li>
            <li> Application of this night cream by Earth Science is so easy where just a little dab of this stuff really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rich, thick, and creamy</li>
            <li> This product is very rich and goes on thick</li>
            <li> I use this cream only, it makes my skin looks young and soft, i am 40, normal skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is NOT greasy and it really helps my skin all day long.   </li>
            <li> After a few days with Lancome &amp; Rejuvi, the fine lines were back.  </li>
            <li> I do like it, the cream really moisturizes my dry spots.</li>
            <li> This moisturizes well and does not seem to evaporate or absorb into the skin so much that it feels dry afterwards like a lot of skin creams.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this is one of the only natural products that I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li> Go easy on it though because it only takes a small amount.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good one for the cold winter months when your skin is extra dry.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m old enough to have been a hippie.  </li>
            <li> so good- am using it at night and during the day in this cold weather- skin</li>
            <li> when I wake in the morning my skin feels balanced (not dry or oily)</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin, and this product outperforms every fancy moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super thick &amp; moisturizes all day &amp; night long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you only need a little to cover a large  area.</li>
            <li> Formula is thick and moisturizing, smells of fresh apricots.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need extra facial oil for my dry patches.  </li>
            <li> I use a substantial amount of benzoyl peroxide every night and this cream mixed with jojoba oil keeps my dry, flakey skin under control.</li>
            <li> I can really only recommend it to someone with dry skin though.</li>
            <li> I added some lavender drops but it is barely useable due to the smell.  </li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin as I do, this is not moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin moist/comfortable all day long.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product for as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> Have been breaking out in some strange bumps since using it, but am still experimenting to make this is what is causing it.</li>
            <li> and like I said my skin is absurdly not sensitive</li>
            <li> and I do not have sensitive skin, but it tends to be a little dry.</li>
            <li> I could actually see sharp distinction</li>
            <li> My skin is on the dry side</li>
            <li> I started using this cream because during the winter my face gets extremely dry even when I have combination skin type.</li>
            <li> I use it nightly and sometimes for dry patches during the day.  </li>
            <li> However, this apricot intensive night cream is just about for anyone who has overly dry or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> and I am fragrance sensitive) and I am not sure if it is causing an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> Mine had no fragrance at all, and I&#x27;m sensitive to smell and usually can&#x27;t stand fragrance.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this is for you!</li>
            <li> We also have the same Earth Science brand in a cleanser, which does have a slight apricot scent to it.  </li>
            <li> I have a trouble dry spot in the center of my forehead that need extra attention in winter.</li>
            <li> It is smoother, clearer (less breakouts) and completely moisturized- no more dry spots.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I always read the ingredients carefully</li>
            <li> The tub lasts a long time, as use is very minimal due to consistency.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever because a little bit smooths a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I only need to use a little every night as its so thick so will last awhile</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am not sure if I would have initially purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night for over 20 years - would not change to any other product.</li>
            <li> HATE the &amp;#34;new formula &amp;#34; which is not as penetrating and lasting as the original which I used since it came out almost 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> It helps me to avoid getting dry skin on my face and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or breakouts (at least not for me).</li>
            <li> , otherwise it can feel a little greasy</li>
            <li> This little jar does the trick well.  </li>
            <li> Feels really nice and creamy but unfortunately smells bad.</li>
            <li> I got this night cream to use during the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and no cloying fragrance.</li>
            <li> Oh, am I in trouble for telling the truth here?&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> It is very thick, but it spreads out well, so a little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick and works well with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this until I forced myself to stop picking at my face, which I saw a rapid improvement in my face in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> Thick and heavy duty with moisturizing</li>
            <li> For daytime, I also use an Earth Science&#x27;s moisturizer because its creams don&#x27;t contain parabens and other unnecessary ingredients and harmful preservatives.  </li>
            <li> Think I will be switching to just plain hyurolonic acid which is the &amp;#34;key&amp;#34; ingredient!</li>
            <li> I do credit this product with at least some of this lack of wrinkles</li>
            <li> At least sample it in the store before you buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, silky and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> No need to dry your skin out with artificial benzoyl</li>
            <li> mid 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have bad skin, yet wanted to keep moisture day &amp; night in the summer heat.  </li>
            <li> So stop picking at your face,  wash your face at least 2x as recommended, and, you&#x27;ll see results that you&#x27;ve been awaiting!</li>
            <li> or I get bored.  </li>
            <li> Silly, I know, but that’s the way I am.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I lost the box</li>
            <li> so badly-</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t repurchase as I hate the feeling.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does a decent job of moisterizing but this stuff smells like old lady. I added some lavender drops but it is barely useable due to the smell.  I can&#x27;t stand it and won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I got this night cream to use during the harsh winter months. I have a trouble dry spot in the center of my forehead that need extra attention in winter. I got this having heard nothing of the company beforehand. I do like it, the cream really moisturizes my dry spots. It  is pretty thick too, but if you apply while your face is damp, it rubs in easily and I noticed that I don&#x27;t use as much too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that it is summer I have only used it a few times. I don&#x27;t want to coat my face on a hot summer night. I don&#x27;t think that would be good for my pores. I would recommend this product for someone in a dry climate, (DC is super humid in Summer) or someone who is looking for a good dry skin fix for the winter.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great, smells great, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune. Plus, I just love this company. All-natural, cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin as I do, this is not moisturizing enough. Not even enought for  the day time.</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of strong so I gave 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose! It&#x27;s very rich, thick, and creamy so you only need a tiny bit to cover your face and neck in the evening. This couples well with my c-serum. The smell is strong but lasts all of 15-20 seconds. For it to be so rich it does not leave my combo skin overly oily and when I wake in the morning my skin feels balanced (not dry or oily)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and it meets all my expectations for a good night cream.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a week. My skin feels so nice after applying&lt;br /&gt;it &amp; still feels good in the morning. I&#x27;ll apply it in the morning if I&#x27;m not&lt;br /&gt;planning on putting on make up.  It seems to diminish the fine little&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;wrinkles to be&amp;#34; but that might just be wishful thinking.  Good product&lt;br /&gt;for cheap price.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I use it during the day as well as at night. It is very thick and works well with my dry skin.It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is very rich and goes on thick so you only need a little to cover a large  area. After two months of consistent use, I have not seen any reduction in fine lines, but my skin is soft, so I think it&#x27;s a good moisturizer.It  irritates my eyes if I get too close so I won&#x27;t repurchase as I hate the feeling.</li>
            <li> HATE the &amp;#34;new formula &amp;#34; which is not as penetrating and lasting as the original which I used since it came out almost 30 years ago. Think I will be switching to just plain hyurolonic acid which is the &amp;#34;key&amp;#34; ingredient!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a good long time with magnificent results! The affordability and visible skin improvement make me come back to Earth Science&#x27;s &amp;#34;Apricot Intensive Night Cream.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, rich, thick moisturizer. I use a substantial amount of benzoyl peroxide every night and this cream mixed with jojoba oil keeps my dry, flakey skin under control. The price isn&#x27;t too bad, however after I ran out I switched to vanicream because the amount you get for the price is far better and it does moisturize better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Seems like a nice night cream; however, it is stated to be &amp;#34;INTENSIVE&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t feel it is that thick or creamy.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I had bee n looking for a natural one and my daughter recommended this. I have used 3,jars. I use it as a moisturizer under makeup and also nite cream. I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> Feels really nice and creamy but unfortunately smells bad. Might be ok if done essential oil was added...</li>
            <li> Very nice night cream I would recommend</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  I have sensitive skin, and this is one of the only natural products that I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  I use it with their apricot scrub at night, and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I like the smooth, light yet rich quality of this facial cream. I wear it night and day. It&#x27;s good for dry skin, face and hands.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial cream. It&#x27;s thick, silky and absorbs well. I highly recommend it. It is my go-to cream though I use others off and on.</li>
            <li> It is great that shipping is free for individual products on Amazon. Otherwise, I am not sure if I would have initially purchased. Formula is thick and moisturizing, smells of fresh apricots. The tub lasts a long time, as use is very minimal due to consistency. Feels lathering and smooth on the face. Noticeable results every morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for almost 20 years, and I LOVE it. I&#x27;m so happy to discover that Amazon sells it for a great price.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. Fair price.</li>
            <li> Just the right weight. It keeps me feeling refreshed all night. Not too heavy and no cloying fragrance. This is a big win. I don&#x27;t want to drift off to the smell of cheap perfume!</li>
            <li> Use it all the time. I use this cream only, it makes my skin looks young and soft, i am 40, normal skin. I have been using this cream for 5 years, i was trying different stuff but always go back to earth science. Very gentle smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I love the way it keeps my skin moist for hours. It&#x27;s mild enough to use around my eyes as well.</li>
            <li> I am using this cream for years. It&#x27;s the only cream which keeps my face well moisturised without break outs. I use it as a day cream as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Lancome moisturizers at $105 for 2oz for years.  While both Lancome and Rejuvi products are excellent, NEITHER got rid of the very fine lines starting to form under and around my eyes.  Tried this just on a whim and wham the fine lines were gone - instantly!  I was amazed, nearly astonished at how smooth and healthy looking all my facial skin appeared, but especially so under my eyes.  It erased fine wrinkles and significantly softened what remained.  Being loyal to my tried &amp; true Lancome, I didn&#x27;t continue using this product.  After a few days with Lancome &amp; Rejuvi, the fine lines were back.  One application again of this lotion (also applied it to my elbows, hands, and feet) and everything was smooth as silk again.  Much like Eucerin Original Formula for the body, this stuff is like 12-year old skin in a bottle, but for your face!  Excellent for your neck and decolletage as well.  And, as others have mentioned you need only a dab or two for all day hydration.  I use it now as a day cream under makeup.  This non-greasy formula has made a believer out of me.  No one single product will do all things for all people, but for the price this is certainly worth giving it a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it!  Learning that it is a \\&quot;cruelty free,\\&quot; all natural product as well is all the better.  I&#x27;m off to try more Earth Science items.</li>
            <li> I love this product and am so happy to find it here. I first tried it from an all natural shop and just loved it right away.  It is rich and deeply moisturizing for the whole night. And in the winter months I use this for daytime too.</li>
            <li> Thick and heavy duty with moisturizing, this is my go-to night cream.</li>
            <li> Nice,  smooth,  rich cream. Perfect nice cream.</li>
            <li> Just love this product. I can really only recommend it to someone with dry skin though. I use it during the day as well as the evening. It lasts forever because a little bit smooths a long way. I&#x27;ve used other products in-between and they just aren&#x27;t as good on my skin. This keeps my skin moist/comfortable all day long. I will buy this product for as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this night cream for years and my skin is proof of its efficacy.  Maybe it&#x27;s genetics, maybe it&#x27;s being a vegetarian, maybe it&#x27;s always wearing a hat, maybe not; but I have better skin than some 30 year-olds and I&#x27;m old enough to have been a hippie.  With this cream I wake up with smooth unlined skin.  For daytime, I also use an Earth Science&#x27;s moisturizer because its creams don&#x27;t contain parabens and other unnecessary ingredients and harmful preservatives.  The fewer and more basic the ingredients the better, and beauty doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive or surgical.</li>
            <li> Best all day cream, moisturizes my skin without making me break out. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great cream - thick but not greasy.  Great coverage.</li>
            <li> This night cream is moderately heavy, but the skin soaks it up and feels great afterward. I love that it is a cruelty free product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizes well and does not seem to evaporate or absorb into the skin so much that it feels dry afterwards like a lot of skin creams.  It also does not seem to sit on top of the skin like a coating.  I would probably love it if it didn&#x27;t have a bit of a bothersome scent (at least to me and I am fragrance sensitive) and I am not sure if it is causing an allergic reaction.  Have been breaking out in some strange bumps since using it, but am still experimenting to make this is what is causing it.</li>
            <li> This is an essential part of my daily skin care! I have very sensitive skin and I need a facial moisturizer that is both effective and won&#x27;t irritate my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this one daily for years now. It helps me to avoid getting dry skin on my face and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or breakouts (at least not for me). It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and it applies very easily. I am frequently told that I have great skin and asked what products I use on it. This is definitely among the first things I&#x27;d recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Getting in via subscribe and save on Amazon makes it much cheaper for me than buying it in a health food store so I am really glad I found it on here!</li>
            <li> It has a medium texture - not too greasy but certainly thicker than a daytime moisturizer. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with breakouts and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great exceptional for the price night cream that I use day and night.  Wonderful product...</li>
            <li> Non-offensive scent and very moisturizing. Am on my second jar and will definitely repurchase as needed.</li>
            <li> Great creme if you like thick, emollient, extra moisture.  I don&#x27;t even need extra facial oil for my dry patches.  Really great for aging skin. No funky fragrance or oily film, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands of facial cream, both day and night. I discovered this one while trying to lower the amount of money I shell out each month on beauty products. I am happy to have found it, and I have bought several jars now. It is not greasy and absorbs well. I feel like my skin looks and feels more hydrated after using this for a couple of weeks. I have issues with strong fragrances and oily products and have not had a problem with this in either regard. I would definitely recommend this product. It works well and it won&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I use it day and night, and it&#x27;s great under makeup. I have dry, sensitive skin, and this product outperforms every fancy moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried. It has a very light scent, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> so far- so good- am using it at night and during the day in this cold weather- skin feels much better - no more &amp;#34;tightness&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Formula seems to have changed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use it because it&#x27;s still the most natural moisturizer our there.</li>
            <li> Great, thick cream.  I discovered it a while back at Whole Foods, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore there near me.  It&#x27;s a very good one for the cold winter months when your skin is extra dry.  It has a pleasant and mild scent that smells almost like baby lotion.</li>
            <li> They met my expectations given the description and they came with another product and both came well packaged and intact.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought it. It smells wonderful! I sometimes open it just to smell it. It&#x27;s like a comforting and smooth scent, not too powerful either. When you put it on you can just FEEL the quality; it doesn&#x27;t stick like a mask or sheen like an oil, but just melts into your face and makes your skin feel soft and pliable. I use it every time I get out of the shower, because my face wash dries my skin up. It&#x27;s a great combo.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely cream.  Go easy on it though because it only takes a small amount.  I like to add just a dab of the cream to my face, otherwise it can feel a little greasy and I don’t like greasy.  The fragrance is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t wear any cream every day, I like to change them around or I get bored.  Silly, I know, but that’s the way I am.  This is a cream I always seem to come back to.  It’s one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> This night cream is amazing!  I love it because it keeps my sensitive skin moisturized and nourished without leaving it greasy or icky.  It always blends in smoothly and my skin looks refreshed and renewed in the morning.  Honestly, this has helped my skin to look younger as well. Plus, a little goes a long way, so this is an extra great value!</li>
            <li> with the weather mild at present, the cream is ok but remains to be seen how we cope with the extreme heat and hot north winds yet to come. I have been using it  during the day as well</li>
            <li> This was just ok, It was not very moisturizing for older skin. I will not be repurchasing again.If you are normal skin this might be ok for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using about a year and love it. My skin is on the dry side and I am in my sixties........but skin does not show signs of age since I began using this cream! I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I started using this cream because during the winter my face gets extremely dry even when I have combination skin type. It helped with the dryness in just 2 uses. I really like it besides it is affordable.</li>
            <li> Not in love with it but I suppose it does the trick. Not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this is for you! Wonderful texture and I wake up with my face still feeling the moisture!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but had to because this cream works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve used it day/night for about six wks now. Within a couple days use, it improved the appearance of my skin considerably - I wasn&#x27;t expecting that at all! It&#x27;s very rich/emollient cream (but not greasy), locks in the moisture all day/night, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First discovered this product at Whole Foods, but found better price on Amazon, of course. The ingredient list appears to be &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; too, no bad chemicals! To top it all off, it&#x27;s not expensive and a little goes a long way. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this - its an all around excellent product.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, moisturizes well, and chemical free!  I use it nightly and sometimes for dry patches during the day.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super thick &amp; moisturizes all day &amp; night long.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m mid 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have bad skin, yet wanted to keep moisture day &amp; night in the summer heat.  This little jar does the trick well.  I use it under makeup during the day &amp; alone at night.  It goes on smoothly, softens my skin &amp; does not cause any breakouts.  So far, this is the right moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this line of skin care.  I have skin that is acne-prone AND aging/sensitive/delicate.  I use the A-D-E cleanser (with a Clarisonic), the aloe vera toner, and I use this apricot intensive cream at night.  It is very hydrating without clogging pores.  It is very thick, but it spreads out well, so a little goes a LONG way.  Take just a tiny bit at a time, or you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;re wasting a lot.</li>
            <li> Mine had no fragrance at all, and I&#x27;m sensitive to smell and usually can&#x27;t stand fragrance.  Anyway, I was hoping for a light apricot scent, but couldn&#x27;t detect anything, but the cream itself is nice.  We also have the same Earth Science brand in a cleanser, which does have a slight apricot scent to it.  I would order again, but wish they&#x27;d put a bit more apricot in it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and I rarely can find it in the stores so I order it from amazon all the time.    This cream is NOT greasy and it really helps my skin all day long.   There are some lotions and creams I like, but they seem to disappear into my skin (which feels great, but then my skin needs more after a couple hours).   This cream is listed as a night time cream, but I use it in the morning and it is great all day long.  I even wear it under makeup.</li>
            <li> The product appears in a tangerine colored glass jar and the product itself has a nice subtle scent to it. I use Retin-A and needed something that would moisturizer and hydrate my skin, both of which this product does exceptionally well. You also need a pea sized amount that gets absorbed into the skin. When I wake up my skin looks rested and hydrated. Also note, I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Good product. I&#x27;ve used it for years without any allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love this cream. I only need to use a little every night as its so thick so will last awhile and I love that it&#x27;s all natural! Love this, I ordered some other products from Earth Science can&#x27;t wait to try them all.</li>
            <li> Dry skin from high altitude, winter heating, or natural course of ageing, this cream is soothing and filled with nutrients to give your skin a glowing appeal.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been trying to fight my face acne at the young age of 24, and this past year I was on an escapade to determine the best product out there for my skin. I was always jealous of how other people&#x27;s faces looked so radiantly clean and beautifully free from acne. But now I think I&#x27;ve found the answer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydration creams really can be a remedial solution for acne prone skin, especially when your skin is not getting the nutrients it needs. However, this apricot intensive night cream is just about for anyone who has overly dry or acne-prone skin. I&#x27;ve tested several other hydration creams from Burts Bees and Avalon Organics, and I think this is truly the best. Application of this night cream by Earth Science is so easy where just a little dab of this stuff really goes a long way. The jar lasts for about 3 weeks (depending on your usage) if you use it consistently every night. Once you apply it to your face for the night, your face will stay moisten &amp; hydrated well until the morning and ready for you to start your day. No need for a second application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash your face with Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Facial Cleanser and apply this cream, and you&#x27;ll see healthier skin in days! The best part that I love about this 2-step system: it&#x27;s really simple and they&#x27;re both eco-friendly products. No need to dry your skin out with artificial benzoyl peroxide!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for those that are struggling with acne, sometimes a change of habits is in order. I didn&#x27;t realize this until I forced myself to stop picking at my face, which I saw a rapid improvement in my face in less than a week.  So stop picking at your face,  wash your face at least 2x as recommended, and, you&#x27;ll see results that you&#x27;ve been awaiting! Livestrong.com has some good acne maintenance tips.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but had to for this. This is the best night cream! I have been using this for 1 week every night before bed and my skin has changed for the better. It is smoother, clearer (less breakouts) and completely moisturized- no more dry spots. And its SO soft. But most of all, I have noticed my skin just looks better and more radiant. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night for over 20 years - would not change to any other product. It&#x27;s amazing, light, non-greasy, and seems to really work to keep wrinkles and dryness to a minimum. I am 67 and people guess that I&#x27;m around 55. I do credit this product with at least some of this lack of wrinkles (AND I do go outdoors; for the first 40 years of my life, without sun screen).  Can&#x27;t say more than that for a product. In addition I use the day cream (Earth Science Almond Aloe Moisturizer - unscented). Together, a perfect team.  I use the \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; option and have them both delivered on a regular schedule. Very affordable this way, and I never have to worry about running out.</li>
            <li> smells good, and feels good on Face</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 years.  I absolutely LOVE it!  It hydrates and softens my skin and adds an apricot glow! ;)  I searched a long time and tried many products over the years, and this one by far is a keeper!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to scents, I wouldn&#x27;t get this. The scent is probably mild in terms of scented things, but to me it smells like I have a grandma sitting on my face when I&#x27;m trying to go to bed. I can&#x27;t stand it. And, you can&#x27;t return it under Amazon&#x27;s return policy. At least sample it in the store before you buy.</li>
            <li> Broke me out.  Guess it is too oily for me.  Has a silky, nice feel though.  But, I will not be able to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this book at the store and it was double the price. so I search and found it on amazon. This is a great cream, with helped me with my dry face. now my face is much clearer.</li>
            <li> One of the best all natural night creams on the market.</li>
            <li> All the products by Earth Science are awesome. In 1993 a Paul Mitchell representative came to my mothers shop and took some of these products. So, Paul.Mitchell products may have been influenced by this chemistry. Oh, am I in trouble for telling the truth here?&lt;br /&gt;Now what did it do, it made face very smooth and took dry spots away, I am very happy with product.</li>
            <li> Second order, great night moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. Its not oily and it REALLY works, especially if you put it on at night right after washing your face.</li>
            <li> I have known this product for 20 years; the good thing is they have not changed the formula, which is great; probably one of the best creams out there! The only thing they have changed is the packaging. Very natural product, no bad stuff in it!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the level of moisture I get from this cream. I use it both day and night. I actually notice a difference, which is rare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several face products and finally found Earth Science, which I have now been using for many years. It&#x27;s hands down by far the best on the market.  Very gentle with all natural ingredients.  If you truly want to take good care of your skin use Earth Science.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 and I do not have sensitive skin, but it tends to be a little dry. I used this lotion twice and each time my face turned candy apple red. Maybe I didn&#x27;t remember any pain the first time I used it, but the 2nd time- last night- my face didn&#x27;t tingle it BURNT. I could actually see sharp distinction were I had missed a spot. I always read the ingredients carefully and I often use \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products so I can&#x27;t think of what could have irritated my skin so badly- and like I said my skin is absurdly not sensitive, I&#x27;m probably part rhinoceros. I used to use a AHA creme quite often and I never had the reaction I had to this creme. I&#x27;m waiting for the Earth Science company to write me back. Unfortunately I lost the box and I think it was a discontinued style jar (it is white not orange like the one that is pictured here) because the company name is slightly different- I guess there were 2 cosmetic companies with the same name and these folks had to change their name.</li>
