            <li>The perfect lotion for out of the shower or bath.  </li>
            <li>Non oily, non toxic, and a wonderful fragrance, without the cancerigenous compounds.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent lotion.</li>
            <li>a Caucasian user of this product and their soaps, all I can say is when a product is great for your skin, it doesn&#x27;t matter the skin you are in!</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim and it is the best lotion!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good lotion to keep my skin hydrated, since Jergens cannot seem to keep theirs on the store shelves, when I found this wonderful lotion on the Amazon marketplace.  </li>
            <li>This is actually a great lotion, but the reason I am giving it three stars is because when I use it on my face around my eyes it stings.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It does not have  a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell, as in light and flowery, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;the scent is very nice and lasts for hours - I&#x27;ll put some on in the afternoon/evening, and the next morning, I can still smell it</li>
            <li>This lotion has a fresh clean and sexy scent, my husband and I use it.</li>
            <li>Nubian raw shea butter lotion is great!  </li>

            <li>Shipped quickly and all that; think after trying the Gold Bond Shea Butter with extra moisturizers I wanted this one to be more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>and I endorse Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter Lotion as a necessity because it is absolutely THE best hydrating lotion I have ever tried in my young-looking, 60 year old life!  </li>
            <li>the scent is a bit much for me right now, but thats because I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
            <li>Having dry skin, this is a real workhorse - Smells pretty good as well...</li>

            <li> It is super thick but soaks in well.  </li>
            <li> I really like that the lotion is so thick, but it needs a pump to get all the lotion out when you get near the bottom of the container</li>
            <li> Even though it is quite thick, it absorbs right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this raw shea butter lotion for over 3 years now and really like it.</li>
            <li> and I expect to be a regular and faithful customer of this merchant for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this lotion all the time now and it has really helped, NO more cracks!  </li>
            <li> I look forward to slathering it on every single day!</li>
            <li> and so I have enough to pack on a few trips that are planned.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need a lot because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> All of their other scents are just as dreamy and luscious.</li>
            <li> A couple of my other friends have been using it and it is working for them as well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain any parabens or other toxic ingredients, and the scent is extremely subtle (unlike the coconut lotion made by the same company).</li>
            <li> I wanted an all-purpose lotion so that I could have less clutter in my bathroom and just to make life easier, but this just wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I tried a little also</li>
            <li> I use this after I wash my face with Nubian coconut and papaya bar soap, which exfoliates, dissolves dead skin cells and prevents blockage.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> B000MC5US8 Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter Lotion 13 Fl.</li>
            <li> See my review of the Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter Body Wash--these two products go together.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried these products you don&#x27;t know what you are missing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and hard to get out; I store the bottle upside down to make it easier, but I never do quite get all of it out.</li>
            <li> so if you have any difficulties using your hands to squeeze hard, have someone else express it into a lidded jar, or softer plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> ( consistency is thick and can make it hard to apply).</li>
            <li> Because it is so thick I also have a hard time getting the product to come out of the bottle and have to knock the bottle around to get it out.</li>
            <li> When I was young, I thought it was so boring to give my grandparents body wash and lotion for birthdays and Christmas, but now I totally understand!  </li>
            <li> Since its so thick, comes out easier that way.</li>
            <li> Its a thick solution almost like toothpaste but no problem rubbing it in and</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s almost as thick as their hand cream, which I also adore.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have the time to sit and rub a thick lotion in.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not oily, but it is thick and it keeps the skin moisturized for hours.</li>

            <li> Just after two days, I&#x27;m ordering another bottle to last me through the summer and so I have enough to pack on a few trips that are planned.</li>
            <li> Nubian raw shea butter lotion is great!  The perfect lotion for out of the shower or bath.  It has such an exotic scent ~ hard to describe, but my kids love it.  Not too greasy, dries rapidly on your body.  A++++++</li>
            <li> This rich, yet non-greasy, lotion is a godsend. It smells fantastic and has superior moisturizing effects. I look forward to slathering it on every single day!</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I use.  Non oily, non toxic, and a wonderful fragrance, without the cancerigenous compounds.</li>
            <li> Even though it is quite thick, it absorbs right away. Really helps my feet and heels when they get dry. Works better for me to just remove the cap to use it. Since its so thick, comes out easier that way. Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product twice daily on my face. I&#x27;m quite pleased with it. I&#x27;m really glad I found out about it. It has a pleasant scent and goes on smoothly on my face.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent lotion. It smells delighful and is natural, leaving the skin very soft. I use this after I wash my face with Nubian coconut and papaya bar soap, which exfoliates, dissolves dead skin cells and prevents blockage.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000MC5US8 Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter Lotion 13 Fl. Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000J3ZMQA Nubian Heritage Coconut &amp; Papaya Soap 5 Oz X 6 Bars]]</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It is BY FAR the best I&#x27;ve ever used. The frankensense and myrhh fragrance is heavenly. I really like that the lotion is so thick, but it needs a pump to get all the lotion out when you get near the bottom of the container</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s thick but spreads easily.  A little goes a long way.  I love that shea butter is the first ingredient in this product.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the sent which tends to linger.  Unless I can find something that smells better with similar ingredients, this will be a permanent staple for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion due to it&#x27;s not greasy and it smells awsome.  I&#x27;m on my second day using this product and the ladies love the smell also fellas.  Its a thick solution almost like toothpaste but no problem rubbing it in and the sent last all day until you wash it off. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in the upside down-style bottle or even a tub. It&#x27;s very thick and hard to get out; I store the bottle upside down to make it easier, but I never do quite get all of it out. That said, I will continue to purchase because I love the scent and it moisturizes pretty well.</li>
            <li> Just like the soap.  This lotion has a fresh clean and sexy scent, my husband and I use it. It was very thick however and I had to mix unscented lotion to thin it out.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturising but also VERY fragrant. Like perfume others will notice that you are wearing it. It&#x27;s not bad smelling just somewhat overbearing. So I only use this before I go to bed</li>
            <li> This is a clean fresh scent. I feel pampered and I live that it&#x27;s not greasy at all. If you haven&#x27;t tried these products you don&#x27;t know what you are missing!</li>
            <li> I love this company especially now that I&#x27;m gearing toward organic...natural products.I love that this lotion is actually thick like a body cream...it leaves my dry skin very soft...the scent is a bit much for me right now, but thats because I&#x27;m pregnant.I still use it though because its a quality product.:)</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a few weeks and really love it&#x27;s staying power. I feel moist, not greasy. Also the dry/scaly sheen look on my legs has FINALLY subsided and appears normal. I&#x27;ve been using all kinds of over the counter stuff as lotion to no avail.   I love that the Shea butter really gets in there and does it&#x27;s job of conditioning my skin ( withought me having to be sliding off the couch!)  and it looks much healthier overall.    Susan</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and all that; think after trying the Gold Bond Shea Butter with extra moisturizers I wanted this one to be more moisturizing.  I did think it felt good on the skin but if they added some special moisturizers, to me, it would be perfect!  :)</li>
            <li> By far the best lotion I have ever used. I have tried everything, high end, low end, coconut oil, shea butter, emu oil, jojoba oil, whipped body butters, layers of this, layers of that.....and these folks have found the right combo for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-LOVE the thickness of this lotion - it&#x27;s almost as thick as their hand cream, which I also adore.&lt;br /&gt;- the scent is lovely....soft...leaves a very pleasant, understated, clean, feminine memory.&lt;br /&gt;- price is mind blowing for such a RICH product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they would make an unscented though as I like to wear other scents, but this is wonderful. All of their other scents are just as dreamy and luscious. A fan forever.</li>
            <li> Smells great, fresh, simple pleasant fragrance.  I love it, too.  Bought for my kids grandma.  She keeps asking me to reorder it.  It&#x27;s the 4th time she&#x27;s got it.  Shea is very moisturizing, and this product has alot of it in the lotion.</li>
            <li> This is actually a great lotion, but the reason I am giving it three stars is because when I use it on my face around my eyes it stings. I wanted an all-purpose lotion so that I could have less clutter in my bathroom and just to make life easier, but this just wasn&#x27;t it. This lotion should be used on the body and not on the face. As a body lotion it is great, but I wish it were smoother( consistency is thick and can make it hard to apply). This is important for me because I am always on the go and I don&#x27;t have the time to sit and rub a thick lotion in. Because it is so thick I also have a hard time getting the product to come out of the bottle and have to knock the bottle around to get it out. I think if it came in a jar it would be easier to get the lotion out. Overall if you are buying this for your body then it is a good pick.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, keeps the skins nice &amp; moist.  Having dry skin, this is a real workhorse - Smells pretty good as well...I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;It does take much to apply to your face. I finally found a lotion for my skin. I use it daily</li>
            <li> The products mells great. and it provides good coverage for skin.  I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion at a local, upscale department several years ago only to discover they no longer carry it when I went looking to replenish my supplies of Nubian Heritage products. This lotion is not oily, but it is thick and it keeps the skin moisturized for hours. I like the soft, gentle aroma that&#x27;s a bit spicy, but not overly so. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like perfumes or spray on.</li>
            <li> I am huge fan of Nubian Heritage and their black soap. This purchase was initially for my sister as a Christmas gift. She told me it smelled great and it softened her skin. I tried a little also and I would definitely agree with her opinion on it! It smells fantastic and my skin felt so smooth after I put some on. I have eczema and it didn&#x27;t irritate it my skin once. Their products are well worth it and I definitely recommend anyone on this lotion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I love the way it smells and I always get the &amp;#34;you smell good&amp;#34; comment.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have  a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell, as in light and flowery, so if that is you, don&#x27;t get this. The smell is not heavy either. To me it is more woodsy, earthy.&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick so if you have any difficulties using your hands to squeeze hard, have someone else express it into a lidded jar, or softer plastic bottle. It is worth this effort.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. This company was started by individuals whose market audience, I believe, is African -American.&lt;br /&gt;As a Caucasian user of this product and their soaps, all I can say is when a product is great for your skin, it doesn&#x27;t matter the skin you are in! And these folks have it nailed.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion so much, it has great staying power, and is non-greasy. I usually mix it with a few drops of patchouli oil to give it the scent I love. I always get compliments, and asked what scent I am wearing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this raw shea butter lotion for over 3 years now and really like it. It doesn&#x27;t contain any parabens or other toxic ingredients, and the scent is extremely subtle (unlike the coconut lotion made by the same company). It absorbs quickly and moisturizes very nicely without leaving any residue.  If you&#x27;re looking for a great body lotion, I highly recommend this raw shea butter lotion from Nubian Heritage.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good lotion to keep my skin hydrated, since Jergens cannot seem to keep theirs on the store shelves, when I found this wonderful lotion on the Amazon marketplace.  It was delivered yesterday and I must say I am completely blown away by this product.  It is non-greasy, easily absorbed and it smells so good I cannot stop smelling my hands and my arms!!  Seriously!!!  You can feel the richness of this lotion and you don&#x27;t need a lot because a little goes a long way.  Even after washing my hands, the smell lingers.  When I went back to read the bottle again, I found that they use frankincense and myrrh as well as the shea butter....this combination produces the most wonderful aroma I have EVER experienced in a lotion.  The smell is NOT too strong or over-powering, it is soft and subtle and definitely pleasing to the nose.  I was so impressed with this lotion that I found other Nubian Heritage products for the hair and body wash.  I cannot wait to try them all and I expect to be a regular and faithful customer of this merchant for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think every woman should smell good all the time without aromas that are too strong and I endorse Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter Lotion as a necessity because it is absolutely THE best hydrating lotion I have ever tried in my young-looking, 60 year old life!  Trust me....you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Irritating to the skin.  Possibly tolerable on extremities, but not the face. I will not reorder this lotion. Its also too expensive.</li>
            <li> this lotion is so nice, a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;the scent is very nice and lasts for hours - I&#x27;ll put some on in the afternoon/evening, and the next morning, I can still smell it&lt;br /&gt;I really like the scent and use this as lotion and perfume, as I don&#x27;t like to wear perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will be buying more in the future -</li>
            <li> See my review of the Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter Body Wash--these two products go together.  I use this wonderful lotion right after showering with the body wash--a perfect combination for cleansing and softening the skin.  Most seniors seem to be plagued with dry feet and elbows, and I have not found anything more effective than this lotion.  The fragrance is pleasant but not sweet or overpowering, so that it is an excellent choice for both men and women.  When I was young, I thought it was so boring to give my grandparents body wash and lotion for birthdays and Christmas, but now I totally understand!  This is a luxury I couldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and it is the best lotion!  I live in a VERY dry climate and always have cracking skin on my hands.  I use this lotion all the time now and it has really helped, NO more cracks!  A couple of my other friends have been using it and it is working for them as well.  It is super thick but soaks in well.  It smells great (very mild).</li>
