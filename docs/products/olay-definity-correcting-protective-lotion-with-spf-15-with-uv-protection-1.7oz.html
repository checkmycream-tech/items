            <li>No shine, just beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>However, now I&#x27;m not so happy since my scars haven&#x27;t minimized.  </li>

            <li>For the most part, I&#x27;m happy with the products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been using this product for a year and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Probably , it just feels so good and makes my makeup go on smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin also has a more radiant and even tone.  </li>
            <li>The night cream in this line provides more moisturizing benefit.  </li>
            <li>I mostly wanted a sunscreen to use in the daytime.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and use it every morning after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clearer and more radiant.</li>
            <li>so I really love it.</li>
            <li>(especially, after I read many excellent reviews on the product)</li>
            <li>It does reduce fine lines a bit.</li>
            <li>I would not give it five as I see no diffence in fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>I was not surprised to find that this is a great product, I have purchased other olay products and they are wonderful for all skin types.</li>
            <li>I originally had a problem with the product flaking.  </li>
            <li>the sweet scent.</li>
            <li>i feel a real difference in the smoothness of my face.:)</li>
            <li>I was even surprised to see some acne-scars become more pronounced...</li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin, I have some black spots (acne scars, or sun spots) but as for pimples just every now and then.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t always been a fan of facial products, but age has a funny way of convincing people that there is no shame in taking care of your skin.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase and it isn&#x27;t finished as yet</li>
            <li>Even on the first day I tried it I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>My wrinkles didn&#x27;t magically disappear but they are getting smaller.</li>
            <li>also have tons of freckles on my face that I don&#x27;t really mind, but Olay Definity started fading them, and I certainly don&#x27;t mind that either!  </li>
            <li>I saw positive results almost immediately after I began using the Definity line.  </li>
            <li>I was so disapointed because i really wanted to like this product...</li>
            <li>i really did...</li>
            <li>so this really matters to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and sinks into my skin immediately leaving no residue and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like my pores are clogged.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s sitting on my dressing table almost brand new...</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it has SPF15 (not enough for constant sun exposure, but good for everyday use).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to this whole facial care scene, so maybe the flaking had something to do with regenerating skin?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just throwing some ideas out there because I really have no explanation why it just suddenly stopped.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks; Now it might be my imagination, but my face is starting to look much better----color, texture, dryness, lines, etc.  </li>
            <li>this lotion makes my skin feels so soft</li>
            <li>As far a improving wrinkles I would have to say I have seen no differnce.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because of the way it feels and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>This was right, I do not get the teary eyes that last all day from some of the other Olay products.</li>
            <li>My new regimen has definitely decreased the appearance of fine lines along my forehead and edges of eyes.  </li>
            <li>This may sound weird, but this is the first lotion that doesn&#x27;t make my face start sweating after putting it on.</li>
            <li>Touching my face made the problem worse.  </li>
            <li>As you age, you really do tend to develop dark patches that take away from that youthful look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other moisterizers on my oily/dry skin and all of them, including other Olay products, turn me shiny and greasy in a few hours.</li>
            <li>I normally use Olay facial products, but had not tried the Definity line due to the cost.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time with lotions on my face since most of them feel heavy to me.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using Olay Definity after they sent me a sample.  I have a hard time with lotions on my face since most of them feel heavy to me.  This is the best I&#x27;ve found!  It&#x27;s light and sinks into my skin immediately leaving no residue and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like my pores are clogged.  This may sound weird, but this is the first lotion that doesn&#x27;t make my face start sweating after putting it on. (If any other woman has this problem, you&#x27;ll know what I mean.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have tons of freckles on my face that I don&#x27;t really mind, but Olay Definity started fading them, and I certainly don&#x27;t mind that either!  I&#x27;ve now been using this product for a year and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I would not know, I never received this product. I was sent the wrong item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle-aged male who uses the Definity line.  I use the Definity Correcting lotion in addition to the illuminating eye cream, pore-reducing scrub, and night cream. I haven&#x27;t always been a fan of facial products, but age has a funny way of convincing people that there is no shame in taking care of your skin. For the most part, I&#x27;m happy with the products.  My new regimen has definitely decreased the appearance of fine lines along my forehead and edges of eyes.  My skin also has a more radiant and even tone.  I saw positive results almost immediately after I began using the Definity line.  It didn&#x27;t soften my skin immediately, but I can now feel and see a difference after a couple weeks.  My skin is brighter, softer, and pores are much less noticeable.  I originally had a problem with the product flaking.  A few hours after application, it would flake, creating tiny white specs all over my face, especially in whiskers and on the neck (due to all of the movement and contact with collar).  Touching my face made the problem worse.  Even when I tried using less of the product, it still occurred.  Oddly enough, the flaking problem seemed to just disappear after a week or so.  I&#x27;m new to this whole facial care scene, so maybe the flaking had something to do with regenerating skin?  I&#x27;m just throwing some ideas out there because I really have no explanation why it just suddenly stopped.</li>
            <li> The night cream in this line provides more moisturizing benefit.  I mostly wanted a sunscreen to use in the daytime.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of deep wrinkles so I don&#x27;t know how it would work with them. It does reduce fine lines a bit.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it every morning after washing my face.  It provides UV protection and non-greasy feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> The results were really amazing!  As you age, you really do tend to develop dark patches that take away from that youthful look.  I also had scarring from facial waxing as my skin is very sensitive and no matter how gentle I try to be, I always blister when I wax and that leaves horrible marks that lasts for months.  This is my first purchase and it isn&#x27;t finished as yet and I have already seen remarkable results.  My skin is clearer and more radiant. Its a definite boost to my self confidence.  I&#x27;m anxious to try the eye cream too!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome lotion.  I normally use Olay facial products, but had not tried the Definity line due to the cost.  So when I saw this sale price, I pulled the trigger!  I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks; Now it might be my imagination, but my face is starting to look much better----color, texture, dryness, lines, etc.  Well I&#x27;m hooked, so I&#x27;m buying another while it&#x27;s still on sale!!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a moisturizer with SPF that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. This one has been wonderful, smells wonderful, and is not heavy. It still hydrates well without being greasy so I really love it.</li>
            <li> Well since this was a product i was wanting to try, i bought it, Even thought it was a little overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;Well, nothing. I have pretty good skin, I have some black spots (acne scars, or sun spots) but as for pimples just every now and then. This did nothing for my skin. Just another moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t see my face illuminate, or glow, or anything. I was so disapointed because i really wanted to like this product...i really did...</li>
            <li> Even on the first day I tried it I noticed a difference. Within a few days my skin tone was brighter and luminous. LOOOVEEED the sweet scent. I was even surprised to see some acne-scars become more pronounced...so I figured the lotion to work layer by layer and pushing the acne out. However, now I&#x27;m not so happy since my scars haven&#x27;t minimized.  So in case you&#x27;re acne-prone I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this lotion makes my skin feels so soft and it is never greasy and just absorbs into skin immediately. best lotion i have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other moisterizers on my oily/dry skin and all of them, including other Olay products, turn me shiny and greasy in a few hours. Not Definity! I can definitely see a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s softer and it almost glows. And it&#x27;s looking younger! I&#x27;m 59 so this really matters to me. No shine, just beautiful skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> ...and I do think this is the best moisturizer I have used. This was recommended in a magazine (sorry I don&#x27;t remember which one)and it basically  one of those \\&quot;why spend hundreds when these products are just as good\\&quot; type of article.  Anyway, I bought it, as opposed to my $75/bottle of product and my skin looks fresher, less pigmented, and overall younger.  I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> i now use this lotion day &amp; night.  i feel a real difference in the smoothness of my face.:)</li>
            <li> I wanted a moisturizer with sunscreen that would also help age spots fade.  It&#x27;s non-greasy, and after a few days I could see the age spots lighten.</li>
            <li> After cleansing with a Clarisonic, I use this moisturizer every morning.  The combination has started to eliminate some of my age spots.  The spots are not gone, but my skin complexion is evening out and I&#x27;m not breaking out.  I also like the fact that it has SPF15 (not enough for constant sun exposure, but good for everyday use).</li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay Definity Correcting a month ago. I chose this one because I am senstive to the stronger ones and this was suppose to be less irritating. This was right, I do not get the teary eyes that last all day from some of the other Olay products. It goes on smooth..feels great and moisturizes well.As far a improving wrinkles I would have to say I have seen no differnce. I have noticed that my skin is softer.  Would I buy again? Probably , it just feels so good and makes my makeup go on smooth. It is expensive. I bought the 1.7 oz bottle and it is VERY small for what you spend.  I gave it four stars because of the way it feels and makes my skin soft. I would not give it five as I see no diffence in fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> I never had any trouble with cosmetics before so I didn&#x27;t expect Olay Definity UV Lotion to cause any...(especially, after I read many excellent reviews on the product) However, I noticed tiny pimples after applying some and my face felt itchy.  I wish I could give it away to someone who likes and uses w/o trouble since I only used a few drops and it&#x27;s sitting on my dressing table almost brand new...</li>
            <li> What can I say - it just workes like they promised to.  My wrinkles didn&#x27;t magically disappear but they are getting smaller.</li>
            <li> I was not surprised to find that this is a great product, I have purchased other olay products and they are wonderful for all skin types. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
