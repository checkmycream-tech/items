            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this - it is slimmer and cleaner looking than most toothbrushes and is perfectly sufficient for my needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and it works splendidly.  </li>
            <li>Thus, she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy, and I guess her dentist is happy.  </li>
            <li>I bought another one at Target and have been happy since.</li>
            <li>Plus with the mail in rebate going on, its a great buy.</li>

            <li>This is a great product.  </li>

            <li>I think this toothbrush is great.  </li>
            <li>What a great product now</li>
            <li>The dentist thinks it&#x27;s doing a great job on my teeth &amp; gums.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This brush cleans well and The compact size and footprint are great.  </li>
            <li>Great for traveling.</li>
            <li>Great brush.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a great toothbrush</li>
            <li>I decided to try this toothbrush and am happy with my outcome.</li>
            <li>great deal</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge for over a week which is great for travel.  </li>
            <li>I can sleep longer (while I stand at the sink, and let this rechargeable toothbrush do the work) - and this is a great thing, when you are up at 3 am for a feeding for your 10 month old.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I happily bought a replacement.</li>
            <li>Does a great job cleaning.</li>
            <li>This a great alternative to the bulkier, heavier electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>great toothbrush at a great price.</li>
            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>Am I happy I took her advice.  </li>
            <li>I was using Oral-B CrossAction before, and I was totally happy with that product.</li>
            <li>The Precision Tip for the Pulsonic, however, has been great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This was a great toothbrush until it stopped working,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The 2 minute dentist recommended time indicator is great.  </li>
            <li>, this is great.</li>
            <li>I have had it for 18 months and it is still working great.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>{ AT THAT PRICE IT WOULD OF MADE GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFTS }</li>
            <li>I used Braun electric shavers and they are really  great.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for a couple of years, had great check up results.</li>

            <li>Great value for the money.</li>

            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>i will be happy.</li>
            <li>This has been a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>the massage gum feature is just great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a great toothbrush if you are looking for the sonic type, I would choose this over any Sonicare lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Oral B Pulsonic is great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is great.</li>
            <li>for the rest it works great..</li>
            <li>Great product no cavities, holds up to my mouth and the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s held up great.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>so I put it into my carry-on happy that I will have a sonic brush to use while away for a month.</li>
            <li>, it is quieter, slimmer built, just a great sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>oh yes, and of course, with freakishly happy with my Oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Great product, does the job 100%.</li>
            <li>hoping to get great report from dentist..</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush and</li>
            <li>It provides great check ups every 6 months.</li>
            <li>serveral months, I swore off electric brushes until noticing this one for a great price since the Sonicare and Waterpik cost me $200 per at time of sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My dentist was happy</li>
            <li>you braces, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!   </li>
            <li>I also find the timer a very handy feature.</li>
            <li>and I must say it is very nice.  </li>
            <li>very nice.     </li>
            <li>I drink a lot of tea and the Pulsonic is very effective on removing stains.  </li>
            <li>It gets VERY WARM.  </li>
            <li>A very light pressure works best.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is amazing!</li>
            <li>Fairly minimalistic but works great.</li>
            <li>I bought another one and it looks great and does a good job cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>BTW, like the Sonicare, the Pulsonic can be used in the shower -- to quote the user manual -- \\&quot;without hesitation.\\&quot;  Nice!</li>
            <li>It works good great battery.</li>
            <li>Good good good!useful and beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is the best electric tooth brush; I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush handles great, reaches just fine wherever needed, and perfectly balances in hand.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would choose anything over my Sonicare, but this toothbrush by Oral B was a pleasant surprise</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I get headaches, but not at all a pleasant experience for me.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts about 3 weeks after a good charge.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Pricewise, the Oral-B Pulsonic is a good bang for the buck.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a good price.    </li>
            <li>To be fair I haven&#x27;t tried to see what happens if I just keep using it without recharging it</li>
            <li>This is a good product for the money.  </li>
            <li>She just loved hers and ordered me to buy one too.  </li>
            <li>but otherwise he feels the cleaning is superior to brushing.</li>
            <li>Battery lift is good too.  </li>
            <li>I have some periodontal issues so this is a good sign for me.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>I have used the interplak and braun Oral B for years, but the level of cleaning I got was never as good at the gumline as it is with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Oral-b products for years and knew they are a good product.  </li>
            <li>The product was good</li>
            <li>I decided to switch to this cheaper product, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to have this good of a quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect to get something that was this good.</li>
            <li>This was for a gift, and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>but it feels like it is doing a good job.</li>
            <li>My dentist says this is just as good of a brush as his</li>
            <li>It makes a good traveling companion for any road warrior.</li>
            <li>All in all, the price point for this power toothbrush is good.  </li>
            <li>it does a good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>Good brush, recommended.</li>
            <li>and I find it a good value.</li>
            <li>In the instructions for good electric toothbrushes they tell you to hold the unit on your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Purchase this product because it was inexpensive and because considered Pulsonic to be a good name.  </li>
            <li>This Oral-B is every bit as good, and the brush heads are quite a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>For the life of me, I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t make the rechargeable battery replaceable - A perfectly good toothbrush is being trashed because the battery died.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is good though.</li>
            <li>Good one.</li>
            <li>Arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>oh ya, it was a good deal as well.</li>
            <li>Have had for years and have always loved it.  </li>
            <li>but the Pulsonic is a good replacement, even though it&#x27;s not a rotary head brush.</li>
            <li>The 50% off program came at a good time for us too.</li>
            <li>all...not a good investment, would not recommend buying this item...</li>
            <li>Loved this product but stopped turning on after 1.5 years of owning.</li>
            <li>Ultimately a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush is good.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about $50 a year if you replace the brush every couple months or so...a good investment for oral hygiene in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for the money.  </li>
            <li>, loved using anything electronic.</li>
            <li>Good quality as you can expect from Oral-B company.</li>
            <li>Also, it seems to be doing a good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>Good vibration.</li>
            <li>Good item for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: if you can get this for a good price, go for it...</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>Good, effective toothbrush with a great price.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are incredibly clean, and the timer on it is great!  </li>
            <li>So all in all this is one very loyal Sonicare user (6 plus years) who is now sold on the Oral B Pulsonic!!</li>
            <li>I like the full brush head the best</li>
            <li>This is one of those perfect examples of technology making the world a much better place, as the ease of use, outstanding health and cosmetic benefits, and portability make the Pulsonic a toothbrush</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s slim, easy to use, and I have experienced none of the \\&quot;head loosening\\&quot; problems listed in some of the reviews.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is attractive and easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li>The Pulsonic is easy to use and does a great job of cleaning around the gum line.</li>
            <li>We bought this one for our kids and it works great and is slimmer, so it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that delivers what it promises-clean, stain free teeth.</li>
            <li>That is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>And Its made in CHINA, SO AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Nice for the price.</li>
            <li>Really handy.</li>
            <li>their own brush head(s)</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about.</li>
            <li>Must be people who work for or own stock in Sonicare.     </li>
            <li>By the way, the Oral B cleans teeth on par with Sonicare, in my own opinion.</li>
            <li>so it fits nicely in the hand and,</li>
            <li>I have never been good at a disciplined approach to brushing, I find this might encourage developing some better habits.</li>
            <li>I have never been good at a disciplined approach to brushing, I find this might encourage developing some better habits.</li>
            <li>I find that they do good at what they should do, cleaning teeth, as my son has done better during his routine dental exams.  </li>
            <li>The precision head is good for floss-like cleaning and it makes me glad to have the gentler setting on the unit.  </li>
            <li>and I liked that one.  </li>
            <li>design of this Oral-B Pulsonic is quite nice.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t comment on how effective it is in cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li>I liked the slim design and two speed options.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll just have to look at their sales numbers and figure it out on their own.    </li>
            <li>The best I could find at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I liked this toothbrush, although it broke after a year of use.</li>
            <li>my navy dentist said she liked it as well.</li>
            <li>So that is really nice to not have to keep the charger handy, can tuck it away until its needed.</li>
            <li>Nice feeling on gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>It is kind of like a dentist drill but</li>
            <li>When I got this brush, I was expecting a nice electric brush</li>
            <li>The timer function on the toothbrush is nice</li>
            <li>Braun&#x27;s own website has a form you MUST download to send the unit in for repair.  </li>
            <li>It does a nice job along the gumline.</li>
            <li>Nice and slim and compact.</li>
            <li>Lightweight Slim Handle Provides Effective Maneuverability and Control&lt;</li>
            <li>This form of tactile feedback is quite effective in keeping the user informed as to the status of their brushing session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Precision Tip brush head is handy for cleaning between teeth and around dental work</li>
            <li>- Easy to use and clean  - Perfect size for travel  - Precision Tip brush head is handy for cleaning between teeth and around dental work  </li>
            <li>nice whan one travels</li>
            <li>I should also mention I didn&#x27;t put any real effort into caring for it the best way.</li>
            <li>This is an okay brush but not as good as the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I paid twice the amount for my own in shanghai and couldn&#x27;t believe it when I saw this one here</li>
            <li>To me that suggests that the Pulsonic&#x27;s vibrations aren&#x27;t as effective as the Sonicare Flexcare.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;timer\\&quot; feature is great and is very useful.  </li>
            <li>I have had great electric toothbrushes that help me keep my lower teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Great product...makes your teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>dentist recommended i buy one, this one is great, makes my mouth fell dentist office clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it uses fairly easy to find replacement brushes at Walmart or Walgreens, I can keep it until it stops and get my best money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I am very happy they replaced my defective unit with an entirely new one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the most important thing is that it removed my dental calculus.&lt;br /&gt;i am really happy to see that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The toothbrushes do work great though, and despite our now degraded opinion of Amazon rebates etc, we are happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li>Sleek design, easy to use, good value at a budget price.</li>
            <li>I would say that overall, it&#x27;s a good to excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li>I love the Pulsonic so much that I would consider it to be a perfect gift for the person who has everything...</li>
            <li>My girlfriend and I both own this toothbrush and it is by far the best bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li>A super brush backed by dental associations and dentists who know teeth and a quality product to ensure great oral hygiene health..</li>
            <li>It seems to do a good job at cleaning and the head interchange easily.</li>
            <li>Very easy to charge.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use with one button.</li>
            <li>My wife has gum problems that demand very excellent care, thus the need for frequent dental cleaning, flossing, and brushing.</li>
            <li>The pulsing action is now considered to be the best way to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Used the Sonicare for many years and liked it, but the housing was stained and it was time to go bye</li>
            <li>but so far I have been very happy.      </li>
            <li>Lacks cover - many units do not offer a brush cover, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option</li>
            <li>I have not owned a professional sonic toothbrush before, and have to say I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, has a sleek design and really good value.  </li>
            <li>Great and powerful sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Gums can really benefit from a good massage, so anyone whose gums and teeth are in fairly good condition can help maintain and improve their dental health, rather than see the kind of decline that might otherwise occur with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with how easy to use and fast this brush is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this toothbrush works great, the price is right, but it does take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>easily~!  </li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s still going strong!  </li>
            <li>My dentist is happy and I am happy, at last.</li>
            <li>I have used many brands, and I liked this one the most even over my Sonic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, sturdy, attractive, and has great features like 2 speeds and a timer that lets you know when to move on to a different quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li>My teeth stay nice and clean throughout the day, and my wife seems really happy with her teeth staying clean.  </li>
            <li>at first it seems to work great</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good electric toothbrush that will keep your teeth healthy and clean, but don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money I would recommend the Pulsonic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a ¼ turn quick release, and this is great for cleaning and sanitizing, but it seems to pop off in the mouth rather easily.</li>
            <li>It is very fortunate that it comes with a 2 year warranty.  </li>
            <li>The two speed mode is nice and easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and compact, very easy to use, cleans better than a manual toothbrush, great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I liked it fine.  </li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to use, the head size and shape is great and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>The price makes this ultra sonic brush even better.  </li>
            <li>and all was ok.  </li>
            <li>I love the sleek skinny design.</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;ll give it a try.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I love its size....</li>
            <li>My dad likes the brush and ever since I gifted this to him he has started with his night time brush routine all over again...</li>
            <li>I will see how many months this keeps up....</li>
            <li>This sonic toothbrush is so much better for your teeth and gums than a regular electric toothbrush (which I always thought of as one of the best inventions).</li>
            <li>You will find that even your dentist and dental hygienist will be able to see the difference.</li>
            <li>But you won&#x27;t be able to find a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It will be more consumer preference on design that motivates the purchase.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much better than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>If you have 2 or more people in the house that want to share the toothbrush and have</li>
            <li>If you want a toothbrush that does a better job keeping your gums in top shape, then I&#x27;d recommend the Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the Pulsonic for maybe 6-7 weeks prior to the dentist visit and my gums are in the best shape they&#x27;ve been in in years.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the Pulsonic for maybe 6-7 weeks prior to the dentist visit and my gums are in the best shape they&#x27;ve been in in years.  </li>
            <li>In addition, most people with manual brushes spend about 20 seconds</li>
            <li>The Pulsonic isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; toothbrush, but it&#x27;s definitely not the best I&#x27;ve used, and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s priced appropriately for its function.  </li>
            <li>This is very convenient and a great way to ensure a thorough clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and it really does a great job.</li>
            <li>But this one performs much better in every aspect.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have mostly used manual toothbrushes probably for most of my 45 years.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush because I have been pleased with every Oral-B appliance I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>It is used just like a manual toothbrush, but it cleans teeth much better.  </li>
            <li>I really love the pic - my teeth never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself and then bought two more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>quality is OK.</li>
            <li>so that makes this one all the better.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>So your price is %25 more than you think.</li>
            <li>Too many days in the shower and humidity built up inside.  </li>
            <li>I compare it to using a pencil compared to a magic marker which resembles the others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>More aggressive than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t get misled by all the rave reviews, save your money and wait for better one to come out or go buy one</li>
            <li>Better portability</li>
            <li>and was quite pleased by the pulsing sensation and the way it made my teeth feel/</li>
            <li>If I had it to do over though, I would probably spend more money and buy the Sonicare again.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Sure, it vibrates and scrubs, but I don&#x27;t detect that sonic pulse implied by the name</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth, all the spaces and surfaces, better than any toothbrush I have ever had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this would message and vibrate (occuring in brush head) whatever off your teeth,   </li>
            <li>but, if your dental setup is many caps, what is that doing to that glue?  </li>
            <li>save your receipt or they may be able to check the serial</li>
            <li>, i love it, it is inexpensive and does the job.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what bar-code I was supposed to save or the Proof of Purchase.</li>
            <li>I did not want a bulky brush, but instead something more sleek and stylish.  </li>
            <li>I am thoroughly satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>After a week of using I was able to move up to the strongest setting as I&#x27;m O.C.D when it comes to keeping my teeth</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy again, I&#x27;m just no overly impressed when comparing it with something like a $20 Spinbrush/Vitality</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I would like to address the issue many are having with the head coming off during use.  </li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>It cleans a million times better and has even cleaned coffee stains off leaving my teeth whiter.  </li>
            <li>I love the timer that lets</li>
            <li>The brush on this is more like the manual toothbrush that I grew up with - not the spin type of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>working problem free!</li>
            <li>Try not to drool, OK?</li>
            <li>Fantastic toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I also purchased one for myself and have been completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d like to think of it as more of a 4.25 rating, are the cost of replacement heads, and the issue with one of the units coming apart and being unusable in a way I did not feel it should have.  </li>
            <li>If replacement heads were more in the $3 - $4 range, I see this as a better value.  </li>
            <li>However, you do get what you pay for, and if you are will to pay a bit more, better brushes are out there.</li>
            <li>i would consider to place more orders.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The Pulsonic cleans deeper and better than any manual or power brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Really pleased with this purchase, cheapest price I could find when compared to competitor retail stores.  </li>
            <li>this Oral-B Pulsonic will more than suffice.  </li>
            <li>50% coupon makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I thought it was okay, until I tried this one.</li>
            <li>-just make sure you charge it for 12 hours before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am incredibly pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush cleans my teeth better than any brush I have used before.  </li>
            <li>My teeth/gums have never felt better.  </li>
            <li>This is quite simply the best toothbrush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>What more can be said.</li>
            <li>I find I brush longer now and pay more attention to each area because I know I will be reminded when it is time to change areas.  </li>
            <li>I have used a smaller toothbrush for years and found this one to be a perfect size brush as well as</li>
            <li>I vowed not to give them any more of my business, if I could avoid it.     </li>
            <li>I eventually got used to it and was quite satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been flossing that regularly, but I got the best checkup ever!  </li>
            <li>The reasons being that it was better than the Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li>I started to brush the bottom teeth for two pulses, then start brushing the top teeth.</li>
            <li>No one touching my tooth brush</li>
            <li>The Pulsonic Sonic is better.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure how this toothbrush would perform.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush removes plaque more than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need spend more for traveling package because everything are compact already.</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for healthy gum/teeth treatment, I recommend Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li>You can pay more and get more (both features and power).  </li>
            <li>HOW MUCH BETTER THAN THAT</li>
            <li>It was $12 more than the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li>Very compact and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Bought this when there was a manufacturer rebate which made this an even better deal.</li>
            <li>We love this toothbrush</li>
            <li>Seems more sanitary to cover the bristles of a toothbrush that lives in the bathroom</li>
            <li>Also, the 5-dollar battery operated one would be better because of the design flaw that this one has.  </li>
            <li>Love this tooth brush the charge holds up for a week or so</li>
            <li>I have had no problems with the toothbrush and look forward to many years of use.</li>
            <li>Been using for about 4 weeks now, and love it.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>well and glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Very slim, and great for travellers - since it saves space.</li>
            <li>I love it and</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Makes dental checkups much more pleasurable.  </li>
            <li>I like this one better.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I upgraded to the triumph model, my dentist visits have been enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>I love this Oral B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>your head when brushing the top teeth.  </li>
            <li>The battery is replaceable, but I do not know where you would be able to purchase one.  </li>
            <li>The brushes detach easily if more than one person uses the motor section.  </li>
            <li>The overall feel, quality, and weight of the product is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Our family have been using this product for more than 6 months.</li>
            <li>Pulsonic replacement brushes are more affordable than most, which was one of the factors into my purchase decision.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the size of the brush handle and the charging unit.  </li>
            <li>However, I am sure not everyone has the time to go through their returns process, thus 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cavity free since! :)</li>
            <li>I saw this Pulsonic brush and had read some of the reviews but wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me, but I decided to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say ?</li>
            <li>I have been using this sonic toothbrush for 3 weeks now and I am extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>but I had to send most of that</li>
            <li>and I love the atachment for cleaning between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had electric toothbrushes before but this one seems to work on my gums better thus keeping gingivitis at bay.</li>
            <li>Also does a better job on whitening the teeth.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite affordable sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But I wanted something more compact.  </li>
            <li>This fits the bill and cleans teeth way better.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s particularly impressive since this thing is quite a bit smaller.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>An excellent product, especially for those of us with bridges.</li>
            <li>Also, outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li>In terms of this against a manual brush, I can say this seems to work much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically a ploy to make you have to buy more brush replacements than you otherwise would have to.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The top portion of the handle can be rinsed under running water, but it is not recommended to run water over the lower, controller portion of the handle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall we are quite pleased with the Pulsonic Power Toothbrush by Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>Most people have their toothbrushes in the bathroom, and I don&#x27;t think anyone would want their brush heads uncovered and fully exposed in that environment.  </li>
            <li>Most people have their toothbrushes in the bathroom, and I don&#x27;t think anyone would want their brush heads uncovered and fully exposed in that environment.  </li>
            <li>I love my buy.</li>
            <li>I love the Oral-B Pulsonic.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel and look better.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is OK, but the replacement heads....</li>
            <li>My son does a better job brushing now.</li>
            <li>Most electric toothbrushes are bulky and this is one isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t come off accidentally any more.</li>
            <li>I love this piece.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much better my trips to the dentist are after using this type of toothbrush for over 5 years.  </li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to find one by another company that fits this toothbrush (</li>
            <li>I am a coffee drinker and red wine drinker and while my oral hygiene is good, this toothbrush has made my smile GREAT!.</li>
            <li>these work better than brushing with a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied as I feel</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of that G.U.M didn&#x27;t respond to emails stating that faulty replacement tips are being sold on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for traveling as it is very compact.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to check if your brushes being recommended are correct.</li>
            <li>For patients who like to  have a brush with them during the day, this slim, light, professional quality brush is perfect.  </li>

            <li>I love the streamline shape.</li>
            <li>I have traveled all over the world with this and most trips</li>
            <li>We Love it</li>
            <li>We have a camper and wanted this item for our weekend trips love it</li>
            <li>Well this is the electric toothbrush I just wrote about when writing aout the replacement brushes four more words required</li>
            <li>if this matters but my dentist said i was doing the best i possibly could with a toothbrush</li>
            <li>think if you&#x27;re reading this you know that electronic toothbrushes are probably much better than manual toothbrushes</li>
            <li>I have used this brush for travel for many years</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I use my Sonicare at home when I want a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>even after the $20 rebate I was able to get.</li>
            <li>I had the most plaque/cavity problems.  </li>
            <li>Everything you would expect and more.</li>
            <li>I bought my Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush 2.5 years ago and was pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li>prefer the smaller handle brushes, so the size was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>you should be pleased.</li>
            <li>I love the two speeds and two minute timer.</li>
            <li>Outstanding purchase.  </li>
            <li>works well, came on time and in general I think it is a good product with a great easy way to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, that I decided to get one for mom, too!!!</li>
            <li>a very powerful and effective tooth cleaner in a compact package.  </li>
            <li>I was less than impressed with the performance of this one, though the slim-line design of the brush was very appealing.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel nice and clean and I look forward to brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>SO FAR IS GREAT AND THE PRICE CERTAINLY WAS GREAT.</li>
            <li>It wonderful to have a quiet, non-bulky electric brush that&#x27;s easy to travel</li>
            <li>and my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, and could easily tip over.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is very light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Thanks for bringing us this amazing product amazon!</li>
            <li>That said, the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great deal more efficient than the old \\&quot;analog\\&quot; toothbrushes most of us grew up with.  </li>
            <li>Oral B did a pretty good job of ripping off the Sonicare technology.  </li>
            <li>Does a pretty good job brushing.</li>
            <li>Pretty good electric toothbrush for the money.</li>
            <li>At first I loved it, my dental check-ups were improving drastically.</li>
            <li>This was my first electric toothbrush and it seemed to do a good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited ordering an electric toothbrush that&#x27;ll finally make my dentist proud :P, and get the job done!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty great deal when more powerful tooth-cleaning systems can cost more than $200.  </li>
            <li>The new Sonic works great.</li>
            <li>Slimmer sizer and lighter... cleans great and love the sensitive mode.</li>
            <li>I love the size/weight of this item - can easily be packed for travel.  </li>
            <li>It has one strong redeeming feature -- the precision tip</li>
            <li>-- the brush part twists off so easily that it came off twice while I was using it, and it vibrates your hand more than in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and its not bulky so easy to use and maneuver.  </li>
            <li>Unit is easy to clean,we love it.</li>
            <li>Compared to Sonicare&#x27;s top of the line, the Pulsonic is not as strong in terms of vibration and its not as well made.  </li>
            <li>it is the TIPS of the bristles that clean , so a LIGHT PRESSURE is the most effective  with EVERY brush.  </li>
            <li>best available rechargeable power toothbrush in the market in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li>great brush and very slim design but not too light in weight.  </li>
            <li>Majority of vine reviewers are restlessly putting the product rating at 5 stars where as non-vine reviewers sound more pragmatic and truthful about the product ?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently switched from the Sonicare Intelliclean and I&#x27;m impressed with both the size, the light weight as well as its cleaning performance.</li>
            <li>it has all the basic features required for a good powered brush &amp; its  rechargeable &amp; good for travel</li>
            <li>It was a good for my budget and had positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for me for many years.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush makes my teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li>This is very convenient and a great way to ensure a thorough clean.    </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush to mainly use as a travel toothbrush because of so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>The clean smooth feeling this leaves is amazing.</li>
            <li>Overall a great purchase experience and a very good product so far.  </li>
            <li>The [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] is a very powerful brush, although not a sonic brush, does an effective job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>and I have found the slower speed to be the most comfortable for myself.  </li>
            <li>I used my wife&#x27;s Triumph OralB which rotates and is MUCH more comfortable.</li>
            <li>especially love the 30 second timer feature, which allows me to daydream while brushing, yet still ensure that I&#x27;m brushing each quadrant of my mouth for a full 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>love the Pulsonic so much that I would consider it to be a perfect gift for the person who has everything... provided their teeth and gums are not already so sensitive that sonic toothbrushes would be out of the question.</li>
            <li>I may just keep my old faithful Sonicare, which may be homely but has worked great for about 7 years.</li>
            <li>This is certainly better than manual brushing however the better brushes by oral b like the triumph series are far superior.  </li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush so far.  </li>
            <li>The brush head has been safe and secure with no evidence that it could come off as some report.  </li>
            <li>The sensitive mode is great if you don&#x27;t want the feeling of a Jack hammer inside your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Great feel in my hand, lighter than my old sonicare from years ago</li>
            <li>has great work to make tooth clear and white,So I will buy it again .</li>
            <li>the sensitive setting is a great bonus.  </li>
            <li>To better clean the top portion of the toothbrush handle, you can easily remove the brush head attachment by turning the head counter-clockwise (about 1/4 turn) and lifting it off the handle.  </li>
            <li>These wear out faster than the free toothbrush the dentist give out and yet cost more than the &amp;#34;Super toothbrush 2000 with color changing flex bristles&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But boy do I absolutely LOVE the precise tip brush to get in between my braces.</li>
            <li>It never did a great cleaning like my old Sonicare did and during the time I owned it</li>
            <li>This is a good product for someone who wants the benefits of an electric brush but does not want to/cannot pay $150-$200</li>
            <li>you know how much time to spend on each quadrant of your mouth, it looks sleek, not bulky, good movement on the brush head.</li>
            <li>This was much cheaper and was from a good oral care company.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and slim handle is more comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li>Works great, just as good as the previous generation Oral-B Sonic Toothbrush, which died after approx.</li>
            <li>Nice and light and charges quickly between uses.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own right.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled to learn that he had purchased this in the States, I purchased it right away.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace brush head and put on gum tool, which is easy to use and really does a good job on gums.</li>
            <li>Easier to clean and very light and easy to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slim and easy to hold and the brush head is the right size, fits in my mouth nicely, and I like the way it cleans.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean and smooth after brushing    Cons:  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research and decided this brush would be best for me based on other reviews, the price, and the style.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it really is a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush, as it has a better to clean my teeth with its Pulsonic system.</li>
            <li>Love how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>The design of the brush makes it easy to reach everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Is it easy to use?</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Charger/dock is flimsy, your toothbrush can easily be bumped over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle and head is slender and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>After all...it is all about getting your teeth clean and maintaining a healthy mouth, which is what this toothbrush is doing for me.  </li>
            <li>Cleans up easily after use without having gaps/spaces to cause unsanitary build-up.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m traveling, the unit and charger are easy to bring along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to place order.  </li>
            <li>easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I love how clean my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li>The handle is slim so is easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li>I like the compact design and the fact that it&#x27;s easy to pack for a vacation.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and there were no issues with it.</li>
            <li>The biggest drawback is that the head unlocks too easily.  </li>
            <li>The head rotates on easily, and has a bit of a detent to keep it in position, but it rotates out of the supposedly locked position while brushing.  </li>
            <li>Great product fast shipping well worth the price</li>
            <li>Most importantly: it is  easy to clean...</li>
            <li>and I find the Pulsonic to be as powerful and easy to use, but in a much more elegant package.  </li>
            <li>While I agree with those who would like to have a travel case, this brush fits easily into a plastic sandwich bag.  </li>
            <li>Cleans up easily with just a rinse.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and I like</li>
            <li>They easily come on and off the toothbrush without falling off while your brushing.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it is easy to get all the toothpaste residue off the brush and handle</li>
            <li>easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I love it and it keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I recommend this Oral-B as a good choice, but I wish the timing feature was more clear.</li>
            <li>I like the compact diameter, easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s lightweight &amp; easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are still going strong.</li>
            <li>It pulses quite strongly to create a vibration effect that along with your hand movement cleans your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This thing has been going strong, the toothbrush, the batteries, and it keeps my teeth spotless.  </li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s is still going strong.</li>
            <li>we used phillips dual action brushes for years and loved them, The sonic brushes move faster and seem to penetrate the gaps between your teeth even better.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend the Perio-Aid No.2 or Perio-Aid</li>
            <li>When I used less pressue the brush head stayed on perfectly and my teeth are soooooo clean!</li>
            <li>but that is true of most electric brushes.</li>
            <li>Battary life is impressive too - good enough that I only take out charger once a week for an overnight charge.  </li>
            <li>I am no expert on this type of tooth brush, but I can tell you my impression of the first of this kind I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Electric brushing is supposed to be fun and easy!  </li>
            <li>And our last checkup at the dentist&#x27;s office confirmed that the brushing was very effective in keeping the teeth and gum healthy.</li>
            <li>It cleans as well as some of the higher end ones at a better price, and is the most portable unit I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>the Oral B Pulsonic worked fine for about 2 months....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously owned nothing but Crest and Oral-B Spin Brush electric tooth brushes which by the way worked wonderfully</li>
            <li>It worked just fine</li>
            <li>A toothbrush should be light, and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>I typically get the bottom of the Sonicare line and have been very happy with the results and ease of use.</li>
            <li>perfectly fine.    </li>
            <li>The head stays on, charges fine.</li>
            <li>It cleans well, and is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Arrived in super lightning time !  </li>
            <li>cleans all surfaces very well,  very quickly because of no need for my own maneuvering, which I was over doing.  </li>
            <li>Seems kind of odd since its size makes it a great travel power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Very light and powerful.  </li>
            <li>The best toothbrush I found so far, small, light, works great and</li>
            <li>Huge buyers remorse....</li>
            <li>Like a huge mosquito.  </li>
            <li>so it does not feel like a huge electric brush in your mouth and it pops in and out of the charging stand with ease.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush, the last one I had lasted about 2 years before the battery in it died.</li>
            <li>It does a fabulous job of cleaning my teeth, and it holds a charge for weeks and weeks.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for its light weight when traveling in Europe, also</li>
            <li>It would be nice if Amazon gave this much info (eg voltage specifications) but they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The body is thinner, easy to clean, does not accumulate gunk anymore and battery life has been doubled.</li>
            <li>Really bizarre.    </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s stuttering on its own</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the 30-second reminders, but the overall 2-minute timer is great.</li>
            <li>It is slim and light weight</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money, and much better than some of those over priced $200 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>, so it is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>It was comfortable to hold and use, and cleaned well.</li>
            <li>Since the Ultrasonex is no longer available</li>
            <li>And free shipping.  </li>
            <li>: I received a free sample to review but was not paid nor otherwise compensated for the review.</li>
            <li>It is also quite easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slim, light, and</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd purchase of this great toothbrush from OralB.  </li>
            <li>I had one of those cheap oral b toothbruses for like $12, but now I am seeing the light.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spinning kind really chewed up my gums.</li>
            <li>This one was quite comfortable to use, save for a bit of a tickle in my jaw from the vibrations.</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>two different speeds are great, and everything but the electric part of the stand is waterproof.</li>
            <li>I started having periodontal issues and my hygenist suggested I replace my cheap &#x27;spin brush&#x27; with this.  </li>
            <li>Your gum health is worth more than that.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a great value given its low price.</li>
            <li>Both of them had the UV light to sterilize the toothbrush head, and they cost around $100 for each system.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember what I paid for this, but it was really cheap.</li>
            <li>Do vine reviewers do this in fear of loosing the free products in their mail box or what ?</li>
            <li>So, after reading every review available, I purchased this one, the Oral-B Pulsonic Power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The brush is really comfortable for use and handle.</li>
            <li>The smaller brush is great for cleaning between teeth and along the gum lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the sonic 4100, the oral-b spinning head and the sonic advanced.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for a month now and enjoy using it a lot.  </li>
            <li>really enjoy the timer feature (pulses every 30 seconds to tell you to change regions)</li>
            <li>This Oral B not so, its fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i plug it into a working outlet and it doesn&#x27;t light up</li>
            <li>Was so happy that they still make them as I recently lost mine</li>
            <li>Not to mention the mail-in rebate that was available when I purchased - now expired but check the Oral-B website to see if there is anything</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li>The unit is slim, well designed, and light weight which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>it was quite a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much</li>
            <li>I got this as a lightning deal with a mail in rebate that made it so cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;Power button feels cheap</li>
            <li>It was a nicely designed and it cleaned very well</li>
            <li>It is also great that it can be left on the charger with no worries of overcharging.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold and is well balanced</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>I was told all Oral B heads would fit.</li>
            <li>We brought two and enjoy them</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>I like the size and the fit in my hand.</li>
            <li>She said I was doing a great job above the gum line</li>
            <li>plastic feels cheap</li>
            <li>and I figured if I&#x27;m going to buy another electric toothbrush, I&#x27;ll go for one that&#x27;s worth it and from a top brand.</li>
            <li>I had an Oral B Sonic Complete before which I loved  --</li>
            <li>It has a soft brush that does a good job on the lowest setting however</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li>I received this electronic toothbrush as a gift, and good timing because my old Sonicare wasn&#x27;t holding it&#x27;s charge</li>
            <li>I own the Sonic Complete and while the toothbrush functions okay, the issue is the battery.</li>
            <li>nice slim brush- replace my old Oral B electric toothbrush which I had for many years and never had any problems with it till now.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush to replace an old Oral-B electric toothbrush, which I loved.</li>
            <li>The bleeding from my gums has subsided, I feel a good massaging and thereby strengthening effect from the soft setting in the brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty good so far.</li>
            <li>so far, so good.</li>
            <li>The first one was for myself and I loved it so much that I bought more as gifts for my boyfriend and also for my super picky mother.</li>
            <li>My son has an easy gag reflex and this is the first brush that helps him brush more and longer.  </li>
            <li>this did a better job right off</li>
            <li>sure you get the right one.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it right out of the box</li>
            <li>My mother, who rarely likes or uses gifts that I have bought her, told me that her teeth feel so clean and healthy and that her teeth felt as smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple but very effective way to improve your oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very useful and beneficial to health.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and take apart, I store the brush head in the drawer to keep it clean from bathroom usage.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who likes a clean, healthy mouth!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and smooth and look shiny.</li>
            <li>Light is on toothbrush but no vibrating-the bottom charger is clean and the tooth brush should be connecting and charging.</li>
            <li>super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>small attachments fit perfect</li>
            <li>The charger is very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take much space.  </li>
            <li>It is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>It does a good job, but if you really want that &#x27;just came from the dentist&#x27; clean, then the Sonicare would be my recommendation, even at the higher price point.  </li>
            <li>The price is at the lower end of the sonic brush range (counterintuitive to a newly introduced, more compact design) and the replacement brush heads come in a three pack that makes them more affordable as well.  </li>
            <li>original review from 2010:&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>i got a full free replacement.</li>
            <li>All in all I am VERY pleased with the Pulsonic and look forward to years of using it since my old Oral B lasted forever...</li>
            <li>I have used electric toothbrush for many years, but this is the first sonic toothbrush I have used.</li>
            <li>It is seems to be made better and is higher quality.</li>
            <li>Precision Tip does a fabulous job of cleaning these areas in a way a full size brush head</li>
            <li>I used a Sonicare toothbrush for 2 years before switching to an Oral-B Triumph, so I&#x27;m familiar with these types of sonic toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although the brush head vibrates significantly and loosens plaque, I find I&#x27;m having to perform the laborious back-and-forth to the extent that I do with a manual brush.  </li>
            <li>This year I opted to try the Oral B Pulsonic and so far am VERY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li>Enclosed with their denial letter are copies of the original form and the invoice I sent.</li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush, however, I got it with a rebate to send in, and they refused my rebate money because they said I didn&#x27;t send in the original UPC.</li>
            <li>, I think this has improved my brushing habits significantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure something just popped</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t so sure as you brush in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>There may be better ones out there, but I bet it would be at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a few days I kind of enjoyed it and really liked that it had a timer that would make it pause after 30 seconds so that you knew when to switch areas in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There hasn&#x27;t been any significant difference.</li>
            <li>I feel like my smile is whiter already!</li>
            <li>This small handled rechargeable toothbrush is awesome.</li>
            <li>The original still works, however does not turn off.</li>
            <li>Worth my money!</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it.</li>
            <li>the first lasted almost 3 years and not a bad price at all!!</li>
            <li>The older model was good to go from the first use on ANY setting.</li>
            <li>It certainly could be better in the fit and finish department.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is gentle, easy to use, and my teeth feel as if I have just had a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li>It vibrates at a pretty high frequency which I wasn&#x27;t expect, but it seems to do a good job</li>
            <li>Both of these being used through the year keep my teeth clean as a whistle...</li>
            <li>how well the brush cleans and 2) how clean the brush stays.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>the recommended 2 minutes of brushing to feel really clean teeth.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush does not wrap around my teeth to fully clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t spin or scrub like an el cheapo Crest/Oral-B Spinbrush/Vitality dual clean does.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is clean, neat to use and to recharge.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel dentist clean every time.</li>
            <li>-B knows what&#x27;s they&#x27;re doing with their Sonic brushes, and, like the others, this one leaves your mouth clean and tingly.</li>
            <li>I was just at the Dentist and received a clean bill of health.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it doesn&#x27;t quite clean as well as the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>My teeth didn&#x27;t feel quite as clean</li>
            <li>I like the slim design, and it seems to clean the teeth well.</li>
            <li>No biggie though, it&#x27;s pretty easy to become acclimated to that system quickly!</li>
            <li>It has the regular vibration motion and the sensitive vibration motion that is perfect for people with sensitives teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Also it let you know the time that you need to clean each quadrant of your teeth and the minimun two minutes to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>It also gets your teeth really clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and my gums stimulated.</li>
            <li>When I am done my teeth feel so clean,</li>
            <li>It cleans well and leave my mouth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and it keeps my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Oh, it makes my teeth feel really clean, too.</li>
            <li>It appears to clean well, as my teeth feel clean, and look clean; but I can&#x27;t say that they appear whiter.  </li>
            <li>Makes your teeth feel SO clean.  </li>
            <li>Does not compare to a Sonicare, my teeth don&#x27;t feel clean at all.</li>
            <li>an my teeth felt so clean.</li>
            <li>The brush works well, but I do prefer to use my [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li>I have always after brushing with tooth paste then redo with just a clean brush.</li>
            <li>Says his mouth has never felt so clean and</li>
            <li>We also have the Diamond clean from Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>and it gets my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>You mouth feels so clean.  </li>
            <li>but my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they do with a rotary head electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>But if you looking for a quick cheap sonic toothbrush then this will get the job done.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the stronger setting much and feel more comfortable with the softer one.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth and gums clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even give me that clean glossy feel like the Crest spinbrush</li>
            <li>I have, though, and it doesn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean in three minutes as my Sonicare does in two.</li>
            <li>We switched from Oral-B&#x27;s high end spin brush to the sonic types, much better results and easy on the gums.  </li>
            <li>I think that I may have a defective brush after reading many of the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li>I liked the look of this toothbrush and it traveled well but was very upset that it just died right after the warranty ended.  </li>
            <li>I attribute much of my good gum health and white, tartar free teeth above the gum line to my good brushing habits</li>
            <li>The motor on it is strong and the vibrations kick just right.     </li>
            <li>The Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great product at a pretty good price, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is light small shape and very effective brushing and cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is nothing special.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job, holds a charge for a week, very light and small</li>
            <li>The older model fit better in the hand.  </li>
            <li>This my first time to use a electric tooth brush, my teeth have never felt so clean!</li>
            <li>It is slim and light, but you really feel like you got your teeth clean after two minutes with this baby!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt such an amazing clean from a toothbrush before!</li>
            <li>Powerful, slick and it would be perfect for travelling if the charger was AUTOVOLTAGE!  </li>
            <li>All the surfaces of the brush are smooth and easy to clean and to stress the point again, it looks very \\&quot;natural,\\&quot; and not at all clunky, sitting on my counter.     </li>
            <li>setup is nice too: the charger is a bit better than the prior ones and there is a flossing tip that is useful.</li>
            <li>I got it wanting to use it for travel for it&#x27;s size,which by the way it is perfect for but found that it would actually make a really nice everyday brush.    </li>
            <li>I also got a good deal through Amazon, for a total of just $33 after the rebate.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get that kind of effect with the Professional model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is much lighter and more toothbrush-like.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush as a replacement to my beloved Braun - after 10 years, it finally stopped holding a charge.  </li>
            <li>Much lighter and more compact than the competition.  </li>
            <li>will go back to Sonicare, which gave good service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Longer battery life would make me give it 5 stars, but a full 12 hr charge will give you couple days use.</li>
            <li>Timer makes you adequately brush and my teeth are still as clean as the day I went to the dentist (over a month now).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also relatively portable, so good for travel too, though you&#x27;ll need to bring the charger along for longer</li>
            <li>/&gt;Toothbrush size is good for my smaller mouth&lt;br /&gt;Price paid at retail store ($38)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured I would try to by a similar product since it was so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are three settings, they really do nothing more than change the strength of the vibration.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really grown to love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>BUT, my favorite feature is the gentle mode</li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>but, 2 different dentist both told me how good my mouth looked after I started using it.</li>
            <li>My Sonic Complete comes with two of one kind of head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do my toothbrushing very routinely twice a day, replace my toothbrush every 3 months and thought there is nothing better than my old-fashioned toothbrush and me to fight cavity.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much lighter and more compact than the rotating head electrics from oral-b.  </li>
            <li>i cant recommend it more highly!</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t do such a good job, this would have been the deal breaker, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>This one comes at you full speed from day one - all guns blazing.</li>
            <li>It really cleans much much much better than the Orbal-b.  </li>
            <li>It took me a week to get used to that, but after a week, I can only say good about this product.  </li>
            <li>the sonicare is a much better product and gets my teeth much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I had the Oral-B Sonic Complete model and liked it, but after 4 years the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge any longer</li>
            <li>By changing the way I brush my teeth (not as much pressure and allowing the brush to do most of the work), it began to meet my performance expectations.</li>
            <li>I love the look and feel of the toothbrush works really well</li>
            <li>There is a lot of vibration in the handle but overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li>very good,I love it .It</li>
            <li>* Provides Gentle Sonic Vibration - More than 27,000 Vibrations per Minute&lt;br</li>
            <li>After putting it through a full charge, I was eager to try it out.</li>
            <li>really get the job done, Love it</li>
            <li>, more compact and shape is much easier to use.</li>
            <li>Then again recently for good.</li>
            <li>any more after 6 straight years of loyal cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most Oral-B electric brushes that oscillate at super fast rates to the point where the brush heads look like they&#x27;re spinning, the Oral-B Pulsonic&#x27;s motions are more akin to Sonicare brushes which vibrate at super fast rates.</li>
            <li>This can easily be seen from the packaging before you even take the product home (the packaging by the way was uncluttered, easy to open and very visually appealing).  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.. the price was better than I expected!</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately when I used it that it seemed to get my teeth cleaner than the sonicare as evidenced by little bits of grime the sonicare had never been able to get, this thing grasped with ease and afterwards my teeth felt a good deal cleaner as well.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, and I highly recommend the Oral-B toothbrushes in general.  </li>
            <li>It does a great joband I can honestly say with the sonic care I could feel light tartar after brushing, so i would use a regular toothbrush every other brushing.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;It is well worth the money and even my dentist has commented on how clean my teeth and gums are.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It will make your teeth feel fresh and clean as never before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although not as powerful, I felt it easily clean just as well.  </li>
            <li>seems so quick</li>
            <li>Oral-B has come up with a worthy challenger to the Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and models, and have always found that Oral-B makes the best.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased this toothbrush to replace a older Sonicare, and I like it much better for me.</li>
            <li>is size that&#x27;s a lot more manageable than most of its competitors and a price that&#x27;s similarly slim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only used it once, but it is nice to know it is available if I need it.  </li>
            <li>Came in 1 day even with the super saver shipping.</li>
            <li>so you know what an adequate brushing time is.</li>
            <li>Well, after using this thing for two weeks, I caved and went back to the sonicare and love it so much better.  </li>
            <li>We had the older Oral B model but love the pulsonic.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly since I needed it for a trip.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are so much cleaner and whiter; I actually look forward to going to the dentist to get a great check up.</li>
            <li>Mild disinfecting cleansers can be applied to the handle portion without damage, but over time the printed text/logos will fade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no dentist, ,so maybe the Sonicare is overkill and the Pulsonic is adequate.</li>
            <li>Replaces older Sonic model which died after many years.</li>
            <li>the interchangeable heads, for brushing between the teeth &amp; gum line are quick to change.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating action is more than my old one, but love it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive it and tried it right way.</li>
            <li>Light weight, easy to handle, large toothbrush head, Extra precision head, good battery life, and large brush</li>
            <li>Well, on this trip the dentist said my teeth were immaculate and my gums and pockets were all within normal, healthy scoring ranges on the scale they use to rate gum disease progression.  </li>
            <li>I find normal is probably better to use, it tickles quite a</li>
            <li>I tried it, I use it twice a day, &amp; I like it very much!</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it meant that it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I especially like the way it &amp;#34;massages&amp;#34; my gums, which is very healthy for them.  </li>
            <li>First, I like that it is slim and light.</li>
            <li>Oral-B has a good feel to it, natural and well-balanced, and that makes me more likely to pick it up instead of a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; brush.</li>
            <li>works great, small, fits the hand great, easy to use, and does not retain water or toothpaste in hidden crevices like the sonicare or oralb 3d heads do.</li>
            <li>It is a much better clean than the old oral-B brushes we had that ran on AA batteries.  </li>
            <li>The BEST feature of this brush is how small/compact and lightweight it is, and that it gives an amazingly strong pulsonic action despite its small size.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you want a good, deep clean, buy the Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide.</li>
            <li>(theoretically this IS better for the battery, since a full cycle is consistently established so the battery will keep capacity better and work</li>
            <li>The ultrasonic tooth brushes are excellent for dental hygiene even if you do not floss, I have used a similar probdut from Oral-B for over 5 years and when used twice a day it has done a better job than having my teeth cleaned by a professional every 6 months especially since there is no damage to the enamel with this type of brush.</li>
            <li>, I do prefer toothpastes with baking soda and/or hydrogen peroxide &amp; love some of the new Arm &amp; Hammer.  </li>
            <li>Pros-  cleans great  light weight  small size  </li>
            <li>and it takes up less space and looks great.  </li>
            <li>amazon has it for such a good price, too, that it is real value for your dollar!  </li>
            <li>It came very well packaged and my first use of it I fell in love.</li>
            <li>I have had periodontal disease for many years along with very sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time to use an electric toothbrush and let me just say I was blown away with the results!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most powerful brush I&#x27;ve used (as compared to higher priced models), but still works very well.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t send the original UPC in after they refused me because I KNOW I sent it the first time.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money because you cant buy a new set of teeth (Not for the price of this toothbrush anyway:))</li>
            <li>My boyfriend ordered the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush reasonably priced $40.00 including the rebate and free super saver shipping.</li>
            <li>It is light, easy to handle and, for an electric toothbrush, not too loud.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush because it&#x27;s slim, quiet, has a timer, uses sonic technology, and is easy on the pocketbook.  </li>
            <li>And with it the special price I got (and $15 rebate) it has really made my buying experience all the worth while!    </li>
            <li>The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars.ually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>this is a great little toothbrush… its lightweight &amp; powerful… and was a steal when i bought it as a lightening deal.</li>
            <li>It does a very good job in reaching the back part of the upper and lower teeth.</li>
            <li>Hard to find, I know I favored this one over a lot of others I&#x27;ve tried, bristles are soft but effective</li>
            <li>My Dentist will approve of the condition of my teeth thanks to this fabulous toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Very slim and light.</li>
            <li>It just feels like the motor does not run quite as fast or as smoothly</li>
            <li>On its own, I actually think this sonic toothbrush is better than my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It is light and very streamline and feels comforatble to use.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they made a softer brush head as it is a lot stiffer then the soft ones that were available for the old one.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;ve been happy with my Sonicare Flexcare for a few years, I couldn&#x27;t wait to add this to my ever-growing cache.</li>
            <li>Worth every every dollar.    </li>
            <li>This may actually be a good thing since you&#x27;re supposed to only apply it gently.  </li>
            <li>But where the Pulsonic wins is with my gums.  </li>
            <li>Also, the charger uses some non-contact inductor which is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>sonic vibrates, almost as powerfully as my cell phone, that&#x27;s all it does.  </li>
            <li>What  I did not like is that the Oral B didn&#x27;t shut off automatically after 2 minutes like the Sonicare, plus the shutoff button accumulates toothpaste runoff in the process, which can be kind off gross to turn off.  </li>
            <li>This one just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I turn it off to do my front teeth, it seems to strong/powerful/rough on more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it and</li>
            <li>I honestly feel for my smaller mouth</li>
            <li>I did own a Philips Sonic Tooth Brush about 8 years ago, but it only lasted two years before it broke.    </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it two stars is because I liked the form, and feel of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But if it works, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>It was worth the buy.</li>
            <li>That means this unit can safely go in the trash at the end of its lifespan, while the NiCad battery in the Sonic Complete would have to be separated and discarded</li>
            <li>Far better price than any that come close in power and efficiency.</li>
            <li>Another thing worth to note is the brush design.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to buy to everyone who is looking for such kind of product.</li>
            <li>I was searching for an affordable electric toothbrush that was slim but powerful:  </li>
            <li>The timer-mechanism is pretty cool (every 30 secs) and lets you know when to switch quadrants of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Hardly worth mentioning, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This Oral B Pulsonic is such a nice alternative.</li>
            <li>the battery is powerful too, as each charge lasts 15-18 days.  </li>
            <li>it has the normal brush head and a small pointed gum-line brush attachment that is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Works like a charm, and makes the Pulsonic worth</li>
            <li>The UV cleaner on the Sonicare was something I rarely used, so I don&#x27;t miss it when I made the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t worth the $40 that I paid for it.</li>
            <li>toothbrush is well worth the price for this feature alone.  </li>
            <li>The waiting time, spending my energy&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Is it worth $50?</li>
            <li>i guess there&#x27;s the fun factor of holding the vibrating toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The Triumph is better by far.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact overall size, fits well in my travel / shaving kit, plus the Pulsonic tooth brush holds enough charge that I can use it for a week without recharge when I am on the road - no need to have the charger with me which is nice ..</li>
            <li>Powerful -</li>
            <li>This unit seems to be fairly powerful.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>so can be still used effectively if  it runs low on power.</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush, no issues so far.</li>
            <li>From my research though, all of the more professional sonic brushes seem to have this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quite powerful for the size.</li>
            <li>I question whether the costs difference would be worth it.</li>
            <li>It has a couple of settings for brushing or massaging and although I prefer the brushing setting for regular brushing, the massaging setting felt nice on my gums.  </li>
            <li>The 30 second timer to move to another quadrant to brush is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by my dentist, and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with it so far.  </li>
            <li>Received my Pulsonic about a week ago, and so far I&#x27;m pleased with the performance, looks, and size.    </li>
            <li>I have used an electric toothbrush for many years, and so was not expecting to need the sensitive mode.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush is worth buying another.</li>
            <li>Whiter smile and my mouth always feels fresher.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Your teeth should be worth $40 to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish Oral-B would sell these on their own instead of having to buy a pack with one and 3 regular brush heads.</li>
            <li>the money, I would strongly suggest anyone considering this brush to spend a little more and upgrade to the [[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]] or the [[ASIN:B000U08ZN4 Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide]], which are much better brushes and do a more efficient job of cleaning.s say, but prefer to just hold the brush in my mouth and let it do all of the work.  </li>
            <li>For the money, I would strongly suggest anyone considering this brush to spend a little more and upgrade to the [[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]] or the [[ASIN:B000U08ZN4 Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide]], which are much better brushes and do a more efficient job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>I believe these Pulsonic electric toothbrushes are far more superior for cleaning teeth, then the other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>All the other reviews talk about what a good job it does cleaning and that is true, but I&#x27;d just like to mention that the first one I bought lasted for 3 1/2 years 2 of those years having two users.</li>
            <li>However, everything about the setup, use, and cleanup of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is very simple and straightforward, so I doubt one would need to refer to the instruction manual more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, everything about the setup, use, and cleanup of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is very simple and straightforward, so I doubt one would need to refer to the instruction manual more than once.    </li>
            <li>Evidently this item is made to quickly remove the toothbrush and install the flossing head.  </li>
            <li>I guess it does clean my teeth better than the basic models.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to charge it up and take it on a long weekend and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t rotate or do anything to clean my teeth any better than a regular manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>my mouth feels so much more clean than it did when I used a regular brush.</li>
            <li>Therefore, if you push the button once, and use the standard clean mode, you will need to push the button twice more in order to power the device off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It vibrates right on your hand and makes your hand tremble</li>
            <li>the price was right also.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box, whith the low-battery indicator blinking, I was amazed.  </li>
            <li>, right?    </li>
            <li>Toothpaste on and the brushing is done for you at the right speed and pressure.  </li>
            <li>So why the two stars for a five star product?Just try and get the right replacement heads-irritating.</li>
            <li>We really do like how they clean the teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>, I feel like it really gets the cracks of my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>does exactly what i wanted, love the action of the unit, teeth are whiter than ever and look forward to continued use</li>
            <li>nice modern look without the typical bulkiness of most power brushes.    </li>
            <li>It does clean very well.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works really well to clean teeth like a dentist.  </li>
            <li>and it really gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>The first time was a year ago, then it came back to life on its own somehow.</li>
            <li>On full charge last more than 15 days, brushing twice a day.  </li>
            <li>The directions provided in the package instruct that the brush be moved across the teeth in circular movements, as if brushing with a manual toothbrush, which seems very natural and easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The timer makes it very easy to get the proper amount of brushing on all teeth.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a breakthrough in power toothbrush design and it is very easy and convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely a breakthrough in power toothbrush design and it is very easy and convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>Not having the opportunity to compare it to similar products I still am very enthusiastic about its light weight, its effectiveness in cleaning - got rid of coffee-drinking related discoloration of my teeth, and its positive effect on my gums.</li>
            <li>When I powered it on, my first first thought was \\&quot;Oh, no!</li>
            <li>It is certainly a lot better than my old manual toothbrush though!</li>
            <li>The handle is slim and light and as easy to hold as a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I actually like closer to 35,000 VPM for a real clean.  </li>
            <li>The small size of the brush is also great for travel.</li>
            <li>In addition, it runs SO long on a battery charge, it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a couple of months, probably more than I should, and the brush head has barely worn out at all.</li>
            <li>its nice to know how long you&#x27;ve been working on a section of teeth</li>
            <li>The first one I bought almost a year ago and still works great, although the battery seems to need more frequent charging lately.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok, although the on-off button is kind of hard to press.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Though studies indicate that brushing with an electric toothbrush is usually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B included a travel case for my Triumph power toothbrush, which is huge compared to this new Pulsonic model.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B included a travel case for my Triumph power toothbrush, which is huge compared to this new Pulsonic model.  </li>
            <li>Previous to the Oral-B Pulsonic I had been using the Sonic Care which I loved.</li>
            <li>The operation is quiet and gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li>bought it while mail-in rebate is still available, so actual out of pocket cost was around $25, and will be getting it shipped free via 2 day from Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>I see this as the company does not charge much for the basic unit, but makes their money off of replacement brush heads, kind of like Hewlett Packard makes their money at selling ink cartridges, while practically giving away printers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been to a dental appointment yet to see if its cleaning effectiveness is as good as my previous toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Pulsonic is easy to set-up and use, but felt underpowered compared to the Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li>Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]] makes more sense as an all-around power toothbrush, and it comes with two brushheads and a travel-case.  </li>
            <li>Size - Great for travel and resembles the smaller, slender size of a standard toothbrush.      </li>
            <li>Regular Diamond round toothpicks work best for me.</li>
            <li>Not a huge deal, but a case would have been nice since the main reason that I chose this toothbrush over others was that it is better suited for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean and I love the little precision tip it comes with.</li>
            <li>The brush head is the perfect size for my mouth, not as large as the standard size oral-b cross action brush.</li>
            <li>My previous toothbrush was a first generation Sonicare, which was a good brush in</li>
            <li>DiamonClean certainly doesn&#x27;t clean 3x-4x as much as its price would suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pulsonic is a surprisingly very light and skinny rechargeable toothbrush that has similar dimensions to a $3 manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>pros of this brush are that it&#x27;s very quiet, slim, and very light.  </li>
            <li>The pros of this brush are that it&#x27;s very quiet, slim, and very light.  </li>
            <li>Big upgrade over Sonicare in one very important area - cleanliness.  </li>
            <li>Came very fast.  </li>
            <li>(almost like it&#x27;s turning off and on very fast)</li>
            <li>I very much recommend this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>Good little toothbrush for the buck.  </li>
            <li>She said it did not feel nearly as powerful, nor did it clean nearly as well.    </li>
            <li>I was using an older Ultrasonex toothbrush that I really liked but left it in a hotel while traveling.</li>
            <li>Cleaning results are far better than the older Vitality Oral B brush.</li>
            <li>A good sonic toothbrush can go a long way to keeping teeth white, clean and can reduce the number of trips to the dentist, but I don&#x27;t think this one is the answer.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare was huge and cumbersome for me to use.</li>
            <li>Brushhead did seem to come off at 1st, but not now (I must have changed to a more proper position).</li>
            <li>Her first pulse type brush was the one advertized on television by Sonicare, which she had for 5 years.</li>
            <li>Like many others who comment on the size, the smaller size definately makes the difference for her.</li>
            <li>But my first check up after getting</li>
            <li>I personally use another Oral-B toothbrush, but she travels a lot, and this worked better for her.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a month since first use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not obsessed with brushing, but am meticulous.</li>
            <li>Like most Oral B brushes, the Pulsonic has a setting where you can spend two minutes brushing your teeth, and it will alert you every 30 seconds to move onto the next part of your mouth.</li>
            <li>Like most Oral B brushes, the Pulsonic has a setting where you can spend two minutes brushing your teeth, and it will alert you every 30 seconds to move onto the next part of your mouth.</li>
            <li>I do take more time brushing and you can not only see but feel the results.</li>
            <li>It is more like the size of a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sooo much nicer!  </li>
            <li>first electric was a Sonicare, which I purchased when it first came out.</li>
            <li>When you brush with it, the pressure applied to the toothbrush is far far more powerful than the oscilation that takes place at the brush head.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B Pulsonic was my first venture into the higher end toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Let me first say I am not big on reading directions on most products before I try them out.  </li>
            <li>Holds enough charge to be safe for a week of travel, twice a day brushing.</li>
            <li>After using another Oral B Sonic toothbrush for years - and being totally satisfied - it finally gave up.  </li>
            <li>A low speed spin brush worked ok and did not tickle the gums, but did not remove the plaque as well as needed.  </li>
            <li>Brushing with this seemed as if I was at the dentist&#x27;s office at first.  </li>
            <li>The first one died about a year in.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s exactly what it sounds like.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is much more like a regular toothbrush, you do the scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>And at 32 years old, still cavity free.  </li>
            <li>I love using this thing and my mouth definitely feels cleaner after.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of getting used to at first because of the sonic power, but after awhile you won&#x27;t even notice.  </li>
            <li>Also love the 2 minute timer and 30 second interval stops.</li>
            <li>Before you shop Target check out Amazon first.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love that this toothbrush feels like a jackhammer in my mouth, but I am now used to it after several months of use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the fact that I am now aware that one must replace these units every three to five years as that is the expectency of the battery life.  </li>
            <li>During my last dental visit, the hygenist commented on how shiny my teeth were more than once</li>
            <li>Try not to drool, OK?the second rubber-tipped head for working the gumline, something my dentist always complains I could use some more of.    </li>
            <li>The Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles of some higher end products in this category.</li>
            <li>Love how it alerts you to move to the next zone of you mouth.</li>
            <li>First one I owned lasted 5 years...</li>
            <li>so I feel the need to rinse it well with hot water before I can use it.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I was able to get for $50 and got a rebate of $15 to bring the total to $35.</li>
            <li>I love this brush for several reasons, but the first is its slim, light-weight design and easy-to-use convenience. .</li>
            <li>HaHa!</li>
            <li>so several more days waiting for Amazon delivery</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things you notice is the lightness of the pulsonic.</li>
            <li>It was bigger, and had more bristles.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Better than my last Oral-B Sonic</li>
            <li>is the soft brush head available?</li>
            <li>Funny, that first one took some getting used to because it seemed to vibrate to the point of feeling like you were being tickled.</li>
            <li>and he paid double what I paid. :-)</li>
            <li>Hot electronics bother me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush head looked more like a traditional manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My first elctric toothbrush was a Sonicare Advance, which lasted almost 7 years.  </li>
            <li>Two bonuses that I am in love with (as compared to the Sonicare) are the smaller two bristled brush</li>
            <li>It does a better job of hitting hard-to-reach areas than I do in the morning (!)</li>
            <li>Back and forth brushing more closely simulates non-electric brush.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time</li>
            <li>So I ordered an exact replacement from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It really does make a difference!</li>
            <li>Never fails that I spend $20.00 on a pack of replacement brushes and the thing stops working</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money to get the better model.  </li>
            <li>The first one was purchased a year ago and it just stopped working.</li>
            <li>I would give the product 5 stars if I knew it would last more than a year.</li>
            <li>much more dynamic.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, I could almost feel it break up any buildup on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I like the toothbrush OK, but just wish the brush heads were larger.  </li>
            <li>The design is ergonomic, can reach inner most molars with ease.</li>
            <li>I love the 30 second increment timer.</li>
            <li>As long as you take your time to brush  and utilize the recommended brushing technique (round, circular motion), you&#x27;re going to find this product does a superb job.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the pretty girl fool ya...</li>
            <li>and I am not sorry.</li>
            <li>The brush works with many different toothpastes which is another plus.</li>
            <li>For many months I have been evaluating various sonic toothbrushes online.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Its size is marginally bigger than a standard toothbrush and makes it the perfect traveling companion given it lasts a week of solid use (two times a day).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through so many different brands of toothbrushes in my 32 years, esp.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>/&gt;could have been 5 stars if it had more toothbrushes included instead of only one!&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li>To reinstall the top portion, you sit it on the bottom portion and slide it back until you feel it click into place.  </li>
            <li>The included instruction manual goes over these steps in better detail, providing visual illustrations.  </li>
            <li>First of all, they need to provide covered storage for the spare brushes.  </li>

            <li>The included instruction manual goes over these steps in better detail, providing visual illustrations.  </li>
            <li>Overall we are quite pleased with the Pulsonic Power Toothbrush by Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>First of all, they need to provide covered storage for the spare brushes.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>The thing I love about this brush the most is that it looks like a regular toothbrush and feels like a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am able to go almost a week until I need to set it back in the charger.</li>
            <li>Gum problems were, in fact, the impetus for me to get an electric tooth brush in the first place, at the recommendation of my dentist who, of course, tried to sell me another one before I scouted around for one myself.</li>
            <li>first one i&#x27;ve ever owned, would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s only gotten better since I invested in this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Many years later is still working like the 1st day.</li>
            <li>Cleans your teeth fast!</li>
            <li>I expect the brush does as good a job on my teeth as advertised,  but I am having trouble making the transition to it.  </li>
            <li>This particular model, although smaller and lighter, does not seem to clean my teeth as good as the 2 aforementioned brushes.  </li>
            <li>It is an awesome toothbrush - once I started using this product a few years back there is no other toothbrush that makes my teeth and mouth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Yet, this new Oral B vibrates much more, but completely lacks this sensation.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used an ultrasonic toothbrush, it will take a little getting used to because it feels different, but don&#x27;t give up because they clean great.  </li>
            <li>The whole brush is completely water proof and can be washed easily.  </li>
            <li>Electric toothbrushes have existed for more than 100 years, and they have become extremely innovative in the last ten, so surely this toothbrush would be a significant improvement over previous versions, well, yes and no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does it have the smart guide and cute smiley face that smiles at you when you&#x27;re done, but it just does an overall better job of cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This actually worked fine at first but its so powerful that it started to take the enamel off of my teeth</li>
            <li>It is definitely a better design than my old Sonicare, which developed mold in the handle!</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommended.truct that the brush be moved across the teeth in circular movements, as if brushing with a manual toothbrush, which seems very natural and easy to do.     </li>
            <li>It functions nicely and cleans my teeth extremely well.</li>
            <li>Since the brush now only vibrate, I need to put in more motion than before, but once again I got used to it pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>The battery life of the Pulsonic is long enough that I can leave it out of the charger for more than a week and still be able to brush twice a day.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing the other kind of Oral B.</li>
            <li>soft and powerful!</li>
            <li>As others have stated, the toothbrush has two settings - clean and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>There is only one button on the brush, push once to turn on strong cleaning, once more for a gentler setting and a third time to turn off.  </li>
            <li>The wave-like pattern in the regular brush-head enables the vibrating bristles to easily access hard-to-reach spots between teeth and at the gum-line, and a second Precision Tip brush head that has toothbrush bristles aligned into a point shape allows even better access between teeth.</li>
            <li>Easier to clean by far.</li>
            <li>Push once for clean or twice for sensitive.    </li>
            <li>If you use this brush without any power whatsoever it will still clean like a manual toothbrush, just without the sonic action.</li>
            <li>I like it even better now that I&#x27;ve found these replacement brushes - \\&quot;Ultra Soft Sensitive Brush</li>
            <li>The Sonic Spin Brush worked okay, and probably if I had never owned a real Sonic Toothbrush, I would have kept it, but it was not the same.  </li>
            <li>Totally bummed -- I loved my earlier toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I replaced my oral b sonic complete (which I really enjoyed using) with this one as the sonic complete is not being made any longer and</li>
            <li>The sensitive mode is a bit more vigorous than people may be expecting who&#x27;ve been using sensitive bristled brushes for years, as I have...</li>
            <li>He says that it gives his mouth a much cleaner feeling and enjoys it more than his regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I was really irritated with the fact that I could only charge it with 110vAC, not a travel toothbrush (most countries don&#x27;t use 110v).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need all the different modes nor fancy lighting of the DiamondClean, I end up using really just one mode most of the time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple ingenious design for holding a toothpick, which allows you to gently rub every edge of your gums.</li>
            <li>I recently went in to see my peridontist for a deep cleaning and she couldn&#x27;t believe how good my gums look because I did have a lot of build up of tartar below the gum line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one positive thing is the toothbrush&#x27;s compactness.</li>
            <li>So after reading some positive reviews here on Amazon, I went ahead and ordered one.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not much bigger than a regular toothbrush, unlike most powered brushes which are huge by comparison.</li>
            <li>Recently purchased a third Pulsonic for my 10 year old and he&#x27;s happy with it too.</li>
            <li>It is too early to evaluate the long-term benefits promised by this product, but I find it a very simple and practical design, easy to store, clean and use.</li>
            <li>The two settings are great, especially since I have titanium implanted teeth, so I use the sensitive setting on part of my mouth and the regular setting on the rest.  </li>
            <li>It is so light and slim, and I love the smaller brush attachment for the back teeth and in between teeth.</li>
            <li>and my whole mouth feels pretty invigorated after using it.      </li>
            <li>The first time I used it was an experience, it tickled so much and took a while to get used to it.</li>
            <li>Love the size, it is quiet and sure beats the big old Phillips I used before!</li>
            <li>The older model had a flashing light and then steady when charged, this one is constantly steady at all times.  </li>
            <li>The small brush tip is good for crevice cleaning.</li>
            <li>The Professional uses a fast sweeping motion of its circular head to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>It will clean my teeth and save more time on everyday.</li>
            <li>I have used both the Sonic Care and the Oral-B Spin Brushes but really liked the slimmed down design of the Oral-B Pulsonic.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for your main toothbrush I&#x27;d skip it and look into Sonicare or the more traditional Oral-B electric</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is a great value over 50% less than Sonicare products and seems to work exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>I used on the low setting for about 1 wk to 10 days, now able to use the high.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is, this little gadget has exceeded my expectations and more!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much to the other reviewer&#x27;s nice review.</li>
            <li>While brushing, I occasionally accidentally hit the button and have to tap it two more times to return to the normal brushing mode.  </li>
            <li>The sensitive setting is useful for those getting used to electric toothbrushes for the first time.</li>
            <li>its so easy to store between daily uses and carry for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Easily maintained it&#x27;s charge brushing twice daily over the douse of a week vacation.</li>
            <li>The Pulsonic toothbrush is even better, keeping them totally clean and removing totally the plaque, especially with the use of the precision tip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smaller size makes it easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I also love the slender look, doesnt take up much room and has a realy long battery life</li>
            <li>I got this because my Sonicare brush finally died, after 9 years of going strong.</li>
            <li>I cant believe it has been running strong for THREE YEARS, now-a-days products seem to barely last for one year.</li>
            <li>wife and i ordered two of these largely because of the $20 rebate that we thought applied to each one.  </li>
            <li>and I certainly did not notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>Whether my teeth will get whiter is another story; they certainly feel cleaner.    </li>
            <li>It was big and chunky, it did clean very well, but when it finally died I wanted something more slender.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this toothbrush for a few years and still use it and love it!</li>
            <li>I love my new electric toothbrush wont be goin back to manual brushing again.</li>
            <li>Overall I like this new brush, though it might be better if Oral-B puts in an indicator for battery.</li>
            <li>After a month of use and a recent perio exam, the dentist says it is looking much better, and to keep up the routine with the new electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>So I finally bought a new one, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>If the dentists are right, which apparently I&#x27;m betting on, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great value for around $50 (often you can get it for less if you buy when they are offering rebates and compare prices on several websites).</li>
            <li>Overall, pleased with the results so far!</li>
            <li>Follow-up 10 months later:  The battery life is fine.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try it after my classic Oral B spin brush died (after 6 years!).  </li>
            <li>Nice and slim, takes up little space on the counter.  </li>
            <li>I liked the size, though it took a little while to adjust to the feel of it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little noisy and kind of grinds when it hit a tooth.</li>
            <li>The little brush cleans nicely between the teeth.</li>
            <li>It holds a very long charge and provides a very clean feeling once i&#x27;m done brushing.  </li>
            <li>Clean (normal) and Sensitive</li>
            <li>The handle is significantly thinner than the Sonicare (competitor) model, which makes it less comfortable for the hand.  </li>
            <li>We really liked this model compared to other sonic toothbrushes because it not only does a great job cleaning our teeth, but the brush handle and charging base are very easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>It is important to note that no matter how much gunk I let accumulate the toothbrush always charged properly.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for a few weeks and find it amazing.  </li>
            <li>- Comfortable to hold and is well balanced  - Very quiet operation  - Medium-soft bristles are gentle on teeth &amp; gums  </li>
            <li>Cleans really well.</li>
            <li>its price is reasonable and the noise is not so loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was reasonably priced and had all the things i wanted:  slim design  </li>
            <li>Oral-B is a trusted name and they had a rebate which made this pulsonic very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>After much research I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for me.  </li>
            <li>he says its really convinient and he can feel the difference.</li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush so much,</li>
            <li>The ultrasonic action is not as powerful as Sonicare&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>So really, this is just a one person toothbrush based on the spots for brush head storage.  </li>
            <li>reasonable price    </li>
            <li>This Oral-B Pulsonic is very sleek and appears to be well made.  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable too and Oral-B was offering a $15.00 rebate when I purchased it so that made the deal even sweeter.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a reasonable priced rechargeable toothbrush this is the toothbrush for you.  </li>
            <li>The reason seems to be that there isn&#x27;t much side to side movement of the bristles.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have as much bristal movement as the ones with the circle shaped heads.</li>
            <li>I really like the pick part</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with the appearance and performance of this product.</li>
            <li>I really prefer the Sonic Complete, which has a comfortable soft brush, so I regret the decision to buy the Pulsonic.</li>
            <li>Holds charge very well.  </li>
            <li>A gentle grip is all that&#x27;s needed and</li>
            <li>(but too big to fit in any toothbrush holder slots)  </li>
            <li>It functions at a much faster speed than my Braun.  </li>
            <li>On the low speed, the sound is more similar to the drone of an old prop plane.    </li>
            <li>a try (available at my local pharmacy for approx.</li>
            <li>The difference is this does a hell of a job at pulsing/vibrating to really help you get those teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;-There is only one type of replacement head available.  </li>
            <li>where I can really massage/clean my gums and really...</li>
            <li>my whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>Come on...get real paranoid people...       </li>
            <li>and I much preferred.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it is very slim</li>
            <li>It really has reduced my teeth stains and people</li>
            <li>Thanks, Frank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>I did not realize it would so jolt my teeth so much when I used it.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have purchased several of these, most have held up very well, however, one came apart, partly because my son did not take great care of it, but I did not believe it should have failed the way it did.  </li>
            <li>The Pulsonic was much easier to handle while brushing</li>
            <li>and yes, it does look much nicer in your bathroom</li>
            <li>Well, it doesn&#x27;t, but it comes very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, while the handle is very sleek the brush head is not at all.  </li>
            <li>So, if you enjoy holding big pieces of plastic in your mouth, then this is the toothbrush for you.  </li>
            <li>and my teeth look so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>The charger is compact, too, and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bit louder than I expected, but certainly better than the SpinBrush,</li>
            <li>my teeth look so much whiter.</li>
            <li>I really like the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>nonetheless i really like the design and form factor of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>There is no provision to hide extra slack of the cord inside the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun seems to go out of their way to hide the fact that wall-mounting is available.</li>
            <li>Really cleans them.</li>
            <li>There is a real deal breaker here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I really miss the Sonicare feature where it shuts off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month now and really like it.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge really well</li>
            <li>The real amazement was when I went in for my checkup.  </li>
            <li>meant that it was sturdier, and covered my whole tooth when brushing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>which I consider to be a real compliment.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>cleans out the stains that are in between your teeth really well.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush is slim, light weight, quiet and the plug is compact.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s replacement brush also much reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>as someone with a slightly smaller mouth, the toothbrush head is perfectly sized to reach the very back of the last row of big molars.</li>
            <li>The bristles move really fast, instead of just sitting there vibrating.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this Braun/Oral-b to work.  </li>
            <li>However, in that time I realized I was applying too much pressure when brushing in the circular pattern, as recommended in the instructions.</li>
            <li>It vibrates, but the WHOLE THING vibrates.  </li>
            <li>I would have expected better from Oral-B.</li>
            <li>Very slim.  </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t wanting an electric toothbrush--</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are reasonable priced.  </li>
            <li>Last time I bought the Oral B  Sonic Complete and it is a great toothbrush, but for some reason Braun isn&#x27;t marketing it any longer, so now the Sonic Complete heads are not carried locally, and supplies on this site, with the exception of the generics, are dwindling.</li>
            <li>Charges fast too.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I dont have much to compare this against.</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>The vibrations are intense as needed to give the results like a \\&quot;dentist office\\&quot; cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads are reasonably priced which is unusual in this market.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Oral-B.</li>
            <li>This is a very well built and thought out brush</li>
            <li>This toothbrush stops if too much pressure is applied.  </li>
            <li>Vibrations make cleaning much easier and effortless.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush really makes a difference in cleaning.    </li>
            <li>The ultrasonic vibration really cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Someone else noted that if that the brushes are coming off, then chances are you are applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li>This sonic toothbrush works very well,and is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>This was a gift, so I can&#x27;t vouch for it myself, but the person I gave it too really really likes it.  </li>
            <li>if I dislike it so much why three stars?</li>
            <li>very powerful&lt;br /&gt;Standard</li>
            <li>This is a very neat toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how anyone lives without an electric tooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone with teeth!</li>
            <li>1) it cleans really well.  </li>
            <li>The charging stand fits neatly on your sink basin and holds the toothbrush straight up in the air.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it too.  </li>
            <li>They continue to get smaller, more powerful, and now tend to include multiple operation modes and interchangeable brushes and accessories.  </li>
            <li>Medium-soft bristles are gentle on teeth &amp; gums&lt;</li>
            <li>I was very tempted to give this Pulsonic toothbrush a 5-star rating, but I honestly feel that Oral-B has overlooked a few important details that will hopefully be corrected on future model releases.  </li>

            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Very recommended</li>
            <li>Very compact.  </li>
            <li>the handle vibrates so much that my hands are still tingling after I have finished brushing.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very noticeably whiter in just under two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Really cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My hygeinist has also commented that I do not have much of the &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; unlike before when I was still using the manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The only thing that you have to watch out for is to buy the replacement heads which is not that cheap.</li>
            <li>This item works very well.  </li>
            <li>Holds charge very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Oral-B.</li>
            <li>Put the whole thing inside a toothbrush-shaped casing and voila: you&#x27;ve got something you can brush your teeth with that&#x27;s vibrating at around ~30,000</li>
            <li>&gt;— Brush in gentle circles.</li>
            <li>I chose this because it came with the precision tip head (which does not do much either).</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works, but all the attachments didn&#x27;t seem to do much...</li>
            <li>We really like the narrow handle of the tooth brush and are happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li>it is neat, but doesn&#x27;t get used much.</li>
            <li>Sonicare&#x27;s most recent update completely redesigned the body, the brushes and the body-brush coupling system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also own the bigger (blue) oral-b sonic tothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The stand can be mounted to the wall to clear up your countertop as well...and who here has enough room on your sink top?    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for a few months now and I am stil loving it.  </li>
            <li>had this for a few years now , battery still works well and it cleans well while being nice and slim.</li>
            <li>only way to stop it is by placing it into the charger but it constantly charging and let be honest -</li>
            <li>The second head it comes with is handy for those teeth in the back</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first sonic brush and my teeth were a wee bit sensitive at first, but I got over it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pulsonic has two settings - regular and sensitive which should do the job for most people.</li>
            <li>The 30 second warnings are by far my favorite feature.</li>
            <li>As a result, I found the quality of cleaning sub-par, and would go so far as to say that a regular manual toothbrush does a better job at cleaning my rear molars.  </li>
            <li>But now I honestly feel like I wasted $30, and I&#x27;m forcing myself to continue using it to get my money&#x27;s worth!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>The right kind is hard to find.</li>
            <li>At first, the clean mode was a bit much to take and felt uncomfortable; but after a couple of days on the sensitive mode I&#x27;ve eased into the clean mode quite nicely.     </li>
            <li>only issue with the Pulsonic is that it just isn&#x27;t quite as gentle or as good as the more expensive models, but you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li>Not a large space but more</li>
            <li>the batteries last forever, the brushes are reasonably priced!!!</li>
            <li>I remember that when first using the Sonicare, the intensity of the vibration gradually increased over time to allow your mouth and teeth to adjust to the new sensation.</li>
            <li>I kept copies of all documentation I sent and as far as I can see it is the right label.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush moves your hand more than it does in your mouth, is hard to hold, and doesn&#x27;t clean as well.  </li>
            <li>When I brush with an electric toothbrush, I want to be able to slowly move my toothbrush around while the cleaning power of the toothbrush head does all the work and leaves my mouth feeling dentist clean.  </li>
            <li>I guess the bottom line is that it does clean your teeth but the proof of how well it really cleans will be found at my next dentist appointment!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was always perplexed by the tiny circular brush heads, but now that&#x27;s MAINLY what I use.</li>
            <li>I originally got the the battery operated version last summer and have been using one until now</li>
            <li>Cleaned my  teeth better than any other electric&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally bought an \\&quot;advanced\\&quot;, but not \\&quot;elite\\&quot; model from my dentist several years ago on her recommendation.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a first time electric toothbrush or to upgrade your old one, get this!</li>
            <li>My problem with the Oral-B Pulsonic, like many other reviewers, is the dependability.  </li>
            <li>i use the pulsonic toothbrushes for many years now and i dont want to have any other now.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this about 2 years ago, but it stopped working because I left it in the shower and the screw at the bottom rusted.  </li>
            <li>The speed of the oscillation is what makes this product better than the other ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely well-designed: Have you seen most electric brushes?</li>
            <li>When I showed up to my first post-brush-purchase teeth-cleaning with red gums, the dental hygienist—while totally supportive of the purchase—pointed out that, since this is an electric brush, you shouldn&#x27;t brush with the same vigor that youwould with a manual brush.</li>
            <li>Tip attachement (LOVE this for my braces)&lt;br /&gt;Quieter than some other Oral B toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;Affordable</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Vibrates my hand more than other brushes</li>
            <li>model in particular is very high quality.</li>
            <li>My teeth haven&#x27;t felt felt this clean since my regular visits to my dentist!</li>
            <li>My mouth definitely feels clean.  </li>
            <li>At first it tingled so much touching my tongue that I had to take a break from brushing, but after a few days I got used to it.</li>
            <li>Give it a 5-day run on regular basis (twice a day) with scrutinized clean (both brushes) in the evening and recommended 4-minute regular clean in the morning</li>
            <li>The brush heads are a great size - not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li>Being someone who has worked myself back into a much better state of dental health, I can heartily testify to the advantages of brushing with electric toothbrushes in general, and sonic toothbrushes in particular.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery life is great, I can use it on long business trips and never worry about it going dead.  </li>
            <li>And also vibes every 30 seconds to help you clean all the areas equally.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is light and small, which means it fit in my mouth, and my wife&#x27;s mouth, quite well.  </li>
            <li>And this smaller brush is also great for getting between a few misaligned teeth too!    </li>
            <li>My wife and I have the older Oral B/Braun that is much wider.  </li>
            <li>Make my mouth and gums feel clean and can definitely feel a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li>Not giving such strong cleaning effect as Sonic Complete but is much easier to operate dure to compact design.</li>
            <li>The brush comes with an additional smaller head that is meant to clean between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Provides the same clean mouth feeling I get from the sonic care electric tooth brush I use at home.</li>
            <li>Third, I can get my teeth just as clean with this $50 product as I could with the $200 Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I miss the oscillating brush and feel that the vibrating one does not scrub my teeth clean enough.  </li>
            <li>It is an investment that will hopefully save you much more over the long run in professional dental</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably use this Pulsonic for travel since it&#x27;s nice and compact, though I suspect that also means the battery won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to upgrade from their manual toothbrush, but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money and use a bulky device.</li>
            <li>Although it does vibrate at a high rate, the whole toothbrush seems to vibrate instead of just the head.</li>
            <li>Being someone who has worked myself back into a much better state of dental health, I can heartily testify to the advantages of brushing with electric toothbrushes in general, and sonic toothbrushes in particular.     </li>
            <li>little brush heads attached to gigantic bases, with some blue or aquamarine detailing that proudly and loudly declares: &amp;#34;I am for dental hygiene!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It is more awkward to use and more time consuming than I anticipated,   but I will keep at it!</li>
            <li>The pricing on this is perfect for someone who wants to be serious about oral health care but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a fancy brush that takes up half the counter-top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, slim, and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>This is a very user friendly electric toothbrush, with a smaller, thinner and lighter size than the direct competitors and also at a reasonable price compared to them.  </li>
            <li>Even though I love my old Professional model, I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the Pulsonic, for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pulsonic is not as gentle on your teeth and gums as most of the more expensive toothbrushes I&#x27;ve owned, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li>The sonic cleaning action is at a higher rate then</li>
            <li>if you buy it from that wharehouse store or a standard store with a good return policy, they will take it back no questions asked anywhere from 60 days to a year later.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for your first sonic brush, or an upgrade from your old one, I cannot think of a reason not to pick the Pulsonic from Oral-B.</li>
            <li>Definitely feels like a much more intense brushing than the prior generation of Oral Bs (had the circular one and the one with the split head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is very maneuverable and oscillates in the normal brushing direction, aligned with the tooth crevices.</li>
            <li>Pulsonic is the first brush to surpass the Sonicare in my professional opinion.  </li>
            <li>True enough, we dropped it.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but was really surprised to find only one brush included.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to live without!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to live without!  </li>
            <li>-B Pro 1000 is the new way to go, and it doesn&#x27;t overheat/overcharge like this one does!</li>
            <li>Just want correct replacement heads,NOT a new $$$ toothbrush!</li>
            <li>This is a great electric toothbrush because it feels like you are holding a regular toothbrush and not a big flashlight like some other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>while this model does well to competitors priced similarly, there are other more powerful units on the market.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I prefer the Oscillating brush head of my Oral-B Triumph power toothbrush, my wife much prefers this new Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>wife really loves the new Oral-B Pulsonic power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Although I prefer the Oscillating brush head of my Oral-B Triumph power toothbrush, my wife much prefers this new Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>No travel/storage case included    My wife really loves the new Oral-B Pulsonic power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy a whole new set.</li>
            <li>I cannot say if this toothbrush out pulses the competition or does a better job of cleaning, but compared to the previous brushes I have tried this one is twice the price.  </li>
            <li>Gives me a big white and clean smile after I finish.</li>
            <li>The two main considerations I use when looking at an electric toothbrush are vibrations per minute (VPM) and brush head form.</li>
            <li>The system comes with a separate attachment to get into those harder to reach areas and a nice rechargeable stand which holds the extra head and the toothbrush.   </li>
            <li>Still a decent product with a decent price.  </li>
            <li>I mainly got this oral b tooth brush because it came with a rebate of $20.</li>
            <li>All in all, a decent sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is light weight, unlike the last one that I had and is not as loud.  </li>
            <li>According to Wikipedia 80% of tooth decay occurs in the pits and fissures of the teeth, mainly the molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much whiter smile without unsightly stains in the areas where regular brushing doesn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li>The main concern consumers should have is the value for money one.  </li>
            <li>I bought another Oral-B rechargeable product because I was out of town and could not find this particular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare is much more expensive and the heads cost more, too, so I stick with this brand.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a regular brushing head and a in between your teeth head (smaller bristle top).</li>
            <li>As with most rechargeable products these days, you must initially wait several hours for the device to charge before you begin using it.  </li>
            <li>teeth were super white though.</li>
            <li>Initially I had a problem with the brush head twisting off during brushing, but either I have inadvertently changed my brushing style, or the head finally seated itself better with some of the toothpaste residue</li>
            <li>It is the most similar in size &amp; shape to a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li>but the brush heads would wear out quickly or they would break after a short time.</li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing this toothbrush, I had the cheap Crest spinbrush that I bought for about $10 from walgreens, which had the &#x27;dual&#x27; action in one head.</li>
            <li>The best thing about it compared to other electric toothbrushes is that it is shaped more like a regular toothbrush, with a lightweight, comfortable base.</li>
            <li>With that, I&#x27;ll repeat my recommendation that people who have slightly inflamed gums, or gums teetering towards developing gum disease may get some valuable help from this toothbrush.re immaculate and my gums and pockets were all within normal, healthy scoring ranges on the scale they use to rate gum disease progression.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>Dentist&#x27;s drill!!!\\&quot; On the &#x27;high&#x27; speed</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a number of high end products in this category, by Oral-B, Phillips and Braun.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I will give this product high marks for not killing me.</li>
            <li>And I have had problems knowing when it needs to be recharged, as electrical outlets in my bathroom are in high demand, and there&#x27;s no way of knowing when you&#x27;re about to run out of juice.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d highly recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Although there is clearly nothing wrong with scrubbing your teeth the traditional way, with a good old-fashioned toothbrush, I find that the power toothbrushes tend to remove stains better and keep my teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>We bought our original set nearly 6 years ago and my husbands finally quit on us (mine is still kicking).</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic toothbrush provides good sonic cleaning action but the head is very small.</li>
            <li>thought they were a little over the top.  </li>
            <li>This can take a little getting used to if you are more accustomed to the oscillating brush-type models, like I am.  </li>
            <li>I like the small head and the concept, but to be honest, my old spin style brush left my teeth feeling far more clean and in less time brushing.  </li>
            <li>This one is subtle, and good if you have sensitive teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two of the LED indicators show what cleaning mode the brush is in, when powered on (clean or sensitive), while the third LED lights up when the device is charging.  </li>
            <li>Post research, my boyfriend concluded the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush was currently the highest rated Oral-B electric toothbrush and the smart choice for our first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrushes for years, but this is the first time I swayed from the basic models such as [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].  </li>
            <li>If you enjoy handing large sums of money over to massive corporations in exchange for a giant piece of plastic in your mouth, then this is the toothbrush for you.  </li>
            <li>So far I like this toothbrush way more than the Sonicare, which was too heavy, the brush head was too large for my liking, and when you take it out of your mouth to spit, you (and the mirror) get splattered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it feels normal now, I remember how much smoother and clean my teeth felt the first few times I used this after switching over from a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I think that probably makes it a little less effective at getting your teeth completely clean.</li>
            <li>I live this smaller, slimmer version of the pulsonic toothbrush, Works as well, if not better, than any other sonic toothbrush Great product!</li>
            <li>I myself prefer the slimmer profile, and it&#x27;s much quieter than my old Philips sonic.</li>
            <li>The Pulsonic still does a great job cleaning your teeth, don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li>So far this has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I tried another of Oral-B&#x27;s lower cost units, and it was like a concrete mixer against my teeth.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Although these vibrations are fairly gentle, switching to the sensitive mode reduces the strength of the vibration by about 1/3.  </li>
            <li>Sensitive Mode is much gentler on touchy teeth &amp; gums&lt;</li>
            <li>- Sensitive Mode is much gentler on touchy teeth &amp; gums  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning this and spending a few dollars more for a heftier sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I decided to try sonic action   because It seemed my first choice, Oral B Professional 1000,  </li>
            <li>I am more motivated to brush my teeth a few times a day now.  </li>
            <li>we have taken to the always useful Comments section to air our grievance; We are Prime members, buy a lot of products on Amazon, and feel like Amazon should definitely do</li>
            <li>: Lack of bundled accessories, doesn&#x27;t feel quite as powerful as some of its bigger</li>
            <li>so since I had good luck with oral B in the past, I decided to go back to them and didn&#x27;t regret it at all.  </li>
            <li>This one would make a good choice for somebody with small hands (children) or for a second toothbrush to keep in your travel kit.</li>
            <li>Much more than this, it has 2 different cleaning modes, regular and sensitive.    </li>
            <li>Small, light, powerful, maneuverable.  </li>
            <li>small brush head, light weigh and powerful brushing motor, this one, IMHO, has it all.</li>
            <li>They tell you to brush like normal.      </li>
            <li>I have has no problems with using the normal brushing mode</li>
            <li>After using it for this long, I&#x27;d pay full retail for it if I had it to do over again.  </li>
            <li>Spend the few dollars more.</li>
            <li>Since using the sonic toothbrush I definitely see a decrease in the build up of plaque and that is makes this purchase worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I would suggest that you spend the extra money and buy a better brush or simply go with the old manual style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an extremely reasonable price: At $40 (as of this writing), it&#x27;s $40 more expensive than the free toothbrushes your dentist gives you after a visit.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A POORLY MANUFACTURED PRODUCT, SOLD BY A COMPANY THAT DOES NOT PROMOTE GOOD CUSTOMER RELATIONS OR PRODUCT LOYALTY!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do wish the battery would last a little longer, I seem to be able to get right about a year of use.</li>
            <li>initial impression was very positive.  </li>
            <li>A whole other level of clean.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, only slightly thicker than an ordinary (non-powered) toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It is not hard on the gums, in fact it stimulates them unlike any toothbrush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>After using this new toothbrush for a couple of weeks, my wife&#x27;s teeth are already noticeably brighter, so we definitely believe Oral-B&#x27;s claim that this brush removes stains and polishes teeth for a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li>After using this new toothbrush for a couple of weeks, my wife&#x27;s teeth are already noticeably brighter, so we definitely believe Oral-B&#x27;s claim that this brush removes stains and polishes teeth for a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li>Thin, light, easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I ordered this electric toothbrush right after I came back from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one of the other great things, it&#x27;s small.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, on the highest vibration setting (clean mode), I found that the brush vibrated too much and was uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>Multi-mode - offers two different modes, clean and sensitive.    </li>
            <li>I find it almost too thin, but its size is closer to that of a regular toothbrush, so it will fit inside a standard travel toothbrush holder -- a good thing, since Oral-B does not include a travel case in the package.    </li>
            <li>It does twist off easily as I wipe it down after using, but I have never had it come off in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to not damage gums/tissue, but can certainly stimulate circulation and cleanse all at one time.  </li>
            <li>and I also wanted to try something different that Sonicare, purely out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot give you a lengthy feedback about Pulsonic because I didn&#x27;t get to use it much.</li>
            <li>- a real ultrasonic brush, the only type useful against periodontal pockets  - very low price for this technology  - easy to clean  - small charging stand  - small brush, great for little hands  - quad pacer  - setting for sensitive gums  </li>
            <li>I am now &#x27;cost sensitive&#x27; as I am only willing to spend so much to &#x27;rent&#x27; a unit for a couple of years</li>
            <li>She needed new brushes and decided to go for a newer toothbrush instead.</li>
            <li>the bristles of the brush are still completely new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li>, what does the Pulsonic sacrifice to achieve this chic new compact design?  </li>
            <li>After two weeks, my new sonicare brush heads would be frayed at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just recieved my new Oral-B Pulsonic Eletric Toothbrush in the mail yesterday.</li>
            <li>so I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying a new one.</li>
            <li>The new unit arrived via FedEx yesterday, just 10 days after I sent the defective one to them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The new one has been working with no problem, and I still have a spare.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>that when I needed a new one I bought the Oral-B sonic.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a new electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>ever did even brand new.  </li>
            <li>The new Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is truly a breakthrough in power toothbrush design.  </li>
            <li>It was time for a new one</li>
            <li>The product itself appears to be very advanced, with the sleek body and small footprint.  </li>
            <li>it is really easy to twist ever so slightly while brushing which pops head off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very slim so doesn&#x27;t take up much room vs a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>(it seems every time they make a newer sonic unit they also make newer brush heads which will not fit the older unit nor will the older unit&#x27;s brushes fit the newer one) as what else can I do with them.    </li>
            <li>The smaller head is great for getting along the gumline and behind your front teeth.</li>
            <li>only spent more than three months, it is out of control.</li>
            <li>although it isn&#x27;t much bigger than a standard size toothbrush, it won&#x27;t fit in the cases designed for them).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any plastic part in this brush is less robust than your gums, or maybe I&#x27;m lucky to receive a better one, which I found more unlikely.    </li>
            <li>you are on a budget, want a good (not great) sonic toothbrush, then I have no trouble recommending the Oral-B Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li>The sonic action of the Pulsonic is not diminished at all by the smaller size (for those who aren&#x27;t familiar with general benefits of sonic brushing, do a google search for animated teeth.).  </li>
            <li>In the meantime , it seems to clean well, the device is is easy to clean and the base is small and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is very slim which is great for packing but a little hard to hold.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I have very sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>My gums are usually very sensitive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very, very loud.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for a simple, high quality electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is tiny in the hands, and the setting gives a very intense cleaning.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this thing and it turned out to be a complete disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only gripe preventing a 5-star rating is that even though OralB designed this brush so compact and perfect for travel, OralB was too cheap to add a few more cents to make charging base chargeable in Asian countries, or elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>: When compared to my Sonicare, this brand actually works better at removing plaque, and I really, really like the little pick brush.</li>
            <li>The only and biggest problem I have is the warranty from Oral-B, first they don&#x27;t go by purchase date, but the date of manufacture.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, inexpensive, and works even better, she says.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Small light toothbrush, does the job!</li>
            <li>My entire family has been using the higher end oral b electric toothbrushes for years now.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Oral-B Triumph Professional Care toothbrush with all the bells and whistles for the last few years and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I like the reminder pauses to change quadrants, but I usually give it a once more all over anyway.  </li>
            <li>If you only need a toothbrush for a short period of time, this might work for you, but I expect my products to last more than one year.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has changed my morning routine completely!</li>
            <li>Pretty much standard these days, I would expect.</li>
            <li>The smaller size of the toothbrush is not merely an aesthetic benefit either.  </li>
            <li>Has a setting for normal or sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for the exact same model I&#x27;ve been using for 3 years.</li>
            <li>not sure how it cleans your teeth better than the manual way.  </li>
            <li>I have had them all back to the first Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I had used several Sonicare models and this is the first time to use O-ral B.  </li>
            <li>It has two modes for normal and sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the battery wasn&#x27;t charged enough, so I charged it for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>First head is a toothbrush and a second head is used for flossing.</li>
            <li>My original Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush finally died after several years.  </li>
            <li>but it actually works better and the battery seems to last and last.</li>
            <li>but it is a non issue to me, it seems pretty standard for a toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve found is that the higher speed causes some bleeding -but</li>
            <li>The toothbrush head only vibrates, unlike many of the other Oral-B electric toothbrushes that oscillate.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the exact same quality as the $100</li>
            <li>I think I brushed my teeth for five minutes the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I have used this toothbrush model for over 5 years and just purchased a second one to replace the first one.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush for travel, slim and small but durable.</li>
            <li>I actually think the Professional cleans my teeth a little better and with less effort on my part because you just sort of place the brush head on top of each tooth.  </li>
            <li>I have been lead to believe that water and electricity can be a dangerous combination, so I am happy to report that I have not yet been electrocuted using my new Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>The charger, as I already mentioned, is small but sturdy and while it lacks a snapping mechanism to hold the brush in place while it charges, the Pulsonic sits very securely in its charging cradle and comes away from the charger without sticking (a problem I had with my old brush).  </li>
            <li>and my teeth feels pretty clean, which usually comes after 3-4 minutes of brushing with my toothbrushes before.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before but felt that my teeth weren&#x27;t getting clean enough with a regular one.  </li>
            <li>While I was using the basic models, I remember that I&#x27;m supposed to only lightly touch the brush onto my teeth, yet from the aging of the brushes I realized that I pressed it too hard most of the time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as effectively as other electric brushes</li>
            <li>I love that this toothbrush is a reasonable size and holds charge long enough for me to use it on long trips.  </li>
            <li>I suspect the same is true for any similar product.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush head is nice an small for those who are looking for a well working toothbrush with a smaller head.</li>
            <li>I got it when it was on double rebate, So I ended up only paying like $30, but after having it, I would&#x27;ve payed full price,  </li>
            <li>so I was able to let one run all the way down before charging, and this was supposed to extend the life of the tooth brush, but one of them eventually became so short</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has multiple brush shapes, the smaller brush is good for cleaning along the gumline where I have had a couple cavities in the past-</li>
            <li>But the power is no difference than other full sized model.</li>
            <li>I find this pulsonic toothbrush cleans my teeth very well (better than traditional oralb electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve had in the past), and I like its slim design a lot.</li>
            <li>so most likely it&#x27;s not a super copy that made in china and bought for $2 -</li>
            <li>Other than the few cons listed above, she feels that the Pulsonic toothbrush is perfect in every other way.  </li>
            <li>Other than the few cons listed above, she feels that the Pulsonic toothbrush is perfect in every other way.  </li>
            <li>The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just slightly larger than regular toothbrush, and easily moving around in mouth just like regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would have prefered a round head on the brush rather than the rectangular, but otherwise it is just fine.  </li>
            <li>This is a good electric toothbrush for travelling, due to its small size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But as I said earlier, I switched from Sonicare to an Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide.</li>
            <li>After using one of the large sonic toothbrushes for several years this one came as a surprise.</li>
            <li>This new one is so small and being so slim it easily falls over when you stand it upright.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how it cleans hard to reach spots, also how clean my teeth felt after the first brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mighty little</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t had them long enough to see if they whiten like the ads say, but they do clean.  </li>
            <li>I used the Sonicare for years and found it extremely difficult to keep the brush head clean despite following all the various tips you can easily find with a quick google search.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the Oral B Sonic is compact, indicates how long you should use it on each quadrant, and is priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t have to do the work myself, i actually brush my teeth for 2 minutes which the toothbrush is preseted to (it uses a little pause for recommended time to brush the front, bottom and top of your teeth).</li>
            <li>You will pay a little more for this toothbrush, as opposed to using standard toothbrushes, but your teeth will thank you...</li>
            <li>overall i think brushing with sonic toothbrushes are a little more work because you have to do the rotating motion with your hand.  </li>
            <li>Love the slim design and way the head and vibrations get into all the hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads are hard and not cushioned like the better brands.</li>
            <li>It does, however, come with a second brush head to get in between teeth and those hard to reach places which is a really nice addition but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big, expensive, but works great.</li>
            <li>The clear plastic is the part that holds the pulsonic and two brush heads.</li>
            <li>but this one is by far the &#x27;buzziest&#x27; and I can not say that it was the tooth brush</li>
            <li>The price is a bit steep to just go out and buy one, unless your replacing an old one.</li>
            <li>my teeth instantly felt cleaner and my whole mouth too.  </li>
            <li>I had a 10+ year old Oral-B 3D toothbrush, and I thought it did a great job, but heads were expensive, and my teeth have that JUST CAME BACK FROM THE DENTIST/DENTAL HYGIENIST FEELING!  </li>
            <li>just wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a frequent traveler (65+ nights away from home)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B Professional rechargeable toothbrush for about 4 years now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot easier to hold and manipulate than the Professional model and probably the bulky Philips model, too.  </li>
            <li>An electric brush naturally makes you spend longer.  </li>
            <li>One note, my wife has sensitive teeth, and found her Sonicare to be too aggressive.</li>
            <li>None so far</li>
            <li>This action  breaks up the plaque supposedly.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;ve hit the sensitive mode on accident.</li>
            <li>When the battery died I bought the Oral B Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li>&quot; feeling I&#x27;d grown used to with my old brush is completely gone.  </li>
            <li>It might be nicer if Oral-B puts on an indicator to show the battery level, since it&#x27;s very unclear to me that how I should notice the low battery status without running out of power.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a lower speed function for brushing sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A mode for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It developed a crack in the bottom side.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had a cavity at 30 years old.  </li>
            <li>Changing the head will be so much easier than my old Oral B Cross Action.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough on gums to use 3 times day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is like getting my teeth professionally cleaned at the dentists&#x27; every morning.</li>

            <li>I gave these as gifts to all my adult children this Christmas.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter that my last Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li>The Sonic Complete has 3 cleaning modes versus the 2 on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Environmentally, this unit has a NiMH battery versus the toxic NiCad in the Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li>Soft bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I chose the sensitive and my teeth are not sore.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel the gums being damaged as I did with my old brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush far surpassed my expectations in terms of size, weight, sturdiness, quietness and functionality for a sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>provided their teeth and gums are not already so sensitive that sonic toothbrushes would be out of the question.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to buy a second one for my husband.</li>
            <li>I received it early, I charged it up per the instructions but when I went to use it</li>
            <li>i used to use an oral-b professional care electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>only con as always brush heads cost too much</li>
            <li>It started with power intermittent on and off during brushing until it completely gave up.</li>
            <li>but I missed the Sonic action I have been use to.  </li>
            <li>For reference, It&#x27;s as loud as my norelco electric razor.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I trust Oral-B and ordered the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 4000 Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I was buying it to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>So far I like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Then there is the quality of the cleaning, which at best is described as disappointing since even after a thorough cleaning, one is left if the sense that something was missed and one reaches for the manual toothbrush to make an extra scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I tend to be an Oral-B fan I really felt this model was middle of the road.  </li>
            <li>I was also surprised by the battery life -</li>
            <li>Lastly, there is no way to tell how much charge remains.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised they even call this a sonic toothbrush (I think somebody already said that in their review here on Amazon).  </li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth get much cleaner than with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I like the 2 speeds, as I prefer sensitive, as well as the compact size.  </li>
            <li>The Sonic Complete came as a set of two</li>
            <li>so I had to buy this one as the Complete is now discontinued.</li>
            <li>I like how it has a sensitive setting.</li>
            <li>with the optional soft brush heads.</li>
            <li>Also it is much easier to get into the tiny spots...</li>
            <li>but I was not expecting it to completely change my thinking about brushing.  </li>
            <li>Besides the fact that the brush actually delivers on the results, the design is very well thought out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering replacing my professional 4000 with one of these.</li>
            <li>Cons: none so far.    </li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job so far.</li>
            <li>It cleans well, just as promised and I do like the sensitive setting.  </li>
            <li>Before using this toothbrush, had sore gums but the messaging action  of the tooth brush has eliminated this problem.</li>
            <li>I had been using my old Sonicare for years, refusing to upgrade bcz</li>
            <li>I wanted it as soon as I saw it - so sleek &amp; compact - much slimmer than even the newer Sonicares; in fact, the size is comparable to a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have had no problems with this brush so far.</li>
            <li>The actual head does not move much in motion, just vibrates, but I guess that must be the &#x27;sonic&#x27; part.</li>
            <li>Dental checkups have markedly improved.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my old oral b electric.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the power of the Sonicare and the shape of the brush head causes it to not get in between my teeth as well.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased 3 of these so far.</li>
            <li>The vibrating motion of the toothbrush can be changed for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I was just a bit surprised that it did not come with any paper work.</li>
            <li>I owned the oral B Sonic complete toothbrush before, but this one doesn&#x27;t match in quality.  </li>
            <li>I purchased about a dozen just before the old handle</li>

            <li>No indication of when charging is complete</li>
            <li>Nearly every rechargeable electronic device provides indication of when it requires charging.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the inclusion of a travel/storage case would really make sense.  </li>

            <li>Finally, the inclusion of a travel/storage case would really make sense.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush for my young daughter.  </li>
            <li>It is light enough and simple enough for her to use without our help.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to soft, and my dentist recommends soft.</li>
            <li>I frequently travel for work and wanted something that had power yet was compact.</li>
            <li>This product is very lightweight - like holding a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I know my kids when they were young</li>
            <li>After using an Oral B rotating electric for years, this one surpasses the old by leaps and bounds.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely simple, but works very well:  </li>
            <li>Friends are surprised when I turn it on (&amp;#34;That thing is electric?&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Pulsonic seems considerably weaker.</li>
            <li>many have complained here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it has a sensitive mode</li>
            <li>, \\&quot;high\\&quot; mode wasn&#x27;t as powerful as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Thoroughly compelling and my confidence in the product only grows after each subsequent viewing.</li>
            <li>The brush will last ~2-3 weeks before the battery&#x27;s dead (which is handy for traveling), then plug it back in again.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It is slim in the hand and very lightweight, most of my earlier experiments were thick and bulky, and cumbersome to navigate around the mouth.</li>
            <li>It feels good in your hand, just like a regular toothbrush except it has the sonic power behind it.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and after a trip to a couple of stores and seeing the high price on other brands I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that at least one other reviewer experienced the same problem, so I suspect that Oral-B may have a quality problem that some buyers may experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have problems with traditional brushes, but I actually like the weight and size of most other brushes.  </li>
            <li>I would have problems with traditional brushes, but I actually like the weight and size of most other brushes.  </li>
            <li>This is a rather mediocre electric brush compared with other Oral-B products (such as the Triumph, which is excellent) or any of the Sonicare line of brushes.</li>
            <li>When I first used it felt very strange.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and fits easily in your hand.</li>
            <li>Small so easy to pack for travel</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tried any other electric toothbrushes, so I really have nothing to compare this one too.</li>
            <li>Slim size and small head makes it easy to glide around your mouth.</li>
            <li>my old toothbrush and probably provides better cleaning but the head seems very small in my mouth.</li>
            <li>This one is just as good for less than half the money!!  </li>
            <li>, it travels well, it stays clean with a minimal amount of rinsing after each use, the battery lasted me the entirety of a 12 day cruise last summer</li>
            <li>(I got the 50% rebate so it only cost $25) and it seems to be decent at holding a charge so far.</li>
            <li>I suspect that the battery life is not going to be nearly as prolonged as the older larger model which lasted about 5 years.</li>
            <li>I would have given this model a little higher rating, but I feel that even at this price range the toothbrush should really impress me.</li>
            <li>It feels more natural and you brush as you would ordinarily brush with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>- Charging Base...takes up a very small footprint on sink  - Price...much lower than many newer Oral-B/Sonic-care brushes  - Performance...</li>
            <li>I have carpal tunnel on the right and an old stress fracture on the left, so even though this products does what it is supposed to do very well, I will continue to use my larger grip, smoother running Sonicare on  a regular basis and this product only once in  awhile for a \\&quot;spit polish.\\</li>
            <li>My dentist and hygienist also commented on the quick improvement with less plaque on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>but, it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary to use the milder setting to get used to the brush, one didn&#x27;t have to with their older model.</li>
            <li>Used a different brush in the past - this seems better.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for just replacement precision tips - nothing on line.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews complain that you have to cycle from high to low speed them off -</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Press once to turn on high, press again to lower the vibration, press third time to shut off.</li>
            <li>Early model Sonicare were far from perfect, with a heavy and bulky design and brushes that were impossible to fit in tight spaces.</li>
            <li>The bristles were a bit stiff for me at first, but I really like the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I use the second rubber-tipped head for working the gumline, something my dentist always complains I could use some more of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When powered up, the motor is interrupted every thirty seconds with  a little blip to remind the user to move on to the next mouth quadrant.</li>
            <li>I will not be going back to my old tooth brush!!</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are a little more expensive, but it works better, too.</li>
            <li>Pulsonic uses special [[ASIN:B001CSZTFK Oral-B Pulsonic Refill Brush Set]] replacement heads, which are priced around the same as other brush heads.  </li>
            <li>The Pulsonic uses special [[ASIN:B001CSZTFK Oral-B Pulsonic Refill Brush Set]] replacement heads, which are priced around the same as other brush heads.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a handy unobtrusive charging station and an extra smaller head for getting hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush head of the Pulsonic is shaped much like a regular toothbrush, and is different than the Professional&#x27;s circular head.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the sonic type my dentist recommended, but it&#x27;s small and light</li>
            <li>Three stars only--it&#x27;s OK, not good.</li>
            <li>Pros  - Small size and light weight  </li>
            <li>in a nutshell, if you&#x27;re looking for a small form factor (both the brush and charger fit in my medium sized toiletry kit -- so it works well for travel),</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how long that really was until I started using the brush.</li>
            <li>Light weight and small handle brush that works well.</li>
            <li>The brush would consistently grow mold over time regardless of how careful I was.  </li>
            <li>I believe this brush head and the speed is much better for my gums compared to the Ora B Cross Action that I had for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li>The first sonicare died after 4 years of use, and I probably spent around $500 for all the sonicare products and systems.</li>
            <li>Even if it turns out to be true as other reviews state an doesnt last but a year or 2</li>
            <li>This one is much smaller, like a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>A full charge lasts for quite a few days.  </li>
            <li>While the Sonicare still has more bells and whistles overall (this could be due to model difference), I&#x27;m willing to sacrifice those little things for what I think is probably one of the two criteria that actually matter: 1)</li>
            <li>I like this product, and had to track it down on Amazon because it is rarely sold in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>The only &#x27;con&#x27; is that only one of our local stores carries the replacement heads and they&#x27;ve marked it up a lot higher than amazon&#x27;s price.  </li>
            <li>and technically they dont have to issue a refund on a personal care item, particularly if it has been used!</li>
            <li>(note that it doesn&#x27;t come with a travel pack, but it&#x27;s hard to go back to using manual brushes after using electric) and looks a lot nicer than competing brushes at this price range (has a more slender, sleek design than bulky cheaper versions).</li>
            <li>My only complaint so far is the lack of additional accessories; such as, travel case(s)/power (more emphasize needed in general on hygiene/bath items/conveniences being ready for travel), and optional brush heads (various shapes and sizes).    </li>
            <li>There are only two cleaning modes (clean and sensitive) vs five for some of its competitors, you can&#x27;t get different size/shape brush heads (other than the pointy Precision Tip brush that comes with it) and it doesn&#x27;t come with any of the nicer amenities like a travel case, brush head covers or a UV</li>
            <li>Have not had a new cavity in same time.</li>
            <li>BUT...allowing battery replacement means you wouldn&#x27;t have to BUY AN ENTIRE NEW UNIT.     </li>
            <li>sent the Oral-B Pulsonic in for repair (my expense) and received an email a week later that they would send me a new unit.  </li>
            <li>For me, the lower front teeth are especially problematic -- they are very tightly spaced, and stains set in easily between the teeth, as well as on the backside.</li>
            <li>Additionally I travel a lot and the toothbrush easily keeps a charge for at least a week and is compact.  </li>
            <li>If you build in \\&quot;planned obsolescence\\&quot; at least give the customer an easy means to recycle the darn thing.    </li>
            <li>Initially I wasn&#x27;t very used to the larger brush size, but it never became a problem.  </li>
            <li>but this one is really uncomfortable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too thin to hold comfortably in the hand.</li>
            <li>After having dealt with my old sonic toothbrush for so long I look at it now and wonder how I ever thought that it was normal to use something the size of a flashlight to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It will be useful for those with partial dentures, or if you had some recent dental work.</li>
            <li>You simply move the brush head gently over your teeth (in the aforementioned circular motion), letting the sonic vibrations perform the work of cleaning and polishing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a slightly whiter smile after using this brush for about a month.</li>
            <li>Still holds charge very well, sounds the same, and cleans the same.</li>
            <li>Well, at the least, I did not want a strong buzzing piece of metal in my mouth and a renegade plastic brush.</li>
            <li>its so small that i was a little fearful that it would not be as effective, but my last visit to the dentist (1-22-12) for a check-up and cleaning, proved it does an even better job of maintaining good dental health.  </li>
            <li>I love the silver and white colors and slim, lightweight design, not to mention the small head, 30 second reminders, and ease of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>However, even though it is a budget-priced model this is a major oversight.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, this toothbrush has some drawbacks and a major flaw.  </li>
            <li>There was no other receipt.    </li>
            <li>I have used many different power toothbrushes over the past several years.  </li>
            <li>The sensitive feature is a real plus I found that my other electronic toothbrushes did not have.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like most other brushes are too heavy and bulky to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like most other brushes are too heavy and bulky to use.  </li>
            <li>With this particular model we found that as long as we remove the brush heads when not in use, mildew and foul smells are not a problem at all.  </li>
            <li>I had a brush head that didn&#x27;t snap on well and was coming loose the first 2-3 times I brushed.</li>
            <li>Maybe it could be useful for people with braces or poorly-aligned teeth, but I think for the majority of users it will provide little</li>
            <li>Maybe it could be useful for people with braces or poorly-aligned teeth, but I think for the majority of users it will provide little benefit.     </li>
            <li>Less than half the price of better known models.</li>
            <li>The main reason for the initial discomfort is attempting to use the Pulsonic as a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have an older and more expensive version of the oral-B pulsonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Comparing the Pulsonic to the conventional sonic toothbrushes, the first thing to be noticed is the size.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the size fool you,this little brush has just as much power as some of the big ones and cleans very well.    </li>
            <li>And I tend to be a fan of Oral-B and Braun in general.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One piece of general advice.</li>
            <li>Small form factor, timed cleaning, multiple head types available and rechargeable.</li>
            <li>In addition, there&#x27;s clear benefit with respect to staining which has improved over my first few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>It is small enough to fit any mouth size....</li>
            <li>The two min. timer, broken up into 30 sec intervals is great for people like me who may not brush as long as they should without such a reminder.</li>
            <li>I can actually feel the cleaning action.</li>
            <li>The operation of the toothbrush is basically the same, there&#x27;s one button that you press to cycle between On, Sensitive, and Off.  </li>
            <li>After using the Pulsonic for 3 weeks, my gums seem to be a much healthier shade of pink, with reduced puffiness.  </li>
            <li>He believes that the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action is the key here.</li>
            <li>I decided to go back to the brushing (twirling clock, counter clock) of the Professional 1000.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s enough vibrating to message and (with the soft brushes)</li>
            <li>(so far I recharged it once after the initial charge).      </li>
            <li>I prefer the larger head that was on my old Ultrasonex.</li>
            <li>There is also a timer feature built into the Pulsonic that gives a short lag in the brushing action every 30 seconds for the recommended two minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Design-wise, this Pulsonic is lighter and smaller than the Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li>I eventually went back to my old habits.  </li>
            <li>their factory.&lt;br /&gt;The people will touch all over my tooth brush, take it apart and send it to me.&lt;br /&gt;She told me to read them the number on the toothbrush - then she told me it&#x27;s out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks oral B for making me the consumer that bought this product 3 months ago not liable for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Eleven months later the completely charged Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush would not turn on until connected to the charger.</li>
            <li>This is my second Pulsonic in about two years, and so far (knock on wood)</li>
            <li>The head barely moves.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far have had no complaints with this product, so I am giving it 5 stars, I&#x27;d definitely buy it again with no hesitation!</li>
            <li>Gave as a Christmas present, and as far as I know she enjoys it.</li>
            <li>I like the size and feel even though i can only use on the sensitive</li>
            <li>My Sonicare is several years old and the battery has about had</li>
            <li>Once you have brushed for the professionally recommended 2-minutes, a longer stutter (two breaks in vibration) can be heard and felt.  </li>
            <li>The old one still works, but it will only hold a charge for 3 - 4 days and it used to hold it for 2 weeks (the max I tested it for.)</li>
            <li>Apparently is was manufactured in 08</li>
            <li>I especially like the sensitive mode for myself.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is getting annoyed with me because every time I use it I tell him how much I love it.</li>
            <li>You need Philips Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are good things of this toothbrush, but I think the disappointing things outweigh them.</li>
            <li>I love how thin the handle is</li>
            <li>Use a light touch and slowly move around the gum line.</li>
            <li>I tried this one because the handle is slim, the charger is small &amp; the reviews said the vibration wasn&#x27;t quite as strong as the more expensive one.  </li>
            <li>After using my last Oral-B electric toothbrush for over ten years I decided it was time for a new one and purchased this Sonic.</li>
            <li>new brush has to be twisted into place and the mechanism holds quite a lot of debris...cannot think that this is healthy to be inserting a germ--laden device into my mouth!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is lighter and feels cheaper overall, right down to the charging stand.  </li>
            <li>I will never buy another P&amp;G product as long as I live.    </li>
            <li>My previous power toothbrush was a higher end model from Oral B that I bought years ago.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s small and more affordable than other sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I bought this on sale to replace my old A-series Sonicare, which works fine but is looking a bit tired.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the small brush used to clean along the gum line and between teeth as my mouth tends to form a lot of tartar.</li>
            <li>They were loud, heavy and large in the hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perio Aid products are not available at large drug stores, but you can order them direct from the manufacturer, which is Marquis Dental Manufacturing Company.</li>
            <li>hardly had to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Much quieter than any other unit I have used.    </li>
            <li>Does all that I want it to do and much cheaper than other electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others like Sonicare or the other Oral B</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t as powerful as a regular sonicare and definitely not as powerful as my larger oral-b with the circular (non \\&quot;sonic\\&quot;) head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but cheaper than many other sonic brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line- loved it while it worked properly, but is not worth the money considering the poor quality.</li>
            <li>The unit comes with one brush head and one precision tip for cleaning tight spots or around dental work (works pretty well, too).  </li>
            <li>Also, the size of the toothbrush is exactly what i was looking for - barely any different than a manual brush - again smaller than any other</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about what I would get for a 40 toothbrush, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  </li>
            <li>I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a slender powerful little brush!</li>
            <li>Summary (per the wife)    - Size...perfect for smaller hands/mouths, but very useful for getting to those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>It comes with a special precision tip brush head, designed for cleaning between teeth and hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a special precision tip brush head, designed for cleaning between teeth and hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>Both teeth have composite fillings that are over 10 years old and have had no other problems, my regular check up with x-rays were only just last month</li>
            <li>I do, and if for no other reason, based on the improvement my son saw from using this toothbrush over a standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It also came with a little flossing attachment that works pretty well.</li>
            <li>directions indicate that some people may experience bleeding of the gums the first few days of use, and while this did not occur for me, as I&#x27;ve already been using sonic toothbrushes, I can see how the sheer power of this toothbrush might cause some bleeding gums for individuals who have so far only been hand-brushing their teeth with sensitive-bristled brushes (as I used to do).</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s true that the brush doesn&#x27;t feel like steel, but my gut feeling is that you probably don&#x27;t need to press it so hard against your teeth anyway.  </li>
            <li>Not worth the cost to replace very year.</li>
            <li>routine includes a general brush over, then a tongue scrape, and then I apply a bit of toothpaste with my finger to the pits of the back teeth and work them over with the Precision Tip.  </li>
            <li>However other than the fact that it&#x27;s quiet, I don&#x27;t really care if a brush is lightweight or slim.  </li>
            <li>However other than the fact that it&#x27;s quiet, I don&#x27;t really care if a brush is lightweight or slim.  </li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s in the On mode, the Pulsonic vibrates in 4, 30 second intervals with a short stutter in between to let you know to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth for a complete 2 minute cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Featuring two cleaning modes: sensitive, and full-power, the Pulsonic makes a discernible difference in dental brightness with regular daily use... brightening teeth two shades in just one week&#x27;s time, in my case of twice daily use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps I have used the old Sonicare for so long that it has colored my view of how an electronic toothbrush should feel.  </li>
            <li>A charge lasts about 2-3 weeks, with 2x a day brushing for at least 90 seconds or if I&#x27;m not in a hurry, the full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have a few impacted teeth, and I didn&#x27;t think a sonic brush would make a difference, but it really does!  </li>
            <li>it works very well and has cut down on gum disease.</li>
            <li>This new Oral B Pulsonic seems to address two problems very well; ticklish gums and the second small pick like brush.  </li>
            <li>that I have one of them in my main home and the other at my beach house.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ergonomically, the handle is too narrow, kind of an awkward fit for a man&#x27;s hand once it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li>you may not get clean enough with a regular toothbrush head, this reaches back there nicely an is small enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>; This one, on the other hand, is quite nice looking, and is the size and approximate shape of a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Other thought: If you are still using manual toothbrushes, then i&#x27;d highly recommend switching to this one.</li>
            <li>I have used other Oral B power tooth brushes and found them to be of consistently high quality.</li>
            <li>If you want to try to mount it on ceramic tile with double-stick foam tape, the available area is about 1 inch tall and 1.75 inches wide, which seems on the small side.</li>
            <li>Colgate has a less intense baking soda toothpaste if you are not used to this type.</li>
            <li>I also thought this toothbrush was much quieter than previous electric toothbrushes we have owned.  </li>
            <li>As far as whitening, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve really seen anything</li>
            <li>Third issue is minor but to turn off unit you have to hit off twice to cycle pass the sensitive mode to the off mode.</li>
            <li>The cord from the charging stand is long enough to reach the plug near your sink basin.</li>
            <li>Like the thin profile too and brushes are easy to replace.</li>
            <li>I like the shape of the brush head as it is shaped like a small manual toothbrush rather than the round shape of most of the oral b electric toothbrushes.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had power toothbrushes in the past, more specifically--sonicare ones, and really disliked them.</li>
            <li>&quot; I would not recommend this product for anyone with large hands, previous or current hand injury or nerve damage, or any one with arthritis.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this impacts the efficiency of the brush, but it clearly feels weaker; the brush markedly slows down when applied.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive gums and teeth and the sensitive setting is perfect...there is little to no irritation.  </li>
            <li>The electric cord is about 4 feet long and there are slots on the back and both sides to direct the cord in 3 different directions.</li>
            <li>The size is almost same as regular brush, so I was not sure it would be powerful or not.</li>
            <li>Have not really seen a marked difference considering the price!  </li>
            <li>FoThe old Oral-B Sonic toothbrush heads do not fit the new handle.  </li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive gums there is the sensitive mode which is less abrasive.</li>
            <li>And with the combination of a sleek handle and bristle it&#x27;s easy to get behind the back molars!</li>
            <li>I apply a light to moderate amount of pressure, and have never found the brush to get bogged down.</li>
            <li>To remove the top you push down on a plastic tab, located at the rear of the base, and slide the top portion forward and lift off.  </li>

            <li>The toothbrush is not bad, but being lured into buying something and than refusing the rebate for very shady reasons does make this purchase a big NO NO.&lt;br /&gt;Why</li>
            <li>It is sized small, will fit in the ceramic toothbrush holder with other regular brushes!</li>
            <li>This model is very lightweight and takes up little space.</li>
            <li>Also it feels a little cheapy compared to Sonic care, and the vibration is a little more rough.</li>
            <li>Whenever I brush, I have to hold the main body and grab or push down the brush head part too.</li>
            <li>That being said, it feels a little weaker than the larger models I&#x27;ve used, but not so much that it doesn&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I called Oral-B support and they are not aware of any such problem but offered to send me a new brush head in the mail.</li>
            <li>Good, but a little clumsy and heavy, but durable.</li>
            <li>Oral-B has introduced a new, extremely slim, power toothbrush that is not much bigger than a traditional (manual) toothbrush.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and it works splendidly.  </li>
            <li> Thus, she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy, and I guess her dentist is happy.  </li>
            <li> I bought another one at Target and have been happy since.</li>
            <li> Plus with the mail in rebate going on, its a great buy.</li>

            <li> What a great product now</li>
            <li> The dentist thinks it&#x27;s doing a great job on my teeth &amp; gums.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is a great toothbrush.  </li>

            <li> I decided to try this toothbrush and am happy with my outcome.</li>
            <li> great deal</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for over a week which is great for travel.  </li>
            <li> I can sleep longer (while I stand at the sink, and let this rechargeable toothbrush do the work) - and this is a great thing, when you are up at 3 am for a feeding for your 10 month old.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I happily bought a replacement.</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning.</li>
            <li> This a great alternative to the bulkier, heavier electric toothbrushes.</li>

            <li> great toothbrush at a great price.</li>
            <li> It is great.</li>
            <li> Am I happy I took her advice.  </li>
            <li> I was using Oral-B CrossAction before, and I was totally happy with that product.</li>
            <li> The Precision Tip for the Pulsonic, however, has been great.</li>

            <li> This was a great toothbrush until it stopped working,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Works great.  </li>

            <li> This has been a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the massage gum feature is just great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great toothbrush if you are looking for the sonic type, I would choose this over any Sonicare lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Oral B Pulsonic is great.  </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is great.</li>
            <li> for the rest it works great..</li>
            <li> Great product no cavities, holds up to my mouth and the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> , it is quieter, slimmer built, just a great sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> oh yes, and of course, with freakishly happy with my Oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product, does the job 100%.</li>
            <li> hoping to get great report from dentist..</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and</li>
            <li> It provides great check ups every 6 months.</li>
            <li> serveral months, I swore off electric brushes until noticing this one for a great price since the Sonicare and Waterpik cost me $200 per at time of sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dentist was happy</li>
            <li> you braces, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!   </li>
            <li> I also find the timer a very handy feature.</li>
            <li> and I must say it is very nice.  </li>
            <li> very nice.     </li>
            <li> I drink a lot of tea and the Pulsonic is very effective on removing stains.  </li>
            <li> It gets VERY WARM.  </li>
            <li> A very light pressure works best.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing!</li>
            <li> Fairly minimalistic but works great.</li>
            <li> I bought another one and it looks great and does a good job cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> BTW, like the Sonicare, the Pulsonic can be used in the shower -- to quote the user manual -- \\&quot;without hesitation.\\&quot;  Nice!</li>
            <li> It works good great battery.</li>
            <li> Good good good!useful and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric tooth brush; I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush handles great, reaches just fine wherever needed, and perfectly balances in hand.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would choose anything over my Sonicare, but this toothbrush by Oral B was a pleasant surprise</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I get headaches, but not at all a pleasant experience for me.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts about 3 weeks after a good charge.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Pricewise, the Oral-B Pulsonic is a good bang for the buck.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a good price.    </li>
            <li> To be fair I haven&#x27;t tried to see what happens if I just keep using it without recharging it</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the money.  </li>
            <li> She just loved hers and ordered me to buy one too.  </li>
            <li> but otherwise he feels the cleaning is superior to brushing.</li>
            <li> Battery lift is good too.  </li>
            <li> I have some periodontal issues so this is a good sign for me.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> I have used the interplak and braun Oral B for years, but the level of cleaning I got was never as good at the gumline as it is with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-b products for years and knew they are a good product.  </li>
            <li> The product was good</li>
            <li> I decided to switch to this cheaper product, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to have this good of a quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect to get something that was this good.</li>
            <li> This was for a gift, and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> but it feels like it is doing a good job.</li>
            <li> My dentist says this is just as good of a brush as his</li>
            <li> It makes a good traveling companion for any road warrior.</li>
            <li> All in all, the price point for this power toothbrush is good.  </li>
            <li> it does a good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Good brush, recommended.</li>
            <li> and I find it a good value.</li>
            <li> In the instructions for good electric toothbrushes they tell you to hold the unit on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Purchase this product because it was inexpensive and because considered Pulsonic to be a good name.  </li>
            <li> This Oral-B is every bit as good, and the brush heads are quite a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> For the life of me, I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t make the rechargeable battery replaceable - A perfectly good toothbrush is being trashed because the battery died.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is good though.</li>
            <li> Good one.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> oh ya, it was a good deal as well.</li>
            <li> Have had for years and have always loved it.  </li>
            <li> but the Pulsonic is a good replacement, even though it&#x27;s not a rotary head brush.</li>
            <li> The 50% off program came at a good time for us too.</li>
            <li> all...not a good investment, would not recommend buying this item...</li>
            <li> Loved this product but stopped turning on after 1.5 years of owning.</li>
            <li> Ultimately a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush is good.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about $50 a year if you replace the brush every couple months or so...a good investment for oral hygiene in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the money.  </li>
            <li> , loved using anything electronic.</li>
            <li> Good quality as you can expect from Oral-B company.</li>
            <li> Also, it seems to be doing a good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Good vibration.</li>
            <li> Good item for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: if you can get this for a good price, go for it...</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> Good, effective toothbrush with a great price.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are incredibly clean, and the timer on it is great!  </li>
            <li> So all in all this is one very loyal Sonicare user (6 plus years) who is now sold on the Oral B Pulsonic!!</li>
            <li> I like the full brush head the best</li>
            <li> This is one of those perfect examples of technology making the world a much better place, as the ease of use, outstanding health and cosmetic benefits, and portability make the Pulsonic a toothbrush</li>

            <li> While other sonic toothbrushes tend to be somewhat bulkier, the Pulsonic is perfect for taking along when traveling, which is absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> BUT....I LOVE this one!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> there are much better toothbrushes on the market!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> he said I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Not as good as my older oral B but for the money, this is an excellent toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This was easy and they work great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slim, easy to use, and I have experienced none of the \\&quot;head loosening\\&quot; problems listed in some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is attractive and easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> The Pulsonic is easy to use and does a great job of cleaning around the gum line.</li>
            <li> We bought this one for our kids and it works great and is slimmer, so it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that delivers what it promises-clean, stain free teeth.</li>
            <li> That is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> And Its made in CHINA, SO AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Nice for the price.</li>
            <li> Really handy.</li>
            <li> their own brush head(s)</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about.</li>
            <li> Must be people who work for or own stock in Sonicare.     </li>
            <li> By the way, the Oral B cleans teeth on par with Sonicare, in my own opinion.</li>
            <li> so it fits nicely in the hand and,</li>
            <li> I have never been good at a disciplined approach to brushing, I find this might encourage developing some better habits.</li>
            <li> I have never been good at a disciplined approach to brushing, I find this might encourage developing some better habits.</li>
            <li> I find that they do good at what they should do, cleaning teeth, as my son has done better during his routine dental exams.  </li>
            <li> The precision head is good for floss-like cleaning and it makes me glad to have the gentler setting on the unit.  </li>
            <li> and I liked that one.  </li>
            <li> design of this Oral-B Pulsonic is quite nice.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t comment on how effective it is in cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> I liked the slim design and two speed options.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll just have to look at their sales numbers and figure it out on their own.    </li>
            <li> The best I could find at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush, although it broke after a year of use.</li>
            <li> my navy dentist said she liked it as well.</li>
            <li> So that is really nice to not have to keep the charger handy, can tuck it away until its needed.</li>
            <li> Nice feeling on gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> It is kind of like a dentist drill but</li>
            <li> When I got this brush, I was expecting a nice electric brush</li>
            <li> The timer function on the toothbrush is nice</li>
            <li> Braun&#x27;s own website has a form you MUST download to send the unit in for repair.  </li>
            <li> It does a nice job along the gumline.</li>
            <li> Nice and slim and compact.</li>
            <li> Lightweight Slim Handle Provides Effective Maneuverability and Control&lt;</li>
            <li> This form of tactile feedback is quite effective in keeping the user informed as to the status of their brushing session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Precision Tip brush head is handy for cleaning between teeth and around dental work</li>
            <li> - Easy to use and clean  - Perfect size for travel  - Precision Tip brush head is handy for cleaning between teeth and around dental work  </li>
            <li> nice whan one travels</li>
            <li> I should also mention I didn&#x27;t put any real effort into caring for it the best way.</li>
            <li> This is an okay brush but not as good as the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I paid twice the amount for my own in shanghai and couldn&#x27;t believe it when I saw this one here</li>
            <li> To me that suggests that the Pulsonic&#x27;s vibrations aren&#x27;t as effective as the Sonicare Flexcare.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;timer\\&quot; feature is great and is very useful.  </li>
            <li> I have had great electric toothbrushes that help me keep my lower teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> Great product...makes your teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> dentist recommended i buy one, this one is great, makes my mouth fell dentist office clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it uses fairly easy to find replacement brushes at Walmart or Walgreens, I can keep it until it stops and get my best money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I am very happy they replaced my defective unit with an entirely new one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the most important thing is that it removed my dental calculus.&lt;br /&gt;i am really happy to see that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The toothbrushes do work great though, and despite our now degraded opinion of Amazon rebates etc, we are happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> Sleek design, easy to use, good value at a budget price.</li>
            <li> I would say that overall, it&#x27;s a good to excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li> I love the Pulsonic so much that I would consider it to be a perfect gift for the person who has everything...</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I both own this toothbrush and it is by far the best bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li> A super brush backed by dental associations and dentists who know teeth and a quality product to ensure great oral hygiene health..</li>
            <li> It seems to do a good job at cleaning and the head interchange easily.</li>
            <li> Very easy to charge.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use with one button.</li>
            <li> My wife has gum problems that demand very excellent care, thus the need for frequent dental cleaning, flossing, and brushing.</li>
            <li> The pulsing action is now considered to be the best way to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Used the Sonicare for many years and liked it, but the housing was stained and it was time to go bye</li>
            <li> but so far I have been very happy.      </li>
            <li> Lacks cover - many units do not offer a brush cover, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option</li>
            <li> I have not owned a professional sonic toothbrush before, and have to say I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, has a sleek design and really good value.  </li>
            <li> Great and powerful sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Gums can really benefit from a good massage, so anyone whose gums and teeth are in fairly good condition can help maintain and improve their dental health, rather than see the kind of decline that might otherwise occur with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with how easy to use and fast this brush is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this toothbrush works great, the price is right, but it does take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> easily~!  </li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s still going strong!  </li>
            <li> My dentist is happy and I am happy, at last.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands, and I liked this one the most even over my Sonic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, sturdy, attractive, and has great features like 2 speeds and a timer that lets you know when to move on to a different quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> My teeth stay nice and clean throughout the day, and my wife seems really happy with her teeth staying clean.  </li>
            <li> at first it seems to work great</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good electric toothbrush that will keep your teeth healthy and clean, but don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money I would recommend the Pulsonic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ¼ turn quick release, and this is great for cleaning and sanitizing, but it seems to pop off in the mouth rather easily.</li>
            <li> It is very fortunate that it comes with a 2 year warranty.  </li>
            <li> The two speed mode is nice and easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and compact, very easy to use, cleans better than a manual toothbrush, great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I liked it fine.  </li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to use, the head size and shape is great and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> The price makes this ultra sonic brush even better.  </li>
            <li> and all was ok.  </li>
            <li> I love the sleek skinny design.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ll give it a try.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love its size....</li>
            <li> My dad likes the brush and ever since I gifted this to him he has started with his night time brush routine all over again...</li>
            <li> I will see how many months this keeps up....</li>
            <li> This sonic toothbrush is so much better for your teeth and gums than a regular electric toothbrush (which I always thought of as one of the best inventions).</li>
            <li> You will find that even your dentist and dental hygienist will be able to see the difference.</li>
            <li> But you won&#x27;t be able to find a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It will be more consumer preference on design that motivates the purchase.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much better than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> If you have 2 or more people in the house that want to share the toothbrush and have</li>
            <li> If you want a toothbrush that does a better job keeping your gums in top shape, then I&#x27;d recommend the Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the Pulsonic for maybe 6-7 weeks prior to the dentist visit and my gums are in the best shape they&#x27;ve been in in years.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the Pulsonic for maybe 6-7 weeks prior to the dentist visit and my gums are in the best shape they&#x27;ve been in in years.  </li>
            <li> In addition, most people with manual brushes spend about 20 seconds</li>
            <li> The Pulsonic isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; toothbrush, but it&#x27;s definitely not the best I&#x27;ve used, and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s priced appropriately for its function.  </li>
            <li> This is very convenient and a great way to ensure a thorough clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and it really does a great job.</li>
            <li> But this one performs much better in every aspect.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have mostly used manual toothbrushes probably for most of my 45 years.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush because I have been pleased with every Oral-B appliance I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> It is used just like a manual toothbrush, but it cleans teeth much better.  </li>
            <li> I really love the pic - my teeth never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and then bought two more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> quality is OK.</li>
            <li> so that makes this one all the better.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> So your price is %25 more than you think.</li>
            <li> Too many days in the shower and humidity built up inside.  </li>
            <li> I compare it to using a pencil compared to a magic marker which resembles the others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> More aggressive than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t get misled by all the rave reviews, save your money and wait for better one to come out or go buy one</li>
            <li> Better portability</li>
            <li> and was quite pleased by the pulsing sensation and the way it made my teeth feel/</li>
            <li> If I had it to do over though, I would probably spend more money and buy the Sonicare again.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Sure, it vibrates and scrubs, but I don&#x27;t detect that sonic pulse implied by the name</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth, all the spaces and surfaces, better than any toothbrush I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this would message and vibrate (occuring in brush head) whatever off your teeth,   </li>
            <li> but, if your dental setup is many caps, what is that doing to that glue?  </li>
            <li> save your receipt or they may be able to check the serial</li>
            <li> , i love it, it is inexpensive and does the job.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what bar-code I was supposed to save or the Proof of Purchase.</li>
            <li> I did not want a bulky brush, but instead something more sleek and stylish.  </li>
            <li> I am thoroughly satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> After a week of using I was able to move up to the strongest setting as I&#x27;m O.C.D when it comes to keeping my teeth</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy again, I&#x27;m just no overly impressed when comparing it with something like a $20 Spinbrush/Vitality</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would like to address the issue many are having with the head coming off during use.  </li>
            <li> I still love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> It cleans a million times better and has even cleaned coffee stains off leaving my teeth whiter.  </li>
            <li> I love the timer that lets</li>
            <li> The brush on this is more like the manual toothbrush that I grew up with - not the spin type of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> working problem free!</li>
            <li> Try not to drool, OK?</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I also purchased one for myself and have been completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d like to think of it as more of a 4.25 rating, are the cost of replacement heads, and the issue with one of the units coming apart and being unusable in a way I did not feel it should have.  </li>
            <li> If replacement heads were more in the $3 - $4 range, I see this as a better value.  </li>
            <li> However, you do get what you pay for, and if you are will to pay a bit more, better brushes are out there.</li>
            <li> i would consider to place more orders.  </li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The Pulsonic cleans deeper and better than any manual or power brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Really pleased with this purchase, cheapest price I could find when compared to competitor retail stores.  </li>
            <li> this Oral-B Pulsonic will more than suffice.  </li>
            <li> 50% coupon makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I thought it was okay, until I tried this one.</li>
            <li> -just make sure you charge it for 12 hours before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am incredibly pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush cleans my teeth better than any brush I have used before.  </li>
            <li> My teeth/gums have never felt better.  </li>
            <li> This is quite simply the best toothbrush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> What more can be said.</li>
            <li> I find I brush longer now and pay more attention to each area because I know I will be reminded when it is time to change areas.  </li>
            <li> I have used a smaller toothbrush for years and found this one to be a perfect size brush as well as</li>
            <li> I vowed not to give them any more of my business, if I could avoid it.     </li>
            <li> I eventually got used to it and was quite satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been flossing that regularly, but I got the best checkup ever!  </li>
            <li> The reasons being that it was better than the Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li> I started to brush the bottom teeth for two pulses, then start brushing the top teeth.</li>
            <li> No one touching my tooth brush</li>
            <li> The Pulsonic Sonic is better.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how this toothbrush would perform.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush removes plaque more than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need spend more for traveling package because everything are compact already.</li>
            <li> It works ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for healthy gum/teeth treatment, I recommend Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> You can pay more and get more (both features and power).  </li>
            <li> HOW MUCH BETTER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> It was $12 more than the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li> Very compact and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Bought this when there was a manufacturer rebate which made this an even better deal.</li>
            <li> We love this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Seems more sanitary to cover the bristles of a toothbrush that lives in the bathroom</li>
            <li> Also, the 5-dollar battery operated one would be better because of the design flaw that this one has.  </li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush the charge holds up for a week or so</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with the toothbrush and look forward to many years of use.</li>
            <li> Been using for about 4 weeks now, and love it.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> well and glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Very slim, and great for travellers - since it saves space.</li>
            <li> I love it and</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Makes dental checkups much more pleasurable.  </li>
            <li> I like this one better.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I upgraded to the triumph model, my dentist visits have been enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> I love this Oral B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li> your head when brushing the top teeth.  </li>
            <li> The battery is replaceable, but I do not know where you would be able to purchase one.  </li>
            <li> The brushes detach easily if more than one person uses the motor section.  </li>
            <li> The overall feel, quality, and weight of the product is excellent.  </li>
            <li> Our family have been using this product for more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> Pulsonic replacement brushes are more affordable than most, which was one of the factors into my purchase decision.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the size of the brush handle and the charging unit.  </li>
            <li> However, I am sure not everyone has the time to go through their returns process, thus 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cavity free since! :)</li>
            <li> I saw this Pulsonic brush and had read some of the reviews but wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me, but I decided to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> What more can I say ?</li>
            <li> I have been using this sonic toothbrush for 3 weeks now and I am extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> but I had to send most of that</li>
            <li> and I love the atachment for cleaning between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had electric toothbrushes before but this one seems to work on my gums better thus keeping gingivitis at bay.</li>
            <li> Also does a better job on whitening the teeth.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite affordable sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But I wanted something more compact.  </li>
            <li> This fits the bill and cleans teeth way better.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s particularly impressive since this thing is quite a bit smaller.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> An excellent product, especially for those of us with bridges.</li>
            <li> Also, outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li> In terms of this against a manual brush, I can say this seems to work much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a ploy to make you have to buy more brush replacements than you otherwise would have to.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The top portion of the handle can be rinsed under running water, but it is not recommended to run water over the lower, controller portion of the handle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall we are quite pleased with the Pulsonic Power Toothbrush by Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> Most people have their toothbrushes in the bathroom, and I don&#x27;t think anyone would want their brush heads uncovered and fully exposed in that environment.  </li>
            <li> Most people have their toothbrushes in the bathroom, and I don&#x27;t think anyone would want their brush heads uncovered and fully exposed in that environment.  </li>
            <li> I love my buy.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral-B Pulsonic.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel and look better.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is OK, but the replacement heads....</li>
            <li> My son does a better job brushing now.</li>
            <li> Most electric toothbrushes are bulky and this is one isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t come off accidentally any more.</li>
            <li> I love this piece.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much better my trips to the dentist are after using this type of toothbrush for over 5 years.  </li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been able to find one by another company that fits this toothbrush (</li>
            <li> I am a coffee drinker and red wine drinker and while my oral hygiene is good, this toothbrush has made my smile GREAT!.</li>
            <li> these work better than brushing with a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied as I feel</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of that G.U.M didn&#x27;t respond to emails stating that faulty replacement tips are being sold on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for traveling as it is very compact.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to check if your brushes being recommended are correct.</li>
            <li> For patients who like to  have a brush with them during the day, this slim, light, professional quality brush is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the streamline shape.</li>
            <li> I have traveled all over the world with this and most trips</li>
            <li> We Love it</li>
            <li> We have a camper and wanted this item for our weekend trips love it</li>
            <li> Well this is the electric toothbrush I just wrote about when writing aout the replacement brushes four more words required</li>
            <li> if this matters but my dentist said i was doing the best i possibly could with a toothbrush</li>
            <li> think if you&#x27;re reading this you know that electronic toothbrushes are probably much better than manual toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for travel for many years</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I use my Sonicare at home when I want a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> even after the $20 rebate I was able to get.</li>
            <li> I had the most plaque/cavity problems.  </li>
            <li> Everything you would expect and more.</li>
            <li> I bought my Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush 2.5 years ago and was pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li> prefer the smaller handle brushes, so the size was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> you should be pleased.</li>
            <li> I love the two speeds and two minute timer.</li>
            <li> Outstanding purchase.  </li>
            <li> works well, came on time and in general I think it is a good product with a great easy way to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, that I decided to get one for mom, too!!!</li>
            <li> a very powerful and effective tooth cleaner in a compact package.  </li>
            <li> I was less than impressed with the performance of this one, though the slim-line design of the brush was very appealing.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel nice and clean and I look forward to brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> SO FAR IS GREAT AND THE PRICE CERTAINLY WAS GREAT.</li>
            <li> It wonderful to have a quiet, non-bulky electric brush that&#x27;s easy to travel</li>
            <li> and my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light, and could easily tip over.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Thanks for bringing us this amazing product amazon!</li>
            <li> That said, the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great deal more efficient than the old \\&quot;analog\\&quot; toothbrushes most of us grew up with.  </li>
            <li> Oral B did a pretty good job of ripping off the Sonicare technology.  </li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job brushing.</li>
            <li> Pretty good electric toothbrush for the money.</li>
            <li> At first I loved it, my dental check-ups were improving drastically.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush and it seemed to do a good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited ordering an electric toothbrush that&#x27;ll finally make my dentist proud :P, and get the job done!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty great deal when more powerful tooth-cleaning systems can cost more than $200.  </li>
            <li> The new Sonic works great.</li>
            <li> Slimmer sizer and lighter... cleans great and love the sensitive mode.</li>
            <li> I love the size/weight of this item - can easily be packed for travel.  </li>
            <li> It has one strong redeeming feature -- the precision tip</li>
            <li> -- the brush part twists off so easily that it came off twice while I was using it, and it vibrates your hand more than in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and its not bulky so easy to use and maneuver.  </li>
            <li> Unit is easy to clean,we love it.</li>
            <li> Compared to Sonicare&#x27;s top of the line, the Pulsonic is not as strong in terms of vibration and its not as well made.  </li>
            <li> it is the TIPS of the bristles that clean , so a LIGHT PRESSURE is the most effective  with EVERY brush.  </li>
            <li> best available rechargeable power toothbrush in the market in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> great brush and very slim design but not too light in weight.  </li>
            <li> Majority of vine reviewers are restlessly putting the product rating at 5 stars where as non-vine reviewers sound more pragmatic and truthful about the product ?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched from the Sonicare Intelliclean and I&#x27;m impressed with both the size, the light weight as well as its cleaning performance.</li>
            <li> it has all the basic features required for a good powered brush &amp; its  rechargeable &amp; good for travel</li>
            <li> It was a good for my budget and had positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for me for many years.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush makes my teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li> This is very convenient and a great way to ensure a thorough clean.    </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to mainly use as a travel toothbrush because of so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> The clean smooth feeling this leaves is amazing.</li>
            <li> Overall a great purchase experience and a very good product so far.  </li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] is a very powerful brush, although not a sonic brush, does an effective job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> and I have found the slower speed to be the most comfortable for myself.  </li>
            <li> I used my wife&#x27;s Triumph OralB which rotates and is MUCH more comfortable.</li>
            <li> especially love the 30 second timer feature, which allows me to daydream while brushing, yet still ensure that I&#x27;m brushing each quadrant of my mouth for a full 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> love the Pulsonic so much that I would consider it to be a perfect gift for the person who has everything... provided their teeth and gums are not already so sensitive that sonic toothbrushes would be out of the question.</li>
            <li> I may just keep my old faithful Sonicare, which may be homely but has worked great for about 7 years.</li>
            <li> This is certainly better than manual brushing however the better brushes by oral b like the triumph series are far superior.  </li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush so far.  </li>
            <li> The brush head has been safe and secure with no evidence that it could come off as some report.  </li>
            <li> The sensitive mode is great if you don&#x27;t want the feeling of a Jack hammer inside your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Great feel in my hand, lighter than my old sonicare from years ago</li>
            <li> has great work to make tooth clear and white,So I will buy it again .</li>
            <li> the sensitive setting is a great bonus.  </li>
            <li> To better clean the top portion of the toothbrush handle, you can easily remove the brush head attachment by turning the head counter-clockwise (about 1/4 turn) and lifting it off the handle.  </li>
            <li> These wear out faster than the free toothbrush the dentist give out and yet cost more than the &amp;#34;Super toothbrush 2000 with color changing flex bristles&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But boy do I absolutely LOVE the precise tip brush to get in between my braces.</li>
            <li> It never did a great cleaning like my old Sonicare did and during the time I owned it</li>
            <li> This is a good product for someone who wants the benefits of an electric brush but does not want to/cannot pay $150-$200</li>
            <li> you know how much time to spend on each quadrant of your mouth, it looks sleek, not bulky, good movement on the brush head.</li>
            <li> This was much cheaper and was from a good oral care company.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and slim handle is more comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li> Works great, just as good as the previous generation Oral-B Sonic Toothbrush, which died after approx.</li>
            <li> Nice and light and charges quickly between uses.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own right.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled to learn that he had purchased this in the States, I purchased it right away.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace brush head and put on gum tool, which is easy to use and really does a good job on gums.</li>
            <li> Easier to clean and very light and easy to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slim and easy to hold and the brush head is the right size, fits in my mouth nicely, and I like the way it cleans.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean and smooth after brushing    Cons:  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and decided this brush would be best for me based on other reviews, the price, and the style.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it really is a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush, as it has a better to clean my teeth with its Pulsonic system.</li>
            <li> Love how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> The design of the brush makes it easy to reach everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Is it easy to use?</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Charger/dock is flimsy, your toothbrush can easily be bumped over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle and head is slender and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> After all...it is all about getting your teeth clean and maintaining a healthy mouth, which is what this toothbrush is doing for me.  </li>
            <li> Cleans up easily after use without having gaps/spaces to cause unsanitary build-up.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m traveling, the unit and charger are easy to bring along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to place order.  </li>
            <li> easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I love how clean my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> The handle is slim so is easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li> I like the compact design and the fact that it&#x27;s easy to pack for a vacation.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and there were no issues with it.</li>
            <li> The biggest drawback is that the head unlocks too easily.  </li>
            <li> The head rotates on easily, and has a bit of a detent to keep it in position, but it rotates out of the supposedly locked position while brushing.  </li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping well worth the price</li>
            <li> Most importantly: it is  easy to clean...</li>
            <li> and I find the Pulsonic to be as powerful and easy to use, but in a much more elegant package.  </li>
            <li> While I agree with those who would like to have a travel case, this brush fits easily into a plastic sandwich bag.  </li>
            <li> Cleans up easily with just a rinse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and I like</li>
            <li> They easily come on and off the toothbrush without falling off while your brushing.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it is easy to get all the toothpaste residue off the brush and handle</li>
            <li> easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I love it and it keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I recommend this Oral-B as a good choice, but I wish the timing feature was more clear.</li>
            <li> I like the compact diameter, easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s lightweight &amp; easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are still going strong.</li>
            <li> It pulses quite strongly to create a vibration effect that along with your hand movement cleans your teeth.  </li>
            <li> This thing has been going strong, the toothbrush, the batteries, and it keeps my teeth spotless.  </li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s is still going strong.</li>
            <li> we used phillips dual action brushes for years and loved them, The sonic brushes move faster and seem to penetrate the gaps between your teeth even better.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend the Perio-Aid No.2 or Perio-Aid</li>
            <li> When I used less pressue the brush head stayed on perfectly and my teeth are soooooo clean!</li>
            <li> but that is true of most electric brushes.</li>
            <li> Battary life is impressive too - good enough that I only take out charger once a week for an overnight charge.  </li>
            <li> I am no expert on this type of tooth brush, but I can tell you my impression of the first of this kind I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Electric brushing is supposed to be fun and easy!  </li>
            <li> And our last checkup at the dentist&#x27;s office confirmed that the brushing was very effective in keeping the teeth and gum healthy.</li>
            <li> It cleans as well as some of the higher end ones at a better price, and is the most portable unit I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> the Oral B Pulsonic worked fine for about 2 months....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously owned nothing but Crest and Oral-B Spin Brush electric tooth brushes which by the way worked wonderfully</li>
            <li> It worked just fine</li>
            <li> A toothbrush should be light, and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> I typically get the bottom of the Sonicare line and have been very happy with the results and ease of use.</li>
            <li> perfectly fine.    </li>
            <li> The head stays on, charges fine.</li>
            <li> It cleans well, and is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Arrived in super lightning time !  </li>
            <li> cleans all surfaces very well,  very quickly because of no need for my own maneuvering, which I was over doing.  </li>
            <li> Seems kind of odd since its size makes it a great travel power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very light and powerful.  </li>
            <li> The best toothbrush I found so far, small, light, works great and</li>
            <li> Huge buyers remorse....</li>
            <li> Like a huge mosquito.  </li>
            <li> so it does not feel like a huge electric brush in your mouth and it pops in and out of the charging stand with ease.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, the last one I had lasted about 2 years before the battery in it died.</li>
            <li> It does a fabulous job of cleaning my teeth, and it holds a charge for weeks and weeks.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for its light weight when traveling in Europe, also</li>
            <li> It would be nice if Amazon gave this much info (eg voltage specifications) but they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The body is thinner, easy to clean, does not accumulate gunk anymore and battery life has been doubled.</li>
            <li> Really bizarre.    </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s stuttering on its own</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the 30-second reminders, but the overall 2-minute timer is great.</li>
            <li> It is slim and light weight</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money, and much better than some of those over priced $200 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> , so it is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> It was comfortable to hold and use, and cleaned well.</li>
            <li> Since the Ultrasonex is no longer available</li>
            <li> And free shipping.  </li>
            <li> : I received a free sample to review but was not paid nor otherwise compensated for the review.</li>
            <li> It is also quite easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slim, light, and</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this great toothbrush from OralB.  </li>
            <li> I had one of those cheap oral b toothbruses for like $12, but now I am seeing the light.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spinning kind really chewed up my gums.</li>
            <li> This one was quite comfortable to use, save for a bit of a tickle in my jaw from the vibrations.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> two different speeds are great, and everything but the electric part of the stand is waterproof.</li>
            <li> I started having periodontal issues and my hygenist suggested I replace my cheap &#x27;spin brush&#x27; with this.  </li>
            <li> Your gum health is worth more than that.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a great value given its low price.</li>
            <li> Both of them had the UV light to sterilize the toothbrush head, and they cost around $100 for each system.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember what I paid for this, but it was really cheap.</li>
            <li> Do vine reviewers do this in fear of loosing the free products in their mail box or what ?</li>
            <li> So, after reading every review available, I purchased this one, the Oral-B Pulsonic Power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The brush is really comfortable for use and handle.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush is great for cleaning between teeth and along the gum lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the sonic 4100, the oral-b spinning head and the sonic advanced.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a month now and enjoy using it a lot.  </li>
            <li> really enjoy the timer feature (pulses every 30 seconds to tell you to change regions)</li>
            <li> This Oral B not so, its fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i plug it into a working outlet and it doesn&#x27;t light up</li>
            <li> Was so happy that they still make them as I recently lost mine</li>
            <li> Not to mention the mail-in rebate that was available when I purchased - now expired but check the Oral-B website to see if there is anything</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> The unit is slim, well designed, and light weight which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> it was quite a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much</li>
            <li> I got this as a lightning deal with a mail in rebate that made it so cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;Power button feels cheap</li>
            <li> It was a nicely designed and it cleaned very well</li>
            <li> It is also great that it can be left on the charger with no worries of overcharging.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold and is well balanced</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> I was told all Oral B heads would fit.</li>
            <li> We brought two and enjoy them</li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> I like the size and the fit in my hand.</li>
            <li> She said I was doing a great job above the gum line</li>
            <li> plastic feels cheap</li>
            <li> and I figured if I&#x27;m going to buy another electric toothbrush, I&#x27;ll go for one that&#x27;s worth it and from a top brand.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B Sonic Complete before which I loved  --</li>
            <li> It has a soft brush that does a good job on the lowest setting however</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> I received this electronic toothbrush as a gift, and good timing because my old Sonicare wasn&#x27;t holding it&#x27;s charge</li>
            <li> I own the Sonic Complete and while the toothbrush functions okay, the issue is the battery.</li>
            <li> nice slim brush- replace my old Oral B electric toothbrush which I had for many years and never had any problems with it till now.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an old Oral-B electric toothbrush, which I loved.</li>
            <li> The bleeding from my gums has subsided, I feel a good massaging and thereby strengthening effect from the soft setting in the brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty good so far.</li>
            <li> so far, so good.</li>
            <li> The first one was for myself and I loved it so much that I bought more as gifts for my boyfriend and also for my super picky mother.</li>
            <li> My son has an easy gag reflex and this is the first brush that helps him brush more and longer.  </li>
            <li> this did a better job right off</li>
            <li> sure you get the right one.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it right out of the box</li>
            <li> My mother, who rarely likes or uses gifts that I have bought her, told me that her teeth feel so clean and healthy and that her teeth felt as smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple but very effective way to improve your oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very useful and beneficial to health.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and take apart, I store the brush head in the drawer to keep it clean from bathroom usage.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who likes a clean, healthy mouth!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean and smooth and look shiny.</li>
            <li> Light is on toothbrush but no vibrating-the bottom charger is clean and the tooth brush should be connecting and charging.</li>
            <li> super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> small attachments fit perfect</li>
            <li> The charger is very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take much space.  </li>
            <li> It is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> It does a good job, but if you really want that &#x27;just came from the dentist&#x27; clean, then the Sonicare would be my recommendation, even at the higher price point.  </li>
            <li> The price is at the lower end of the sonic brush range (counterintuitive to a newly introduced, more compact design) and the replacement brush heads come in a three pack that makes them more affordable as well.  </li>
            <li> original review from 2010:&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> i got a full free replacement.</li>
            <li> All in all I am VERY pleased with the Pulsonic and look forward to years of using it since my old Oral B lasted forever...</li>
            <li> I have used electric toothbrush for many years, but this is the first sonic toothbrush I have used.</li>
            <li> It is seems to be made better and is higher quality.</li>
            <li> Precision Tip does a fabulous job of cleaning these areas in a way a full size brush head</li>
            <li> I used a Sonicare toothbrush for 2 years before switching to an Oral-B Triumph, so I&#x27;m familiar with these types of sonic toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the brush head vibrates significantly and loosens plaque, I find I&#x27;m having to perform the laborious back-and-forth to the extent that I do with a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> This year I opted to try the Oral B Pulsonic and so far am VERY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> Enclosed with their denial letter are copies of the original form and the invoice I sent.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush, however, I got it with a rebate to send in, and they refused my rebate money because they said I didn&#x27;t send in the original UPC.</li>
            <li> , I think this has improved my brushing habits significantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure something just popped</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t so sure as you brush in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> There may be better ones out there, but I bet it would be at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few days I kind of enjoyed it and really liked that it had a timer that would make it pause after 30 seconds so that you knew when to switch areas in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There hasn&#x27;t been any significant difference.</li>
            <li> I feel like my smile is whiter already!</li>
            <li> This small handled rechargeable toothbrush is awesome.</li>
            <li> The original still works, however does not turn off.</li>
            <li> Worth my money!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it.</li>
            <li> the first lasted almost 3 years and not a bad price at all!!</li>
            <li> The older model was good to go from the first use on ANY setting.</li>
            <li> It certainly could be better in the fit and finish department.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is gentle, easy to use, and my teeth feel as if I have just had a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li> It vibrates at a pretty high frequency which I wasn&#x27;t expect, but it seems to do a good job</li>
            <li> Both of these being used through the year keep my teeth clean as a whistle...</li>
            <li> how well the brush cleans and 2) how clean the brush stays.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> the recommended 2 minutes of brushing to feel really clean teeth.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush does not wrap around my teeth to fully clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t spin or scrub like an el cheapo Crest/Oral-B Spinbrush/Vitality dual clean does.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is clean, neat to use and to recharge.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel dentist clean every time.</li>
            <li> -B knows what&#x27;s they&#x27;re doing with their Sonic brushes, and, like the others, this one leaves your mouth clean and tingly.</li>
            <li> I was just at the Dentist and received a clean bill of health.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it doesn&#x27;t quite clean as well as the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> My teeth didn&#x27;t feel quite as clean</li>
            <li> I like the slim design, and it seems to clean the teeth well.</li>
            <li> No biggie though, it&#x27;s pretty easy to become acclimated to that system quickly!</li>
            <li> It has the regular vibration motion and the sensitive vibration motion that is perfect for people with sensitives teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Also it let you know the time that you need to clean each quadrant of your teeth and the minimun two minutes to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> It also gets your teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and my gums stimulated.</li>
            <li> When I am done my teeth feel so clean,</li>
            <li> It cleans well and leave my mouth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and it keeps my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> Oh, it makes my teeth feel really clean, too.</li>
            <li> It appears to clean well, as my teeth feel clean, and look clean; but I can&#x27;t say that they appear whiter.  </li>
            <li> Makes your teeth feel SO clean.  </li>
            <li> Does not compare to a Sonicare, my teeth don&#x27;t feel clean at all.</li>
            <li> an my teeth felt so clean.</li>
            <li> The brush works well, but I do prefer to use my [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> I have always after brushing with tooth paste then redo with just a clean brush.</li>
            <li> Says his mouth has never felt so clean and</li>
            <li> We also have the Diamond clean from Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> and it gets my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> You mouth feels so clean.  </li>
            <li> but my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they do with a rotary head electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> But if you looking for a quick cheap sonic toothbrush then this will get the job done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the stronger setting much and feel more comfortable with the softer one.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth and gums clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even give me that clean glossy feel like the Crest spinbrush</li>
            <li> I have, though, and it doesn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean in three minutes as my Sonicare does in two.</li>
            <li> We switched from Oral-B&#x27;s high end spin brush to the sonic types, much better results and easy on the gums.  </li>
            <li> I think that I may have a defective brush after reading many of the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li> I liked the look of this toothbrush and it traveled well but was very upset that it just died right after the warranty ended.  </li>
            <li> I attribute much of my good gum health and white, tartar free teeth above the gum line to my good brushing habits</li>
            <li> The motor on it is strong and the vibrations kick just right.     </li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great product at a pretty good price, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is light small shape and very effective brushing and cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is nothing special.</li>
            <li> and it does a great job, holds a charge for a week, very light and small</li>
            <li> The older model fit better in the hand.  </li>
            <li> This my first time to use a electric tooth brush, my teeth have never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> It is slim and light, but you really feel like you got your teeth clean after two minutes with this baby!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt such an amazing clean from a toothbrush before!</li>
            <li> Powerful, slick and it would be perfect for travelling if the charger was AUTOVOLTAGE!  </li>
            <li> All the surfaces of the brush are smooth and easy to clean and to stress the point again, it looks very \\&quot;natural,\\&quot; and not at all clunky, sitting on my counter.     </li>
            <li> setup is nice too: the charger is a bit better than the prior ones and there is a flossing tip that is useful.</li>
            <li> I got it wanting to use it for travel for it&#x27;s size,which by the way it is perfect for but found that it would actually make a really nice everyday brush.    </li>
            <li> I also got a good deal through Amazon, for a total of just $33 after the rebate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that kind of effect with the Professional model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is much lighter and more toothbrush-like.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush as a replacement to my beloved Braun - after 10 years, it finally stopped holding a charge.  </li>
            <li> Much lighter and more compact than the competition.  </li>
            <li> will go back to Sonicare, which gave good service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Longer battery life would make me give it 5 stars, but a full 12 hr charge will give you couple days use.</li>
            <li> Timer makes you adequately brush and my teeth are still as clean as the day I went to the dentist (over a month now).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also relatively portable, so good for travel too, though you&#x27;ll need to bring the charger along for longer</li>
            <li> /&gt;Toothbrush size is good for my smaller mouth&lt;br /&gt;Price paid at retail store ($38)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured I would try to by a similar product since it was so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are three settings, they really do nothing more than change the strength of the vibration.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really grown to love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> BUT, my favorite feature is the gentle mode</li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> but, 2 different dentist both told me how good my mouth looked after I started using it.</li>
            <li> My Sonic Complete comes with two of one kind of head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do my toothbrushing very routinely twice a day, replace my toothbrush every 3 months and thought there is nothing better than my old-fashioned toothbrush and me to fight cavity.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much lighter and more compact than the rotating head electrics from oral-b.  </li>
            <li> i cant recommend it more highly!</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t do such a good job, this would have been the deal breaker, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> This one comes at you full speed from day one - all guns blazing.</li>
            <li> It really cleans much much much better than the Orbal-b.  </li>
            <li> It took me a week to get used to that, but after a week, I can only say good about this product.  </li>
            <li> the sonicare is a much better product and gets my teeth much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I had the Oral-B Sonic Complete model and liked it, but after 4 years the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge any longer</li>
            <li> By changing the way I brush my teeth (not as much pressure and allowing the brush to do most of the work), it began to meet my performance expectations.</li>
            <li> I love the look and feel of the toothbrush works really well</li>
            <li> There is a lot of vibration in the handle but overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> very good,I love it .It</li>
            <li> * Provides Gentle Sonic Vibration - More than 27,000 Vibrations per Minute&lt;br</li>
            <li> After putting it through a full charge, I was eager to try it out.</li>
            <li> really get the job done, Love it</li>
            <li> , more compact and shape is much easier to use.</li>
            <li> Then again recently for good.</li>
            <li> any more after 6 straight years of loyal cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most Oral-B electric brushes that oscillate at super fast rates to the point where the brush heads look like they&#x27;re spinning, the Oral-B Pulsonic&#x27;s motions are more akin to Sonicare brushes which vibrate at super fast rates.</li>
            <li> This can easily be seen from the packaging before you even take the product home (the packaging by the way was uncluttered, easy to open and very visually appealing).  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.. the price was better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately when I used it that it seemed to get my teeth cleaner than the sonicare as evidenced by little bits of grime the sonicare had never been able to get, this thing grasped with ease and afterwards my teeth felt a good deal cleaner as well.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, and I highly recommend the Oral-B toothbrushes in general.  </li>
            <li> It does a great joband I can honestly say with the sonic care I could feel light tartar after brushing, so i would use a regular toothbrush every other brushing.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;It is well worth the money and even my dentist has commented on how clean my teeth and gums are.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It will make your teeth feel fresh and clean as never before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although not as powerful, I felt it easily clean just as well.  </li>
            <li> seems so quick</li>
            <li> Oral-B has come up with a worthy challenger to the Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and models, and have always found that Oral-B makes the best.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased this toothbrush to replace a older Sonicare, and I like it much better for me.</li>
            <li> is size that&#x27;s a lot more manageable than most of its competitors and a price that&#x27;s similarly slim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, but it is nice to know it is available if I need it.  </li>
            <li> Came in 1 day even with the super saver shipping.</li>
            <li> so you know what an adequate brushing time is.</li>
            <li> Well, after using this thing for two weeks, I caved and went back to the sonicare and love it so much better.  </li>
            <li> We had the older Oral B model but love the pulsonic.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly since I needed it for a trip.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are so much cleaner and whiter; I actually look forward to going to the dentist to get a great check up.</li>
            <li> Mild disinfecting cleansers can be applied to the handle portion without damage, but over time the printed text/logos will fade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no dentist, ,so maybe the Sonicare is overkill and the Pulsonic is adequate.</li>
            <li> Replaces older Sonic model which died after many years.</li>
            <li> the interchangeable heads, for brushing between the teeth &amp; gum line are quick to change.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating action is more than my old one, but love it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive it and tried it right way.</li>
            <li> Light weight, easy to handle, large toothbrush head, Extra precision head, good battery life, and large brush</li>
            <li> Well, on this trip the dentist said my teeth were immaculate and my gums and pockets were all within normal, healthy scoring ranges on the scale they use to rate gum disease progression.  </li>
            <li> I find normal is probably better to use, it tickles quite a</li>
            <li> I tried it, I use it twice a day, &amp; I like it very much!</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it meant that it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I especially like the way it &amp;#34;massages&amp;#34; my gums, which is very healthy for them.  </li>
            <li> First, I like that it is slim and light.</li>
            <li> Oral-B has a good feel to it, natural and well-balanced, and that makes me more likely to pick it up instead of a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; brush.</li>
            <li> works great, small, fits the hand great, easy to use, and does not retain water or toothpaste in hidden crevices like the sonicare or oralb 3d heads do.</li>
            <li> It is a much better clean than the old oral-B brushes we had that ran on AA batteries.  </li>
            <li> The BEST feature of this brush is how small/compact and lightweight it is, and that it gives an amazingly strong pulsonic action despite its small size.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you want a good, deep clean, buy the Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide.</li>
            <li> (theoretically this IS better for the battery, since a full cycle is consistently established so the battery will keep capacity better and work</li>
            <li> The ultrasonic tooth brushes are excellent for dental hygiene even if you do not floss, I have used a similar probdut from Oral-B for over 5 years and when used twice a day it has done a better job than having my teeth cleaned by a professional every 6 months especially since there is no damage to the enamel with this type of brush.</li>
            <li> , I do prefer toothpastes with baking soda and/or hydrogen peroxide &amp; love some of the new Arm &amp; Hammer.  </li>
            <li> Pros-  cleans great  light weight  small size  </li>
            <li> and it takes up less space and looks great.  </li>
            <li> amazon has it for such a good price, too, that it is real value for your dollar!  </li>
            <li> It came very well packaged and my first use of it I fell in love.</li>
            <li> I have had periodontal disease for many years along with very sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time to use an electric toothbrush and let me just say I was blown away with the results!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most powerful brush I&#x27;ve used (as compared to higher priced models), but still works very well.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t send the original UPC in after they refused me because I KNOW I sent it the first time.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money because you cant buy a new set of teeth (Not for the price of this toothbrush anyway:))</li>
            <li> My boyfriend ordered the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush reasonably priced $40.00 including the rebate and free super saver shipping.</li>
            <li> It is light, easy to handle and, for an electric toothbrush, not too loud.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush because it&#x27;s slim, quiet, has a timer, uses sonic technology, and is easy on the pocketbook.  </li>
            <li> And with it the special price I got (and $15 rebate) it has really made my buying experience all the worth while!    </li>
            <li> The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars.ually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> this is a great little toothbrush… its lightweight &amp; powerful… and was a steal when i bought it as a lightening deal.</li>
            <li> It does a very good job in reaching the back part of the upper and lower teeth.</li>
            <li> Hard to find, I know I favored this one over a lot of others I&#x27;ve tried, bristles are soft but effective</li>
            <li> My Dentist will approve of the condition of my teeth thanks to this fabulous toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very slim and light.</li>
            <li> It just feels like the motor does not run quite as fast or as smoothly</li>
            <li> On its own, I actually think this sonic toothbrush is better than my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It is light and very streamline and feels comforatble to use.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they made a softer brush head as it is a lot stiffer then the soft ones that were available for the old one.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve been happy with my Sonicare Flexcare for a few years, I couldn&#x27;t wait to add this to my ever-growing cache.</li>
            <li> Worth every every dollar.    </li>
            <li> This may actually be a good thing since you&#x27;re supposed to only apply it gently.  </li>
            <li> But where the Pulsonic wins is with my gums.  </li>
            <li> Also, the charger uses some non-contact inductor which is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> sonic vibrates, almost as powerfully as my cell phone, that&#x27;s all it does.  </li>
            <li> What  I did not like is that the Oral B didn&#x27;t shut off automatically after 2 minutes like the Sonicare, plus the shutoff button accumulates toothpaste runoff in the process, which can be kind off gross to turn off.  </li>
            <li> This one just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I turn it off to do my front teeth, it seems to strong/powerful/rough on more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it and</li>
            <li> I honestly feel for my smaller mouth</li>
            <li> I did own a Philips Sonic Tooth Brush about 8 years ago, but it only lasted two years before it broke.    </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it two stars is because I liked the form, and feel of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But if it works, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> It was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> That means this unit can safely go in the trash at the end of its lifespan, while the NiCad battery in the Sonic Complete would have to be separated and discarded</li>
            <li> Far better price than any that come close in power and efficiency.</li>
            <li> Another thing worth to note is the brush design.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to buy to everyone who is looking for such kind of product.</li>
            <li> I was searching for an affordable electric toothbrush that was slim but powerful:  </li>
            <li> The timer-mechanism is pretty cool (every 30 secs) and lets you know when to switch quadrants of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Hardly worth mentioning, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Oral B Pulsonic is such a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> the battery is powerful too, as each charge lasts 15-18 days.  </li>
            <li> it has the normal brush head and a small pointed gum-line brush attachment that is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> Works like a charm, and makes the Pulsonic worth</li>
            <li> The UV cleaner on the Sonicare was something I rarely used, so I don&#x27;t miss it when I made the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t worth the $40 that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> toothbrush is well worth the price for this feature alone.  </li>
            <li> The waiting time, spending my energy&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Is it worth $50?</li>
            <li> i guess there&#x27;s the fun factor of holding the vibrating toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The Triumph is better by far.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact overall size, fits well in my travel / shaving kit, plus the Pulsonic tooth brush holds enough charge that I can use it for a week without recharge when I am on the road - no need to have the charger with me which is nice ..</li>
            <li> Powerful -</li>
            <li> This unit seems to be fairly powerful.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> so can be still used effectively if  it runs low on power.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush, no issues so far.</li>
            <li> From my research though, all of the more professional sonic brushes seem to have this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quite powerful for the size.</li>
            <li> I question whether the costs difference would be worth it.</li>
            <li> It has a couple of settings for brushing or massaging and although I prefer the brushing setting for regular brushing, the massaging setting felt nice on my gums.  </li>
            <li> The 30 second timer to move to another quadrant to brush is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my dentist, and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with it so far.  </li>
            <li> Received my Pulsonic about a week ago, and so far I&#x27;m pleased with the performance, looks, and size.    </li>
            <li> I have used an electric toothbrush for many years, and so was not expecting to need the sensitive mode.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is worth buying another.</li>
            <li> Whiter smile and my mouth always feels fresher.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Your teeth should be worth $40 to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish Oral-B would sell these on their own instead of having to buy a pack with one and 3 regular brush heads.</li>
            <li> the money, I would strongly suggest anyone considering this brush to spend a little more and upgrade to the [[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]] or the [[ASIN:B000U08ZN4 Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide]], which are much better brushes and do a more efficient job of cleaning.s say, but prefer to just hold the brush in my mouth and let it do all of the work.  </li>
            <li> For the money, I would strongly suggest anyone considering this brush to spend a little more and upgrade to the [[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]] or the [[ASIN:B000U08ZN4 Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide]], which are much better brushes and do a more efficient job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I believe these Pulsonic electric toothbrushes are far more superior for cleaning teeth, then the other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> All the other reviews talk about what a good job it does cleaning and that is true, but I&#x27;d just like to mention that the first one I bought lasted for 3 1/2 years 2 of those years having two users.</li>
            <li> However, everything about the setup, use, and cleanup of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is very simple and straightforward, so I doubt one would need to refer to the instruction manual more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, everything about the setup, use, and cleanup of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is very simple and straightforward, so I doubt one would need to refer to the instruction manual more than once.    </li>
            <li> Evidently this item is made to quickly remove the toothbrush and install the flossing head.  </li>
            <li> I guess it does clean my teeth better than the basic models.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to charge it up and take it on a long weekend and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t rotate or do anything to clean my teeth any better than a regular manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> my mouth feels so much more clean than it did when I used a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you push the button once, and use the standard clean mode, you will need to push the button twice more in order to power the device off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It vibrates right on your hand and makes your hand tremble</li>
            <li> the price was right also.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box, whith the low-battery indicator blinking, I was amazed.  </li>
            <li> , right?    </li>
            <li> Toothpaste on and the brushing is done for you at the right speed and pressure.  </li>
            <li> So why the two stars for a five star product?Just try and get the right replacement heads-irritating.</li>
            <li> We really do like how they clean the teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> , I feel like it really gets the cracks of my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> does exactly what i wanted, love the action of the unit, teeth are whiter than ever and look forward to continued use</li>
            <li> nice modern look without the typical bulkiness of most power brushes.    </li>
            <li> It does clean very well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works really well to clean teeth like a dentist.  </li>
            <li> and it really gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The first time was a year ago, then it came back to life on its own somehow.</li>
            <li> On full charge last more than 15 days, brushing twice a day.  </li>
            <li> The directions provided in the package instruct that the brush be moved across the teeth in circular movements, as if brushing with a manual toothbrush, which seems very natural and easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The timer makes it very easy to get the proper amount of brushing on all teeth.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a breakthrough in power toothbrush design and it is very easy and convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely a breakthrough in power toothbrush design and it is very easy and convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> Not having the opportunity to compare it to similar products I still am very enthusiastic about its light weight, its effectiveness in cleaning - got rid of coffee-drinking related discoloration of my teeth, and its positive effect on my gums.</li>
            <li> When I powered it on, my first first thought was \\&quot;Oh, no!</li>
            <li> It is certainly a lot better than my old manual toothbrush though!</li>
            <li> The handle is slim and light and as easy to hold as a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I actually like closer to 35,000 VPM for a real clean.  </li>
            <li> The small size of the brush is also great for travel.</li>
            <li> In addition, it runs SO long on a battery charge, it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of months, probably more than I should, and the brush head has barely worn out at all.</li>
            <li> its nice to know how long you&#x27;ve been working on a section of teeth</li>
            <li> The first one I bought almost a year ago and still works great, although the battery seems to need more frequent charging lately.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok, although the on-off button is kind of hard to press.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Though studies indicate that brushing with an electric toothbrush is usually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B included a travel case for my Triumph power toothbrush, which is huge compared to this new Pulsonic model.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B included a travel case for my Triumph power toothbrush, which is huge compared to this new Pulsonic model.  </li>
            <li> Previous to the Oral-B Pulsonic I had been using the Sonic Care which I loved.</li>
            <li> The operation is quiet and gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li> bought it while mail-in rebate is still available, so actual out of pocket cost was around $25, and will be getting it shipped free via 2 day from Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I see this as the company does not charge much for the basic unit, but makes their money off of replacement brush heads, kind of like Hewlett Packard makes their money at selling ink cartridges, while practically giving away printers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to a dental appointment yet to see if its cleaning effectiveness is as good as my previous toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Pulsonic is easy to set-up and use, but felt underpowered compared to the Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li> Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]] makes more sense as an all-around power toothbrush, and it comes with two brushheads and a travel-case.  </li>
            <li> Size - Great for travel and resembles the smaller, slender size of a standard toothbrush.      </li>
            <li> Regular Diamond round toothpicks work best for me.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but a case would have been nice since the main reason that I chose this toothbrush over others was that it is better suited for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean and I love the little precision tip it comes with.</li>
            <li> The brush head is the perfect size for my mouth, not as large as the standard size oral-b cross action brush.</li>
            <li> My previous toothbrush was a first generation Sonicare, which was a good brush in</li>
            <li> DiamonClean certainly doesn&#x27;t clean 3x-4x as much as its price would suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pulsonic is a surprisingly very light and skinny rechargeable toothbrush that has similar dimensions to a $3 manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> pros of this brush are that it&#x27;s very quiet, slim, and very light.  </li>
            <li> The pros of this brush are that it&#x27;s very quiet, slim, and very light.  </li>
            <li> Big upgrade over Sonicare in one very important area - cleanliness.  </li>
            <li> Came very fast.  </li>
            <li> (almost like it&#x27;s turning off and on very fast)</li>
            <li> I very much recommend this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> Good little toothbrush for the buck.  </li>
            <li> She said it did not feel nearly as powerful, nor did it clean nearly as well.    </li>
            <li> I was using an older Ultrasonex toothbrush that I really liked but left it in a hotel while traveling.</li>
            <li> Cleaning results are far better than the older Vitality Oral B brush.</li>
            <li> A good sonic toothbrush can go a long way to keeping teeth white, clean and can reduce the number of trips to the dentist, but I don&#x27;t think this one is the answer.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare was huge and cumbersome for me to use.</li>
            <li> Brushhead did seem to come off at 1st, but not now (I must have changed to a more proper position).</li>
            <li> Her first pulse type brush was the one advertized on television by Sonicare, which she had for 5 years.</li>
            <li> Like many others who comment on the size, the smaller size definately makes the difference for her.</li>
            <li> But my first check up after getting</li>
            <li> I personally use another Oral-B toothbrush, but she travels a lot, and this worked better for her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month since first use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not obsessed with brushing, but am meticulous.</li>
            <li> Like most Oral B brushes, the Pulsonic has a setting where you can spend two minutes brushing your teeth, and it will alert you every 30 seconds to move onto the next part of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Like most Oral B brushes, the Pulsonic has a setting where you can spend two minutes brushing your teeth, and it will alert you every 30 seconds to move onto the next part of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I do take more time brushing and you can not only see but feel the results.</li>
            <li> It is more like the size of a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sooo much nicer!  </li>
            <li> first electric was a Sonicare, which I purchased when it first came out.</li>
            <li> When you brush with it, the pressure applied to the toothbrush is far far more powerful than the oscilation that takes place at the brush head.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic was my first venture into the higher end toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Let me first say I am not big on reading directions on most products before I try them out.  </li>
            <li> Holds enough charge to be safe for a week of travel, twice a day brushing.</li>
            <li> After using another Oral B Sonic toothbrush for years - and being totally satisfied - it finally gave up.  </li>
            <li> A low speed spin brush worked ok and did not tickle the gums, but did not remove the plaque as well as needed.  </li>
            <li> Brushing with this seemed as if I was at the dentist&#x27;s office at first.  </li>
            <li> The first one died about a year in.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s exactly what it sounds like.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is much more like a regular toothbrush, you do the scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> And at 32 years old, still cavity free.  </li>
            <li> I love using this thing and my mouth definitely feels cleaner after.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of getting used to at first because of the sonic power, but after awhile you won&#x27;t even notice.  </li>
            <li> Also love the 2 minute timer and 30 second interval stops.</li>
            <li> Before you shop Target check out Amazon first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love that this toothbrush feels like a jackhammer in my mouth, but I am now used to it after several months of use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the fact that I am now aware that one must replace these units every three to five years as that is the expectency of the battery life.  </li>
            <li> During my last dental visit, the hygenist commented on how shiny my teeth were more than once</li>
            <li> Try not to drool, OK?the second rubber-tipped head for working the gumline, something my dentist always complains I could use some more of.    </li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles of some higher end products in this category.</li>
            <li> Love how it alerts you to move to the next zone of you mouth.</li>
            <li> First one I owned lasted 5 years...</li>
            <li> so I feel the need to rinse it well with hot water before I can use it.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I was able to get for $50 and got a rebate of $15 to bring the total to $35.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for several reasons, but the first is its slim, light-weight design and easy-to-use convenience. .</li>
            <li> HaHa!</li>
            <li> so several more days waiting for Amazon delivery</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things you notice is the lightness of the pulsonic.</li>
            <li> It was bigger, and had more bristles.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Better than my last Oral-B Sonic</li>
            <li> is the soft brush head available?</li>
            <li> Funny, that first one took some getting used to because it seemed to vibrate to the point of feeling like you were being tickled.</li>
            <li> and he paid double what I paid. :-)</li>
            <li> Hot electronics bother me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush head looked more like a traditional manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My first elctric toothbrush was a Sonicare Advance, which lasted almost 7 years.  </li>
            <li> Two bonuses that I am in love with (as compared to the Sonicare) are the smaller two bristled brush</li>
            <li> It does a better job of hitting hard-to-reach areas than I do in the morning (!)</li>
            <li> Back and forth brushing more closely simulates non-electric brush.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time</li>
            <li> So I ordered an exact replacement from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It really does make a difference!</li>
            <li> Never fails that I spend $20.00 on a pack of replacement brushes and the thing stops working</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money to get the better model.  </li>
            <li> The first one was purchased a year ago and it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> I would give the product 5 stars if I knew it would last more than a year.</li>
            <li> much more dynamic.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it, I could almost feel it break up any buildup on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush OK, but just wish the brush heads were larger.  </li>
            <li> The design is ergonomic, can reach inner most molars with ease.</li>
            <li> I love the 30 second increment timer.</li>
            <li> As long as you take your time to brush  and utilize the recommended brushing technique (round, circular motion), you&#x27;re going to find this product does a superb job.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the pretty girl fool ya...</li>
            <li> and I am not sorry.</li>
            <li> The brush works with many different toothpastes which is another plus.</li>
            <li> For many months I have been evaluating various sonic toothbrushes online.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Its size is marginally bigger than a standard toothbrush and makes it the perfect traveling companion given it lasts a week of solid use (two times a day).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many different brands of toothbrushes in my 32 years, esp.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> /&gt;could have been 5 stars if it had more toothbrushes included instead of only one!&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> To reinstall the top portion, you sit it on the bottom portion and slide it back until you feel it click into place.  </li>
            <li> The included instruction manual goes over these steps in better detail, providing visual illustrations.  </li>
            <li> First of all, they need to provide covered storage for the spare brushes.  </li>
            <li> To reinstall the top portion, you sit it on the bottom portion and slide it back until you feel it click into place.  </li>
            <li> The included instruction manual goes over these steps in better detail, providing visual illustrations.  </li>
            <li> Overall we are quite pleased with the Pulsonic Power Toothbrush by Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> First of all, they need to provide covered storage for the spare brushes.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> The thing I love about this brush the most is that it looks like a regular toothbrush and feels like a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am able to go almost a week until I need to set it back in the charger.</li>
            <li> Gum problems were, in fact, the impetus for me to get an electric tooth brush in the first place, at the recommendation of my dentist who, of course, tried to sell me another one before I scouted around for one myself.</li>
            <li> first one i&#x27;ve ever owned, would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only gotten better since I invested in this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Many years later is still working like the 1st day.</li>
            <li> Cleans your teeth fast!</li>
            <li> I expect the brush does as good a job on my teeth as advertised,  but I am having trouble making the transition to it.  </li>
            <li> This particular model, although smaller and lighter, does not seem to clean my teeth as good as the 2 aforementioned brushes.  </li>
            <li> It is an awesome toothbrush - once I started using this product a few years back there is no other toothbrush that makes my teeth and mouth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Yet, this new Oral B vibrates much more, but completely lacks this sensation.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used an ultrasonic toothbrush, it will take a little getting used to because it feels different, but don&#x27;t give up because they clean great.  </li>
            <li> The whole brush is completely water proof and can be washed easily.  </li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes have existed for more than 100 years, and they have become extremely innovative in the last ten, so surely this toothbrush would be a significant improvement over previous versions, well, yes and no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only does it have the smart guide and cute smiley face that smiles at you when you&#x27;re done, but it just does an overall better job of cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This actually worked fine at first but its so powerful that it started to take the enamel off of my teeth</li>
            <li> It is definitely a better design than my old Sonicare, which developed mold in the handle!</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommended.truct that the brush be moved across the teeth in circular movements, as if brushing with a manual toothbrush, which seems very natural and easy to do.     </li>
            <li> It functions nicely and cleans my teeth extremely well.</li>
            <li> Since the brush now only vibrate, I need to put in more motion than before, but once again I got used to it pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> The battery life of the Pulsonic is long enough that I can leave it out of the charger for more than a week and still be able to brush twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing the other kind of Oral B.</li>
            <li> soft and powerful!</li>
            <li> As others have stated, the toothbrush has two settings - clean and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> There is only one button on the brush, push once to turn on strong cleaning, once more for a gentler setting and a third time to turn off.  </li>
            <li> The wave-like pattern in the regular brush-head enables the vibrating bristles to easily access hard-to-reach spots between teeth and at the gum-line, and a second Precision Tip brush head that has toothbrush bristles aligned into a point shape allows even better access between teeth.</li>
            <li> Easier to clean by far.</li>
            <li> Push once for clean or twice for sensitive.    </li>
            <li> If you use this brush without any power whatsoever it will still clean like a manual toothbrush, just without the sonic action.</li>
            <li> I like it even better now that I&#x27;ve found these replacement brushes - \\&quot;Ultra Soft Sensitive Brush</li>
            <li> The Sonic Spin Brush worked okay, and probably if I had never owned a real Sonic Toothbrush, I would have kept it, but it was not the same.  </li>
            <li> Totally bummed -- I loved my earlier toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I replaced my oral b sonic complete (which I really enjoyed using) with this one as the sonic complete is not being made any longer and</li>
            <li> The sensitive mode is a bit more vigorous than people may be expecting who&#x27;ve been using sensitive bristled brushes for years, as I have...</li>
            <li> He says that it gives his mouth a much cleaner feeling and enjoys it more than his regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I was really irritated with the fact that I could only charge it with 110vAC, not a travel toothbrush (most countries don&#x27;t use 110v).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need all the different modes nor fancy lighting of the DiamondClean, I end up using really just one mode most of the time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple ingenious design for holding a toothpick, which allows you to gently rub every edge of your gums.</li>
            <li> I recently went in to see my peridontist for a deep cleaning and she couldn&#x27;t believe how good my gums look because I did have a lot of build up of tartar below the gum line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one positive thing is the toothbrush&#x27;s compactness.</li>
            <li> So after reading some positive reviews here on Amazon, I went ahead and ordered one.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not much bigger than a regular toothbrush, unlike most powered brushes which are huge by comparison.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased a third Pulsonic for my 10 year old and he&#x27;s happy with it too.</li>
            <li> It is too early to evaluate the long-term benefits promised by this product, but I find it a very simple and practical design, easy to store, clean and use.</li>
            <li> The two settings are great, especially since I have titanium implanted teeth, so I use the sensitive setting on part of my mouth and the regular setting on the rest.  </li>
            <li> It is so light and slim, and I love the smaller brush attachment for the back teeth and in between teeth.</li>
            <li> and my whole mouth feels pretty invigorated after using it.      </li>
            <li> The first time I used it was an experience, it tickled so much and took a while to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Love the size, it is quiet and sure beats the big old Phillips I used before!</li>
            <li> The older model had a flashing light and then steady when charged, this one is constantly steady at all times.  </li>
            <li> The small brush tip is good for crevice cleaning.</li>
            <li> The Professional uses a fast sweeping motion of its circular head to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> It will clean my teeth and save more time on everyday.</li>
            <li> I have used both the Sonic Care and the Oral-B Spin Brushes but really liked the slimmed down design of the Oral-B Pulsonic.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for your main toothbrush I&#x27;d skip it and look into Sonicare or the more traditional Oral-B electric</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is a great value over 50% less than Sonicare products and seems to work exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> I used on the low setting for about 1 wk to 10 days, now able to use the high.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is, this little gadget has exceeded my expectations and more!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much to the other reviewer&#x27;s nice review.</li>
            <li> While brushing, I occasionally accidentally hit the button and have to tap it two more times to return to the normal brushing mode.  </li>
            <li> The sensitive setting is useful for those getting used to electric toothbrushes for the first time.</li>
            <li> its so easy to store between daily uses and carry for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Easily maintained it&#x27;s charge brushing twice daily over the douse of a week vacation.</li>
            <li> The Pulsonic toothbrush is even better, keeping them totally clean and removing totally the plaque, especially with the use of the precision tip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smaller size makes it easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I also love the slender look, doesnt take up much room and has a realy long battery life</li>
            <li> I got this because my Sonicare brush finally died, after 9 years of going strong.</li>
            <li> I cant believe it has been running strong for THREE YEARS, now-a-days products seem to barely last for one year.</li>
            <li> wife and i ordered two of these largely because of the $20 rebate that we thought applied to each one.  </li>
            <li> and I certainly did not notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> Whether my teeth will get whiter is another story; they certainly feel cleaner.    </li>
            <li> It was big and chunky, it did clean very well, but when it finally died I wanted something more slender.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this toothbrush for a few years and still use it and love it!</li>
            <li> I love my new electric toothbrush wont be goin back to manual brushing again.</li>
            <li> Overall I like this new brush, though it might be better if Oral-B puts in an indicator for battery.</li>
            <li> After a month of use and a recent perio exam, the dentist says it is looking much better, and to keep up the routine with the new electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> So I finally bought a new one, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> If the dentists are right, which apparently I&#x27;m betting on, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a great value for around $50 (often you can get it for less if you buy when they are offering rebates and compare prices on several websites).</li>
            <li> Overall, pleased with the results so far!</li>
            <li> Follow-up 10 months later:  The battery life is fine.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try it after my classic Oral B spin brush died (after 6 years!).  </li>
            <li> Nice and slim, takes up little space on the counter.  </li>
            <li> I liked the size, though it took a little while to adjust to the feel of it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy and kind of grinds when it hit a tooth.</li>
            <li> The little brush cleans nicely between the teeth.</li>
            <li> It holds a very long charge and provides a very clean feeling once i&#x27;m done brushing.  </li>
            <li> Clean (normal) and Sensitive</li>
            <li> The handle is significantly thinner than the Sonicare (competitor) model, which makes it less comfortable for the hand.  </li>
            <li> We really liked this model compared to other sonic toothbrushes because it not only does a great job cleaning our teeth, but the brush handle and charging base are very easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> It is important to note that no matter how much gunk I let accumulate the toothbrush always charged properly.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few weeks and find it amazing.  </li>
            <li> - Comfortable to hold and is well balanced  - Very quiet operation  - Medium-soft bristles are gentle on teeth &amp; gums  </li>
            <li> Cleans really well.</li>
            <li> its price is reasonable and the noise is not so loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was reasonably priced and had all the things i wanted:  slim design  </li>
            <li> Oral-B is a trusted name and they had a rebate which made this pulsonic very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> After much research I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for me.  </li>
            <li> he says its really convinient and he can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush so much,</li>
            <li> The ultrasonic action is not as powerful as Sonicare&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> So really, this is just a one person toothbrush based on the spots for brush head storage.  </li>
            <li> reasonable price    </li>
            <li> This Oral-B Pulsonic is very sleek and appears to be well made.  </li>
            <li> The price was reasonable too and Oral-B was offering a $15.00 rebate when I purchased it so that made the deal even sweeter.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a reasonable priced rechargeable toothbrush this is the toothbrush for you.  </li>
            <li> The reason seems to be that there isn&#x27;t much side to side movement of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have as much bristal movement as the ones with the circle shaped heads.</li>
            <li> I really like the pick part</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with the appearance and performance of this product.</li>
            <li> I really prefer the Sonic Complete, which has a comfortable soft brush, so I regret the decision to buy the Pulsonic.</li>
            <li> Holds charge very well.  </li>
            <li> A gentle grip is all that&#x27;s needed and</li>
            <li> (but too big to fit in any toothbrush holder slots)  </li>
            <li> It functions at a much faster speed than my Braun.  </li>
            <li> On the low speed, the sound is more similar to the drone of an old prop plane.    </li>
            <li> a try (available at my local pharmacy for approx.</li>
            <li> The difference is this does a hell of a job at pulsing/vibrating to really help you get those teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;-There is only one type of replacement head available.  </li>
            <li> where I can really massage/clean my gums and really...</li>
            <li> my whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> Come on...get real paranoid people...       </li>
            <li> and I much preferred.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it is very slim</li>
            <li> It really has reduced my teeth stains and people</li>
            <li> Thanks, Frank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> I did not realize it would so jolt my teeth so much when I used it.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have purchased several of these, most have held up very well, however, one came apart, partly because my son did not take great care of it, but I did not believe it should have failed the way it did.  </li>
            <li> The Pulsonic was much easier to handle while brushing</li>
            <li> and yes, it does look much nicer in your bathroom</li>
            <li> Well, it doesn&#x27;t, but it comes very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, while the handle is very sleek the brush head is not at all.  </li>
            <li> So, if you enjoy holding big pieces of plastic in your mouth, then this is the toothbrush for you.  </li>
            <li> and my teeth look so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> The charger is compact, too, and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bit louder than I expected, but certainly better than the SpinBrush,</li>
            <li> my teeth look so much whiter.</li>
            <li> I really like the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> nonetheless i really like the design and form factor of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> There is no provision to hide extra slack of the cord inside the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun seems to go out of their way to hide the fact that wall-mounting is available.</li>
            <li> Really cleans them.</li>
            <li> There is a real deal breaker here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I really miss the Sonicare feature where it shuts off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month now and really like it.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge really well</li>
            <li> The real amazement was when I went in for my checkup.  </li>
            <li> meant that it was sturdier, and covered my whole tooth when brushing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> which I consider to be a real compliment.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> cleans out the stains that are in between your teeth really well.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush is slim, light weight, quiet and the plug is compact.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s replacement brush also much reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> as someone with a slightly smaller mouth, the toothbrush head is perfectly sized to reach the very back of the last row of big molars.</li>
            <li> The bristles move really fast, instead of just sitting there vibrating.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this Braun/Oral-b to work.  </li>
            <li> However, in that time I realized I was applying too much pressure when brushing in the circular pattern, as recommended in the instructions.</li>
            <li> It vibrates, but the WHOLE THING vibrates.  </li>
            <li> I would have expected better from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Very slim.  </li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t wanting an electric toothbrush--</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are reasonable priced.  </li>
            <li> Last time I bought the Oral B  Sonic Complete and it is a great toothbrush, but for some reason Braun isn&#x27;t marketing it any longer, so now the Sonic Complete heads are not carried locally, and supplies on this site, with the exception of the generics, are dwindling.</li>
            <li> Charges fast too.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I dont have much to compare this against.</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> The vibrations are intense as needed to give the results like a \\&quot;dentist office\\&quot; cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads are reasonably priced which is unusual in this market.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Oral-B.</li>
            <li> This is a very well built and thought out brush</li>
            <li> This toothbrush stops if too much pressure is applied.  </li>
            <li> Vibrations make cleaning much easier and effortless.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really makes a difference in cleaning.    </li>
            <li> The ultrasonic vibration really cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Someone else noted that if that the brushes are coming off, then chances are you are applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li> This sonic toothbrush works very well,and is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, so I can&#x27;t vouch for it myself, but the person I gave it too really really likes it.  </li>
            <li> if I dislike it so much why three stars?</li>
            <li> very powerful&lt;br /&gt;Standard</li>
            <li> This is a very neat toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how anyone lives without an electric tooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone with teeth!</li>
            <li> 1) it cleans really well.  </li>
            <li> The charging stand fits neatly on your sink basin and holds the toothbrush straight up in the air.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it too.  </li>
            <li> They continue to get smaller, more powerful, and now tend to include multiple operation modes and interchangeable brushes and accessories.  </li>
            <li> Medium-soft bristles are gentle on teeth &amp; gums&lt;</li>
            <li> I was very tempted to give this Pulsonic toothbrush a 5-star rating, but I honestly feel that Oral-B has overlooked a few important details that will hopefully be corrected on future model releases.  </li>

            <li> I highly recommend purchasing this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Very recommended</li>
            <li> Very compact.  </li>
            <li> the handle vibrates so much that my hands are still tingling after I have finished brushing.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very noticeably whiter in just under two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Really cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My hygeinist has also commented that I do not have much of the &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; unlike before when I was still using the manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The only thing that you have to watch out for is to buy the replacement heads which is not that cheap.</li>
            <li> This item works very well.  </li>
            <li> Holds charge very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Put the whole thing inside a toothbrush-shaped casing and voila: you&#x27;ve got something you can brush your teeth with that&#x27;s vibrating at around ~30,000</li>
            <li> &gt;— Brush in gentle circles.</li>
            <li> I chose this because it came with the precision tip head (which does not do much either).</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works, but all the attachments didn&#x27;t seem to do much...</li>
            <li> We really like the narrow handle of the tooth brush and are happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li> it is neat, but doesn&#x27;t get used much.</li>
            <li> Sonicare&#x27;s most recent update completely redesigned the body, the brushes and the body-brush coupling system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also own the bigger (blue) oral-b sonic tothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The stand can be mounted to the wall to clear up your countertop as well...and who here has enough room on your sink top?    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for a few months now and I am stil loving it.  </li>
            <li> had this for a few years now , battery still works well and it cleans well while being nice and slim.</li>
            <li> only way to stop it is by placing it into the charger but it constantly charging and let be honest -</li>
            <li> The second head it comes with is handy for those teeth in the back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first sonic brush and my teeth were a wee bit sensitive at first, but I got over it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pulsonic has two settings - regular and sensitive which should do the job for most people.</li>
            <li> The 30 second warnings are by far my favorite feature.</li>
            <li> As a result, I found the quality of cleaning sub-par, and would go so far as to say that a regular manual toothbrush does a better job at cleaning my rear molars.  </li>
            <li> But now I honestly feel like I wasted $30, and I&#x27;m forcing myself to continue using it to get my money&#x27;s worth!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> The right kind is hard to find.</li>
            <li> At first, the clean mode was a bit much to take and felt uncomfortable; but after a couple of days on the sensitive mode I&#x27;ve eased into the clean mode quite nicely.     </li>
            <li> only issue with the Pulsonic is that it just isn&#x27;t quite as gentle or as good as the more expensive models, but you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li> Not a large space but more</li>
            <li> the batteries last forever, the brushes are reasonably priced!!!</li>
            <li> I remember that when first using the Sonicare, the intensity of the vibration gradually increased over time to allow your mouth and teeth to adjust to the new sensation.</li>
            <li> I kept copies of all documentation I sent and as far as I can see it is the right label.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush moves your hand more than it does in your mouth, is hard to hold, and doesn&#x27;t clean as well.  </li>
            <li> When I brush with an electric toothbrush, I want to be able to slowly move my toothbrush around while the cleaning power of the toothbrush head does all the work and leaves my mouth feeling dentist clean.  </li>
            <li> I guess the bottom line is that it does clean your teeth but the proof of how well it really cleans will be found at my next dentist appointment!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was always perplexed by the tiny circular brush heads, but now that&#x27;s MAINLY what I use.</li>
            <li> I originally got the the battery operated version last summer and have been using one until now</li>
            <li> Cleaned my  teeth better than any other electric&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally bought an \\&quot;advanced\\&quot;, but not \\&quot;elite\\&quot; model from my dentist several years ago on her recommendation.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a first time electric toothbrush or to upgrade your old one, get this!</li>
            <li> My problem with the Oral-B Pulsonic, like many other reviewers, is the dependability.  </li>
            <li> i use the pulsonic toothbrushes for many years now and i dont want to have any other now.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this about 2 years ago, but it stopped working because I left it in the shower and the screw at the bottom rusted.  </li>
            <li> The speed of the oscillation is what makes this product better than the other ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely well-designed: Have you seen most electric brushes?</li>
            <li> When I showed up to my first post-brush-purchase teeth-cleaning with red gums, the dental hygienist—while totally supportive of the purchase—pointed out that, since this is an electric brush, you shouldn&#x27;t brush with the same vigor that youwould with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Tip attachement (LOVE this for my braces)&lt;br /&gt;Quieter than some other Oral B toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;Affordable</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Vibrates my hand more than other brushes</li>
            <li> model in particular is very high quality.</li>
            <li> My teeth haven&#x27;t felt felt this clean since my regular visits to my dentist!</li>
            <li> My mouth definitely feels clean.  </li>
            <li> At first it tingled so much touching my tongue that I had to take a break from brushing, but after a few days I got used to it.</li>
            <li> Give it a 5-day run on regular basis (twice a day) with scrutinized clean (both brushes) in the evening and recommended 4-minute regular clean in the morning</li>
            <li> The brush heads are a great size - not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> Being someone who has worked myself back into a much better state of dental health, I can heartily testify to the advantages of brushing with electric toothbrushes in general, and sonic toothbrushes in particular.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery life is great, I can use it on long business trips and never worry about it going dead.  </li>
            <li> And also vibes every 30 seconds to help you clean all the areas equally.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is light and small, which means it fit in my mouth, and my wife&#x27;s mouth, quite well.  </li>
            <li> And this smaller brush is also great for getting between a few misaligned teeth too!    </li>
            <li> My wife and I have the older Oral B/Braun that is much wider.  </li>
            <li> Make my mouth and gums feel clean and can definitely feel a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> Not giving such strong cleaning effect as Sonic Complete but is much easier to operate dure to compact design.</li>
            <li> The brush comes with an additional smaller head that is meant to clean between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Provides the same clean mouth feeling I get from the sonic care electric tooth brush I use at home.</li>
            <li> Third, I can get my teeth just as clean with this $50 product as I could with the $200 Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I miss the oscillating brush and feel that the vibrating one does not scrub my teeth clean enough.  </li>
            <li> It is an investment that will hopefully save you much more over the long run in professional dental</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably use this Pulsonic for travel since it&#x27;s nice and compact, though I suspect that also means the battery won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to upgrade from their manual toothbrush, but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money and use a bulky device.</li>
            <li> Although it does vibrate at a high rate, the whole toothbrush seems to vibrate instead of just the head.</li>
            <li> Being someone who has worked myself back into a much better state of dental health, I can heartily testify to the advantages of brushing with electric toothbrushes in general, and sonic toothbrushes in particular.     </li>
            <li> little brush heads attached to gigantic bases, with some blue or aquamarine detailing that proudly and loudly declares: &amp;#34;I am for dental hygiene!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It is more awkward to use and more time consuming than I anticipated,   but I will keep at it!</li>
            <li> The pricing on this is perfect for someone who wants to be serious about oral health care but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a fancy brush that takes up half the counter-top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, slim, and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a very user friendly electric toothbrush, with a smaller, thinner and lighter size than the direct competitors and also at a reasonable price compared to them.  </li>
            <li> Even though I love my old Professional model, I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the Pulsonic, for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pulsonic is not as gentle on your teeth and gums as most of the more expensive toothbrushes I&#x27;ve owned, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> The sonic cleaning action is at a higher rate then</li>
            <li> if you buy it from that wharehouse store or a standard store with a good return policy, they will take it back no questions asked anywhere from 60 days to a year later.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for your first sonic brush, or an upgrade from your old one, I cannot think of a reason not to pick the Pulsonic from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Definitely feels like a much more intense brushing than the prior generation of Oral Bs (had the circular one and the one with the split head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is very maneuverable and oscillates in the normal brushing direction, aligned with the tooth crevices.</li>
            <li> Pulsonic is the first brush to surpass the Sonicare in my professional opinion.  </li>
            <li> True enough, we dropped it.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but was really surprised to find only one brush included.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to live without!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to live without!  </li>
            <li> -B Pro 1000 is the new way to go, and it doesn&#x27;t overheat/overcharge like this one does!</li>
            <li> Just want correct replacement heads,NOT a new $$$ toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush because it feels like you are holding a regular toothbrush and not a big flashlight like some other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> while this model does well to competitors priced similarly, there are other more powerful units on the market.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I prefer the Oscillating brush head of my Oral-B Triumph power toothbrush, my wife much prefers this new Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> wife really loves the new Oral-B Pulsonic power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Although I prefer the Oscillating brush head of my Oral-B Triumph power toothbrush, my wife much prefers this new Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> No travel/storage case included    My wife really loves the new Oral-B Pulsonic power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy a whole new set.</li>
            <li> I cannot say if this toothbrush out pulses the competition or does a better job of cleaning, but compared to the previous brushes I have tried this one is twice the price.  </li>
            <li> Gives me a big white and clean smile after I finish.</li>
            <li> The two main considerations I use when looking at an electric toothbrush are vibrations per minute (VPM) and brush head form.</li>
            <li> The system comes with a separate attachment to get into those harder to reach areas and a nice rechargeable stand which holds the extra head and the toothbrush.   </li>
            <li> Still a decent product with a decent price.  </li>
            <li> I mainly got this oral b tooth brush because it came with a rebate of $20.</li>
            <li> All in all, a decent sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is light weight, unlike the last one that I had and is not as loud.  </li>
            <li> According to Wikipedia 80% of tooth decay occurs in the pits and fissures of the teeth, mainly the molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much whiter smile without unsightly stains in the areas where regular brushing doesn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> The main concern consumers should have is the value for money one.  </li>
            <li> I bought another Oral-B rechargeable product because I was out of town and could not find this particular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare is much more expensive and the heads cost more, too, so I stick with this brand.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a regular brushing head and a in between your teeth head (smaller bristle top).</li>
            <li> As with most rechargeable products these days, you must initially wait several hours for the device to charge before you begin using it.  </li>
            <li> teeth were super white though.</li>
            <li> Initially I had a problem with the brush head twisting off during brushing, but either I have inadvertently changed my brushing style, or the head finally seated itself better with some of the toothpaste residue</li>
            <li> It is the most similar in size &amp; shape to a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> but the brush heads would wear out quickly or they would break after a short time.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this toothbrush, I had the cheap Crest spinbrush that I bought for about $10 from walgreens, which had the &#x27;dual&#x27; action in one head.</li>
            <li> The best thing about it compared to other electric toothbrushes is that it is shaped more like a regular toothbrush, with a lightweight, comfortable base.</li>
            <li> With that, I&#x27;ll repeat my recommendation that people who have slightly inflamed gums, or gums teetering towards developing gum disease may get some valuable help from this toothbrush.re immaculate and my gums and pockets were all within normal, healthy scoring ranges on the scale they use to rate gum disease progression.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Dentist&#x27;s drill!!!\\&quot; On the &#x27;high&#x27; speed</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a number of high end products in this category, by Oral-B, Phillips and Braun.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I will give this product high marks for not killing me.</li>
            <li> And I have had problems knowing when it needs to be recharged, as electrical outlets in my bathroom are in high demand, and there&#x27;s no way of knowing when you&#x27;re about to run out of juice.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d highly recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Although there is clearly nothing wrong with scrubbing your teeth the traditional way, with a good old-fashioned toothbrush, I find that the power toothbrushes tend to remove stains better and keep my teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> We bought our original set nearly 6 years ago and my husbands finally quit on us (mine is still kicking).</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic toothbrush provides good sonic cleaning action but the head is very small.</li>
            <li> thought they were a little over the top.  </li>
            <li> This can take a little getting used to if you are more accustomed to the oscillating brush-type models, like I am.  </li>
            <li> I like the small head and the concept, but to be honest, my old spin style brush left my teeth feeling far more clean and in less time brushing.  </li>
            <li> This one is subtle, and good if you have sensitive teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two of the LED indicators show what cleaning mode the brush is in, when powered on (clean or sensitive), while the third LED lights up when the device is charging.  </li>
            <li> Post research, my boyfriend concluded the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush was currently the highest rated Oral-B electric toothbrush and the smart choice for our first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrushes for years, but this is the first time I swayed from the basic models such as [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].  </li>
            <li> If you enjoy handing large sums of money over to massive corporations in exchange for a giant piece of plastic in your mouth, then this is the toothbrush for you.  </li>
            <li> So far I like this toothbrush way more than the Sonicare, which was too heavy, the brush head was too large for my liking, and when you take it out of your mouth to spit, you (and the mirror) get splattered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it feels normal now, I remember how much smoother and clean my teeth felt the first few times I used this after switching over from a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I think that probably makes it a little less effective at getting your teeth completely clean.</li>
            <li> I live this smaller, slimmer version of the pulsonic toothbrush, Works as well, if not better, than any other sonic toothbrush Great product!</li>
            <li> I myself prefer the slimmer profile, and it&#x27;s much quieter than my old Philips sonic.</li>
            <li> The Pulsonic still does a great job cleaning your teeth, don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> So far this has worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I tried another of Oral-B&#x27;s lower cost units, and it was like a concrete mixer against my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Although these vibrations are fairly gentle, switching to the sensitive mode reduces the strength of the vibration by about 1/3.  </li>
            <li> Sensitive Mode is much gentler on touchy teeth &amp; gums&lt;</li>
            <li> - Sensitive Mode is much gentler on touchy teeth &amp; gums  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning this and spending a few dollars more for a heftier sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I decided to try sonic action   because It seemed my first choice, Oral B Professional 1000,  </li>
            <li> I am more motivated to brush my teeth a few times a day now.  </li>
            <li> we have taken to the always useful Comments section to air our grievance; We are Prime members, buy a lot of products on Amazon, and feel like Amazon should definitely do</li>
            <li> : Lack of bundled accessories, doesn&#x27;t feel quite as powerful as some of its bigger</li>
            <li> so since I had good luck with oral B in the past, I decided to go back to them and didn&#x27;t regret it at all.  </li>
            <li> This one would make a good choice for somebody with small hands (children) or for a second toothbrush to keep in your travel kit.</li>
            <li> Much more than this, it has 2 different cleaning modes, regular and sensitive.    </li>
            <li> Small, light, powerful, maneuverable.  </li>
            <li> small brush head, light weigh and powerful brushing motor, this one, IMHO, has it all.</li>
            <li> They tell you to brush like normal.      </li>
            <li> I have has no problems with using the normal brushing mode</li>
            <li> After using it for this long, I&#x27;d pay full retail for it if I had it to do over again.  </li>
            <li> Spend the few dollars more.</li>
            <li> Since using the sonic toothbrush I definitely see a decrease in the build up of plaque and that is makes this purchase worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I would suggest that you spend the extra money and buy a better brush or simply go with the old manual style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an extremely reasonable price: At $40 (as of this writing), it&#x27;s $40 more expensive than the free toothbrushes your dentist gives you after a visit.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A POORLY MANUFACTURED PRODUCT, SOLD BY A COMPANY THAT DOES NOT PROMOTE GOOD CUSTOMER RELATIONS OR PRODUCT LOYALTY!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do wish the battery would last a little longer, I seem to be able to get right about a year of use.</li>
            <li> initial impression was very positive.  </li>
            <li> A whole other level of clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, only slightly thicker than an ordinary (non-powered) toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It is not hard on the gums, in fact it stimulates them unlike any toothbrush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> After using this new toothbrush for a couple of weeks, my wife&#x27;s teeth are already noticeably brighter, so we definitely believe Oral-B&#x27;s claim that this brush removes stains and polishes teeth for a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li> After using this new toothbrush for a couple of weeks, my wife&#x27;s teeth are already noticeably brighter, so we definitely believe Oral-B&#x27;s claim that this brush removes stains and polishes teeth for a brighter smile.  </li>
            <li> Thin, light, easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I ordered this electric toothbrush right after I came back from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one of the other great things, it&#x27;s small.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, on the highest vibration setting (clean mode), I found that the brush vibrated too much and was uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Multi-mode - offers two different modes, clean and sensitive.    </li>
            <li> I find it almost too thin, but its size is closer to that of a regular toothbrush, so it will fit inside a standard travel toothbrush holder -- a good thing, since Oral-B does not include a travel case in the package.    </li>
            <li> It does twist off easily as I wipe it down after using, but I have never had it come off in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to not damage gums/tissue, but can certainly stimulate circulation and cleanse all at one time.  </li>
            <li> and I also wanted to try something different that Sonicare, purely out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot give you a lengthy feedback about Pulsonic because I didn&#x27;t get to use it much.</li>
            <li> - a real ultrasonic brush, the only type useful against periodontal pockets  - very low price for this technology  - easy to clean  - small charging stand  - small brush, great for little hands  - quad pacer  - setting for sensitive gums  </li>
            <li> I am now &#x27;cost sensitive&#x27; as I am only willing to spend so much to &#x27;rent&#x27; a unit for a couple of years</li>
            <li> She needed new brushes and decided to go for a newer toothbrush instead.</li>
            <li> the bristles of the brush are still completely new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> , what does the Pulsonic sacrifice to achieve this chic new compact design?  </li>
            <li> After two weeks, my new sonicare brush heads would be frayed at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just recieved my new Oral-B Pulsonic Eletric Toothbrush in the mail yesterday.</li>
            <li> so I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying a new one.</li>
            <li> The new unit arrived via FedEx yesterday, just 10 days after I sent the defective one to them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The new one has been working with no problem, and I still have a spare.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> that when I needed a new one I bought the Oral-B sonic.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a new electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> ever did even brand new.  </li>
            <li> The new Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is truly a breakthrough in power toothbrush design.  </li>
            <li> It was time for a new one</li>
            <li> The product itself appears to be very advanced, with the sleek body and small footprint.  </li>
            <li> it is really easy to twist ever so slightly while brushing which pops head off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slim so doesn&#x27;t take up much room vs a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> (it seems every time they make a newer sonic unit they also make newer brush heads which will not fit the older unit nor will the older unit&#x27;s brushes fit the newer one) as what else can I do with them.    </li>
            <li> The smaller head is great for getting along the gumline and behind your front teeth.</li>
            <li> only spent more than three months, it is out of control.</li>
            <li> although it isn&#x27;t much bigger than a standard size toothbrush, it won&#x27;t fit in the cases designed for them).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any plastic part in this brush is less robust than your gums, or maybe I&#x27;m lucky to receive a better one, which I found more unlikely.    </li>
            <li> you are on a budget, want a good (not great) sonic toothbrush, then I have no trouble recommending the Oral-B Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li> The sonic action of the Pulsonic is not diminished at all by the smaller size (for those who aren&#x27;t familiar with general benefits of sonic brushing, do a google search for animated teeth.).  </li>
            <li> In the meantime , it seems to clean well, the device is is easy to clean and the base is small and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is very slim which is great for packing but a little hard to hold.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have very sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> My gums are usually very sensitive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very, very loud.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for a simple, high quality electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is tiny in the hands, and the setting gives a very intense cleaning.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this thing and it turned out to be a complete disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only gripe preventing a 5-star rating is that even though OralB designed this brush so compact and perfect for travel, OralB was too cheap to add a few more cents to make charging base chargeable in Asian countries, or elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> : When compared to my Sonicare, this brand actually works better at removing plaque, and I really, really like the little pick brush.</li>
            <li> The only and biggest problem I have is the warranty from Oral-B, first they don&#x27;t go by purchase date, but the date of manufacture.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, inexpensive, and works even better, she says.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Small light toothbrush, does the job!</li>
            <li> My entire family has been using the higher end oral b electric toothbrushes for years now.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral-B Triumph Professional Care toothbrush with all the bells and whistles for the last few years and liked it.  </li>
            <li> I like the reminder pauses to change quadrants, but I usually give it a once more all over anyway.  </li>
            <li> If you only need a toothbrush for a short period of time, this might work for you, but I expect my products to last more than one year.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has changed my morning routine completely!</li>
            <li> Pretty much standard these days, I would expect.</li>
            <li> The smaller size of the toothbrush is not merely an aesthetic benefit either.  </li>
            <li> Has a setting for normal or sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the exact same model I&#x27;ve been using for 3 years.</li>
            <li> not sure how it cleans your teeth better than the manual way.  </li>
            <li> I have had them all back to the first Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I had used several Sonicare models and this is the first time to use O-ral B.  </li>
            <li> It has two modes for normal and sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the battery wasn&#x27;t charged enough, so I charged it for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> First head is a toothbrush and a second head is used for flossing.</li>
            <li> My original Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush finally died after several years.  </li>
            <li> but it actually works better and the battery seems to last and last.</li>
            <li> but it is a non issue to me, it seems pretty standard for a toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve found is that the higher speed causes some bleeding -but</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head only vibrates, unlike many of the other Oral-B electric toothbrushes that oscillate.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the exact same quality as the $100</li>
            <li> I think I brushed my teeth for five minutes the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush model for over 5 years and just purchased a second one to replace the first one.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush for travel, slim and small but durable.</li>
            <li> I actually think the Professional cleans my teeth a little better and with less effort on my part because you just sort of place the brush head on top of each tooth.  </li>
            <li> I have been lead to believe that water and electricity can be a dangerous combination, so I am happy to report that I have not yet been electrocuted using my new Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> The charger, as I already mentioned, is small but sturdy and while it lacks a snapping mechanism to hold the brush in place while it charges, the Pulsonic sits very securely in its charging cradle and comes away from the charger without sticking (a problem I had with my old brush).  </li>
            <li> and my teeth feels pretty clean, which usually comes after 3-4 minutes of brushing with my toothbrushes before.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before but felt that my teeth weren&#x27;t getting clean enough with a regular one.  </li>
            <li> While I was using the basic models, I remember that I&#x27;m supposed to only lightly touch the brush onto my teeth, yet from the aging of the brushes I realized that I pressed it too hard most of the time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as effectively as other electric brushes</li>
            <li> I love that this toothbrush is a reasonable size and holds charge long enough for me to use it on long trips.  </li>
            <li> I suspect the same is true for any similar product.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head is nice an small for those who are looking for a well working toothbrush with a smaller head.</li>
            <li> I got it when it was on double rebate, So I ended up only paying like $30, but after having it, I would&#x27;ve payed full price,  </li>
            <li> so I was able to let one run all the way down before charging, and this was supposed to extend the life of the tooth brush, but one of them eventually became so short</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has multiple brush shapes, the smaller brush is good for cleaning along the gumline where I have had a couple cavities in the past-</li>
            <li> But the power is no difference than other full sized model.</li>
            <li> I find this pulsonic toothbrush cleans my teeth very well (better than traditional oralb electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve had in the past), and I like its slim design a lot.</li>
            <li> so most likely it&#x27;s not a super copy that made in china and bought for $2 -</li>
            <li> Other than the few cons listed above, she feels that the Pulsonic toothbrush is perfect in every other way.  </li>
            <li> Other than the few cons listed above, she feels that the Pulsonic toothbrush is perfect in every other way.  </li>
            <li> The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just slightly larger than regular toothbrush, and easily moving around in mouth just like regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would have prefered a round head on the brush rather than the rectangular, but otherwise it is just fine.  </li>
            <li> This is a good electric toothbrush for travelling, due to its small size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But as I said earlier, I switched from Sonicare to an Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide.</li>
            <li> After using one of the large sonic toothbrushes for several years this one came as a surprise.</li>
            <li> This new one is so small and being so slim it easily falls over when you stand it upright.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how it cleans hard to reach spots, also how clean my teeth felt after the first brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mighty little</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had them long enough to see if they whiten like the ads say, but they do clean.  </li>
            <li> I used the Sonicare for years and found it extremely difficult to keep the brush head clean despite following all the various tips you can easily find with a quick google search.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the Oral B Sonic is compact, indicates how long you should use it on each quadrant, and is priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have to do the work myself, i actually brush my teeth for 2 minutes which the toothbrush is preseted to (it uses a little pause for recommended time to brush the front, bottom and top of your teeth).</li>
            <li> You will pay a little more for this toothbrush, as opposed to using standard toothbrushes, but your teeth will thank you...</li>
            <li> overall i think brushing with sonic toothbrushes are a little more work because you have to do the rotating motion with your hand.  </li>
            <li> Love the slim design and way the head and vibrations get into all the hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads are hard and not cushioned like the better brands.</li>
            <li> It does, however, come with a second brush head to get in between teeth and those hard to reach places which is a really nice addition but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big, expensive, but works great.</li>
            <li> The clear plastic is the part that holds the pulsonic and two brush heads.</li>
            <li> but this one is by far the &#x27;buzziest&#x27; and I can not say that it was the tooth brush</li>
            <li> The price is a bit steep to just go out and buy one, unless your replacing an old one.</li>
            <li> my teeth instantly felt cleaner and my whole mouth too.  </li>
            <li> I had a 10+ year old Oral-B 3D toothbrush, and I thought it did a great job, but heads were expensive, and my teeth have that JUST CAME BACK FROM THE DENTIST/DENTAL HYGIENIST FEELING!  </li>
            <li> just wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent traveler (65+ nights away from home)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B Professional rechargeable toothbrush for about 4 years now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot easier to hold and manipulate than the Professional model and probably the bulky Philips model, too.  </li>
            <li> An electric brush naturally makes you spend longer.  </li>
            <li> One note, my wife has sensitive teeth, and found her Sonicare to be too aggressive.</li>
            <li> None so far</li>
            <li> This action  breaks up the plaque supposedly.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ve hit the sensitive mode on accident.</li>
            <li> When the battery died I bought the Oral B Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li> &quot; feeling I&#x27;d grown used to with my old brush is completely gone.  </li>
            <li> It might be nicer if Oral-B puts on an indicator to show the battery level, since it&#x27;s very unclear to me that how I should notice the low battery status without running out of power.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a lower speed function for brushing sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A mode for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It developed a crack in the bottom side.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had a cavity at 30 years old.  </li>
            <li> Changing the head will be so much easier than my old Oral B Cross Action.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough on gums to use 3 times day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is like getting my teeth professionally cleaned at the dentists&#x27; every morning.</li>
            <li> B001KYVQ8A Colgate 360 Sonic Power Soft Toothbrush]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It feels natural to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave these as gifts to all my adult children this Christmas.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter that my last Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> The Sonic Complete has 3 cleaning modes versus the 2 on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Environmentally, this unit has a NiMH battery versus the toxic NiCad in the Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li> Soft bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I chose the sensitive and my teeth are not sore.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the gums being damaged as I did with my old brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush far surpassed my expectations in terms of size, weight, sturdiness, quietness and functionality for a sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> provided their teeth and gums are not already so sensitive that sonic toothbrushes would be out of the question.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to buy a second one for my husband.</li>
            <li> I received it early, I charged it up per the instructions but when I went to use it</li>
            <li> i used to use an oral-b professional care electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> only con as always brush heads cost too much</li>
            <li> It started with power intermittent on and off during brushing until it completely gave up.</li>
            <li> but I missed the Sonic action I have been use to.  </li>
            <li> For reference, It&#x27;s as loud as my norelco electric razor.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I trust Oral-B and ordered the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 4000 Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was buying it to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> So far I like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Then there is the quality of the cleaning, which at best is described as disappointing since even after a thorough cleaning, one is left if the sense that something was missed and one reaches for the manual toothbrush to make an extra scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I tend to be an Oral-B fan I really felt this model was middle of the road.  </li>
            <li> I was also surprised by the battery life -</li>
            <li> Lastly, there is no way to tell how much charge remains.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised they even call this a sonic toothbrush (I think somebody already said that in their review here on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth get much cleaner than with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I like the 2 speeds, as I prefer sensitive, as well as the compact size.  </li>
            <li> The Sonic Complete came as a set of two</li>
            <li> so I had to buy this one as the Complete is now discontinued.</li>
            <li> I like how it has a sensitive setting.</li>
            <li> with the optional soft brush heads.</li>
            <li> Also it is much easier to get into the tiny spots...</li>
            <li> but I was not expecting it to completely change my thinking about brushing.  </li>
            <li> Besides the fact that the brush actually delivers on the results, the design is very well thought out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering replacing my professional 4000 with one of these.</li>
            <li> Cons: none so far.    </li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job so far.</li>
            <li> It cleans well, just as promised and I do like the sensitive setting.  </li>
            <li> Before using this toothbrush, had sore gums but the messaging action  of the tooth brush has eliminated this problem.</li>
            <li> I had been using my old Sonicare for years, refusing to upgrade bcz</li>
            <li> I wanted it as soon as I saw it - so sleek &amp; compact - much slimmer than even the newer Sonicares; in fact, the size is comparable to a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problems with this brush so far.</li>
            <li> The actual head does not move much in motion, just vibrates, but I guess that must be the &#x27;sonic&#x27; part.</li>
            <li> Dental checkups have markedly improved.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old oral b electric.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the power of the Sonicare and the shape of the brush head causes it to not get in between my teeth as well.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these so far.</li>
            <li> The vibrating motion of the toothbrush can be changed for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I was just a bit surprised that it did not come with any paper work.</li>
            <li> I owned the oral B Sonic complete toothbrush before, but this one doesn&#x27;t match in quality.  </li>
            <li> I purchased about a dozen just before the old handle</li>

            <li> No indication of when charging is complete</li>
            <li> Nearly every rechargeable electronic device provides indication of when it requires charging.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the inclusion of a travel/storage case would really make sense.  </li>
            <li> No indication of when charging is complete  - Spare brush storage is not covered  -</li>
            <li> Nearly every rechargeable electronic device provides indication of when it requires charging.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the inclusion of a travel/storage case would really make sense.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my young daughter.  </li>
            <li> It is light enough and simple enough for her to use without our help.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to soft, and my dentist recommends soft.</li>
            <li> I frequently travel for work and wanted something that had power yet was compact.</li>
            <li> This product is very lightweight - like holding a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I know my kids when they were young</li>
            <li> After using an Oral B rotating electric for years, this one surpasses the old by leaps and bounds.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely simple, but works very well:  </li>
            <li> Friends are surprised when I turn it on (&amp;#34;That thing is electric?&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Pulsonic seems considerably weaker.</li>
            <li> many have complained here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it has a sensitive mode</li>
            <li> , \\&quot;high\\&quot; mode wasn&#x27;t as powerful as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Thoroughly compelling and my confidence in the product only grows after each subsequent viewing.</li>
            <li> The brush will last ~2-3 weeks before the battery&#x27;s dead (which is handy for traveling), then plug it back in again.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It is slim in the hand and very lightweight, most of my earlier experiments were thick and bulky, and cumbersome to navigate around the mouth.</li>
            <li> It feels good in your hand, just like a regular toothbrush except it has the sonic power behind it.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and after a trip to a couple of stores and seeing the high price on other brands I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that at least one other reviewer experienced the same problem, so I suspect that Oral-B may have a quality problem that some buyers may experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have problems with traditional brushes, but I actually like the weight and size of most other brushes.  </li>
            <li> I would have problems with traditional brushes, but I actually like the weight and size of most other brushes.  </li>
            <li> This is a rather mediocre electric brush compared with other Oral-B products (such as the Triumph, which is excellent) or any of the Sonicare line of brushes.</li>
            <li> When I first used it felt very strange.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and fits easily in your hand.</li>
            <li> Small so easy to pack for travel</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tried any other electric toothbrushes, so I really have nothing to compare this one too.</li>
            <li> Slim size and small head makes it easy to glide around your mouth.</li>
            <li> my old toothbrush and probably provides better cleaning but the head seems very small in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This one is just as good for less than half the money!!  </li>
            <li> , it travels well, it stays clean with a minimal amount of rinsing after each use, the battery lasted me the entirety of a 12 day cruise last summer</li>
            <li> (I got the 50% rebate so it only cost $25) and it seems to be decent at holding a charge so far.</li>
            <li> I suspect that the battery life is not going to be nearly as prolonged as the older larger model which lasted about 5 years.</li>
            <li> I would have given this model a little higher rating, but I feel that even at this price range the toothbrush should really impress me.</li>
            <li> It feels more natural and you brush as you would ordinarily brush with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> - Charging Base...takes up a very small footprint on sink  - Price...much lower than many newer Oral-B/Sonic-care brushes  - Performance...</li>
            <li> I have carpal tunnel on the right and an old stress fracture on the left, so even though this products does what it is supposed to do very well, I will continue to use my larger grip, smoother running Sonicare on  a regular basis and this product only once in  awhile for a \\&quot;spit polish.\\</li>
            <li> My dentist and hygienist also commented on the quick improvement with less plaque on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> but, it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary to use the milder setting to get used to the brush, one didn&#x27;t have to with their older model.</li>
            <li> Used a different brush in the past - this seems better.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for just replacement precision tips - nothing on line.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews complain that you have to cycle from high to low speed them off -</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Press once to turn on high, press again to lower the vibration, press third time to shut off.</li>
            <li> Early model Sonicare were far from perfect, with a heavy and bulky design and brushes that were impossible to fit in tight spaces.</li>
            <li> The bristles were a bit stiff for me at first, but I really like the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I use the second rubber-tipped head for working the gumline, something my dentist always complains I could use some more of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When powered up, the motor is interrupted every thirty seconds with  a little blip to remind the user to move on to the next mouth quadrant.</li>
            <li> I will not be going back to my old tooth brush!!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are a little more expensive, but it works better, too.</li>
            <li> Pulsonic uses special [[ASIN:B001CSZTFK Oral-B Pulsonic Refill Brush Set]] replacement heads, which are priced around the same as other brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The Pulsonic uses special [[ASIN:B001CSZTFK Oral-B Pulsonic Refill Brush Set]] replacement heads, which are priced around the same as other brush heads.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a handy unobtrusive charging station and an extra smaller head for getting hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush head of the Pulsonic is shaped much like a regular toothbrush, and is different than the Professional&#x27;s circular head.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the sonic type my dentist recommended, but it&#x27;s small and light</li>
            <li> Three stars only--it&#x27;s OK, not good.</li>
            <li> Pros  - Small size and light weight  </li>
            <li> in a nutshell, if you&#x27;re looking for a small form factor (both the brush and charger fit in my medium sized toiletry kit -- so it works well for travel),</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how long that really was until I started using the brush.</li>
            <li> Light weight and small handle brush that works well.</li>
            <li> The brush would consistently grow mold over time regardless of how careful I was.  </li>
            <li> I believe this brush head and the speed is much better for my gums compared to the Ora B Cross Action that I had for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li> The first sonicare died after 4 years of use, and I probably spent around $500 for all the sonicare products and systems.</li>
            <li> Even if it turns out to be true as other reviews state an doesnt last but a year or 2</li>
            <li> This one is much smaller, like a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> A full charge lasts for quite a few days.  </li>
            <li> While the Sonicare still has more bells and whistles overall (this could be due to model difference), I&#x27;m willing to sacrifice those little things for what I think is probably one of the two criteria that actually matter: 1)</li>
            <li> I like this product, and had to track it down on Amazon because it is rarely sold in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> The only &#x27;con&#x27; is that only one of our local stores carries the replacement heads and they&#x27;ve marked it up a lot higher than amazon&#x27;s price.  </li>
            <li> and technically they dont have to issue a refund on a personal care item, particularly if it has been used!</li>
            <li> (note that it doesn&#x27;t come with a travel pack, but it&#x27;s hard to go back to using manual brushes after using electric) and looks a lot nicer than competing brushes at this price range (has a more slender, sleek design than bulky cheaper versions).</li>
            <li> My only complaint so far is the lack of additional accessories; such as, travel case(s)/power (more emphasize needed in general on hygiene/bath items/conveniences being ready for travel), and optional brush heads (various shapes and sizes).    </li>
            <li> There are only two cleaning modes (clean and sensitive) vs five for some of its competitors, you can&#x27;t get different size/shape brush heads (other than the pointy Precision Tip brush that comes with it) and it doesn&#x27;t come with any of the nicer amenities like a travel case, brush head covers or a UV</li>
            <li> Have not had a new cavity in same time.</li>
            <li> BUT...allowing battery replacement means you wouldn&#x27;t have to BUY AN ENTIRE NEW UNIT.     </li>
            <li> sent the Oral-B Pulsonic in for repair (my expense) and received an email a week later that they would send me a new unit.  </li>
            <li> For me, the lower front teeth are especially problematic -- they are very tightly spaced, and stains set in easily between the teeth, as well as on the backside.</li>
            <li> Additionally I travel a lot and the toothbrush easily keeps a charge for at least a week and is compact.  </li>
            <li> If you build in \\&quot;planned obsolescence\\&quot; at least give the customer an easy means to recycle the darn thing.    </li>
            <li> Initially I wasn&#x27;t very used to the larger brush size, but it never became a problem.  </li>
            <li> but this one is really uncomfortable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too thin to hold comfortably in the hand.</li>
            <li> After having dealt with my old sonic toothbrush for so long I look at it now and wonder how I ever thought that it was normal to use something the size of a flashlight to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It will be useful for those with partial dentures, or if you had some recent dental work.</li>
            <li> You simply move the brush head gently over your teeth (in the aforementioned circular motion), letting the sonic vibrations perform the work of cleaning and polishing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a slightly whiter smile after using this brush for about a month.</li>
            <li> Still holds charge very well, sounds the same, and cleans the same.</li>
            <li> Well, at the least, I did not want a strong buzzing piece of metal in my mouth and a renegade plastic brush.</li>
            <li> its so small that i was a little fearful that it would not be as effective, but my last visit to the dentist (1-22-12) for a check-up and cleaning, proved it does an even better job of maintaining good dental health.  </li>
            <li> I love the silver and white colors and slim, lightweight design, not to mention the small head, 30 second reminders, and ease of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> However, even though it is a budget-priced model this is a major oversight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, this toothbrush has some drawbacks and a major flaw.  </li>
            <li> There was no other receipt.    </li>
            <li> I have used many different power toothbrushes over the past several years.  </li>
            <li> The sensitive feature is a real plus I found that my other electronic toothbrushes did not have.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like most other brushes are too heavy and bulky to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like most other brushes are too heavy and bulky to use.  </li>
            <li> With this particular model we found that as long as we remove the brush heads when not in use, mildew and foul smells are not a problem at all.  </li>
            <li> I had a brush head that didn&#x27;t snap on well and was coming loose the first 2-3 times I brushed.</li>
            <li> Maybe it could be useful for people with braces or poorly-aligned teeth, but I think for the majority of users it will provide little</li>
            <li> Maybe it could be useful for people with braces or poorly-aligned teeth, but I think for the majority of users it will provide little benefit.     </li>
            <li> Less than half the price of better known models.</li>
            <li> The main reason for the initial discomfort is attempting to use the Pulsonic as a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have an older and more expensive version of the oral-B pulsonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Comparing the Pulsonic to the conventional sonic toothbrushes, the first thing to be noticed is the size.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the size fool you,this little brush has just as much power as some of the big ones and cleans very well.    </li>
            <li> And I tend to be a fan of Oral-B and Braun in general.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One piece of general advice.</li>
            <li> Small form factor, timed cleaning, multiple head types available and rechargeable.</li>
            <li> In addition, there&#x27;s clear benefit with respect to staining which has improved over my first few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> It is small enough to fit any mouth size....</li>
            <li> The two min. timer, broken up into 30 sec intervals is great for people like me who may not brush as long as they should without such a reminder.</li>
            <li> I can actually feel the cleaning action.</li>
            <li> The operation of the toothbrush is basically the same, there&#x27;s one button that you press to cycle between On, Sensitive, and Off.  </li>
            <li> After using the Pulsonic for 3 weeks, my gums seem to be a much healthier shade of pink, with reduced puffiness.  </li>
            <li> He believes that the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action is the key here.</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to the brushing (twirling clock, counter clock) of the Professional 1000.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s enough vibrating to message and (with the soft brushes)</li>
            <li> (so far I recharged it once after the initial charge).      </li>
            <li> I prefer the larger head that was on my old Ultrasonex.</li>
            <li> There is also a timer feature built into the Pulsonic that gives a short lag in the brushing action every 30 seconds for the recommended two minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Design-wise, this Pulsonic is lighter and smaller than the Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li> I eventually went back to my old habits.  </li>
            <li> their factory.&lt;br /&gt;The people will touch all over my tooth brush, take it apart and send it to me.&lt;br /&gt;She told me to read them the number on the toothbrush - then she told me it&#x27;s out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks oral B for making me the consumer that bought this product 3 months ago not liable for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Eleven months later the completely charged Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush would not turn on until connected to the charger.</li>
            <li> This is my second Pulsonic in about two years, and so far (knock on wood)</li>
            <li> The head barely moves.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far have had no complaints with this product, so I am giving it 5 stars, I&#x27;d definitely buy it again with no hesitation!</li>
            <li> Gave as a Christmas present, and as far as I know she enjoys it.</li>
            <li> I like the size and feel even though i can only use on the sensitive</li>
            <li> My Sonicare is several years old and the battery has about had</li>
            <li> Once you have brushed for the professionally recommended 2-minutes, a longer stutter (two breaks in vibration) can be heard and felt.  </li>
            <li> The old one still works, but it will only hold a charge for 3 - 4 days and it used to hold it for 2 weeks (the max I tested it for.)</li>
            <li> Apparently is was manufactured in 08</li>
            <li> I especially like the sensitive mode for myself.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is getting annoyed with me because every time I use it I tell him how much I love it.</li>
            <li> You need Philips Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are good things of this toothbrush, but I think the disappointing things outweigh them.</li>
            <li> I love how thin the handle is</li>
            <li> Use a light touch and slowly move around the gum line.</li>
            <li> I tried this one because the handle is slim, the charger is small &amp; the reviews said the vibration wasn&#x27;t quite as strong as the more expensive one.  </li>
            <li> After using my last Oral-B electric toothbrush for over ten years I decided it was time for a new one and purchased this Sonic.</li>
            <li> new brush has to be twisted into place and the mechanism holds quite a lot of debris...cannot think that this is healthy to be inserting a germ--laden device into my mouth!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is lighter and feels cheaper overall, right down to the charging stand.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy another P&amp;G product as long as I live.    </li>
            <li> My previous power toothbrush was a higher end model from Oral B that I bought years ago.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s small and more affordable than other sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale to replace my old A-series Sonicare, which works fine but is looking a bit tired.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the small brush used to clean along the gum line and between teeth as my mouth tends to form a lot of tartar.</li>
            <li> They were loud, heavy and large in the hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perio Aid products are not available at large drug stores, but you can order them direct from the manufacturer, which is Marquis Dental Manufacturing Company.</li>
            <li> hardly had to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Much quieter than any other unit I have used.    </li>
            <li> Does all that I want it to do and much cheaper than other electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others like Sonicare or the other Oral B</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as powerful as a regular sonicare and definitely not as powerful as my larger oral-b with the circular (non \\&quot;sonic\\&quot;) head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but cheaper than many other sonic brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line- loved it while it worked properly, but is not worth the money considering the poor quality.</li>
            <li> The unit comes with one brush head and one precision tip for cleaning tight spots or around dental work (works pretty well, too).  </li>
            <li> Also, the size of the toothbrush is exactly what i was looking for - barely any different than a manual brush - again smaller than any other</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about what I would get for a 40 toothbrush, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  </li>
            <li> I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  </li>
            <li> This is a slender powerful little brush!</li>
            <li> Summary (per the wife)    - Size...perfect for smaller hands/mouths, but very useful for getting to those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> It comes with a special precision tip brush head, designed for cleaning between teeth and hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a special precision tip brush head, designed for cleaning between teeth and hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> Both teeth have composite fillings that are over 10 years old and have had no other problems, my regular check up with x-rays were only just last month</li>
            <li> I do, and if for no other reason, based on the improvement my son saw from using this toothbrush over a standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It also came with a little flossing attachment that works pretty well.</li>
            <li> directions indicate that some people may experience bleeding of the gums the first few days of use, and while this did not occur for me, as I&#x27;ve already been using sonic toothbrushes, I can see how the sheer power of this toothbrush might cause some bleeding gums for individuals who have so far only been hand-brushing their teeth with sensitive-bristled brushes (as I used to do).</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s true that the brush doesn&#x27;t feel like steel, but my gut feeling is that you probably don&#x27;t need to press it so hard against your teeth anyway.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the cost to replace very year.</li>
            <li> routine includes a general brush over, then a tongue scrape, and then I apply a bit of toothpaste with my finger to the pits of the back teeth and work them over with the Precision Tip.  </li>
            <li> However other than the fact that it&#x27;s quiet, I don&#x27;t really care if a brush is lightweight or slim.  </li>
            <li> However other than the fact that it&#x27;s quiet, I don&#x27;t really care if a brush is lightweight or slim.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s in the On mode, the Pulsonic vibrates in 4, 30 second intervals with a short stutter in between to let you know to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth for a complete 2 minute cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Featuring two cleaning modes: sensitive, and full-power, the Pulsonic makes a discernible difference in dental brightness with regular daily use... brightening teeth two shades in just one week&#x27;s time, in my case of twice daily use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps I have used the old Sonicare for so long that it has colored my view of how an electronic toothbrush should feel.  </li>
            <li> A charge lasts about 2-3 weeks, with 2x a day brushing for at least 90 seconds or if I&#x27;m not in a hurry, the full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have a few impacted teeth, and I didn&#x27;t think a sonic brush would make a difference, but it really does!  </li>
            <li> it works very well and has cut down on gum disease.</li>
            <li> This new Oral B Pulsonic seems to address two problems very well; ticklish gums and the second small pick like brush.  </li>
            <li> that I have one of them in my main home and the other at my beach house.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ergonomically, the handle is too narrow, kind of an awkward fit for a man&#x27;s hand once it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> you may not get clean enough with a regular toothbrush head, this reaches back there nicely an is small enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> ; This one, on the other hand, is quite nice looking, and is the size and approximate shape of a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Other thought: If you are still using manual toothbrushes, then i&#x27;d highly recommend switching to this one.</li>
            <li> I have used other Oral B power tooth brushes and found them to be of consistently high quality.</li>
            <li> If you want to try to mount it on ceramic tile with double-stick foam tape, the available area is about 1 inch tall and 1.75 inches wide, which seems on the small side.</li>
            <li> Colgate has a less intense baking soda toothpaste if you are not used to this type.</li>
            <li> I also thought this toothbrush was much quieter than previous electric toothbrushes we have owned.  </li>
            <li> As far as whitening, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve really seen anything</li>
            <li> Third issue is minor but to turn off unit you have to hit off twice to cycle pass the sensitive mode to the off mode.</li>
            <li> The cord from the charging stand is long enough to reach the plug near your sink basin.</li>
            <li> Like the thin profile too and brushes are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I like the shape of the brush head as it is shaped like a small manual toothbrush rather than the round shape of most of the oral b electric toothbrushes.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had power toothbrushes in the past, more specifically--sonicare ones, and really disliked them.</li>
            <li> &quot; I would not recommend this product for anyone with large hands, previous or current hand injury or nerve damage, or any one with arthritis.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this impacts the efficiency of the brush, but it clearly feels weaker; the brush markedly slows down when applied.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive gums and teeth and the sensitive setting is perfect...there is little to no irritation.  </li>
            <li> The electric cord is about 4 feet long and there are slots on the back and both sides to direct the cord in 3 different directions.</li>
            <li> The size is almost same as regular brush, so I was not sure it would be powerful or not.</li>
            <li> Have not really seen a marked difference considering the price!  </li>
            <li> FoThe old Oral-B Sonic toothbrush heads do not fit the new handle.  </li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive gums there is the sensitive mode which is less abrasive.</li>
            <li> And with the combination of a sleek handle and bristle it&#x27;s easy to get behind the back molars!</li>
            <li> I apply a light to moderate amount of pressure, and have never found the brush to get bogged down.</li>
            <li> To remove the top you push down on a plastic tab, located at the rear of the base, and slide the top portion forward and lift off.  </li>
            <li> To remove the top you push down on a plastic tab, located at the rear of the base, and slide the top portion forward and lift off.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is not bad, but being lured into buying something and than refusing the rebate for very shady reasons does make this purchase a big NO NO.&lt;br /&gt;Why</li>
            <li> It is sized small, will fit in the ceramic toothbrush holder with other regular brushes!</li>
            <li> This model is very lightweight and takes up little space.</li>
            <li> Also it feels a little cheapy compared to Sonic care, and the vibration is a little more rough.</li>
            <li> Whenever I brush, I have to hold the main body and grab or push down the brush head part too.</li>
            <li> That being said, it feels a little weaker than the larger models I&#x27;ve used, but not so much that it doesn&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I called Oral-B support and they are not aware of any such problem but offered to send me a new brush head in the mail.</li>
            <li> Good, but a little clumsy and heavy, but durable.</li>
            <li> Oral-B has introduced a new, extremely slim, power toothbrush that is not much bigger than a traditional (manual) toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The major selling point is that it is small - it is easy to hold and to use in a small mouth.   </li>
            <li> My wife and I consider the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush a 4 and 1/2 star product, and we highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a powered brush but doesn&#x27;t want the typical fat-handled, noisy products that have always been the norm.1/4 clockwise turn.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I consider the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush a 4 and 1/2 star product, and we highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a powered brush but doesn&#x27;t want the typical fat-handled, noisy products that have always been the norm.</li>
            <li> This is my third one of these over three years, and I will buy a new one next year if I can get my hands on one when this one breaks down.</li>
            <li> I am a dental professional and prefer this brush for several reasons: It is lighter  and easier to manipulate; packs easily into a ziplock sandwich bag on the go; both brush and replacement heads are far less expensive than sonicare and the clinical results are identical.  </li>
            <li> When I called them back they apologetically agreed that there was no other way to get additional precision tips without getting three regular toothbrush heads - a complete waste.  </li>
            <li> The body of the Pulsonic is very thin, about 2/3 that of the latest generation Sonicare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: it&#x27;s become annoying but still is very effective.</li>
            <li> I find it to be a very poor performer when compared to the alternative solutions from Oral B. Save your money and buy one of the better engineered Oral B power tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> This one is about half the size of the previous generation, and equally powerful.    </li>
            <li> other reviewers here note that this model requires you to move the brush in circular motions, but I always did that with my old electric toothbrushes, too.</li>
            <li> one just died of old age the other dropped and quit soon after.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oral-B Pulsonic for my wife, who&#x27;s former high end rotary Oral-B toothbrush broke a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Turn it on, move it around, rinse it, wipe it off with a towel and put it back in the base, which could be a little more stable, but works just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always felt he scrubbing and spinning action though somewhat weak compared to a more expensive brush really made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less than two years ago, my husband and I bought new electric tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li> but it was not nearly as powerful as the Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush which I am currently using.</li>
            <li> Now, only time will tell if the Oral-B Pulsonic will last as long as its predecessor, so 4 stars, not 5.</li>
            <li> I have had an Oral B for 3 years but they only last so long</li>
            <li> The main objection I have is that it&#x27;s too harsh.  </li>
            <li> The bristle pattern is a little more comfortable than my Sonicare and while it \\&quot;blips\\&quot; every 30 seconds to let you know to brush a different section of your teeth, it doesn&#x27;t shut off after 2 minutes like the Sonicare, which I find mildly annoying.  </li>
            <li> The only replacement heads for this toothbrush have three regular brushes and only a single precision tip.</li>
            <li> only slight drawback (minimal) is how you switch modes, essentially need to press the main button for toggling through them and turning the toothbrush off.  </li>
            <li> Thin and lightweight with special grips</li>
            <li> The first one stood up to wear and tear for 5 years at the hands and mouths of 2 adults, but a crack formed in the plastic near the base (possibly the battery inside was just old and starting to swell) and we suspect too much moisture got into it.  </li>
            <li> The head does not move, the complete body of the toothbrush simply has this vibration that when you put it against your teeth, it does nothing but hum slightly.</li>
            <li> Regardless of which brush you choose, please take the time to ask your dentist to teach you how to use it properly: apply gently at a 45 degree angle targeting the gum line; don&#x27;t move the brush back and forth, don&#x27;t push hard</li>
            <li> but I am certain my teeth are already whiter than they were and less stained!!</li>
            <li> Fits in small mouths but cleans no worse for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> This is my first negative review of any product on any website.  </li>
            <li> I need to focus on gum health, and this small head provide accuracy and a very reassuring sensation--</li>
            <li> called the company to complain and request an extension to warranty and was flatly rejected by both a service rep and her manager Lori.</li>
            <li> A charge will last you for your long weekends away from home.  </li>
            <li> Portable electric toothbrush that caters to both short and long term travel.</li>
            <li> long and only 11/16\\&quot; (just under 3/4\\&quot;) around at the thickest part of the handle.  </li>
            <li> A timer imbedded in brush lets you know how long you have brushed in minute intervals.</li>
            <li> My complaint is not with the product itself (has worked fine for the few weeks we&#x27;ve had them), but with Amazon for the advertising of the rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, after a few days of brushing, I went to the directions to see why my new toothbrush kept pausing or hesitating after a couple minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li> Because I live in Australia I couldn&#x27;t return this when it dies unceremoniously after  a few weeks.</li>
            <li> the battery last for for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have less tooth and gum pain and don&#x27;t even need to use sensitive toothpaste as often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sorry - if it was solid construction, it would otherwise be fabulous.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oral-B Pulsonic to replace my old one which is probably at least 6 years old.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so thin, it also vibrates super forcefully in the hand and hurts.</li>
            <li> I am not new to electric toothbrushes but having recently purchased the Clairsonic, pulsating technology for my face and bocy, I thought I&#x27;d also try pulsonic tech for my teeth.</li>
            <li> A single push of the power/mode button activates the power toothbrush in \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode, while a second push of the button switches the toothbrush into \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; mode.  </li>
            <li> While brushing, the Pulsonic toothbrush provides a short stutter (a single break in vibration), at 30-second intervals, to let you know that you are supposed to switch quadrants in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> We had previously used a more expensive sonic toothbrush and found that it was prone to collect moisture where the brush heads attached and mildew would develop which was tough to clean away (the visible mildew could be removed but the smell was still there).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before the last one died, the toothbrush heads were loose and fell off while using.</li>
            <li> the pulsing/vibration was pretty strong and annoying.  </li>
            <li> &quot; (You&#x27;re supposed to brush maximum 2 minutes by brushing one half of the top teeth for 30 seconds, then the other, then half of the bottom teeth, and then the other half.)</li>
            <li> It otherwise has the same features as other electronic toothbrushes ie 2 minute notification, as well as 4 30 second interruptions to let you know to move around in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Whereas other electric tooth brushes come with various different heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked at the oral B Pulsonic and decided to switch due to its smaller diameter like a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used other electric toothbrushes and looking at my wife&#x27;s very expensive electric toothbrush, one thing that really stands out is how light and slim this unit is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electrical brushes for several years including other oral b products, but they&#x27;ve never shown such a long battery life.     </li>
            <li> Not to mention the extra brush to clean small hard to get to places like crowns or around braces.</li>
            <li> You see, my sonicare has broken one month exactly after its warranty ran out - TWICE!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not for me and my teeth were not better at my dental appointment like a high end Sonicare.</li>
            <li> it really gets those hard to reach places...</li>
            <li> Well, I found out what sonic action is,  even on the low setting, with very little noise, about a 2 on the 10 scale.  </li>
            <li> At eight and a half inches long, and less than three quarters of an inch in diameter at the base, this beautifully ergonomically designed toothbrush balances effortlessly in one&#x27;s hand, with batteries down toward the base of the brush just heavy enough to provide perfect balance while brushing.</li>
            <li> (my older one lasted on the lower side of this equation) only to have to throw it and the useless, spare, brand new brushes I have away</li>
            <li> After having the whole brush replaced by Oral B twice, I am asking for a complete refund- disappointing because the old complete Oral B sonic toothbrush I had worked much better- do not buy this item unless you want to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> We took them on a long weekend and didn&#x27;t take the chargers.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to a long use of this product.  </li>
            <li> I charge it for a day before a week long trip</li>
            <li> Only when applying a minimal amount of pressure do you get the vibration feeling at the end of the brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a really loud one and it doesn&#x27;t need any batteries, it has a recharger.  </li>
            <li> 13 year old likes narrow brush for around braces.</li>
            <li> You should definitely give this a try if you&#x27;re ready to switch from a regular toothbrush to a electric sonic type, or if you are tired of paying a premium for the Sonicare replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely long.</li>
            <li> like it might not hold up as long as my Sonicare did.  </li>
            <li> I am a long time Sonicare user.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold its charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how long it stays charged.  </li>
            <li> I like how its small, has two settings, and is the normal toothbrush shape.</li>
            <li> I had a few years old Sonicare</li>
            <li> With the timer, my son knows for how long he needs to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable and not recommended for those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> On Long Island.</li>
            <li> and I was looking forward to using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Hold a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried to get a replacement head for this and the one soft Oral B head I could find does not fit this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> keeps it  charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is very slim and it costs a little less than a comparable product from Sonicare (like the Essence 5300).  </li>
            <li> After searching for fine print, we went ahead with the purchase as we were unable to locate any other details of the rebate except that it was a $20 mail in to be postmarked prior to April 1.  </li>
            <li> acquiring this device I wondered if it would soon join the collection of previous failed attempts at \\&quot;better and easier oral hygiene through technology\\</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why they made the brush lighter, so it will be easier to use and less fatiguing when you have to do the extra work of moving the brush head back and forth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why they made the brush lighter, so it will be easier to use and less fatiguing when you have to do the extra work of moving the brush head back and forth.      </li>
            <li> Compared to a cheaper (and also a more expensive) sonicate that I previously had</li>
            <li> I scrolled through my past Amazon purchases to see that I had purchased it exactly 18 months previous.  </li>
            <li> It is possible that I received a defective head, but receiving a defective head in a sample of one is not a positive sign.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush technology has come a long way!</li>
            <li> Also, the brush head is much smaller with fewer frills than other sonic brushes I have tried.      </li>
            <li> That said, I think that personal preferences are so different, that people with larger hands might find it too small.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush is low quality and does not stand up to other toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Oral b said they did not offer the guarantee on this model, but only on a couple of other models.  </li>
            <li> The charger requires a smaller space than the other electric toothbrush I used.</li>
            <li> It seems other people have had the same problem with the brush head popping off while brushing too.  </li>
            <li> I bet this slim little Pulsonic doesn&#x27;t have a big enough battery to do that.</li>
            <li> When you take the brush head off the handle you can see that the design simply doesn&#x27;t allow for any movement other than vibreation.  </li>
            <li> I have seen other people use different brands of electric toothbrushes, and in comparison they all seemed louder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with other vibrating style electric brushes, only the oscillating ones.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband when his other Oral B finally died.  </li>
            <li> 3)The &#x27;waterpik&#x27;-sized (very small) type brush attachment really gets in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> chose this one over other more expensive models due to</li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten one of these long time ago!</li>
            <li> This one is much lighter, doesn&#x27;t have as many cycles, and the brush head is awkward and the hard part bumps other teeth.</li>
            <li> I have to remember to let it run down completely some time in the next few months as the instructions suggest.  </li>
            <li> not used to the hard brittle of the toothbrush, especially i always use the soft manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Battery charge lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does not have a very long cord.</li>
            <li> It was time to replace it because it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> ,slim, hhold the charge a very long time</li>
            <li> only bad thing about oral B is that too many products are made in China.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s removable, so you can rinse it off in the sink and dry it off.</li>
            <li> I do notice that my brush head does dry faster because it doesn&#x27;t have a cover.</li>
            <li> After a few attempts at hybridizing its antique rotary brush system with ultrasonic technology, Braun/Oral-B is finally shipping a proper ultrasonic brush: the Pulsonic.    </li>
            <li> I had purchased a Crest Spinbrush (probably a few years ago), and finally  started using it in the last year.  </li>
            <li> After getting addicted to it, i tried my old manual toothbrush and could clearly notice that my tooth were feeling like not cleaned at all.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they will at least offer a Pulsonic travel case, as an optional accessory, in the near future.  </li>
            <li> Hopefullythey will at least offer a Pulsonic travel case, as an optional accessory, in the near future.  </li>
            <li> The bristles barely move, I mean barely.  </li>
            <li> The battery life was also limited to about a week between charges.</li>
            <li> * Warranty:  2-Year Limited</li>
            <li> The front of the toothbrush handle has a single power/mode button and three indicator lights.  </li>
            <li> This is designed to help you spend the right amount of time in the four quadrants of your mouth, and has always seemed silly to me, but after using it for a while I am following the routine without even thinking.  </li>
            <li> it last as long as my previous oral b (10yrs)</li>
            <li> Brushing the top teeth for me is an unpleasant experience.</li>
            <li> This one has two speeds, is slim enough even for small mouths, and last a long time on a charge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the savings, in the end it will come back in dentist visits.  </li>
            <li> The brush head has never come loose.  </li>
            <li> Seems like the vibration is making the brushhead loose</li>
            <li> Loose brush head - After some time and use, the brush head (or the mechanism itself) starts to become loose and can pop off.  </li>
            <li> The recharger feels &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; as the toothbrush fits loosely into a hole type slot.</li>
            <li> It all comes down to personal preference.</li>
            <li> Let them go down with Big Auto.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable (handle buzzes far, far more than any other electric brush I&#x27;ve used), the head is poorly shaped to get at tight spots, and the build quality is a notch below other Oral-B products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow, this thing is so active I can not use the stiff brush on it&#x27;s lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I had used three different powered brushes and was indifferent to their performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have now been using this toothbrush daily for a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Another small but obvious feature that you&#x27;d only notice if it was not there</li>
            <li> This takes the place of the usual multi-button brush with a variety of settings, only one of which you actually wind up using.        </li>
            <li> - Possibly replaceable battery (There is a small screw at the bottom and the manual says it is for proper battery disposal)    </li>
            <li> Though small and relatively inexpensive, this toothbrush also comes with a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode and a \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; mode, a big plus.  </li>
            <li> the 2 previous ones have lasted only about 2.5 years.</li>
            <li> but after a year and a half it suddenly turned on by itself and would not turn off until you put it on the charger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike the typical oscillating head type power toothbrushes that Oral-B is known for, which require the user to simply hold the head on each tooth for cleaning, this Pulsonic model requires you to move the head around in a circular motion while cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The vibration speed remains the same, but the intensity becomes gentler and feels less abrasive against your teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The other drawbacks are relatively minor.  </li>
            <li> I have only pressed the power button by accident while brushing a couple times and this was because I was holding it too tightly.  </li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve only had this one for a few months but even if it only lasts as long as some of the others I&#x27;ve owned, at least I&#x27;m only paying 1/3 or 1/2 the price for it</li>
            <li> However, after only a few months, the gray plastic piece on the front started coming loose and eventually fell off.</li>
            <li> previous one was a little bigger in the hand while this new handpiece is small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a cavity, but the dentist always complains that my gums are a little too puffy or too red.  </li>
            <li> When powered up, the motor is interrupted every thirty seconds with  a little blip to remind the user to move on to the next mouth quadrant.</li>
            <li> The brush also felt a little different.  </li>
            <li> I also like that the brush head is a little larger than others I have used.</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper rechargeable toothbrush, and when I used this one, I was surprised at how hard it felt brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> my SIX YEAR OLD (who i bought a phillips sonic toothbrush for) said why are your bristles so hard, they cant bend.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that brush is hard to get on and off, especially when you have wet hands.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; vibrations are weak and easy to slow down if pressed against my teeth.</li>
            <li> After trying this toothbrush I had to vent my anger somwhere :-)    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like the \\&quot;pulsonic\\&quot; action as well as the old standby, but I was wrong...</li>
            <li> get AT LEAST a week of brushing (2x a day, plus an occasional spot up) before a recharge, so it&#x27;s not too much of a big deal.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I would like a smaller head.    </li>
            <li> as expected.</li>
            <li> Do not like the 30 sec reminder.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding these at my local grocers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now, and it still works just as expected.</li>
            <li> and it gets slippery when it gets wet while you brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The lower \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; speed does not tickle the gums, and the pick like brush allows me to carefully brush the gum line and the crevices between teeth.  </li>
            <li> keep your receipt the button jammed on mine after 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Once you destroy gum tissue it never comes back.  </li>
            <li> Not wanting to spend the amounts I had already spent</li>
            <li> Because I brush my teeth while in the shower my electric toothbrushes get completely wet.  </li>
            <li> I know that some people seem to brush their teeth with their mouth virtually closed</li>
            <li> If you are the person who keeps your teeth clinched and your mouth closed around the brush, you might have the brush problem.  </li>
            <li> everyday after use, over charge is not possible.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints yet for this product.  </li>
            <li> The lady was polite, but I told her I was upset that I wasted my money on their product, and I will not be buying from them in the future.      </li>
            <li> This may have been an isolated occurrence, but after using it for about two years, I still would not have expected the unit to come apart the way it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having had a round head Oral-b toothbrush in the pass that is what I will go back to.  </li>
            <li> I just point my pulsonic away from the sink to avoid getting it wet.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it keeps slipping out.</li>
            <li> I do not really believe any toothbrush that says it whitens teeth</li>
            <li> It is not really a sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are much harder that the models before.</li>
            <li> I was told I had to go to a Braun service center.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for over a year and have absolutely no complaints.  </li>
            <li> My dad had just bought it a few weeks prior for the price you see here and had recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I prefer this brush head&#x27;s shape to the round ones as I think it is similar to that which we have been trained to use.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts for about a week before recharging, while the heads come in a wide variety of firmness and designs.  </li>
            <li> These stay charged all the time and work well even when taken on short trips for a few days without the charger.</li>
            <li> Switch once opened can not be closed.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried tiny round head</li>
            <li> That is a result of poor flossing for much longer than I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd type of rechargeable in 5 years because the batteries have died within a few months of the warranty expiring</li>
            <li> The Sonic Complete is probably twice as thick.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t love is the cord is in the base - not detachable</li>
            <li> - While not a huge breaking point, this model does offer quiet operation.  </li>
            <li> I hold my lips way back and usually have my upper and lower teeth apart, not biting down.  </li>
            <li> I do not use the other brush for between teeth because I am in the habit of always flossing before brushing which is faster than using that brush, but if you hate flossing, the little \\&quot;between\\&quot; brush would be a good thing to use.</li>
            <li> Really annoying such a big company doesn&#x27;t invest in a user friendly website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> so it costs me less than half the shelf price I saw at local store.</li>
            <li> On a regular basis however I keep it in the charging base when I&#x27;m not using it because I feel that when you pull it straight off the charger the power output is much stronger than if you were to have it sitting on the counter the previous day or two.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who likes to brush his or her teeth the old fashioned way but with a serious power boost.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about buying this brush, since it was smaller than typical electric brushes and because it is a \\&quot;store</li>
            <li> Other than looks, this toothbrush has no positive attributes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very sure my teeth are now whiter than before, but I do feel like it&#x27;s now less likely to have anything \\&quot;grows\\</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the process to get that rebate was a little more than confusing.</li>
            <li> Same thing -- vibration, but very little bristle movement.  </li>
            <li> I brushed my teeth with it a couple of times, but unless you use it like a manual brush, there is very little cleaning done by this vibration.  </li>
            <li> But a few weeks later, it just stopped working, so because the cost of a replacement is much less than dental care, I am purchasing another one.  </li>
            <li> I think this is the next step up if you are not sure you will like a sonic.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy any other toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Make note that there are other reviews that make note of this defect.</li>
            <li> The brush is thinner than other brushes I have used.  </li>
            <li> cleans extremely well, takes a week or so to get used to it.     </li>
            <li> My girlfriend got a more expensive electric toothbrush and she is jealous of mine now because mine is so sleek and compact and my battery stays charged for at least a week when hers lasts a day or so before it&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other CONs:  vibrates rather than pulses / head twists off during brushing.  </li>
            <li> I am not able to return the toothbrush, despite its low quality.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other electric toothbrush this one has no moving parts</li>
            <li> and I do now prefer it due to</li>
            <li> I read some reviews from other users online and all said that it had to be a faulty brush head.</li>
            <li> Once I started using it, there were two other differences.</li>
            <li> The extra brush head supplied (the small tipped one)</li>
            <li> The reason for this was due to the brush head since I had already picked up a replacement pack.</li>
            <li> OTHER COMMENTS:    </li>
            <li> I especially like the additional small brush head that comes with it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush came without any sort of carrying or travel case, which my other electric toothbrush had.  </li>
            <li> I dont seem to have any problems with my button like I have read in other reviews for this toothbrush yet.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t do that pulsing that some other do</li>
            <li> This product was relavitely inexpensive and does not have the &amp;#34;bells and whisles&amp;#34; as some of the other models but it does the job quite well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of the expensive electric toothbrushes and after my last one (Sonicare) finally died, I figured I&#x27;d try a cheaper model and see if it&#x27;s any different.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a pain to have it falling over when stood up due to</li>
            <li> /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;- Extremely slim and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> *  - Extremely slim and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if the tips were compatible with other Oral-B brushes (Triumph series).</li>
            <li> Unlike other Oral B toothbrushes, this one does not give a pressure warning.</li>
            <li> Its versatility is endless.</li>
            <li> It is quieter than other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all due to this.</li>
            <li> But compared to other electric toothbrushes, $40 is a steal.</li>
            <li> I think this should have lasted longer based on the reviews I&#x27;ve seen for other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a very expensive Sonicare which has the major drawback of being very bulky.</li>
            <li> Tough to get replacement brushes at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy the round spinning one instead.</li>
            <li> I  have so far found the single biggest complaint is that my usual rather aggressive style of use needs to be restrained, or the brush head will twist off of the body.</li>
            <li> &gt;— Oral-B advises you to completely drain the battery every few months, which is hard to do when it&#x27;s charging every time you put it on its stand.</li>
            <li> It is outdated and the replacement heads now cost the amount of a new toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li> The pulsing takes some getting used to, but I have a small jaw and regular-sized brushes -- even the rotary brushes -- may be difficult to fit into the tight areas.  </li>
            <li> Those tooth brushes cost roughly $20 each and were rechargeable and typically lasted me 2 years.  </li>
            <li> Batteries last 3-5 years (meaning 3 years), AND once the battery is exhausted and no longer holds a charge, you have to throw away the entire unit.    </li>
            <li> it has a 60 second timer where it does a short burst so you can regulate your brushing, two power setting, lasts a long time on one charge, replacement heads are not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Thank heavens the charger is small -- my previous one was bigger than the toothbrush itself.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, especially negative ones, but I strongly felt that I needed to do this one....    </li>
            <li> They have a dual cleaning head, one part of the head goes up and down, the other part of the head spins.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the generic brands, and have found they do just as well as the Oral-B brand, with some cost savings, but you are still going to pay, and they do need replacement at least every other month or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before I received the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush I was using the conventional, bulky, sonic toothbrush (Philips Sonicare).  </li>
            <li> conventional toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the traditional brush head as opposed to the small round one of other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> only criticism is that you periodically have to clean tooth paste gunk from the charging base.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money.  </li>
            <li> One last thing don&#x27;t press hard let the brush do the work.</li>
            <li> The head seems a bit big to me and therefore is hard to get is some of the tighter spots of my mouth.</li>
            <li> At least their ultrasonic technology was clinically proven to fight gum disease by hitting plaque several millimeters below the gum line, whereas Oral-B&#x27;s rotary brushes were nothing but glorified tooth polishers.    </li>
            <li> This is about average for an electric brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some reviews claiming this is not a powerful brush.</li>
            <li> works for small mouths, i.e. children  maneuverable  long battery life (between charge)  </li>
            <li> least one extra replacement head included</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see how one could go wrong with either brand&#x27;s lightweight sonic model.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish the tip whirled in a circle.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I don&#x27;t want to seem like a Sonicare fanatic.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that Oral B doesn&#x27;t make a travel case for it</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars if the replacement heads were not so expensive (almost as much as the brush itself) and if the rebate advertised with the product had not already expired (which I did not realize until after I purchased the brush).</li>
            <li> I dont know how many time can this battery be charged, although the user guide said &#x27;you can put it on the base unit(charger)</li>
            <li> Even worse: you have to power through the sensitive mode and hit the button twice to turn it off to save yourself from this...</li>
            <li> The charging base either needs to be weighted or should have better griping foot pads to prevent it from sliding all over the place.  </li>
            <li> The charging base either needs to be weighted or should have better griping foot pads to prevent it from sliding all over the place.  </li>
            <li> A typical use requires me to twist the head back on at least 3 times during one brushing.</li>
            <li> I think in choosing it will come down to which one is on sale or even color/style preference.</li>
            <li> The movement is up and down.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t drool down your hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping they will wear down soon.</li>
            <li> The brush is designed to be waterproof, but, in the interest of prolonging the life of the electronics, it can&#x27;t hurt to wipe the thing down before you put it away.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> (overcharging may lead to unit breaking down)</li>
            <li> The curve of the brush head may be part of why I feel this way because it doesn&#x27;t sit completely flush or even; but on the other hand it does reach behind my wisdom teeth which the Sonicare had trouble doing.  </li>
            <li> After the battery ran out, I plugged the charger into an adapter (as I do with all other rechargeable devices) and NOTHING!</li>
            <li> I also have to use a regular toothbrush or my circular oral-b to get tight, hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> My usual practice was to use it only once a day, using a traditional brush otherwise, so I was shocked when it suddenly seized up just outside the warranty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of silly that it is only 110Volts! :(  </li>
            <li> The noise was startling at first, a shrill buzz that reminded me of another reason I never took to electrics: it shatters the quiet ritual of morning and evening brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are a little expensive, but not much different than other similar toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to since it&#x27;s so thin compared to the old Oral it replaced</li>
            <li> The small charging base simply plugs into an available A/C outlet and sits on your countertop.  </li>
            <li> It feels very thick and bulky in the mouth compared to the Sonicare which makes it harder to use properly to reach all areas of teeth.</li>
            <li> We have used the Pulsonic for several years only to find out that it is impossible to buy a new one and that its replacement brushes tend to be defective and hard to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too bad: this toothbrush is sleek, silent, and looks like an advance on previous models.</li>
            <li> I had to toss mine after less than a year, the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge.  </li>
            <li> Ill still give the brush 3stars because I actually did like it, no head falling off issues like some reviews, its compact enough to travel with and it cleans like you think a sonic should.  </li>
            <li> With that, I&#x27;ll repeat my recommendation that people who have slightly inflamed gums, or gums teetering towards developing gum disease may get some valuable help from this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I found there&#x27;s quite a price variance, although they are less than Sonicare replacements at any rate.    </li>
            <li> I was using a battery operated Oral-B toothbrush previously</li>
            <li> from vibrating your hand slightly, and doing nothing for your teeth, the head comes off easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having tried multiple rotary style brushes and battery-operated pulse brushes, I was a bit wary on the switch to a Sonic/pulse brush since she was quite fond of her former brush.     </li>
            <li> bought it about a month after my previous (2-3X the price)</li>
            <li> While they&#x27;re typically waterproof, I always worry about damaging it anyway.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of sinktop, and I appreciate the fact that this toothbrush takes up less space.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a gap between brush head and handle, so there&#x27;s less place for crud to build</li>
            <li> and it vibrates so intensely in my hand that it is painful to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why anyone would give this toothbrush less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> one less thing to pack.  </li>
            <li> This has also happened on previous Oral-B power toothbrushes I have owned.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for less than two years and it died this week (</li>
            <li> the reason I have it less stars).  </li>
            <li> and of course the half price rebate helped also.</li>
            <li> That means less time in the hygenist chair.</li>
            <li> The only problem is replacement heads are quite expensive and there are no generic options.</li>
            <li> Less vibration in the handle.  </li>
            <li> + toothbrushes for half of that.</li>
            <li> He said he doesn&#x27;t have to push on it like he did the previous one he had.</li>
            <li> I previously had an Oral B sonic toothbrush that lasted 5 years</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Affordable (less than $70)&lt;br/&gt;Slim design&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Precision</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is cleaning my teeth, or shaking them loose!  </li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> It gets into tight areas and along the gum line if you need it to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The company&#x27;s explanation is that the unit is water tight so removing the battery breaks that seal.</li>
            <li> I tried to go back to the toothbrush and found out the hard way!</li>
            <li> The brush itself is rather petite, but this makes getting into tight areas a little easier.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because it is half the price of some of the other major brands</li>
            <li> easy to take on vacation without the base charger.    </li>
            <li> * Non-contact charging mechanism is less efficient than a wired connection and therefore wastes energy  *</li>
            <li> Make things less messy on the bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the charging base is just as easy.  </li>
            <li> She also wishes that the charging base was weighted, so that it wouldn&#x27;t slide around on the counter so easily.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning the charging base is just as easy.  </li>
            <li> - Charging base slides around countertop too easily  -</li>
            <li> She also wishes that the charging base was weighted, so that it wouldn&#x27;t slide around on the counter so easily.  </li>
            <li> The brush does vibrate heavily and sends a &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; through your mouth when the head touches your teeth instead of the bristles, but you get use to it and using it makes that happen less often.</li>
            <li> My hygenist always says she has nothing to do on my visits because I have so little plaque.</li>
            <li> : Slim, takes up little counter space, gets my teeth</li>
            <li> Well, I was a little bit sceptical about this product when decided to buy.</li>
            <li> i had used phillips, &#x27;sonic care&#x27; brand for about 7 years before discovering this little gem.  </li>
            <li> You lose a little power by buying this item, which says for $33 or so.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel cleaner and with little effort.</li>
            <li> A little pricy for 2 years of brushing.</li>
            <li> takes up little space on a counter as well as in a travel bag.  </li>
            <li> A little jumping through hoops by a company who should NOT make the consumer do this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also like the little Precision brush that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one for a little over a year</li>
            <li> This works just as well, but might seem a little flimsier than its predecessor.</li>
            <li> The little flossing pick that came with</li>
            <li> I found a place that replaced my battery in a previous brush, but on this one, the copper wire broke, and it was unable to be fixed</li>
            <li> Terrible, I was expecting an easy transaction, just a simple toothbrush</li>
            <li> We just bought a new sonicare base and it was within 4$ of what I spent for this brush, so you can no longer argue that they are in different categories.  </li>
            <li> It does not clean like the round head Oral-b toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I am very tired of spending 50$ or so a year on new brush heads between my wife and I.  </li>
            <li> That one was heavy and unwieldy and nothing like this little powerhouse.</li>
            <li> A company should stand behind their product; offer, at the very least, a reasonable outlet to recycle something.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 3 different ones over the years and have not liked or stuck with any of them.  </li>
            <li> Only a few reviews made note of this: the brush head does not lock on to the base very well.</li>
            <li> With its battery now almost dead, I replaced it with the Pulsonic, which I thought was an advance in design.</li>
            <li> I had a few cavities and he recommended this one to me.  </li>
            <li> When I got tired of the [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] model (too big for my mouth)</li>
            <li> It took a few days for me to get used to this unit as</li>
            <li> (these are not cheap)</li>
            <li> Now, although the toothbrush does well, the cost of replacement heads is not cheap.  </li>
            <li> brush head is the same approximate size as my Sonic Complete heads, but is not even vaguely interchangable.  </li>
            <li> Update went dead after one year.</li>
            <li> I wore the tip out within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Even on the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting, the brushing can be a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Pulsonic for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> : Noise, base is too light</li>
            <li> The sonicare was ridiculously heavy.</li>
            <li> comparing to my sonicare, some things missing from the pulsonic would be the automatic shutoff, the brush head covers, and the UV brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of exclusively using this toothbrush there was no noticeable whiteness difference for my teeth.</li>
            <li> But I am returning mine and have now wasted money and time.</li>
            <li> Dropped it in the sink one time... dead as Dillinger.</li>
            <li> I have seen a few reviews about the brush falling off</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and got this Braun Pulsonic - what a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Takes a few days to adapt to this style of brushing, so</li>
            <li> So, if you are like me and are looking for a temporary toothbrush for your trip abroad don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> It also holds a charge for a few days when traveling, even after a few months.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes of brushing they are gone, just like when I went to the hygienist.</li>
            <li> I have had a few electronic toothbrushes</li>
            <li> We tried gluing it, but predictably it broke again because of the vibration.</li>
            <li> It is not a secure locking head like Sonicare which is frustrating when you are changing angles to brush and find you have to stop and put the head back on.</li>
            <li> This makes it difficult to take with you when traveling, especially considering you need to take the charger, the brush and the other brush head.    </li>
            <li> so was a little skeptical that this little Oral-B could do the same job at about half the price.  </li>
            <li> there is no easy means of recycling.</li>
            <li> While I like the small footprint of the charging base, I find it a bit too light, which causes it to slide around on the countertop too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes the toothbrush relatively useless for traveling, unless your trip is less then two weeks (in which case the battery will probably last).</li>
            <li> At first, I was shocked.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even on the sensitive setting, it hurt on impact, and I&#x27;m not talking a little, I mean alot.  </li>
            <li> Over the past few months, I realized something.</li>
            <li> Maufacturers must delight in purposely frustrating consumers by forcing us to buy &amp;#34;improved &amp;#34; products with minor changes.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because it simply seemed like one of those vibrating toothbrushes that you can buy at the store for about $6.</li>
            <li> Finally an electric toothbrush that fits a woman&#x27;s hand, unlike all of those other big clunkers that I came to hate.  </li>
            <li> Too bad... I will buy the more expensive ones I guess.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the brush is too firm for comfort, so I am using it at low speed.</li>
            <li> I hate how the brush head gets stuck on my Professional model, so this is a big advantage of the Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li> shady: the rebate center denied the rebate request due to a wrong upc label.</li>
            <li> i like it because it&#x27;s compact, takes up very little counter space.  </li>
            <li> The whitening is usually the toothpaste anyway.</li>
            <li> - may be too small for some hands  </li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of the cheaper battery operated toothbrushes in the past.  </li>
            <li> The only way I can see this happening is if you fail to twist it all the way into position without realizing it.  </li>
            <li> (even the charger is not the usual eyesore).      </li>
            <li> Because two of my Philips Sonicare toothbrushes failed in the last four years, I wanted to find an alternative but this one is not even close.  </li>
            <li> Small handle.</li>
            <li> the handle is so small</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oral-B makes a small brush for people with braces, but it&#x27;s ineffective at getting out in-between teeth stains.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just received a faulty battery</li>
            <li> turn this thing on with the small tipped brush head and let it sit on the stain for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a small one --  </li>
            <li> SMALL AND COMPACT COMPARED TO PHILLIPS</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> This toothbrush also continues to vibrate past two minutes, which is either a boon if you take longer than two minutes to brush your teeth or an annoyance if you have to shut it off.  </li>
            <li> Had the head remained locked, I would have given this toothbrush four stars for its small size and weight.  </li>
            <li> Had the head remained locked, I would have given this toothbrush four stars for its small size and weight.  </li>
            <li> (forgot what they call it) and the fact that it continues to brush past 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I like this products small package and ease of use.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended getting an electric toothbrush to improve my dental health, so after a small bit of research, i purchased the oral-b pulsonic.</li>
            <li> There was no misuse or excessive wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small size makes it easier than bulky brushes to get to all the teeth.</li>
            <li> The tiny brush (floss head) supplied with it is useless.  </li>
            <li> It fails to charge, trying to charge it in different places to no avail.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush after using a Sonicare for the past two years.  </li>
            <li> Between the battery life and small size</li>
            <li> This has all the benefits of an electric toothbrush in a small and compact form factor.</li>
            <li> Another problem is that the brush replacements include a useless 4th brush with a tiny head.</li>
            <li> Being so small</li>
            <li> I usually use the oral b oscillating toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Since the individual charger was way too expensive</li>
            <li> I like it because it is small in size.</li>
            <li> I have juvenile peridontitis</li>
            <li> It is small</li>
            <li> This replace my crest sonic, which I&#x27;ve been unable to find recently in stores.</li>
            <li> The base is not too large, so it is not a huge annoyance to pack.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any of the problems some other reviewers have with the brush coming off etc.  </li>
            <li> Granted, it is less expensive than other models, but this is a case where you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> If you press hard with electric toothbrushes the tips stay still, the bristles flex in the middle, and FAIL to brush.</li>
            <li> The brush head DOES NOT STAY ON ITS BASE and vibrates off constantly while in use, leaving a big piece of plastic in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> It is very uncomfortable as it vibrates the teeth unless you use the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li> And an added bonus is that the replacement heads are even less expensive and the brush it self had a $15 rebate so less than the cheapest Sonicare too.    </li>
            <li> However, as soon as I turned on the brush, the vibrations travelled down the handle and proved to be irritating to both my hand and my gums.</li>
            <li> For my money, the power on this electric toothbrush is a little on the weak side.  </li>
            <li> still miss my Interplak with rotary head that lasted me 15 years before the battery couldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore &amp; brushes were near impossible to find.</li>
            <li> &amp; then the old replacement heads became impossible to find.  </li>
            <li> him bcz one charge lasted so long, but even the charging base is much smaller than Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Limited power and battery life, so-so ergonimics, and uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is the shape of the Oral B brush, but it sometimes felt like it missed those hard to reach places too.  </li>
            <li> I am notorious for brushing too hard and that messes up your gums.  </li>
            <li> but it is not too hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> Hard to brush your teeth when the brush won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> and it was bulky and hard to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly hard to say.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads are too hard for my liking.</li>
            <li> The bristles are somewhat hard without the slightest irritation to the gums.  </li>
            <li> I used to brush so hard it damaged my gums.  </li>
            <li> The brush head that comes with this unit is really hard.</li>
            <li> Comes with hard bristles.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am a hard button</li>
            <li> And with a couple of bites to the tip you can \\&quot;soften\\&quot; and slightly dull the tip if you want.</li>
            <li> it is wroth every dollar you spend for it, and it gets in those hard to reach places</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, try it for yourself, I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a rechargeable toothbrush and commonly have cavity problems, then maybe you want to go with one of the high-end Oral-B models that have a circular head.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint however, is with the brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I spend at least 10 minutes brushing my teeth in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I find that the Pulsonic leaves my teeth feeling smoother than my manual toothbrush and, apart from the tingling, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any negative effect on my gums.    </li>
            <li> The heads for this thing are also cheaper at least, on amazon</li>
            <li> battery lasted at least a week of brush.</li>
            <li> My one complaint (and thus the 4 stars) would be that it does not come with a travel case.</li>
            <li> I was going to submit a negative review to Oral-b on the questionare form that came in the box, but when I went to the website, it said that they are no longer giving $10 gift cards for submitting a review, so I won&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li> Shoddy construction</li>
            <li> Sometime around July, this sucker just quit on me.</li>
            <li> My dentist has never had a negative thing to say about my oral hygeine since I started using it,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complaint about this toothbrush at $50 with $15 mail in rebate.  </li>
            <li> Weighing a mere 1.8 oz., with the brush head attached, the dimensions of the handle and brush assembly is roughly 8 1/4\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s too late to return it.</li>
            <li> Why I need to write at least 20 words?</li>
            <li> Wish it came with at least one feplacement brush.  </li>
            <li> The timer is confusing.</li>
            <li> Since you should never get the electrical portion of the charger base wet, Oral-B has designed the base with a removable top, which can then be cleaned under running water.  </li>
            <li> She informed me that she wants the base mounted to the wall</li>

            <li> She informed me that she wants the base mounted to the wall</li>
            <li> Just slowly massage the brush in circles, and let the ultrasonic vibrations do their job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additional very small brush head for those hard to reach places</li>
            <li> There are two other recessed openings on the base, to allow for storage of the included Precision Tip brush head and a spare standard brush head.  </li>
            <li> I took them apart and it seems that after a while water starts leaking inside and they fail due to corrosion (note that I never use them in the shower).</li>
            <li> Why would I want to have another Oral B with a likelihood of failure just after warranty expires?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Particularly in the base that holds the toothbrush, and the noise when it&#x27;s operated.</li>
            <li> They were OK, but I didn&#x27;t like the overly pointed tips, replacement tips were hard to find ... and the expensive replacements tips that I found were worthless, because they failed to stay attached to the handle.</li>
            <li> Almost no noise during use, the handler is very small, like a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the charger has a very small footprint.  </li>
            <li> I bought the tooth brush on other site 3 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;For the past 2 weeks it started to act crazy.</li>
            <li> The base is made of hard plastic and clear plastic.</li>
            <li> I owned a sonicare and decided to get something with less expensive brusheads.   </li>
            <li> You want some serious cleaning?</li>
            <li> This thing has some serious vibrating power.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re serious about oral/gum health</li>
            <li> w/ a new base + expensive replacement heads every few months.  </li>
            <li> But sadly, every single time I attempted to use it in a week, the brush head portion popped off and came loose in my mouth, leaving me with a plastic brush in my mouth, and a vibrating electronically powered stick which I was afraid would electrocute me! &lt;</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this product is that the charger is enormous.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this type for years and on those rare occasions where I am drugged and dragged to a dentist, the evil woman with the metal scrapers always comments that my teeth &amp;#34;don&#x27;t look too bad&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Hate the idea to have to be carrying a transformer around even if it was a tiny one :S</li>
            <li> This one caught my eye because it&#x27;s small and not as ugly as the other options.  </li>
            <li> Guess their tactic is to make it so hard to reach them that one just let&#x27;s it go, but this seller should not be on amazone, please?!</li>
            <li> The vibrating was not pleasant, but I got use to it.  </li>
            <li> charge lasts long (comes with small base that you plug into the wall), travels well</li>
            <li> It is a very thin toothbrush but not uncomfortably so, easy to grasp in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I was deeply disappointed.   </li>
            <li> She has stayed away from power toothbrushes in the past because she didn&#x27;t like the fat handles, noisy operation, and uncomfortable brush heads.  </li>
            <li> She has stayed away from power toothbrushes in the past because she didn&#x27;t like thefat handles, noisy operation, and uncomfortable brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The wall-mount charger is small and probably won&#x27;t keep a casual brush-by from knocking the toothbrush</li>
            <li> Other brushes have small circular or weird shaped heads making it impossible to use without battery power.</li>
            <li> I was a little unhappy about this order.</li>
            <li> To get to the next setting though, you have to press the button twice to cycle through, which is annoying.  </li>
            <li> This makes it so that the brush head constantly vibrates off of the base and into your mouth while brushing.</li>
            <li> The head was poorly designed and falls off during use.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st sonic toothbrush and I&#x27;m addicted to it.</li>
            <li> behind, over and under.  </li>
            <li> so the base needs a larger space to accomidate the cord.  </li>
            <li> No problems or broken parts.</li>
            <li> It is thin</li>
            <li> I find that the 30 second timer and two minute marker to be both helpful yet a bit annoying-</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t broken up to my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also does not turn off after two minutes, a feature that always annoyed me with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I also found the toothbrush head to be awkward in shape and size, which lead to a few scraped gums.</li>
            <li> The latch and groove that snaps the head in place grips the base with about as much strength as a dirty post-</li>
            <li> We dont want false reviews in Amazon.</li>
            <li> The base has a small footprint size and the Pulsonic simply rests in a small hole in the base.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the quality is not good.</li>
            <li> After cleaning the removable portion, you can wipe the bottom portion of the base with a dry cloth.  </li>
            <li> After cleaning the removable portion, you can wipe the bottom portion of the base with a dry cloth.  </li>
            <li> I did not use to like electric toothbrushes because of thick handles and awkward ergonomics.</li>
            <li> After I lost it in China, I purchased Pulsonic, and I have had a very bad experience with this different model.</li>
            <li> other thing I&#x27;ll mention about the Pulsonic is the base.  </li>
            <li> other things in the box are the manual, base, and the precision brush head.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t like leaving the brush heads exposed, so she keeps the spares in a drawer, due to the lack of covered brush storage on the base.  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t like leaving the brush heads exposed, so she keeps the spares in a drawer, due to the lack of covered brush storage on the base.  </li>
            <li> Another issue with the warranty is that you have to pay for shipping for the product, which in practicality makes the enforcement of the warranty useless once shipping is paid for by the customer.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> I only wish the base stand came with covered storage for the brush heads!!</li>
            <li> So be wary.</li>
            <li> I tried this out a few times before deciding it was fairly worthless and giving up on it.  </li>
            <li> I tried this out a few times before deciding it was fairly worthless and giving up on it.  </li>
            <li> Expensive refill brushes that come with a throw away brush that no one uses.</li>
            <li> item failed after 2 years and a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Sonic as it&#x27;s replacement, and find the Sonic to be a silly gimmic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> buy this silly item.</li>
            <li> As expensive as these all were,  I  still felt like it took longer then</li>
            <li> I would return it except I feel guilty returning a tooth brush.</li>
            <li> disappointed in Oral B that toothburshes are not more intercompatible so that the brush heads can be intermixed between toothbrush models.</li>
            <li> Repalcement heads are way way to expensive</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Even then if you move in the wrong direction it still vibrates the teeth.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s expensive for a toothbrush</li>
            <li> I just got back from the dentist and this was my worst check-up ever!</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> have read that it is difficult to get replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> I disassembled it to see what went wrong, and found out that water leaked into the housing where the electronic components were.</li>
            <li> I also think that the shape of the toothbrush makes it is easier to get at the back of the bottom teeth where the plaque is the worst.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have had to return this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> , kinda lame seeing as it was $70 should mention that it wont work over seas.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong...</li>
            <li> I have a few annoying surface stains in my front teeth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this pulsonic wasn&#x27;t it...</li>
            <li> Very poor product.   </li>
            <li> Very thin and lightweight and cleans well.  </li>
            <li> Very thin and lightweight.    </li>
            <li> Charging base takes up very little space on the countertop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> - Charging base takes up very little space on the countertop     </li>
            <li> ; however, because of the small diameter of the base, it doesn&#x27;t stand upright that well</li>
            <li> Once the charging base is plugged in you simply sit the Pulsonic Power Brush handle into a recessed opening on the front of the base.  </li>
            <li> They also had a tendency to accumulate disgusting gunk and required regular thorough cleaning, an unpleasant task.</li>
            <li> How disappointing to spend $$$ for a toothbrush that is useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately a toothbrush is not something you can return if you&#x27;re unhappy with it.  </li>
            <li> A bit awkward though is finding the on/off button when I&#x27;m done brushing.  </li>
            <li> * Non-contact induction charging mechanism means there&#x27;s no metal contacts to get dirty and prevent charging  </li>
            <li> The brush head was awkward to use, but I went on to like it.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment it was - no comparison to this product at all.  </li>
            <li> The inside of these things grow mold like crazy.</li>
            <li> The charging base measures approximately 1 3/4\\&quot; - H x 1 5/8\\&quot; - W x 3\\</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> Well, that was a bad move.  </li>
            <li> The noise isn&#x27;t bad either.  </li>
            <li> Ugly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frustrated with them.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve used it for a week, and I am completely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed as I realized</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> (I think it accidentally got thrown away:-(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I would turn it off.....and set it on the recharging base....</li>
            <li> The brush would no longer turn off when coming in contact with the charging base.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an annoying inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : the motor shuts off upon return to the base, like hanging up a phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> given the restrictive charging base.</li>
            <li> Annoying.</li>
            <li> The base has two elongated screw slots 1.125 inches apart for wall mounting.</li>
            <li> The noise was annoying at the beginning, but I gradually got used to it.</li>
            <li> The manual states that you need to keep the base plugged in at all times, and let the toothbrush discharge every 6 months.</li>
            <li> I unplugged my base 5 days ago.</li>
            <li> The one con of the base is the weight.</li>
            <li> This is extremely annoying.</li>
            <li> I HATE manual toothbrushes now.</li>
            <li> For longer trips, I throw in the base and the brush.</li>
            <li> It just sits in the base and charges (I assume by induction)</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t even have the charging base w/</li>
            <li> Found the handle to be so annoying</li>
            <li> Charging Base w/ Brush Head Storage&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the instruction manual doesn&#x27;t specifically mention anything about mounting the charging base, there are two slotted holes on the backside, which would allow for wall mounting.  </li>
            <li> The Pulsonic toothbrush requires 12 hours on the charging base before it is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> Charging base slides around countertop too easily&lt;</li>
            <li> I have been using a Crest Spinbrush since my Sonicare broke, which I hated.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the quality - would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Worst toothbrush i have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Worst craftsmenship ive seen in any toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
            <li> The worst part is the connection between the body and brush head.</li>
            <li> This is the worst customer service I have ever received and</li>
            <li> This is horrific design flaw - if they wanted they could allow for battery replacement.     </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As always, excellent!</li>
            <li> This is the third one of these my husband and I have purchased. We bought our original set nearly 6 years ago and my husbands finally quit on us (mine is still kicking). They have been used and abused and we have gotten a lot of milage out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is that you periodically have to clean tooth paste gunk from the charging base. I suspect the same is true for any similar product. It is important to note that no matter how much gunk I let accumulate the toothbrush always charged properly.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, the last one I had lasted about 2 years before the battery in it died. This is not a terribly short amount of time for something with a battery that can&#x27;t be replaced, especially considering the price. It cleans as well as some of the higher end ones at a better price, and is the most portable unit I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush, as it has a better to clean my teeth with its Pulsonic system. I believe these Pulsonic electric toothbrushes are far more superior for cleaning teeth, then the other electric toothbrushes. My dentist and hygienist also commented on the quick improvement with less plaque on my teeth.  I like the 30 seconds timer warning feature. The charger is very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take much space.  The only and biggest problem I have is the warranty from Oral-B, first they don&#x27;t go by purchase date, but the date of manufacture.  Another issue with the warranty is that you have to pay for shipping for the product, which in practicality makes the enforcement of the warranty useless once shipping is paid for by the customer.  I had to toss mine after less than a year, the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge.  Apparently my package was sitting on Amazon&#x27;s shelves for too long.  I bought another one at Target and have been happy since.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few weeks and find it amazing.  Thin, light, easy to hold. Cleans really well.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  The price makes this ultra sonic brush even better.  I started using this brush and have had no tarter build up since.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these. The right kind is hard to find. This was easy and they work great. as expected.</li>
            <li> its price is reasonable and the noise is not so loud.&lt;br /&gt;the most important thing is that it removed my dental calculus.&lt;br /&gt;i am really happy to see that.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was reasonably priced and had all the things i wanted:  slim design  various settings  30 second interval timers to tell me when to move  2 different brush head sizes  oral b brand name for some \\&quot;insurance\\&quot;    Had it for 4 months now and it has whitened my teeth beyond any whitener paste/ gel forms i&#x27;ve ever used. Love how clean my teeth feel. Battery lasts about 3 weeks after a good charge. easy to take on vacation without the base charger.    Love it! Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]  I was using a battery operated Crest brush &amp; wanted to stop buying batteries. I think this is the next step up if you are not sure you will like a sonic. It is sized small, will fit in the ceramic toothbrush holder with other regular brushes! I charge about every 10 days or so (says it lasts 2 wks &amp; I have not run out before I recharge). Brushhead did seem to come off at 1st, but not now (I must have changed to a more proper position). I used on the low setting for about 1 wk to 10 days, now able to use the high.  Only 2 minutes and I have the cleanest teeth, I do prefer toothpastes with baking soda and/or hydrogen peroxide &amp; love some of the new Arm &amp; Hammer.  Colgate has a less intense baking soda toothpaste if you are not used to this type. Final review: THUMBS UP!!!</li>
            <li> Ive had this tooth brush for 3 weeks now and just had my second tooth crack! Both teeth have composite fillings that are over 10 years old and have had no other problems, my regular check up with x-rays were only just last month and all was ok.  Ive used sonic tooth brushes for years now but this one is by far the &#x27;buzziest&#x27; and I can not say that it was the tooth brush but that was the only change.          Ill still give the brush 3stars because I actually did like it, no head falling off issues like some reviews, its compact enough to travel with and it cleans like you think a sonic should.  The price is a bit steep to just go out and buy one, unless your replacing an old one.</li>
            <li> My wife has gum problems that demand very excellent care, thus the need for frequent dental cleaning, flossing, and brushing. Her first pulse type brush was the one advertized on television by Sonicare, which she had for 5 years. It&#x27;s big, expensive, but works great. She needed new brushes and decided to go for a newer toothbrush instead. Oral-B is a trusted name and they had a rebate which made this pulsonic very inexpensive. It&#x27;s small, inexpensive, and works even better, she says. Thus, she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy, and I guess her dentist is happy.  I still use manual toothbrush myself, but I might find it in my future to switch as well. Like many others who comment on the size, the smaller size definately makes the difference for her.</li>
            <li> I love the sleek skinny design. I love my new electric toothbrush wont be goin back to manual brushing again.</li>
            <li> When my dentist recommended the Pulsonic, I thought, \\&quot;Ho-hum, another electric toothbrush. OK, I&#x27;ll give it a try.\\&quot; Previously, I had used three different powered brushes and was indifferent to their performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pulsonic is different. I can actually feel the cleaning action. It&#x27;s slim, easy to use, and I have experienced none of the \\&quot;head loosening\\&quot; problems listed in some of the reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for two months and I heartily recommend it. I also got a good deal through Amazon, for a total of just $33 after the rebate.</li>
            <li> After much research I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for me.  We really do like how they clean the teeth and gums.  We haven&#x27;t had them long enough to see if they whiten like the ads say, but they do clean.  The whitening is usually the toothpaste anyway. We took them on a long weekend and didn&#x27;t take the chargers.  No problem. They held enough charge for four days&#x27; use.  I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money.  But my first check up after getting the Oral-B Pulsonic went well.  My dentist commented that she could tell I was doing something different.  Following the directions and using as suggested, has shown results for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, and she likes it a lot! I personally use another Oral-B toothbrush, but she travels a lot, and this worked better for her. Nice for the price.</li>
            <li> bought this for my dad who travels a lot, and I am sure happy to buy this one for him . I love its size....Really handy. My dad likes the brush and ever since I gifted this to him he has started with his night time brush routine all over again...he says its really convinient and he can feel the difference. Plus with the mail in rebate going on, its a great buy.</li>
            <li> Had this about 1 week now.  my teeth instantly felt cleaner and my whole mouth too.  Can&#x27;t go wrong w/Amazon&#x27;s lowest price, and a $15 rebate from Oral-B, and only around $12 w/free shipping for 4 packs of refill heads forever!  I had a 10+ year old Oral-B 3D toothbrush, and I thought it did a great job, but heads were expensive, and my teeth have that JUST CAME BACK FROM THE DENTIST/DENTAL HYGIENIST FEELING!  I highly recommend this product.  works great, small, fits the hand great, easy to use, and does not retain water or toothpaste in hidden crevices like the sonicare or oralb 3d heads do. I look forward to a long use of this product.  I only wish the base stand came with covered storage for the brush heads!!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with how easy to use and fast this brush is. Before I knew it it was over....seems so quick and my teeth feels pretty clean, which usually comes after 3-4 minutes of brushing with my toothbrushes before.    I&#x27;m going to continue to use this product and I am really really impressed with it. It&#x27;s been a month since first use and I use it every day but the bristles of the brush are still completely new. I will see how many months this keeps up....just wow. Worth every every dollar.    Thanks for bringing us this amazing product amazon!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this toothbrush.  It does a fabulous job of cleaning my teeth, and it holds a charge for weeks and weeks.  I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is a very user friendly electric toothbrush, with a smaller, thinner and lighter size than the direct competitors and also at a reasonable price compared to them.  I like this toothbrush so much, that I have one of them in my main home and the other at my beach house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent traveler (65+ nights away from home) and I have found this Pulsonic to be the best travel toothbrush out there. It&#x27;s very slim so doesn&#x27;t take up much room vs a regular toothbrush. I charge it for a day before a week long trip and I&#x27;ve never run out of juice.   I also use an Oral-B Triumph system at home as my \\&quot;main\\&quot; toothbrush. Both are very different, I wouldn&#x27;t want to travel with my Triumph as it&#x27;s just too big.  Both of these being used through the year keep my teeth clean as a whistle...</li>
            <li> This sonic toothbrush is so much better for your teeth and gums than a regular electric toothbrush (which I always thought of as one of the best inventions). In addition, the Oral B Sonic is compact, indicates how long you should use it on each quadrant, and is priced very reasonably. You will find that even your dentist and dental hygienist will be able to see the difference. It can&#x27;t work miracles - you still have to floss. But you won&#x27;t be able to find a better toothbrush. Am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great sonic toothbrush... I myself prefer the slimmer profile, and it&#x27;s much quieter than my old Philips sonic. Also easier to toss in travel bag. A charge lasts about 2-3 weeks, with 2x a day brushing for at least 90 seconds or if I&#x27;m not in a hurry, the full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have become used to dual voltage electronic goods so I bought an Oral B Pulsonic toothbrush from the USA - but I am in Australia with 240v and the USA model only runs at 110v.  I bought it for its light weight when traveling in Europe, also 240v - so by the time I buy a transformer the weight advantage is lost and this product is of no use to me. (You can not get this model in Australia - bummer). It would be nice if Amazon gave this much info (eg voltage specifications) but they don&#x27;t. So be wary.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush from Target 2 days ago and while I am brushing my teeth the brush head keeps coming off. I then read the reviews here and see that a lot of people have this same problem. I called Oral-B support and they are not aware of any such problem but offered to send me a new brush head in the mail. It would take 2 to 3 weeks to get to me. I am taking this toothbrush back and never buying an oral-b brush again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is very lightweight and compact, very easy to use, cleans better than a manual toothbrush, great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to upgrade from their manual toothbrush, but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money and use a bulky device.</li>
            <li> I have used both the Sonic Care and the Oral-B Spin Brushes but really liked the slimmed down design of the Oral-B Pulsonic. The sensitive feature is a real plus I found that my other electronic toothbrushes did not have.  Its easy to use and slim handle is more comfortable for me.  It otherwise has the same features as other electronic toothbrushes ie 2 minute notification, as well as 4 30 second interruptions to let you know to move around in your mouth. It will be more consumer preference on design that motivates the purchase. However I would buy this item again and suggest it to friends.</li>
            <li> This product works.  I just saw my dentist yesterday.  He said, \\&quot;I´ve never seen teeth this clean.\\&quot;  I have used the Oral B Pulsonic since May, 2009.  Contrary to some of the reviews I read before the purchase, the head stays on and I can´t imagine it poppíng off.  As for those who complain about it being too messy or taking too much effort to use, maybe they just don´t want to put out any effort at all.  Turn it on, move it around, rinse it, wipe it off with a towel and put it back in the base, which could be a little more stable, but works just fine.</li>
            <li> Sonicare and Oral-B are the two largest manufacturers of high-end powered toothbrushes. They initially entered the market using very different technologies: ultrasonic vibration for Sonicare, rotary brushes for Oral-B.    Early model Sonicare were far from perfect, with a heavy and bulky design and brushes that were impossible to fit in tight spaces. They also had a tendency to accumulate disgusting gunk and required regular thorough cleaning, an unpleasant task. The battery life was also limited to about a week between charges. At least their ultrasonic technology was clinically proven to fight gum disease by hitting plaque several millimeters below the gum line, whereas Oral-B&#x27;s rotary brushes were nothing but glorified tooth polishers.    Sonicare&#x27;s most recent update completely redesigned the body, the brushes and the body-brush coupling system. The body is thinner, easy to clean, does not accumulate gunk anymore and battery life has been doubled. These brushes are sold under the FlexCare moniker.    After a few attempts at hybridizing its antique rotary brush system with ultrasonic technology, Braun/Oral-B is finally shipping a proper ultrasonic brush: the Pulsonic.    The body of the Pulsonic is very thin, about 2/3 that of the latest generation Sonicare. I find it almost too thin, but its size is closer to that of a regular toothbrush, so it will fit inside a standard travel toothbrush holder -- a good thing, since Oral-B does not include a travel case in the package.    The ultrasonic action is not as powerful as Sonicare&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t know if this impacts the efficiency of the brush, but it clearly feels weaker; the brush markedly slows down when applied. This may actually be a good thing since you&#x27;re supposed to only apply it gently.  Oral-B includes a feature similar to what Sonicare calls the \\&quot;quad-pacer,\\&quot; essentially a timer that signals you when it&#x27;s time to switch quadrants (every 30 seconds)  Battery life is about a week.  Included in the package: brush, charging stand, bonus interstitial brush... but no travel case.    PROS  ----  - a real ultrasonic brush, the only type useful against periodontal pockets  - very low price for this technology  - easy to clean  - small charging stand  - small brush, great for little hands  - quad pacer  - setting for sensitive gums  CONS  ----  - may be too small for some hands  - charger is 110V only (you need a transformer, not just an adapter, to use it overseas)  - no travel case    CONCLUSION  ----------  Oral-B has come up with a worthy challenger to the Sonicare brushes. At less than half the price of the cheapest FlexCare, the Pulsonic is worthy of your consideration. Regardless of which brush you choose, please take the time to ask your dentist to teach you how to use it properly: apply gently at a 45 degree angle targeting the gum line; don&#x27;t move the brush back and forth, don&#x27;t push hard: just hold it in place and let it do its job. You will get the best results if you rinse with Listerine and floss before brushing.</li>
            <li> Worst toothbrush i have ever owned.  I owned a sonicare and decided to get something with less expensive brusheads.   the Oral B Pulsonic worked fine for about 2 months....Then it would not stay OFF.  I would turn it off.....and set it on the recharging base....then after about 2 minutes it would turn on by itself.   Really bizarre.    Worst craftsmenship ive seen in any toothbrush.  The brush would no longer turn off when coming in contact with the charging base.  So finally after an hour of letting it run i finally just took it apart....and all the wiring inside was corroded.  I do not think this was designed to keep water out.  Very poor product.   Save your money and buy any other toothbrush.  Huge buyers remorse....I am considering never buying ORAL B products again......</li>
            <li> Amazing! I had been using a Braun electric tooth brush for years and decided on the Pulsonic. WOW! That&#x27;s all I can say. My teeth feel amazing. I&#x27;m not obsessed with brushing, but am meticulous. My hygenist always says she has nothing to do on my visits because I have so little plaque. Now I only go to the dentist for a check up once a year. After I brush with the Pulsonic, it&#x27;s feels like I just came out the dentist&#x27;s chair. I would recommend the Pulsonic to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great product at a pretty good price, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B Professional rechargeable toothbrush for about 4 years now and I really like it.  The Oral-B Professionals have the circular brush head and work differently than the Pulsonic or Philips&#x27;s Sonicare toothbrushes.  Even though I love my old Professional model, I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the Pulsonic, for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pulsonic is a surprisingly very light and skinny rechargeable toothbrush that has similar dimensions to a $3 manual toothbrush.  It&#x27;s a lot easier to hold and manipulate than the Professional model and probably the bulky Philips model, too.  The brush head of the Pulsonic is a breeze to take on and off; you slide it onto the unit and then give it a quarter-twist.  The brush head locks into place.  I hate how the brush head gets stuck on my Professional model, so this is a big advantage of the Pulsonic.  The operation of the toothbrush is basically the same, there&#x27;s one button that you press to cycle between On, Sensitive, and Off.  When it&#x27;s in the On mode, the Pulsonic vibrates in 4, 30 second intervals with a short stutter in between to let you know to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth for a complete 2 minute cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head of the Pulsonic is shaped much like a regular toothbrush, and is different than the Professional&#x27;s circular head.  The Pulsonic assists in cleaning by sending out sonic pulses, similar to a jewelry sonication cleaner.  This is used to blast off debris and break up bacteria biofilms that are populating your teeth and gums.  The Professional uses a fast sweeping motion of its circular head to clean your teeth.  Here&#x27;s where I feel is the key difference that should determine which type of toothbrush you should get.  I actually think the Professional cleans my teeth a little better and with less effort on my part because you just sort of place the brush head on top of each tooth.  The Pulsonic requires you to make tiny circular motions over your teeth and assists your cleaning with the sonic vibrations.  The Pulsonic still does a great job cleaning your teeth, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s much better than a manual toothbrush.  But where the Pulsonic wins is with my gums.  I&#x27;ve never had a cavity, but the dentist always complains that my gums are a little too puffy or too red.  After using the Pulsonic for 3 weeks, my gums seem to be a much healthier shade of pink, with reduced puffiness.  I don&#x27;t get that kind of effect with the Professional model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I&#x27;ll mention about the Pulsonic is the base.  The base has a small footprint size and the Pulsonic simply rests in a small hole in the base.  It&#x27;s a bit wobbly, but it works alright.  The problem I have, however, is that there are only two spots for brush heads.  The unit comes with one brush head and one precision tip for cleaning tight spots or around dental work (works pretty well, too).  So really, this is just a one person toothbrush based on the spots for brush head storage.  If you have 2 or more people in the house that want to share the toothbrush and have their own brush head(s) it&#x27;s an annoying inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think the choice is up to your specific needs.  If you are looking for a rechargeable toothbrush and commonly have cavity problems, then maybe you want to go with one of the high-end Oral-B models that have a circular head.  If you want a toothbrush that does a better job keeping your gums in top shape, then I&#x27;d recommend the Pulsonic.  I&#x27;m not a dentist, so that&#x27;s just my opinion.  For my needs, though, I&#x27;ll be sticking with the Pulsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I went to the dentist recently for my standard 6-month check-up.  I&#x27;ve never had cavity problems before, but the dentist had always warned me that my gums and gum pockets were borderline beginning to show problems.Well, on this trip the dentist said my teeth were immaculate and my gums and pockets were all within normal, healthy scoring ranges on the scale they use to rate gum disease progression.  While the hygienist was cleaning my teeth she asked, \\&quot;do you use an electric toothbrush?\\&quot;  When I replied yes, she said, \\&quot;yeah, I can tell.\\&quot;  So, there ya go.  I had been using the Pulsonic for maybe 6-7 weeks prior to the dentist visit and my gums are in the best shape they&#x27;ve been in in years.  With that, I&#x27;ll repeat my recommendation that people who have slightly inflamed gums, or gums teetering towards developing gum disease may get some valuable help from this toothbrush.re immaculate and my gums and pockets were all within normal, healthy scoring ranges on the scale they use to rate gum disease progression.

With that, I&#x27;ll repeat my recommendation that people who have slightly inflamed gums, or gums teetering towards developing gum disease may get some valuable help from this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush for 5 years now, and I will never go back to a traditional brush.  You don&#x27;t get nearly the same type of cleaning with a manual brush than with an electric, simply because your hand is not capable of reproducing the 30,000+ vibrations per minute that an electric can.  In addition, most people with manual brushes spend about 20 seconds (I made that number up) brushing their teeth.  An electric brush naturally makes you spend longer.  If you&#x27;re now convinced to buy an electric brush, the next step is to choose a model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Pulsonic is the fifth electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and models, and have always found that Oral-B makes the best.  The Pulsonic isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; toothbrush, but it&#x27;s definitely not the best I&#x27;ve used, and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s priced appropriately for its function.  The two main considerations I use when looking at an electric toothbrush are vibrations per minute (VPM) and brush head form. The Pulsonic has 27,000 - 30,000 VPM (depending on which of the conflicting descriptions you use from Amazon).  This is about average for an electric brush.  I actually like closer to 35,000 VPM for a real clean.  What&#x27;s more, on the highest vibration setting (clean mode), I found that the brush vibrated too much and was uncomfortable.  To get to the next setting though, you have to press the button twice to cycle through, which is annoying.  My biggest complaint however, is with the brush heads.  The brush heads are rectangular.  I prefer a circular brush head.  Since the toothbrush is supposed to do all of the work, and since the manual even says you should use a circular motion, what sense does it make to have rectangular brush heads?  I can understand with a manual toothbrush, but in my opinion, all electric brushes should have circular heads to facilitate a cleaning using a circular motion.  I also don&#x27;t want to have to brush in a circular motion myself, as the instructions say, but prefer to just hold the brush in my mouth and let it do all of the work.  Maybe that&#x27;s why they made the brush lighter, so it will be easier to use and less fatiguing when you have to do the extra work of moving the brush head back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros of this brush are that it&#x27;s very quiet, slim, and very light.  However other than the fact that it&#x27;s quiet, I don&#x27;t really care if a brush is lightweight or slim.  It&#x27;s not like most other brushes are too heavy and bulky to use.  Maybe if I weighed 50 lbs I would have problems with traditional brushes, but I actually like the weight and size of most other brushes.  Like most Oral B brushes, the Pulsonic has a setting where you can spend two minutes brushing your teeth, and it will alert you every 30 seconds to move onto the next part of your mouth. This is very convenient and a great way to ensure a thorough clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pulsonic uses special [[ASIN:B001CSZTFK Oral-B Pulsonic Refill Brush Set]] replacement heads, which are priced around the same as other brush heads.  It comes with a special precision tip brush head, designed for cleaning between teeth and hard to reach areas.  I tried this out a few times before deciding it was fairly worthless and giving up on it.  Maybe it could be useful for people with braces or poorly-aligned teeth, but I think for the majority of users it will provide little benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, I would strongly suggest anyone considering this brush to spend a little more and upgrade to the [[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]] or the [[ASIN:B000U08ZN4 Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide]], which are much better brushes and do a more efficient job of cleaning.s say, but prefer to just hold the brush in my mouth and let it do all of the work.

            <li> This is a great product, and I highly recommend the Oral-B toothbrushes in general.  But if you are going to get one, I would recommend the soniccare model over this one.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would purchase an electric toothbrush but reluctantly bought one. Have had it a month and it really does a great job. My teeth are whiter with no effort. I do take more time brushing and you can not only see but feel the results. I have since purchased another for our second bathroom.</li>
            <li> (5/03/11) These toothbrushes are still going strong. Great product!    I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for five months now. It functions nicely and cleans my teeth extremely well. My previous toothbrush was a first generation Sonicare, which was a good brush in it&#x27;s own right. But this one performs much better in every aspect. I&#x27;ve noticed some reviews claiming this is not a powerful brush. I honestly don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about. I apply a light to moderate amount of pressure, and have never found the brush to get bogged down. Must be people who work for or own stock in Sonicare.     Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase a Pulsonic. But shop around for replacement heads. I found there&#x27;s quite a price variance, although they are less than Sonicare replacements at any rate.    One note, my wife has sensitive teeth, and found her Sonicare to be too aggressive. However, this Pulsonic has two speeds, and she has found the slower speed to be perfect for her.    Recently purchased a third Pulsonic for my 10 year old and he&#x27;s happy with it too. The size works well with a smaller mouth.    Pros-  cleans great  light weight  small size  works for small mouths, i.e. children  maneuverable  long battery life (between charge)  reasonable price    Cons-  None so far</li>
            <li> Have been using this for over a month and I love it. I used to have a Sonicare and this is much lighter and more toothbrush-like.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have very sensitive teeth.  I have mostly used manual toothbrushes probably for most of my 45 years.  I had purchased a Crest Spinbrush (probably a few years ago), and finally  started using it in the last year.  It cleaned my teeth well enough and didn&#x27;t bother me.  This Oral-B Pulsonic is very sleek and appears to be well made.  Unfortunately, even on the sensitive setting, it hurt on impact, and I&#x27;m not talking a little, I mean alot.  Thinking I was jumping the gun, I lightened up on it and went around the entire mouth.  A third, slower setting may have worked, but as is, I simply cannot use it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just me but I have used a sonic are for the last 15 years and this toothbrush feels skimpy. It is more like the size of a regular toothbrush. Dose not seem to be of the quality as the sonicare either; but only time will tell. Good price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush because I have been pleased with every Oral-B appliance I have ever owned.  I was using a battery operated Oral-B toothbrush previously but I wanted something re-chargeable so I could stop wasting money and batteries.  Since I began using this toothbrush my teeth have never felt cleaner.  It is used just like a manual toothbrush, but it cleans teeth much better.  The price was reasonable too and Oral-B was offering a $15.00 rebate when I purchased it so that made the deal even sweeter.  I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who likes to brush his or her teeth the old fashioned way but with a serious power boost.  I have very sensitive gums and teeth and the sensitive setting is perfect...there is little to no irritation.  If you are looking for a reasonable priced rechargeable toothbrush this is the toothbrush for you.  Happy brushing!</li>
            <li> Only a few reviews made note of this: the brush head does not lock on to the base very well. This makes it so that the brush head constantly vibrates off of the base and into your mouth while brushing. I think that I may have a defective brush after reading many of the positive reviews here. Make note that there are other reviews that make note of this defect. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my sonicare elite which died on me.  I&#x27;ve also own the bigger (blue) oral-b sonic tothbrush.  This particular model, although smaller and lighter, does not seem to clean my teeth as good as the 2 aforementioned brushes.  The reason seems to be that there isn&#x27;t much side to side movement of the bristles.  Although it does vibrate at a high rate, the whole toothbrush seems to vibrate instead of just the head.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush as a replacement to my beloved Braun - after 10 years, it finally stopped holding a charge.  I didn&#x27;t think I would like the \\&quot;pulsonic\\&quot; action as well as the old standby, but I was wrong... it&#x27;s sooo much nicer!  Just about as effortless as brushing your teeth can get.  It is slim and light, but you really feel like you got your teeth clean after two minutes with this baby!  Great brush!</li>
            <li> It \\&quot;blips\\&quot; every 30 seconds to let you know to brush a different section of your teeth, it doesn&#x27;t shut off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Previous to the Oral-B Pulsonic I had been using the Sonic Care which I loved. When that one died I decided to give the Pulsonic a try because it was a great price. It is my new favorite! I really love the pic - my teeth never felt cleaner. I bought one for myself and then bought two more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> quality is OK. doesn&#x27;t have as much bristal movement as the ones with the circle shaped heads. Do not like the 30 sec reminder.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.  It is an exception product overall.  Much lighter and more compact than the competition.  My teeth have not felt so clearn in ages.</li>
            <li> It vibrates at a pretty high frequency which I wasn&#x27;t expect, but it seems to do a good job and I like the streamlined design of it.  Also, the charger uses some non-contact inductor which is pretty cool.  No concern of the inevitable water/nastiness buildup effecting contacts.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]  love it, our teeth are cleaner than they have ever been!</li>
            <li> The head was poorly designed and falls off during use. A typical use requires me to twist the head back on at least 3 times during one brushing. Terrible. Do not buy this, no matter the cost.</li>
            <li> bought it while it&#x27;s on sale and with manufacture rebate so it costs me less than half the shelf price I saw at local store. Sleek design, easy to use, good value at a budget price.</li>
            <li> I think this toothbrush is great.  Powerful, slick and it would be perfect for travelling if the charger was AUTOVOLTAGE!  It&#x27;s kind of silly that it is only 110Volts! :(  Hate the idea to have to be carrying a transformer around even if it was a tiny one :S</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! I feel like I&#x27;ve just come back from the dentist everytime I use it. I really like the pick part, I feel like it really gets the cracks of my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Oral B has been my brush of choice for a while now. What a great product now that it is rechargeable. I was using the battery one but couldn&#x27;t recharge that one so that makes this one all the better.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding these at my local grocers. Small light toothbrush, does the job!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve never purchased and used one before. I would highly recommend this to everyone. My gums are usually very sensitive but I had no problems with this. My teeth feel nice and clean and I look forward to brushing my teeth. My breath is fresher and my gums look healthier.</li>
            <li> For years my dentist has been pushing me to use an electric toothbrush.  I have tried at least 3 different ones over the years and have not liked or stuck with any of them.  This one I can!  It is fabulous!  Finally an electric toothbrush that fits a woman&#x27;s hand, unlike all of those other big clunkers that I came to hate.  I originally got the the battery operated version last summer and have been using one until now I have this plug in one for home.  I will still use the battery operated ones for travel.  My dentist is happy and I am happy, at last.</li>
            <li> Expensive refill brushes that come with a throw away brush that no one uses. So your price is %25 more than you think.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B product is the best I have ever used. Great Buy and coupon to save even more.</li>
            <li> Big upgrade over Sonicare in one very important area - cleanliness.  I used the Sonicare for years and found it extremely difficult to keep the brush head clean despite following all the various tips you can easily find with a quick google search.  The brush would consistently grow mold over time regardless of how careful I was.  While the Sonicare still has more bells and whistles overall (this could be due to model difference), I&#x27;m willing to sacrifice those little things for what I think is probably one of the two criteria that actually matter: 1) how well the brush cleans and 2) how clean the brush stays.  By the way, the Oral B cleans teeth on par with Sonicare, in my own opinion.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by my son&#x27;s dentist and periodontist.   It is his personal product and the one he suggests for his patients.  He believes that the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action is the key here. This action  breaks up the plaque supposedly. I would have preferred purchasing  a brush that came with extra tips included. With this product I had  to order the tips separately.</li>
            <li> I really like this, it&#x27;s the sonic type my dentist recommended, but it&#x27;s small and light so it&#x27;s easier for me to travel with it. Thank heavens the charger is small -- my previous one was bigger than the toothbrush itself.</li>
            <li> I would say that overall, it&#x27;s a good to excellent value for the money. My only criticism is that I can&#x27;t tell when the 2 minute timer goes off. It&#x27;s supposed to stutter. I really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s stuttering on its own or I&#x27;ve hit the sensitive mode on accident.</li>
            <li> After using my last Oral-B electric toothbrush for over ten years I decided it was time for a new one and purchased this Sonic. Toothbrush technology has come a long way! I&#x27;m very please with the appearance and performance of this product. I believe my teeth are cleaner and whiter than they have been for some time. Recently took the toothbrush along for a short vacation and it had no problem running with out a recharge for several days. I also find the timer a very handy feature. I would (and have) recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now, and it still works just as expected. It holds a charge for weeks, so I can take it on trips without needing the charger. (Disclaimer - I only use it once a day, I prefer an old-fashioned manual toothbrush at night.) The dentist thinks it&#x27;s doing a great job on my teeth &amp; gums. I like it even better now that I&#x27;ve found these replacement brushes - \\&quot;Ultra Soft Sensitive Brush Heads\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t care for the 30-second reminders, but the overall 2-minute timer is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before but felt that my teeth weren&#x27;t getting clean enough with a regular one.  This toothbrush is gentle, easy to use, and my teeth feel as if I have just had a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A POORLY MANUFACTURED PRODUCT, SOLD BY A COMPANY THAT DOES NOT PROMOTE GOOD CUSTOMER RELATIONS OR PRODUCT LOYALTY!&lt;br /&gt;I am adding (today is 2/28/13) to my prior review--see below:&lt;br /&gt;This item failed after 2 years and a couple of months. My usual practice was to use it only once a day, using a traditional brush otherwise, so I was shocked when it suddenly seized up just outside the warranty period.&lt;br /&gt;I called the company to complain and request an extension to warranty and was flatly rejected by both a service rep and her manager Lori. Instead I was offered $10 toward buying another brush, which I told them to forget about. Why would I want to have another Oral B with a likelihood of failure just after warranty expires?&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to Sonicare, which gave good service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review from 2010:&lt;br /&gt;My first electric was a Sonicare, which I purchased when it first came out. Good, but a little clumsy and heavy, but durable. When the battery died I bought the Oral B Sonic Complete. With its battery now almost dead, I replaced it with the Pulsonic, which I thought was an advance in design. Unfortunately, the brush is too firm for comfort, so I am using it at low speed. I really prefer the Sonic Complete, which has a comfortable soft brush, so I regret the decision to buy the Pulsonic. Three stars only--it&#x27;s OK, not good.</li>
            <li> After four years, my Triumph finaly quit.  Too many days in the shower and humidity built up inside.  I purchased a Sonic as it&#x27;s replacement, and find the Sonic to be a silly gimmic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonic vibrates, almost as powerfully as my cell phone, that&#x27;s all it does.  When you brush with it, the pressure applied to the toothbrush is far far more powerful than the oscilation that takes place at the brush head.  Only when applying a minimal amount of pressure do you get the vibration feeling at the end of the brush.  I don&#x27;t think this does anything that you can&#x27;t do with a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from vibrating your hand slightly, and doing nothing for your teeth, the head comes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this silly item.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of the cheaper battery operated toothbrushes in the past.  The Oral-B Pulsonic was my first venture into the higher end toothbrushes and I must say it is very nice.  Let me first say I am not big on reading directions on most products before I try them out.  So, after a few days of brushing, I went to the directions to see why my new toothbrush kept pausing or hesitating after a couple minutes of brushing.  Low and behold, it&#x27;s a feature designed to let you know it&#x27;s time to move on to another part of your mouth...very nice.     The system comes with a separate attachment to get into those harder to reach areas and a nice rechargeable stand which holds the extra head and the toothbrush.   The stand can be mounted to the wall to clear up your countertop as well...and who here has enough room on your sink top?    As others have stated, the toothbrush has two settings - clean and sensitive.  I have found the button placement may not be located at the best spot for some people.  While brushing, I occasionally accidentally hit the button and have to tap it two more times to return to the normal brushing mode.  The brush is thinner than other brushes I have used.  I compare it to using a pencil compared to a magic marker which resembles the others I have tried.  Also, the brush head is much smaller with fewer frills than other sonic brushes I have tried.      Pricewise, the Oral-B Pulsonic is a good bang for the buck.  I cannot say if this toothbrush out pulses the competition or does a better job of cleaning, but compared to the previous brushes I have tried this one is twice the price.  In my opinion, this is a great toothbrush.  It all comes down to personal preference.</li>
            <li> Good little toothbrush for the buck.  Very light and powerful.  Holds charge very well.  More aggressive than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year.  I read the reviews before I ordered it and have found none of the problems mentioned in some of the reviews.  The brush head has never come loose.  The only way I can see this happening is if you fail to twist it all the way into position without realizing it.  I have only pressed the power button by accident while brushing a couple times and this was because I was holding it too tightly.  A gentle grip is all that&#x27;s needed and the sonic vibrations do all the work.  This brush cleans well and The compact size and footprint are great.  I would recommended it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use an electric toothbrush and let me just say I was blown away with the results! My teeth haven&#x27;t felt felt this clean since my regular visits to my dentist! All I can say is, this little gadget has exceeded my expectations and more! And with it the special price I got (and $15 rebate) it has really made my buying experience all the worth while!    I have already recommended this product to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!   It is the only electric toothbrush I will ever use. Because it is thin and streamlined it will fit inside your mouth as easily as a regular toothbrush. It feels more natural and you brush as you would ordinarily brush with a regular toothbrush.  My son has an easy gag reflex and this is the first brush that helps him brush more and longer.  I hope they never discontinue this item. I am tempted to get one and hold it aside for the future.</li>
            <li> I did not use to like electric toothbrushes because of thick handles and awkward ergonomics. The Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush handles great, reaches just fine wherever needed, and perfectly balances in hand. Holds enough charge to be safe for a week of travel, twice a day brushing.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, especially negative ones, but I strongly felt that I needed to do this one....    I bought this toothbrush to mainly use as a travel toothbrush because of so many good reviews. I was so excited to receive it and tried it right way. It is slim and light weight but it was not nearly as powerful as the Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush which I am currently using. It vibrates right on your hand and makes your hand tremble and it gets slippery when it gets wet while you brushing your teeth.  As compact toothbrush for travel, it didn&#x27;t come with a world voltage charger. And the charger that comes with it is heavier and bulkier than toothbrush itself.    So don&#x27;t get misled by all the rave reviews, save your money and wait for better one to come out or go buy one try it out yourself.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oral-B Pulsonic for my wife, who&#x27;s former high end rotary Oral-B toothbrush broke a few weeks ago. Having tried multiple rotary style brushes and battery-operated pulse brushes, I was a bit wary on the switch to a Sonic/pulse brush since she was quite fond of her former brush.     Summary (per the wife)    - Size...perfect for smaller hands/mouths, but very useful for getting to those hard to reach areas. Better portability; however, because of the small diameter of the base, it doesn&#x27;t stand upright that well (but too big to fit in any toothbrush holder slots)  - Charging Base...takes up a very small footprint on sink  - Price...much lower than many newer Oral-B/Sonic-care brushes  - Performance...cleans extremely well, takes a week or so to get used to it.     I did try it out for a day or so, too (don&#x27;t tell the wifey!!!) and was quite pleased by the pulsing sensation and the way it made my teeth feel/look. I liked it so much, that I decided to get one for mom, too!!!</li>
            <li> The pulsing action is now considered to be the best way to brush your teeth.  It has two speeds, one for vigorous brushing and one for gum stimulation.</li>
            <li> Used the Sonicare for many years and liked it, but the housing was stained and it was time to go bye bye.   Oral B did a pretty good job of ripping off the Sonicare technology.  What  I did not like is that the Oral B didn&#x27;t shut off automatically after 2 minutes like the Sonicare, plus the shutoff button accumulates toothpaste runoff in the process, which can be kind off gross to turn off.  Maybe it is the shape of the Oral B brush, but it sometimes felt like it missed those hard to reach places too.  Still a decent product with a decent price.  If I had it to do over though, I would probably spend more money and buy the Sonicare again.</li>
            <li> So far this has worked very well.  Keeps my teeth clean.  Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> After using another Oral B Sonic toothbrush for years - and being totally satisfied - it finally gave up.  It was a no-brainer to shop for another Oral B.  This one caught my eye because it&#x27;s small and not as ugly as the other options.  Also, it&#x27;s a good price.    Well, I&#x27;ve used it for a week, and I am completely disappointed.  That \\&quot;just from the dentist\\&quot; feeling I&#x27;d grown used to with my old brush is completely gone.  I don&#x27;t get the impression this is even a sonic toothbrush.  Sure, it vibrates and scrubs, but I don&#x27;t detect that sonic pulse implied by the name \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot;.  It seems like I&#x27;m getting the same results as I could get with a regular 2 dollar brush.      I&#x27;m returning this and spending a few dollars more for a heftier sonic toothbrush.  This one just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> My Dentist will approve of the condition of my teeth thanks to this fabulous toothbrush. It cleans my teeth, all the spaces and surfaces, better than any toothbrush I have ever had. As a matter of fact, my teeth feel and look like I have just been to the Dentist. This is a great product that delivers what it promises-clean, stain free teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for a few months now and I am stil loving it.  My girlfriend got a more expensive electric toothbrush and she is jealous of mine now because mine is so sleek and compact and my battery stays charged for at least a week when hers lasts a day or so before it&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to electric toothbrushes and I decided to try sonic action   because It seemed my first choice, Oral B Professional 1000,  did not vibrate enough.  Well, I found out what sonic action is,  even on the low setting, with very little noise, about a 2 on the 10 scale.  I&#x27;m sure this would message and vibrate (occuring in brush head) whatever off your teeth,   but, if your dental setup is many caps, what is that doing to that glue?  I decided to go back to the brushing (twirling clock, counter clock) of the Professional 1000.  That&#x27;s enough vibrating to message and (with the soft brushes) cleans all surfaces very well,  very quickly because of no need for my own maneuvering, which I was over doing.  However, the noise for it is about a 4.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrushes for years, but this is the first time I swayed from the basic models such as [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].  After years I finally decided to make an upgrade to a sonic one, and Pulsonic became an obvious choice.      Initially I wasn&#x27;t very used to the larger brush size, but it never became a problem.  The design of the brush makes it easy to reach everywhere.  Since the brush now only vibrate, I need to put in more motion than before, but once again I got used to it pretty fast.  I&#x27;m not very sure my teeth are now whiter than before, but I do feel like it&#x27;s now less likely to have anything \\&quot;grows\\&quot; on my teeth a while after brushing.  I guess it does clean my teeth better than the basic models.    I charged the brush once, then used it for three weeks without noticing any difference, unlike those mechanically rotating cups that the rotation power changes with time observably.  It might be nicer if Oral-B puts on an indicator to show the battery level, since it&#x27;s very unclear to me that how I should notice the low battery status without running out of power.  To be fair I haven&#x27;t tried to see what happens if I just keep using it without recharging it (so far I recharged it once after the initial charge).      I saw a lot of complaints about the robustness of some plastic parts.  While I was using the basic models, I remember that I&#x27;m supposed to only lightly touch the brush onto my teeth, yet from the aging of the brushes I realized that I pressed it too hard most of the time.  Given that as a reference, I didn&#x27;t find any part that i too fragile.  I know a lot of people brush their teeth too forcefully, my mom being one of them.  It&#x27;s true that the brush doesn&#x27;t feel like steel, but my gut feeling is that you probably don&#x27;t need to press it so hard against your teeth anyway.  I don&#x27;t think any plastic part in this brush is less robust than your gums, or maybe I&#x27;m lucky to receive a better one, which I found more unlikely.    Overall I like this new brush, though it might be better if Oral-B puts in an indicator for battery.</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper rechargeable toothbrush, and when I used this one, I was surprised at how hard it felt brushing my teeth. I turn it off to do my front teeth, it seems to strong/powerful/rough on more sensitive teeth. Overall I like it for the price (I got the 50% rebate so it only cost $25) and it seems to be decent at holding a charge so far.</li>
            <li> I have had periodontal disease for many years along with very sensitive gums.  Traditional electric toothbrushes made my gums so ticklish that I could not use them.  A low speed spin brush worked ok and did not tickle the gums, but did not remove the plaque as well as needed.  This new Oral B Pulsonic seems to address two problems very well; ticklish gums and the second small pick like brush.  The lower \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; speed does not tickle the gums, and the pick like brush allows me to carefully brush the gum line and the crevices between teeth.  After a month of use and a recent perio exam, the dentist says it is looking much better, and to keep up the routine with the new electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush! Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Very slim and light. A full charge lasts for quite a few days.  Incompatible charger which can&#x27;t be used in UK.</li>
            <li> Battery charge lasts for a very long time. I traveled for 11 days and did not need to charge the battery. Compact charger. Great brush.</li>
            <li> keep your receipt the button jammed on mine after 3 months.  i got a full free replacement. save your receipt or they may be able to check the serial number.&lt;br /&gt;otherwise, i love it, it is inexpensive and does the job.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this brush. My teeth feel like they came from the dentist. Longer battery life would make me give it 5 stars, but a full 12 hr charge will give you couple days use.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome!  I am notorious for brushing too hard and that messes up your gums.  Once you destroy gum tissue it never comes back.  So my hygenist recommended this toothbrush.  Totally worth it and super easy to use.  Timer makes you adequately brush and my teeth are still as clean as the day I went to the dentist (over a month now).  I still can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the money.  It has two speeds and I have found the slower speed to be the most comfortable for myself.  The handle is significantly thinner than the Sonicare (competitor) model, which makes it less comfortable for the hand.  Every 30 seconds it signals to tell the user that they should scrub another 1/4 of their mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for someone who wants the benefits of an electric brush but does not want to/cannot pay $150-$200+. It&#x27;s also relatively portable, so good for travel too, though you&#x27;ll need to bring the charger along for longer trips.&lt;br /&gt;The Pulsonic is not as gentle on your teeth and gums as most of the more expensive toothbrushes I&#x27;ve owned, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. It just feels like the motor does not run quite as fast or as smoothly and I think that probably makes it a little less effective at getting your teeth completely clean. It is certainly a lot better than my old manual toothbrush though! Overall I think it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it about a month after my previous (2-3X the price) electric brush broke, so I&#x27;d been using a manual brush for a bit. After a week of using the Pulsonic my teeth were noticeably whiter and have gotten whiter since then. I like the fact that it has multiple brush shapes, the smaller brush is good for cleaning along the gumline where I have had a couple cavities in the past- my soda drinking youth eventually caught up with me I guess:(. I&#x27;ve had this brush for a year and my dentist says my teeth and gums are in great shape.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with the Pulsonic is that it just isn&#x27;t quite as gentle or as good as the more expensive models, but you get what you pay for right? If you&#x27;re looking for a good electric toothbrush that will keep your teeth healthy and clean, but don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money I would recommend the Pulsonic.</li>
            <li> I mainly got this oral b tooth brush because it came with a rebate of $20. Unfortunately the process to get that rebate was a little more than confusing. I wasn&#x27;t sure what bar-code I was supposed to save or the Proof of Purchase. Regardless of all that, this is a very good toothbrush. Every time I finish brushing it feels like I just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> I ordered this electric toothbrush right after I came back from the dentist.  I had a few cavities and he recommended this one to me.  It works great.  I waited for my next appointment to write this review and I had no cavities and the dentist hardly had to clean my teeth.  It has a 2 minute timer and every 30 seconds it changes up the vibration so you know when to switch to a different area in your mouth.  It has two settings and one is softer for gums or when you&#x27;re just starting out using it.  It&#x27;s not a really loud one and it doesn&#x27;t need any batteries, it has a recharger.  I&#x27;m able to charge it up and take it on a long weekend and it works just fine.  It comes with a smaller brush for getting along your gums.  The only thing I wish is that it had a cover for taking it elsewhere, but that&#x27;s it.  It&#x27;s a great toothbrush and it definitely helped my teeth and the dentist saw the difference.</li>
            <li> Brushing with this seemed as if I was at the dentist&#x27;s office at first.  It functions at a much faster speed than my Braun.  I like the 30 second cues. A bit awkward though is finding the on/off button when I&#x27;m done brushing.  I&#x27;d recommend it for a thorough cleaning.  It has a lower speed function for brushing sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I have now been using this toothbrush daily for a year and a half.  My dental hygienist recommended I use an electric toothbrush to make my gums stronger.  I did a lot of research and decided this brush would be best for me based on other reviews, the price, and the style.  I did not want a bulky brush, but instead something more sleek and stylish.  This was perfect for my style.  I am thoroughly satisfied with this product.  My battery has not died yet.  My hygienist noted my gums are stronger.  I am more motivated to brush my teeth a few times a day now.  I replace my brush heads every 4 months.  The charge lasts about a week.  The timer helps me ensure I am brushing my teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> My entire family has been using the higher end oral b electric toothbrushes for years now. I have been using the Oral-B Triumph Professional Care toothbrush with all the bells and whistles for the last few years and liked it.  As expensive as these all were,  I  still felt like it took longer then the recommended 2 minutes of brushing to feel really clean teeth. I felt it was time to try sonic.  Not wanting to spend the amounts I had already spent I decided to try this toothbrush and am happy with my outcome. I honestly feel for my smaller mouth this did a better job right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Sleek footprint not clunky at all&lt;br /&gt;Light weight&lt;br /&gt;A mode for sensitive teeth&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy well designed charger&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush size is good for my smaller mouth&lt;br /&gt;Price paid at retail store ($38)&lt;br /&gt;$20 rebate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No color banding to identify  individual toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;Cost of replacement heads! (every brand pet peeve)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would like to see:&lt;br /&gt;Color banding&lt;br /&gt;At least one extra replacement head included&lt;br /&gt;A multi toothbrush holder/ charging unit (ex-4 in a sleek row)&lt;br /&gt;Replacement head price drops</li>
            <li> I have owned two Pulsonics.  The first one died about a year in. It developed a crack in the bottom side. Several months after I noticed the crack it stopped working. The lights still came on but it did not work. I thought perhaps it was just deffective, so I bought another one. The same thing happened after 11 months.  Not worth the cost to replace very year.</li>
            <li> These days toothbrush manufacturers want to buff, scrape,and who knows what else to your teeth. All I want is an electric version of the old-fashioned toothbrush. When I got tired of the [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] model (too big for my mouth), I saw this model &amp; thought, \\&quot;Aha! A toothbrush that&#x27;s electric... like those of the 80&#x27;s.\\&quot;    When I powered it on, my first first thought was \\&quot;Oh, no! Dentist&#x27;s drill!!!\\&quot; On the &#x27;high&#x27; speed that&#x27;s exactly what it sounds like. On the low speed, the sound is more similar to the drone of an old prop plane.    Does it perform the job of a toothbrush? Yes.  Is it easy to use? Yes.  But had I realized the noise it makes, I would have made another choice.</li>
            <li> Have had it a month or so.  Works great, just as good as the previous generation Oral-B Sonic Toothbrush, which died after approx. 4+ years of use.  This one is about half the size of the previous generation, and equally powerful.    I did own a Philips Sonic Tooth Brush about 8 years ago, but it only lasted two years before it broke.    This one never seems to require a charge, after about two weeks of use I put it back on the charger out of habit.    Before ordering, I figured I would give the Arm &amp; Hammer Sonic Spin Brush a try (available at my local pharmacy for approx. $30).  The difference can be compared to a Pinto vs. a Lexus.  The Sonic Spin Brush worked okay, and probably if I had never owned a real Sonic Toothbrush, I would have kept it, but it was not the same.  The Sonic Spin Brush felt cheap and poorly implemented.  You definitely get what you pay for.    Now, only time will tell if the Oral-B Pulsonic will last as long as its predecessor, so 4 stars, not 5.</li>
            <li> Great quality and excellent price.</li>
            <li> My complaint is not with the product itself (has worked fine for the few weeks we&#x27;ve had them), but with Amazon for the advertising of the rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and i ordered two of these largely because of the $20 rebate that we thought applied to each one.  After searching for fine print, we went ahead with the purchase as we were unable to locate any other details of the rebate except that it was a $20 mail in to be postmarked prior to April 1.  Once we completed the purchase and went to fill out the form, we then discovered that the rebate was only applicable to one toothbrush, despite our purchasing two on the same order. After calling the customer service number, we were told we are S.O.L. on getting the rebate for both, and there is no way to \\&quot;contact the seller\\&quot; about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus we have taken to the always useful Comments section to air our grievance; We are Prime members, buy a lot of products on Amazon, and feel like Amazon should definitely do better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrushes do work great though, and despite our now degraded opinion of Amazon rebates etc, we are happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> I owned an Oral B Sonic toothbrush for about 10 years. When it stopped working I figured I would try to by a similar product since it was so good. This is not a good product. The toothbrush does not wrap around my teeth to fully clean. The \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; vibrations are weak and easy to slow down if pressed against my teeth. I would return it except I feel guilty returning a tooth brush. I recommend avoiding this product.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Update, I returned the product as suggested by the comment below. No problem with the return process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously owned nothing but Crest and Oral-B Spin Brush electric tooth brushes which by the way worked wonderfully and I&#x27;ve never had a cavity at 30 years old.  They have a dual cleaning head, one part of the head goes up and down, the other part of the head spins.  Those tooth brushes cost roughly $20 each and were rechargeable and typically lasted me 2 years.  If you&#x27;ve ever used one of those units, then you should know that this unit doesn&#x27;t work anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit pulses.  So there is no actual scrubbing, spinning, brushing going on. It pulses quite strongly to create a vibration effect that along with your hand movement cleans your teeth.  It took a few days for me to get used to this unit as the pulsing/vibration was pretty strong and annoying.  I had to start off on the softer mode and work my way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the toothbrush for you if you prefer a brush that does all the work while you just glide the moving brush around your teeth.  This toothbrush is much more like a regular toothbrush, you do the scrubbing.  The difference is this does a hell of a job at pulsing/vibrating to really help you get those teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used other electric toothbrushes and looking at my wife&#x27;s very expensive electric toothbrush, one thing that really stands out is how light and slim this unit is.  This makes it feel more like your old school manual toothbrush, but awkward if you&#x27;re used to holding an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three settings, they really do nothing more than change the strength of the vibration.  After a week of using I was able to move up to the strongest setting as I&#x27;m O.C.D when it comes to keeping my teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-There is only one type of replacement head available.  Actually two if you count the flossing/pick tool.  Whereas other electric tooth brushes come with various different heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t spin or scrub like an el cheapo Crest/Oral-B Spinbrush/Vitality dual clean does.  I&#x27;ve always felt he scrubbing and spinning action though somewhat weak compared to a more expensive brush really made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Charger/dock is flimsy, your toothbrush can easily be bumped over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No cover for your brush.  Even the cheapo $20 electric tooth brushed has a plastic snap cover to protect your brush/bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this toothbrush works great, the price is right, but it does take some getting used to.  I would definitely buy again, I&#x27;m just no overly impressed when comparing it with something like a $20 Spinbrush/Vitality unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** UPDATE 10/5/2012  *******  I&#x27;ve really grown to love this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s a workhorse.  I spend at least 10 minutes brushing my teeth in the morning.  And at 32 years old, still cavity free.  Because I brush my teeth while in the shower my electric toothbrushes get completely wet.  While they&#x27;re typically waterproof, I always worry about damaging it anyway.  This thing has been going strong, the toothbrush, the batteries, and it keeps my teeth spotless.  Definitely worth the money, and much better than some of those over priced $200 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product! battery last for almost 3 weeks, without charging..it works wonders! great deal</li>
            <li> I received my Pulsonic and have been using it for 2-3 weeks.  The handle and head is slender and easy to maneuver.  The operation is quiet and gentle yet effective.  Changing the head will be so much easier than my old Oral B Cross Action.  There are no recesses to collect toothpaste, moisture etc., so it is easy to keep clean.  I drink a lot of tea and the Pulsonic is very effective on removing stains.  I like the reminder pauses to change quadrants, but I usually give it a once more all over anyway.  BUT, my favorite feature is the gentle mode where I can really massage/clean my gums and really...my whole mouth.  It is gentle enough to not damage gums/tissue, but can certainly stimulate circulation and cleanse all at one time.  I believe this brush head and the speed is much better for my gums compared to the Ora B Cross Action that I had for at least 5 years.  I love this toothbrush and would recommend it to anyone. I do not use the other brush for between teeth because I am in the habit of always flossing before brushing which is faster than using that brush, but if you hate flossing, the little \\&quot;between\\&quot; brush would be a good thing to use. The only change I would make would be to slant the head a bit to enable reaching inside surfaces.  All in all I am VERY pleased with the Pulsonic and look forward to years of using it since my old Oral B lasted forever...in fact it is still working. It may not have all the bells and whistles of the Sonicare, but for the money, this is the best buy. After all...it is all about getting your teeth clean and maintaining a healthy mouth, which is what this toothbrush is doing for me.  AND, I do not work for Oral B.  Come on...get real paranoid people...       09/10/09:  I would like to address the issue many are having with the head coming off during use.  I have not had this problem.  I know that some people seem to brush their teeth with their mouth virtually closed and I can see where that might create the above mentioned problem.  I hold my lips way back and usually have my upper and lower teeth apart, not biting down.  If you are the person who keeps your teeth clinched and your mouth closed around the brush, you might have the brush problem.  It does twist off easily as I wipe it down after using, but I have never had it come off in my mouth.  Just food for thought if trying to decide on this product.  I still love it.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this toothbrush to replace a older Sonicare, and I like it much better for me. That said, I think that personal preferences are so different, that people with larger hands might find it too small. It is definitely a better design than my old Sonicare, which developed mold in the handle!</li>
            <li> Purchased one of these toothbrushes and was very pleased, in the beginning. It was comfortable to hold and use, and cleaned well. However, after only a few months, the gray plastic piece on the front started coming loose and eventually fell off. Then the toothbrush stopped working properly - it wouldn&#x27;t turn off. So, after only 13 months, I replaced it. Very disappointed in the quality - would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> works well, came on time and in general I think it is a good product with a great easy way to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I have used electric toothbrush for many years, but this is the first sonic toothbrush I have used. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how it cleans hard to reach spots, also how clean my teeth felt after the first brushing. Gentle enough on gums to use 3 times day. I have been using the toothbrush several months now and my teeth are noticeably whiter. Cleans up easily after use without having gaps/spaces to cause unsanitary build-up. I love this toothbrush and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> best available rechargeable power toothbrush in the market in my personal opinion. oral b comes thru once again!! bought it while mail-in rebate is still available, so actual out of pocket cost was around $25, and will be getting it shipped free via 2 day from Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I never wanted one of these until my dentist recommended it. I love using this thing and my mouth definitely feels cleaner after. Since I don&#x27;t have to do the work myself, i actually brush my teeth for 2 minutes which the toothbrush is preseted to (it uses a little pause for recommended time to brush the front, bottom and top of your teeth). Like the thin profile too and brushes are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other CONs:  vibrates rather than pulses / head twists off during brushing.  I bought mine (these are not cheap) 3 months ago before I moved across the country and cleaned out all my garbage including my receipt for this purchase.  After only 3 months, it stopped working.  It runs for about 3 seconds then shuts off.  I click it on again and it runs for 3 seconds then shuts off.  Problem is, nobody will return it without a receipt.  I will definately go to Philips, which I had before and I much preferred.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B Sonic Complete before which I loved  -- but this one is really uncomfortable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too thin to hold comfortably in the hand. Because it&#x27;s so thin, it also vibrates super forcefully in the hand and hurts. Totally bummed -- I loved my earlier toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Also disappointed in Oral B that toothburshes are not more intercompatible so that the brush heads can be intermixed between toothbrush models.</li>
            <li> After 10 months of use, the Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush burned out. I can smell a burnt scent eminating from the charging station.  It no longer accepts a charge. If you only need a toothbrush for a short period of time, this might work for you, but I expect my products to last more than one year. The Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush is low quality and does not stand up to other toothbrushes. I am not able to return the toothbrush, despite its low quality.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic toothbrush provides good sonic cleaning action but the head is very small. I was using an older Ultrasonex toothbrush that I really liked but left it in a hotel while traveling. Since the Ultrasonex is no longer available I thought I&#x27;d given the Oral-B a try. The sonic cleaning action is at a higher rate then my old toothbrush and probably provides better cleaning but the head seems very small in my mouth. I prefer the larger head that was on my old Ultrasonex.</li>
            <li> Almost no noise during use, the handler is very small, like a manual toothbrush. But the battery is a Ni-MH battery, not Li battery. I dont know how many time can this battery be charged, although the user guide said &#x27;you can put it on the base unit(charger) everyday after use, over charge is not possible. I&#x27;m still afraid this kind of use will reduce the life time of the battery.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT toothbrush.  I decided to try it after my classic Oral B spin brush died (after 6 years!).  It cleans a million times better and has even cleaned coffee stains off leaving my teeth whiter.  It takes a bit of getting used to at first because of the sonic power, but after awhile you won&#x27;t even notice.  Well worth the cost - I definitely recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had the Oral B Vitality Sonic and the batteries became more difficult to locate. Didn&#x27;t want to lose an arm and a leg to buy another toothbrush, so found this one on your website and decided it was a viable alternative. The vibrating action is more than my old one, but love it! Also love the 2 minute timer and 30 second interval stops.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints yet for this product.  My mouth definitely feels clean.  I love the timer that lets you know how much time to spend on each quadrant of your mouth, it looks sleek, not bulky, good movement on the brush head.</li>
            <li> My wife bought the Pulsonic at Target for $66.    She just loved hers and ordered me to buy one too.  But instead of Target I went to Amazon and got the same thing for only $40!!!!!  And free shipping.  Before you shop Target check out Amazon first.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as powerful as a regular sonicare and definitely not as powerful as my larger oral-b with the circular (non \\&quot;sonic\\&quot;) head. I also have to use a regular toothbrush or my circular oral-b to get tight, hard to reach places. NOTE AMAZON&#x27;S RETURN POLICY!! you have only thirty days and technically they dont have to issue a refund on a personal care item, particularly if it has been used! if you use it and determine you dont like it and initiate a return all within the thirty days they will probably only give you back 50% or not accept the return at all. if you buy it from that wharehouse store or a standard store with a good return policy, they will take it back no questions asked anywhere from 60 days to a year later.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my older oral B but for the money, this is an excellent toothbrush.  It holds a charge for over a week which is great for travel.  It is very slim which is great for packing but a little hard to hold.  Repalcement heads are way way to expensive but that is true of most electric brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this - it is slimmer and cleaner looking than most toothbrushes and is perfectly sufficient for my needs.</li>
            <li> Revised after several months of use.    I replaced my oral b sonic complete (which I really enjoyed using) with this one as the sonic complete is not being made any longer and any left over inventory is way overpriced.   I don&#x27;t love that this toothbrush feels like a jackhammer in my mouth, but I am now used to it after several months of use.  Yes, it has two settings but, it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary to use the milder setting to get used to the brush, one didn&#x27;t have to with their older model. The older model was good to go from the first use on ANY setting. There is also no indication that it is fully charged except by plugging it in when uncharged and timing it.  The older model had a flashing light and then steady when charged, this one is constantly steady at all times.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the fact that I am now aware that one must replace these units every three to five years as that is the expectency of the battery life.  I am now &#x27;cost sensitive&#x27; as I am only willing to spend so much to &#x27;rent&#x27; a unit for a couple of years (my older one lasted on the lower side of this equation) only to have to throw it and the useless, spare, brand new brushes I have away (it seems every time they make a newer sonic unit they also make newer brush heads which will not fit the older unit nor will the older unit&#x27;s brushes fit the newer one) as what else can I do with them.    On the plus side, it is very slim so it fits nicely in the hand and, I like the shape of the brush head as it is shaped like a small manual toothbrush rather than the round shape of most of the oral b electric toothbrushes.   During my last dental visit, the hygenist commented on how shiny my teeth were more than once so, I suppose that jackhammer feeling of the brush obviously did not do any harm to the enamel as I had feared it would.</li>
            <li> Bought and bring back to Asia, the battery cannot be charge.....&lt;br /&gt;i bought 2 sets, 2 sets also cannot charged in Asian in China........</li>
            <li> Wow, this thing is so active I can not use the stiff brush on it&#x27;s lowest setting.  It has a soft brush that does a good job on the lowest setting however so I will continue to use it.    Chas E. Moser</li>
            <li> Hello,    I purchased this model in hopes it would replace my sonicare e-series.  I am very tired of spending 50$ or so a year on new brush heads between my wife and I.  I had her try this brush out for 2 weeks to see if she could tell the difference between the two, and she could.  She said it did not feel nearly as powerful, nor did it clean nearly as well.    The only reason I gave it two stars is because I liked the form, and feel of the toothbrush.  If you simply cannot, or do not want to spend the money on the sonicare then I might buy this toothbrush.  I contacted oral b to ask if they offer a money back guarantee, which sonicare does. Oral b said they did not offer the guarantee on this model, but only on a couple of other models.  FIGURES!  The lady was polite, but I told her I was upset that I wasted my money on their product, and I will not be buying from them in the future.      We just bought a new sonicare base and it was within 4$ of what I spent for this brush, so you can no longer argue that they are in different categories.  I would not recommend this toothbrush to anyone.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush Oral-B     I had another Oral-B electric toothbrush until I dropped it. When looking to replace it, I read a review that made me think \\&quot;This is the one for me\\&quot;.  The major selling point is that it is small - it is easy to hold and to use in a small mouth.   The brush on this is more like the manual toothbrush that I grew up with - not the spin type of toothbrush. This toothbrush is clean, neat to use and to recharge.  The charger requires a smaller space than the other electric toothbrush I used.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is awesome.  Cleaned my  teeth better than any other electric&lt;br /&gt;toothbrush i have owned.  arrived promptly.  Have owned for 2 years and is&lt;br /&gt;still working problem free!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has changed my morning routine completely! I can sleep longer (while I stand at the sink, and let this rechargeable toothbrush do the work) - and this is a great thing, when you are up at 3 am for a feeding for your 10 month old.&lt;br /&gt;It is like getting my teeth professionally cleaned at the dentists&#x27; every morning. It really has reduced my teeth stains and people always ask if I am using the Crest white-strips (I haven&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;It is well worth the money and even my dentist has commented on how clean my teeth and gums are.&lt;br /&gt;You will never regret buying this product. Well worth the money because you cant buy a new set of teeth (Not for the price of this toothbrush anyway:))</li>
            <li> Thanks, Frank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon acquiring this device I wondered if it would soon join the collection of previous failed attempts at \\&quot;better and easier oral hygiene through technology\\&quot; currently growing mold under the bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. It is too early to evaluate the long-term benefits promised by this product, but I find it a very simple and practical design, easy to store, clean and use. It is slim in the hand and very lightweight, most of my earlier experiments were thick and bulky, and cumbersome to navigate around the mouth. Like brushing your teeth with a flashlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B has a good feel to it, natural and well-balanced, and that makes me more likely to pick it up instead of a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; brush. The brush itself is rather petite, but this makes getting into tight areas a little easier. The noise was startling at first, a shrill buzz that reminded me of another reason I never took to electrics: it shatters the quiet ritual of morning and evening brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if it works, it will be worth it. I  have so far found the single biggest complaint is that my usual rather aggressive style of use needs to be restrained, or the brush head will twist off of the body. It&#x27;s a ¼ turn quick release, and this is great for cleaning and sanitizing, but it seems to pop off in the mouth rather easily. How the bristles survive until I learn a gentler touch remains to be seen. I have to remember it&#x27;s like running a polishing tool, not a backhoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is totally sealed and waterproof, as is the charger-base. Makes clean-up a cinch, and with induction charging connection, no pesky exposed electrical connections. Pretty much standard these days, I would expect. Another small but obvious feature that you&#x27;d only notice if it was not there: the motor shuts off upon return to the base, like hanging up a phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has two speeds, \\&quot;normal\\&quot; and \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;. I find normal is probably better to use, it tickles quite a but but it is not too hard to get used to. I use the second rubber-tipped head for working the gumline, something my dentist always complains I could use some more of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When powered up, the motor is interrupted every thirty seconds with  a little blip to remind the user to move on to the next mouth quadrant. I have never been good at a disciplined approach to brushing, I find this might encourage developing some better habits. A double-blip signals the end of the session, as does a mouthful of hyper-foamed toothpaste. Try not to drool, OK?the second rubber-tipped head for working the gumline, something my dentist always complains I could use some more of.

            <li> Fantastic toothbrush! Teeth feel dentist clean every time. Baffled by the reviews stating that the head falls off; never had that happen even once. Shame on Amazon for abandoning this product. Can&#x27;t even get replacement heads from them anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for a week now. At first it tingled so much touching my tongue that I had to take a break from brushing, but after a few days I got used to it. I haven&#x27;t used electric toothbrushes before, so I can only compare the Oral-B Pulsonic to manual toothbrushes. I find that the Pulsonic leaves my teeth feeling smoother than my manual toothbrush and, apart from the tingling, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any negative effect on my gums.    Pros:  * Non-contact induction charging mechanism means there&#x27;s no metal contacts to get dirty and prevent charging  * Built-in timer to remind you to spend the recommended 30s brushing each quandrant of your teeth  * The smaller of the interchangeable brush heads allows you to brush hard-to-reach areas  * Teeth feel very clean and smooth after brushing    Cons:  * Non-contact charging mechanism is less efficient than a wired connection and therefore wastes energy  * Rechargeable battery is not replaceable - the entire toothbrush must be replaced when the battery wears out  * It doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying case. This makes it difficult to take with you when traveling, especially considering you need to take the charger, the brush and the other brush head.    Full disclosure: I received a free sample to review but was not paid nor otherwise compensated for the review.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles of some higher end products in this category. There are only two cleaning modes (clean and sensitive) vs five for some of its competitors, you can&#x27;t get different size/shape brush heads (other than the pointy Precision Tip brush that comes with it) and it doesn&#x27;t come with any of the nicer amenities like a travel case, brush head covers or a UV sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does have going for it is size that&#x27;s a lot more manageable than most of its competitors and a price that&#x27;s similarly slim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a number of high end products in this category, by Oral-B, Phillips and Braun. They&#x27;re all bulky beasts, that, with their recharging stations, take up a lot of counter space. Not this one. It&#x27;s just about as skinny as a regular toothbrush - in fact, it&#x27;s slimmer than the battery-powered toothbrushes you can get for $5-10, like the [[ASIN:B001KYVQ8A Colgate 360 Sonic Power Soft Toothbrush]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the streamlined size works. I don&#x27;t have a lot of sinktop, and I appreciate the fact that this toothbrush takes up less space. If I&#x27;m traveling, the unit and charger are easy to bring along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B knows what&#x27;s they&#x27;re doing with their Sonic brushes, and, like the others, this one leaves your mouth clean and tingly. That being said, it feels a little weaker than the larger models I&#x27;ve used, but not so much that it doesn&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviewers here note that this model requires you to move the brush in circular motions, but I always did that with my old electric toothbrushes, too. Who knew you weren&#x27;t supposed to? It feels natural to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Slim, takes up little counter space, gets my teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Lack of bundled accessories, doesn&#x27;t feel quite as powerful as some of its bigger siblings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: A great buy for the price, and perfect if you travel or don&#x27;t have a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li> Great value for an electrical toothbrush and love the flossing head that&#x27;s included. Nice and light and charges quickly between uses. Usually only charge once a week.</li>
            <li> I gave these as gifts to all my adult children this Christmas.  It was a big hit.  I also purchased one for myself and have been completely satisfied.  It&#x27;s much quieter that my last Oral B toothbrush.  Oral B makes a really good product!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this Electric Toothbrush.  Love how it alerts you to move to the next zone of you mouth.</li>
            <li> Awesome buy.  I was just at the Dentist and received a clean bill of health.  My gums had even improved since my last cleanning.  I also love the slender look, doesnt take up much room and has a realy long battery life befor you need to recharge.  The two settings are great, especially since I have titanium implanted teeth, so I use the sensitive setting on part of my mouth and the regular setting on the rest.  It was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> but it does the job, the advantage is its slim design, I would purchase it for gals/women uses.</li>
            <li> I did not realize it would so jolt my teeth so much when I used it.  it destroyed a three tooth bridge by breaking off one of the hinge teeth! It has cost thousands for me to replace the bridge. I can&#x27;t begin to share how upsetting this is.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the sonic toothbrushes. My son loves his. When I asked my dentist, he said getting used to the vibration might take a bit of doing but otherwise he feels the cleaning is superior to brushing. I tried this one because the handle is slim, the charger is small &amp; the reviews said the vibration wasn&#x27;t quite as strong as the more expensive one.  Also, there are 2 settings. I tried it, I use it twice a day, &amp; I like it very much!</li>
            <li> My husband and I really like this toothbrush. The best thing about it compared to other electric toothbrushes is that it is shaped more like a regular toothbrush, with a lightweight, comfortable base. The toothbrush itself is attractive and easy to rinse off. There are 2 settings and it will go until you turn it off (unlike some that just shut off.) We are happy with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace my second sonicare that died in under six months so since I had good luck with oral B in the past, I decided to go back to them and didn&#x27;t regret it at all.  It is a very thin toothbrush but not uncomfortably so, easy to grasp in your hand.  I noticed immediately when I used it that it seemed to get my teeth cleaner than the sonicare as evidenced by little bits of grime the sonicare had never been able to get, this thing grasped with ease and afterwards my teeth felt a good deal cleaner as well.  The heads for this thing are also cheaper at least, on amazon so I think this thing is a winner.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several of these toothbrushes for my wife and kids.  I find that they do good at what they should do, cleaning teeth, as my son has done better during his routine dental exams.  Now, although the toothbrush does well, the cost of replacement heads is not cheap.  I&#x27;ve purchased the generic brands, and have found they do just as well as the Oral-B brand, with some cost savings, but you are still going to pay, and they do need replacement at least every other month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have purchased several of these, most have held up very well, however, one came apart, partly because my son did not take great care of it, but I did not believe it should have failed the way it did.  This may have been an isolated occurrence, but after using it for about two years, I still would not have expected the unit to come apart the way it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reasons for a 4 star review, and I&#x27;d like to think of it as more of a 4.25 rating, are the cost of replacement heads, and the issue with one of the units coming apart and being unusable in a way I did not feel it should have.  If replacement heads were more in the $3 - $4 range, I see this as a better value.  I see this as the company does not charge much for the basic unit, but makes their money off of replacement brush heads, kind of like Hewlett Packard makes their money at selling ink cartridges, while practically giving away printers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend others to purchase this?  I do, and if for no other reason, based on the improvement my son saw from using this toothbrush over a standard toothbrush.  You will pay a little more for this toothbrush, as opposed to using standard toothbrushes, but your teeth will thank you...</li>
            <li> Before I received the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush I was using the conventional, bulky, sonic toothbrush (Philips Sonicare).  Comparing the Pulsonic to the conventional sonic toothbrushes, the first thing to be noticed is the size.  The Pulsonic is about the same size as a manual toothbrush, which is much smaller than all electronic toothbrushes currently on the market.  This can easily be seen from the packaging before you even take the product home (the packaging by the way was uncluttered, easy to open and very visually appealing).  The smaller size of the toothbrush is not merely an aesthetic benefit either.  After having dealt with my old sonic toothbrush for so long I look at it now and wonder how I ever thought that it was normal to use something the size of a flashlight to brush my teeth.  The Pulsonic was much easier to handle while brushing and yes, it does look much nicer in your bathroom (even the charger is not the usual eyesore).      Now to the nitty gritty, what does the Pulsonic sacrifice to achieve this chic new compact design?  Nothing, except unwanted complexities.  The sonic action of the Pulsonic is not diminished at all by the smaller size (for those who aren&#x27;t familiar with general benefits of sonic brushing, do a google search for animated teeth.).  The battery life of the Pulsonic is long enough that I can leave it out of the charger for more than a week and still be able to brush twice a day.  There is only one button on the brush, push once to turn on strong cleaning, once more for a gentler setting and a third time to turn off.  This takes the place of the usual multi-button brush with a variety of settings, only one of which you actually wind up using.        The Pulsonic comes with one standard brush head and one precision head that has a brush area about the size of a toothpick and stiffer bristles.  The precision head is good for floss-like cleaning and it makes me glad to have the gentler setting on the unit.  There is also a timer feature built into the Pulsonic that gives a short lag in the brushing action every 30 seconds for the recommended two minutes of brushing.  This is designed to help you spend the right amount of time in the four quadrants of your mouth, and has always seemed silly to me, but after using it for a while I am following the routine without even thinking.  The charger, as I already mentioned, is small but sturdy and while it lacks a snapping mechanism to hold the brush in place while it charges, the Pulsonic sits very securely in its charging cradle and comes away from the charger without sticking (a problem I had with my old brush).  All the surfaces of the brush are smooth and easy to clean and to stress the point again, it looks very \\&quot;natural,\\&quot; and not at all clunky, sitting on my counter.     Overall, the brush does everything a sonic brush should, none of the things I think it shouldn&#x27;t and it takes up less space and looks great.  The price is at the lower end of the sonic brush range (counterintuitive to a newly introduced, more compact design) and the replacement brush heads come in a three pack that makes them more affordable as well.  If you&#x27;re looking for your first sonic brush, or an upgrade from your old one, I cannot think of a reason not to pick the Pulsonic from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> I have the [[ASIN:B0019ZGU1S Philips Sonicare R732 HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush]] so was a little skeptical that this little Oral-B could do the same job at about half the price.  Well, it doesn&#x27;t, but it comes very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the good.&lt;br /&gt;This a very powerful and effective tooth cleaner in a compact package.  It&#x27;s slim form makes it ideal for taking on trips, and if you don&#x27;t want to lug the charger around with you -- no worries.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a week and it kept on humming!  The bristle pattern is a little more comfortable than my Sonicare and while it \\&quot;blips\\&quot; every 30 seconds to let you know to brush a different section of your teeth, it doesn&#x27;t shut off after 2 minutes like the Sonicare, which I find mildly annoying.  It comes with a handy unobtrusive charging station and an extra smaller head for getting hard to reach spots.  I have only used it once, but it is nice to know it is available if I need it.  It is also quite easy to clean. All in all, a decent sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it doesn&#x27;t quite clean as well as the Sonicare.  I guess the slim handle, just can&#x27;t generate the vibrational power of the larger toothbrush.  It does a good job, but if you really want that &#x27;just came from the dentist&#x27; clean, then the Sonicare would be my recommendation, even at the higher price point.  It also doesn&#x27;t have quite the same solid construction and the head is not quite as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on a budget, want a good (not great) sonic toothbrush, then I have no trouble recommending the Oral-B Pulsonic.  However, you do get what you pay for, and if you are will to pay a bit more, better brushes are out there.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I buy an electric toothbrush. After reading the reviews for the Pulse Sonic and with the 50% rebate, I decided to order it. I never used an electric toothbrush but I would not recommend this toothbrush. It is very uncomfortable as it vibrates the teeth unless you use the sensitive setting. Even then if you move in the wrong direction it still vibrates the teeth. I would not recommend this to anyone. I used my wife&#x27;s Triumph OralB which rotates and is MUCH more comfortable. I wish I could return this toothbrush to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the size/weight of this item - can easily be packed for travel.  I haven&#x27;t been to a dental appointment yet to see if its cleaning effectiveness is as good as my previous toothbrush.  Overall, pleased with the results so far!</li>
            <li> First one I owned lasted 5 years... that&#x27;s expensive for a toothbrush but, 2 different dentist both told me how good my mouth looked after I started using it. So I happily bought a replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of another Oral-B, the [[ASIN:B0002M50Z6 Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]], that&#x27;s the bigger brother of this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Pulsonic is easy to set-up and use, but felt underpowered compared to the Sonic Complete. My teeth didn&#x27;t feel quite as clean, \\&quot;high\\&quot; mode wasn&#x27;t as powerful as I expected.  The Sonic Complete has 3 cleaning modes versus the 2 on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design-wise, this Pulsonic is lighter and smaller than the Sonic Complete.  It doesn&#x27;t have a gap between brush head and handle, so there&#x27;s less place for crud to build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomically, the handle is too narrow, kind of an awkward fit for a man&#x27;s hand once it&#x27;s wet.  The Sonic Complete is probably twice as thick.  The wall-mount charger is small and probably won&#x27;t keep a casual brush-by from knocking the toothbrush down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is the same approximate size as my Sonic Complete heads, but is not even vaguely interchangable.  Pulsonic comes with one each of two kinds of heads.  My Sonic Complete comes with two of one kind of head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Environmentally, this unit has a NiMH battery versus the toxic NiCad in the Sonic Complete.  That means this unit can safely go in the trash at the end of its lifespan, while the NiCad battery in the Sonic Complete would have to be separated and discarded specially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a first-time purchaser, the [[ASIN:B0002M50Z6 Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]] makes more sense as an all-around power toothbrush, and it comes with two brushheads and a travel-case.  This one would make a good choice for somebody with small hands (children) or for a second toothbrush to keep in your travel kit.</li>
            <li> It seems other people have had the same problem with the brush head popping off while brushing too.  Wish I had read more reviews before buying two! This happened to me and my husband when he tried his...it is really easy to twist ever so slightly while brushing which pops head off. It is not a secure locking head like Sonicare which is frustrating when you are changing angles to brush and find you have to stop and put the head back on. Also, while the handle is very sleek the brush head is not at all.  It feels very thick and bulky in the mouth compared to the Sonicare which makes it harder to use properly to reach all areas of teeth. Third issue is minor but to turn off unit you have to hit off twice to cycle pass the sensitive mode to the off mode. Returning two of these and will probably go back to Sonicare for next purchase.</li>
            <li> I used Sonic for several years.  When it was time to replace it I didn&#x27;t even think of using another product.  The new Sonic works great.</li>
            <li> Far better price than any that come close in power and efficiency. Easy to use. 13 year old likes narrow brush for around braces.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonic Care toothbrush for several years. Today I got the Oral B Pulsonic for Christmas. I like the slim design, and it seems to clean the teeth well. The problem is that the toothbrush head fell off twice during use. Maybe it is vibrating off? Also it feels a little cheapy compared to Sonic care, and the vibration is a little more rough. If you are trying to decide between the two types. Get the Sonic Care. It is seems to be made better and is higher quality.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush blows.  The brush head DOES NOT STAY ON ITS BASE and vibrates off constantly while in use, leaving a big piece of plastic in your mouth.  The latch and groove that snaps the head in place grips the base with about as much strength as a dirty post-it note. So, if you enjoy holding big pieces of plastic in your mouth, then this is the toothbrush for you.  If you enjoy poorly engineered oral hygiene products, then this is the toothbrush for you.  If you enjoy handing large sums of money over to massive corporations in exchange for a giant piece of plastic in your mouth, then this is the toothbrush for you.  And finally, if you have NO TEETH or one day hope to HAVE NO TEETH, then this is definitely the toothbrush for you!</li>
            <li> Well, I was a little bit sceptical about this product when decided to buy. I do my toothbrushing very routinely twice a day, replace my toothbrush every 3 months and thought there is nothing better than my old-fashioned toothbrush and me to fight cavity.    But I was wrong, this product cleans your teeth absolutely outstanding. Give it a 5-day run on regular basis (twice a day) with scrutinized clean (both brushes) in the evening and recommended 4-minute regular clean in the morning and you feel the difference! Much more than this, it has 2 different cleaning modes, regular and sensitive.    Another thing worth to note is the brush design. Thin and lightweight with special grips so you do not have to worry whether you do or not hold the brush correctly.    I would recommend it to buy to everyone who is looking for such kind of product.</li>
            <li> Because two of my Philips Sonicare toothbrushes failed in the last four years, I wanted to find an alternative but this one is not even close.  It operates, it buzzes, it looks and feels a bit like the Sonicare, but compared to the Sonicare it has no cleaning power.  A good sonic toothbrush can go a long way to keeping teeth white, clean and can reduce the number of trips to the dentist, but I don&#x27;t think this one is the answer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and fits easily in your hand. Does a pretty good job brushing. Pretty good electric toothbrush for the money.</li>
            <li> great brush and very slim design but not too light in weight.  battery lasted at least a week of brush.</li>
            <li> easy to place order.  easy to use.  i would consider to place more orders.  the price was right also.  dislike writing the reviews though.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  It is light weight, unlike the last one that I had and is not as loud.  Does a great job cleaning.</li>
            <li> This a great alternative to the bulkier, heavier electric toothbrushes. The sensitive setting is useful for those getting used to electric toothbrushes for the first time.</li>
            <li> The Pulsonic cleans deeper and better than any manual or power brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s slim, light, and the charger has a very small footprint.  With it&#x27;s fairly low cost and associated rebate, this brush is a winner!</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this purchase, cheapest price I could find when compared to competitor retail stores.  Plus I was able to take advantage of the $15 mail-in rebate, too!  I was searching for an affordable electric toothbrush that was slim but powerful:  this Oral-B Pulsonic will more than suffice.  The timer-mechanism is pretty cool (every 30 secs) and lets you know when to switch quadrants of your mouth.  Also notifies you after 2 minutes has spanned.  I highly recommend this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only slight drawback (minimal) is how you switch modes, essentially need to press the main button for toggling through them and turning the toothbrush off.  No biggie though, it&#x27;s pretty easy to become acclimated to that system quickly!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Very thin and lightweight and cleans well.  50% coupon makes it even better.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this great toothbrush from OralB.  The first one I bought almost a year ago and still works great, although the battery seems to need more frequent charging lately.  This second one I bought for my brother.  The BEST feature of this brush is how small/compact and lightweight it is, and that it gives an amazingly strong pulsonic action despite its small size.  My only gripe preventing a 5-star rating is that even though OralB designed this brush so compact and perfect for travel, OralB was too cheap to add a few more cents to make charging base chargeable in Asian countries, or elsewhere.  Just about every cell phone charger allows you to plug into a 110-220v wall outlet, it would have pennies more for Oral B to do this and yet it failed its customers.  I bought this second one in 9/2010 while Amazon &amp; OralB had a 50% off rebate so ended up paying only $25 for it - a definite buy at that price!  Don&#x27;t think I would pay over $40 given the restrictive charging base.</li>
            <li> I had one of those cheap oral b toothbruses for like $12, but now I am seeing the light. This&lt;br /&gt;really feels like it&#x27;s working and my teeth look so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is an excellent product because of its capacity in removing the stains and whitening your teeth. It has the regular vibration motion and the sensitive vibration motion that is perfect for people with sensitives teeth and gums. Also it let you know the time that you need to clean each quadrant of your teeth and the minimun two minutes to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> My son ask for this one Christmas and I got it for him with some replacement heads. He likes it.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st sonic toothbrush and I&#x27;m addicted to it. A whole other level of clean. I just wish they had a traveling case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about two months now.  When I first used it felt very strange.  The vibrating was not pleasant, but I got use to it.  I used to have bleeding gums, after using this and raising my mouth with water and salt the bleeding has stopped.  Unlike the other electric toothbrush this one has no moving parts so you will still have to brush like you did with a regular toothbrush.  All in all I like this product.  Another plus the replacement heads aren&#x27;t too expensieve.   ******Update went dead after one year.</li>
            <li> great toothbrush at a great price. i&#x27;ve had this for about two years now. charge lasts long (comes with small base that you plug into the wall), travels well (note that it doesn&#x27;t come with a travel pack, but it&#x27;s hard to go back to using manual brushes after using electric) and looks a lot nicer than competing brushes at this price range (has a more slender, sleek design than bulky cheaper versions). it has two modes for brushing and even the generic replacement heads will work on this just as well. The brush heads are a great size - not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> I just got back from the dentist and this was my worst check-up ever! The only thing that I have changed was my toothbrush.  I would not recomment this toothbrush to anyone.  It does not clean like the round head Oral-b toothbrushes.  Having had a round head Oral-b toothbrush in the pass that is what I will go back to.  How disappointing to spend $$$ for a toothbrush that is useless.</li>
            <li> The precision tip of this toothbrush is great for getting those spaces between teeth and does a very good job. I wore the tip out within a few weeks. The only replacement heads for this toothbrush have three regular brushes and only a single precision tip. I searched high and low for just replacement precision tips - nothing on line. Called Oral-B they told me to get a head that does not work with this vibrating toothbrush. When I called them back they apologetically agreed that there was no other way to get additional precision tips without getting three regular toothbrush heads - a complete waste.  So if you want to get this toothbrush because of the extra precision head to take care of your gums - look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Brushhead won&#x27;t stay on even on the slower mode.  Seems like the vibration is making the brushhead loose so I can&#x27;t finish brushing my teeth.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am not new to electric toothbrushes but having recently purchased the Clairsonic, pulsating technology for my face and bocy, I thought I&#x27;d also try pulsonic tech for my teeth. I love how clean my teeth feel after brushing. My only problem with this toothbrush, as others have mentioned, is that it does not come with a toothbrush protector or cap so I feel the need to rinse it well with hot water before I can use it. Other than that, it really is a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> What I had before this was the Crest SpinBrush. I thought it was okay, until I tried this one. This is a fabulous brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Rechargeable battery. Not likely to lose juice any time soon-just make sure you charge it for 12 hours before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Small handle. It&#x27;s not much bigger around than a regular toothbrush, especially when compared to the monster I&#x27;ve been using. The charger is compact, too, and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Compact head. Fits in small mouths but cleans no worse for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Soft bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Vibrates rather than spinning. The spinning kind really chewed up my gums. This one was quite comfortable to use, save for a bit of a tickle in my jaw from the vibrations. Went away as soon as the brush was off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Has a setting for normal or sensitive teeth. I chose the sensitive and my teeth are not sore. I don&#x27;t feel the gums being damaged as I did with my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Stops briefly to let you know when it&#x27;s time to switch \\&quot;quadrants.\\&quot; (You&#x27;re supposed to brush maximum 2 minutes by brushing one half of the top teeth for 30 seconds, then the other, then half of the bottom teeth, and then the other half.) When the maximum 2 minutes has elapsed, the brush gives a double signal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. There is a precision attachment to get between teeth and into dental work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Does a fantastic job. My teeth are very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit louder than I expected, but certainly better than the SpinBrush, and the vibrating tickled my jaw. Hardly worth mentioning, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am incredibly pleased with this product. I would definitely buy this again and will recommend it to all my family members.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this toothbrush! I have a very expensive Sonicare which has the major drawback of being very bulky. This Oral B Pulsonic is such a nice alternative. The size is perfect. It is only just a tad larger than a regular manual toothbrush. It is great. It is very comfortable to use, the head size and shape is great and it works very well. My teeth feel so clean and smooth and look shiny. I never thought I would choose anything over my Sonicare, but this toothbrush by Oral B was a pleasant surprise and I do now prefer it due to it&#x27;s slim design and comfortability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the exact same model I&#x27;ve been using for 3 years. I tried another of Oral-B&#x27;s lower cost units, and it was like a concrete mixer against my teeth. This one has two speeds, is slim enough even for small mouths, and last a long time on a charge. It also gets your teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush cleans my teeth better than any brush I have used before.  I was able to get for $50 and got a rebate of $15 to bring the total to $35.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush far surpassed my expectations in terms of size, weight, sturdiness, quietness and functionality for a sonic toothbrush. Featuring two cleaning modes: sensitive, and full-power, the Pulsonic makes a discernible difference in dental brightness with regular daily use... brightening teeth two shades in just one week&#x27;s time, in my case of twice daily use. While other sonic toothbrushes tend to be somewhat bulkier, the Pulsonic is perfect for taking along when traveling, which is absolutely wonderful! Not only is this toothbrush built for home use, it&#x27;s the one you won&#x27;t want to be without wherever you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love the 30 second timer feature, which allows me to daydream while brushing, yet still ensure that I&#x27;m brushing each quadrant of my mouth for a full 30 seconds. The sensitive mode is a bit more vigorous than people may be expecting who&#x27;ve been using sensitive bristled brushes for years, as I have... yet I found I can get used to the sonic sensations, and I even feel that my gums and teeth are gaining strength, cleanliness and overall health. Gums can really benefit from a good massage, so anyone whose gums and teeth are in fairly good condition can help maintain and improve their dental health, rather than see the kind of decline that might otherwise occur with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just how compact is this toothbrush? At eight and a half inches long, and less than three quarters of an inch in diameter at the base, this beautifully ergonomically designed toothbrush balances effortlessly in one&#x27;s hand, with batteries down toward the base of the brush just heavy enough to provide perfect balance while brushing. The wave-like pattern in the regular brush-head enables the vibrating bristles to easily access hard-to-reach spots between teeth and at the gum-line, and a second Precision Tip brush head that has toothbrush bristles aligned into a point shape allows even better access between teeth. The directions provided in the package instruct that the brush be moved across the teeth in circular movements, as if brushing with a manual toothbrush, which seems very natural and easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions indicate that some people may experience bleeding of the gums the first few days of use, and while this did not occur for me, as I&#x27;ve already been using sonic toothbrushes, I can see how the sheer power of this toothbrush might cause some bleeding gums for individuals who have so far only been hand-brushing their teeth with sensitive-bristled brushes (as I used to do). Being someone who has worked myself back into a much better state of dental health, I can heartily testify to the advantages of brushing with electric toothbrushes in general, and sonic toothbrushes in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Pulsonic so much that I would consider it to be a perfect gift for the person who has everything... provided their teeth and gums are not already so sensitive that sonic toothbrushes would be out of the question. This is one of those perfect examples of technology making the world a much better place, as the ease of use, outstanding health and cosmetic benefits, and portability make the Pulsonic a toothbrush I don&#x27;t want to live without!  Highly, highly recommended.truct that the brush be moved across the teeth in circular movements, as if brushing with a manual toothbrush, which seems very natural and easy to do.

            <li> my teeth look so much whiter. two different speeds are great, and everything but the electric part of the stand is waterproof.Brush fits teeth too. Use as directed</li>
            <li> Nice and slim, takes up little space on the counter.  Battery lift is good too.  I&#x27;ve taken it on a 2 week trip out of the country and didn&#x27;t have to charge it.  Replacement heads are a little expensive, but not much different than other similar toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of my hygenist.  I started having periodontal issues and my hygenist suggested I replace my cheap &#x27;spin brush&#x27; with this.  Am I happy I took her advice.  This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  My teeth/gums have never felt better.  I go back to the dentist in July and I can&#x27;t wait to see what they have to say this time.  I have not experienced any of the problems some other reviewers have with the brush coming off etc.  I keep the charger plugged in and store it there.  I have to remember to let it run down completely some time in the next few months as the instructions suggest.  I&#x27;m ready to buy a second one for my husband.</li>
            <li> I was using Oral-B CrossAction before, and I was totally happy with that product. After I lost it in China, I purchased Pulsonic, and I have had a very bad experience with this different model. My gum started to bleed a lot, continually, and every time when I brush the teeth, when I was doing it the same way as before when I was using CrossAction.     Please keep away from this product. Don&#x27;t be lured by the 50% rebate. Your gum health is worth more than that.</li>
            <li> I was a little unhappy about this order. I received it early, I charged it up per the instructions but when I went to use it the brush head kept falling off. Hard to brush your teeth when the brush won&#x27;t stay on. I read some reviews from other users online and all said that it had to be a faulty brush head. I had purchased replacement heads at the same time so I tried it. It worked just fine so I don&#x27;t have to return it. I really like the toothbrush. The handle is slim so is easy to hold onto. My old Sonicare was huge and cumbersome for me to use. My teeth feel clean and my gums stimulated. I have some periodontal issues so this is a good sign for me. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does not have a very long cord. Can&#x27;t go from a lighting fixture over the medicine cabinet to the counter. I wanted a unit that mounted on the wall.  It&#x27;s very, very loud. Like a huge mosquito.  Annoying. Very annoying. And sometimes it just won&#x27;t re-start and I have to use a regular brush. Sorry I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> i used to use an oral-b professional care electric tooth brush.  wanted to give sonic technology a try.  overall i think brushing with sonic toothbrushes are a little more work because you have to do the rotating motion with your hand.  nonetheless i really like the design and form factor of this toothbrush.  it&#x27;s much lighter and more compact than the rotating head electrics from oral-b.  the lightweight makes brushing easier and also makes traveling with it easier.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for several reasons, but the first is its slim, light-weight design and easy-to-use convenience. . its so easy to store between daily uses and carry for traveling.  the battery is powerful too, as each charge lasts 15-18 days.  i had used phillips, &#x27;sonic care&#x27; brand for about 7 years before discovering this little gem.  its so small that i was a little fearful that it would not be as effective, but my last visit to the dentist (1-22-12) for a check-up and cleaning, proved it does an even better job of maintaining good dental health.  it has the normal brush head and a small pointed gum-line brush attachment that is wonderful!  it really gets those hard to reach places...behind, over and under.  amazon has it for such a good price, too, that it is real value for your dollar!  i cant recommend it more highly!</li>
            <li> The base has two elongated screw slots 1.125 inches apart for wall mounting. If you want to try to mount it on ceramic tile with double-stick foam tape, the available area is about 1 inch tall and 1.75 inches wide, which seems on the small side. The electric cord is about 4 feet long and there are slots on the back and both sides to direct the cord in 3 different directions. There is no provision to hide extra slack of the cord inside the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun seems to go out of their way to hide the fact that wall-mounting is available. There is no mention of it in any of the marketing materials nor on the box.</li>
            <li> Yes, this toothbrush cleans your teeth. Really cleans them. But I&#x27;m not sold on it. There is a real deal breaker here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: When compared to my Sonicare, this brand actually works better at removing plaque, and I really, really like the little pick brush. It gets into tight areas and along the gum line if you need it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: There are problems with this product though. Even on the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting, the brushing can be a bit harsh. If it didn&#x27;t do such a good job, this would have been the deal breaker, but it&#x27;s not. I remember that when first using the Sonicare, the intensity of the vibration gradually increased over time to allow your mouth and teeth to adjust to the new sensation. This one comes at you full speed from day one - all guns blazing. Also, I really miss the Sonicare feature where it shuts off after 2 minutes. Yes, this one is supposed to beep, but my didn&#x27;t always do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly: Then there&#x27;s the deal breaker - the handle is so small and it vibrates so intensely in my hand that it is painful to use on a daily basis. I have carpal tunnel on the right and an old stress fracture on the left, so even though this products does what it is supposed to do very well, I will continue to use my larger grip, smoother running Sonicare on  a regular basis and this product only once in  awhile for a \\&quot;spit polish.\\&quot; I would not recommend this product for anyone with large hands, previous or current hand injury or nerve damage, or any one with arthritis.</li>
            <li> This is quite simply the best toothbrush I have ever used.  I love the silver and white colors and slim, lightweight design, not to mention the small head, 30 second reminders, and ease of cleaning.  And my dental hygenist was impressed for the first time in years!</li>
            <li> This is a rather mediocre electric brush compared with other Oral-B products (such as the Triumph, which is excellent) or any of the Sonicare line of brushes. Limited power and battery life, so-so ergonimics, and uncomfortable to use. Why the three stars and not just one? It has one strong redeeming feature -- the precision tip brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have both a Oral-B Triumph and a Sonicare (can&#x27;t remember the model number), and find both to be excellent performers. They are different, and each has its strengths/weaknesses, so I alternate between the two. The one shortcoming neither address well is getting between teeth to get out tea and coffee stains (and the occasional cigarette). For me, the lower front teeth are especially problematic -- they are very tightly spaced, and stains set in easily between the teeth, as well as on the backside. My 6-month dental cleaning/checkup gets rid of them, but by month 4 or 5, they&#x27;re back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B makes a small brush for people with braces, but it&#x27;s ineffective at getting out in-between teeth stains. The Precision Tip for the Pulsonic, however, has been great. After brushing with either the Triumph or Sonicare, I finish with a 30-60 second run using the Precision Tip. Works like a charm, and makes the Pulsonic worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everything else, the Pulsonic is a so-so performer at best. Granted, it is less expensive than other models, but this is a case where you get what you pay for. Uncomfortable (handle buzzes far, far more than any other electric brush I&#x27;ve used), the head is poorly shaped to get at tight spots, and the build quality is a notch below other Oral-B products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to stop or get rid of in-between teeth stains, get this model and use it in combination with another model. If in-between teeth stains are not an issue, don&#x27;t even bother with this. Pick up a different Oral-B or a Sonicare -- you&#x27;ll be a lot happier with it than the Pulsonic.</li>
            <li> What more can be said. Small form factor, timed cleaning, multiple head types available and rechargeable. Great product.</li>
            <li> This was a great toothbrush until it stopped working,&lt;br /&gt;I opened it up and found out the battery was overcharged from 1.2 to 2.1v and if it was left charging could caught on fire, leaked murcury or exploded. Imagine if your brushing your teeth when that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theres a fundamental flaw in this design.&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used!  I have used the interplak and braun Oral B for years, but the level of cleaning I got was never as good at the gumline as it is with this product.  In addition, there&#x27;s clear benefit with respect to staining which has improved over my first few weeks of use.  I love that this toothbrush is a reasonable size and holds charge long enough for me to use it on long trips.  Also, it&#x27;s a great value given its low price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why anyone would give this toothbrush less than 5 stars. I bought this toothbrush after my Sonicare fell on the floor and never worked the same. I have been using a Crest Spinbrush since my Sonicare broke, which I hated. I have been using the Pulsonic for a few weeks now. This toothbrush is amazing! It is so light and slim, and I love the smaller brush attachment for the back teeth and in between teeth. When I am done my teeth feel so clean, like I just had them polished at the dentist! So far I like this toothbrush way more than the Sonicare, which was too heavy, the brush head was too large for my liking, and when you take it out of your mouth to spit, you (and the mirror) get splattered. That doesn&#x27;t happen with the Pulsonic. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price for the Pulsonic. My boyfriend is getting annoyed with me because every time I use it I tell him how much I love it. HaHa! I highly recommend it, try it for yourself, I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and after a trip to a couple of stores and seeing the high price on other brands I decided to give this one a try. I have been using Oral-b products for years and knew they are a good product.  I do not need all the bells and whistles they offer and this one had everything I need.  I have been using it for about a month now and really like it.  It holds a charge really well and it came fully charged.  The 2 minute dentist recommended time indicator is great.  I find I brush longer now and pay more attention to each area because I know I will be reminded when it is time to change areas.  I have used a smaller toothbrush for years and found this one to be a perfect size brush as well as the handle is not that much bigger than a manual toothbrush.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t love is the cord is in the base - not detachable so the base needs a larger space to accomidate the cord.  Not a large space but more than it would if the cord was detachable.   I would definately buy another or recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> had this for a few years now , battery still works well and it cleans well while being nice and slim. overall its a winner - would buy it again.  only con as always brush heads cost too much</li>
            <li> Small, light, powerful, maneuverable.  Excellent product, only slightly thicker than an ordinary (non-powered) toothbrush.  I continue to use it months after purchase.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Bought this item 2 years ago and after about 18 months it gave up on me. It started with power intermittent on and off during brushing until it completely gave up. Will have to buy same one again as I still do have replacement brushes</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this product after being recommended by a friend.  I have been a Sonicare user for close to 10 years and recently bought another Oral B prouduct that has a rotating brush.  The product was good but I missed the Sonic action I have been use to.  The toothbrush is a great value over 50% less than Sonicare products and seems to work exactly the same.  Oral B and Sonicare has a 2 minute timer but Sonicare turns off the device while Oral B as a pulsating \\&quot;notice.\\&quot;  I have not purchased replacement heads but so far I have been very happy.      Additionally I travel a lot and the toothbrush easily keeps a charge for at least a week and is compact.  I never travel with the charging attachement.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but was really surprised to find only one brush included. My husband asked \\&quot;where&#x27;s mine\\&quot;. A nuisance having to find another (local CVS didn&#x27;t have any) so several more days waiting for Amazon delivery</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about buying this brush, since it was smaller than typical electric brushes and because it is a \\&quot;store brand.\\&quot;  I originally bought an \\&quot;advanced\\&quot;, but not \\&quot;elite\\&quot; model from my dentist several years ago on her recommendation.  It worked fine for me for many years.  But it seemed no matter how often I brushed and flossed, I could never get a compliment from her.  I eventually went back to my old habits.  When it finally died, I broke open its Fort Knox-like enclosure only to discover two rechargeable AA batteries.  I vowed not to give them any more of my business, if I could avoid it.     Then, I bought this one.  I liked the size, though it took a little while to adjust to the feel of it.  The brush also felt a little different.  I eventually got used to it and was quite satisfied with it.  The real amazement was when I went in for my checkup.  I hadn&#x27;t been flossing that regularly, but I got the best checkup ever!  They were actually impressed with the progress I&#x27;d made.   I can&#x27;t recommend this brush enough, especially if you have a history with periodontal problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Sonicare for 6 years. In fact, I&#x27;ve been through 2 sonicare toothbrush systems. Both of them had the UV light to sterilize the toothbrush head, and they cost around $100 for each system. After 5 years, 2 sonicare systems, and numerous toothbrush heads, I couldn&#x27;t justify the cost. The first sonicare died after 4 years of use, and I probably spent around $500 for all the sonicare products and systems. I decided to switch to this cheaper product, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to have this good of a quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Light weight, easy to handle, large toothbrush head, Extra precision head, good battery life, and large brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Noise, base is too light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things you notice is the lightness of the pulsonic. At first, I thought it meant that it was cheap. Over the past few months, I realized something. The sonicare was ridiculously heavy. A toothbrush should be light, and easy to handle. Once I started using it, there were two other differences. These were the size of the toothbrush, and the noise. The toothbrush head is significantly bigger than the sonicare, and the Oral-B pulsonic was noisier. The noise was annoying at the beginning, but I gradually got used to it. For reference, It&#x27;s as loud as my norelco electric razor. The brush head was awkward to use, but I went on to like it. The reasons being that it was better than the Sonicare brush heads. It was bigger, and had more bristles.&lt;br /&gt;This meant that it was sturdier, and covered my whole tooth when brushing. After two weeks, my new sonicare brush heads would be frayed at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other things in the box are the manual, base, and the precision brush head. The manual states that you need to keep the base plugged in at all times, and let the toothbrush discharge every 6 months. I unplugged my base 5 days ago. While brushing about 2 minutes twice a day, I haven&#x27;t run out of battery. The base is made of hard plastic and clear plastic. The clear plastic is the part that holds the pulsonic and two brush heads. It&#x27;s removable, so you can rinse it off in the sink and dry it off. The one con of the base is the weight. It&#x27;s very light, and could easily tip over. The precision brush head is something I haven&#x27;t used. It will be useful for those with partial dentures, or if you had some recent dental work. Like brushing between the gaps of your tooth, or cleaning the sides of a tooth that recently had a filling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When comparing to my sonicare, some things missing from the pulsonic would be the automatic shutoff, the brush head covers, and the UV brush cleaner. It does pulse every 30 seconds, so you can develop a routine. I started to brush the bottom teeth for two pulses, then start brushing the top teeth. For the brush covers, I do miss them. I just point my pulsonic away from the sink to avoid getting it wet. I do notice that my brush head does dry faster because it doesn&#x27;t have a cover. The UV cleaner on the Sonicare was something I rarely used, so I don&#x27;t miss it when I made the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would give this a 4. It certainly could be better in the fit and finish department. Particularly in the base that holds the toothbrush, and the noise when it&#x27;s operated. Everything else meets my needs, and I&#x27;m actually saving around $7 - $10 every time because the Pulsoinc brush head packs are cheaper. I don&#x27;t remember what I paid for this, but it was really cheap. For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect to get something that was this good. You should definitely give this a try if you&#x27;re ready to switch from a regular toothbrush to a electric sonic type, or if you are tired of paying a premium for the Sonicare replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> Compared to a cheaper (and also a more expensive) sonicate that I previously had, this is great. Slimmer sizer and lighter... cleans great and love the sensitive mode. Easily maintained it&#x27;s charge brushing twice daily over the douse of a week vacation. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these for my wife, daughter and I. For some reason and it must be just my luck, but my toothbrush will not work properly. I will brush but then it stops. In the beginning I had to charge it after every brushing. But now it only works for about 5 seconds and then turns off. Then I must turn it back on and then it turns off again. I thought that I was pressing the button but that wasn&#x27;t the case. I&#x27;m not sure if I just received a faulty battery but it wasn&#x27;t worth the $40 that I paid for it. It&#x27;s now just the same as a regular toothbrush where I have to brush manually.</li>
            <li> According to Wikipedia 80% of tooth decay occurs in the pits and fissures of the teeth, mainly the molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Precision Tip does a fabulous job of cleaning these areas in a way a full size brush head cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is well worth the price for this feature alone.  It&#x27;s a simple but very effective way to improve your oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine includes a general brush over, then a tongue scrape, and then I apply a bit of toothpaste with my finger to the pits of the back teeth and work them over with the Precision Tip.  Follow with a mouthwash.  Voila, best brushing ever!</li>
            <li> The bristles were a bit stiff for me at first, but I really like the toothbrush.  It cleans well and leave my mouth feeling clean.  I&#x27;ve used this type for years and on those rare occasions where I am drugged and dragged to a dentist, the evil woman with the metal scrapers always comments that my teeth &amp;#34;don&#x27;t look too bad&amp;#34; which I consider to be a real compliment.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas.  He says that it gives his mouth a much cleaner feeling and enjoys it more than his regular toothbrush.  It&#x27;s been a year since I purchased this toothbrush &amp; it&#x27;s still going strong!  No problems or broken parts.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and it keeps my teeth clean.  I like the compact design and the fact that it&#x27;s easy to pack for a vacation.</li>
            <li> I bought the tooth brush on other site 3 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;For the past 2 weeks it started to act crazy. The power button not working and the brush not stopping.&lt;br /&gt;the only way to stop it is by placing it into the charger but it constantly charging and let be honest - not that environment friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some spare time and I called Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;They told me I need to pay for shipping and send it to their factory.&lt;br /&gt;The people will touch all over my tooth brush, take it apart and send it to me.&lt;br /&gt;She told me to read them the number on the toothbrush - then she told me it&#x27;s out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks oral B for making me the consumer that bought this product 3 months ago not liable for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I told her it&#x27;s said ORAL B on it so most likely it&#x27;s not a super copy that made in china and bought for $2 - that&#x27;s the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think she got my point - I just told her I&#x27;ll find the receipt and that is the process I&#x27;ll need to follow after find a receipt for a product I bought 3 months ago:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st- No one touching my tooth brush - kinda yaki&lt;br /&gt;2nd- so for 2-3 months until the surgery for my tooth brush is done I&#x27;ll have no toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;3rd - The waiting time, spending my energy&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Is it worth $50? I think no!</li>
            <li> I expect the brush does as good a job on my teeth as advertised,  but I am having trouble making the transition to it.  It is more awkward to use and more time consuming than I anticipated,   but I will keep at it!</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Better than my last Oral-B Sonic and I liked that one.  The Pulsonic Sonic is better.  It cleans between my teeth.</li>
            <li> not sure how it cleans your teeth better than the manual way.  i guess there&#x27;s the fun factor of holding the vibrating toothbrush.  how we are being made to be lazier!  the brush head is multiple times more expensive than the manual toothbrush, even with a deal of $15 for 3.    not used to the hard brittle of the toothbrush, especially i always use the soft manual toothbrush.  is the soft brush head available?</li>
            <li> My teeth stains are gone after 3 days of usage.  The extra brush head supplied (the small tipped one) cleans out the stains that are in between your teeth really well.  Just get a flashlight and point it in your mouth in front of a mirror, turn this thing on with the small tipped brush head and let it sit on the stain for about 5 minutes and it&#x27;s gone.  Much whiter smile without unsightly stains in the areas where regular brushing doesn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how this toothbrush would perform.  I had an electric toothbrush years ago and it was bulky and hard to use.  The Pulsonic is easy to use and does a great job of cleaning around the gum line. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend ordered the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush reasonably priced $40.00 including the rebate and free super saver shipping. Post research, my boyfriend concluded the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush was currently the highest rated Oral-B electric toothbrush and the smart choice for our first electric toothbrush. Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush is slim, light weight, quiet and the plug is compact. The sensative mode is helpful in transitioning from the manual toothbrush to the electric toothbrush. Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush removes plaque more than a manual toothbrush. Eleven months later the completely charged Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush would not turn on until connected to the charger. My boyfriend and I trust Oral-B and ordered the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 4000 Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! I was buying it to replace my old one. My local stores did not have this model in stock. So, I checked AMAZON.com, found it, ordered it, received it! Very pleased.. the price was better than I expected!</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush because it feels like you are holding a regular toothbrush and not a big flashlight like some other electric toothbrushes. It is easy to clean and take apart, I store the brush head in the drawer to keep it clean from bathroom usage.</li>
            <li> This was for a gift, and she loved it.  Came very fast.  A++</li>
            <li> I used a Sonicare toothbrush for 2 years before switching to an Oral-B Triumph, so I&#x27;m familiar with these types of sonic toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of this Oral-B Pulsonic is quite nice. I like that it&#x27;s not much bigger than a regular toothbrush, unlike most powered brushes which are huge by comparison. On its own, I actually think this sonic toothbrush is better than my old Sonicare. And I tend to be a fan of Oral-B and Braun in general. (I also have their Pulsonic razor) I also like the design of the charging unit and extra cleaning attachment as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as I said earlier, I switched from Sonicare to an Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide. And for me, comparing this Pulsonic to the Triumph... well, there&#x27;s just no comparison. The Triumph is better by far. Not only does it have the smart guide and cute smiley face that smiles at you when you&#x27;re done, but it just does an overall better job of cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably use this Pulsonic for travel since it&#x27;s nice and compact, though I suspect that also means the battery won&#x27;t last long. I can bring my Triumph on a 10 day vacation without the charging unit (and I brush twice a day.) I bet this slim little Pulsonic doesn&#x27;t have a big enough battery to do that. And even if it does, that just goes to show you the cleaning power. This one is subtle, and good if you have sensitive teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want a good, deep clean, buy the Oral B Triumph 9900 Toothbrush with Smart Guide.</li>
            <li> I have had them all back to the first Sonicare. Funny, that first one took some getting used to because it seemed to vibrate to the point of feeling like you were being tickled. Yet, this new Oral B vibrates much more, but completely lacks this sensation. Definitely feels like a much more intense brushing than the prior generation of Oral Bs (had the circular one and the one with the split head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The setup is nice too: the charger is a bit better than the prior ones and there is a flossing tip that is useful. Definitely best yet.</li>
            <li> In all fairness I already use the Sonic Flexcare daily and it has a similar sonic speed feature. After a few weeks of exclusively using this toothbrush there was no noticeable whiteness difference for my teeth. It was easy to use and there were no issues with it. I chose to return to the Sonic and will keep this one as a back up. The reason for this was due to the brush head since I had already picked up a replacement pack. I really don&#x27;t see how one could go wrong with either brand&#x27;s lightweight sonic model. I think in choosing it will come down to which one is on sale or even color/style preference.</li>
            <li> I am seeing a trend in \\&quot;vine\\&quot; reviews. Majority of vine reviewers are restlessly putting the product rating at 5 stars where as non-vine reviewers sound more pragmatic and truthful about the product ? Do vine reviewers do this in fear of loosing the free products in their mail box or what ? If this is the case, Amazon should guard this. We dont want false reviews in Amazon.</li>
            <li> So far I like this toothbrush. It is light and very streamline and feels comforatble to use. Can&#x27;t comment on how effective it is in cleaning my teeth but it feels like it is doing a good job. I like the attachment for cleaning around the gum line.</li>
            <li> I had used several Sonicare models and this is the first time to use O-ral B.  Personally, I was deeply disappointed.   The worst part is the connection between the body and brush head. Whenever I brush, I have to hold the main body and grab or push down the brush head part too. Otherwise, it keeps slipping out. This is extremely annoying. I haven&#x27;t had any similar problem with the Sonicare product.     Pros  - Small size and light weight  - Possibly replaceable battery (There is a small screw at the bottom and the manual says it is for proper battery disposal)    Cons  - Brush head slips out so easily~!  - No low battery warning indicator</li>
            <li> I like this product, and had to track it down on Amazon because it is rarely sold in stores anymore. This is my third one of these over three years, and I will buy a new one next year if I can get my hands on one when this one breaks down. Very good value for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just slightly larger than regular toothbrush, and easily moving around in mouth just like regular toothbrush. When I considered buying this model, I did worry about its sonic power. But the power is no difference than other full sized model. It&#x27;s replacement brush also much reasonable priced. You don&#x27;t even need spend more for traveling package because everything are compact already. Thanks so much to the other reviewer&#x27;s nice review.</li>
            <li> The battery life is great, I can use it on long business trips and never worry about it going dead.  It is thin so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  Perfect electric toothbrush.  I have had it for 18 months and it is still working great.</li>
            <li> This works for me.  Love the slim design and way the head and vibrations get into all the hard to reach spots.  Battary life is impressive too - good enough that I only take out charger once a week for an overnight charge.  Can travel with out it too!  Fairly minimalistic but works great.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Nice and compact overall size, fits well in my travel / shaving kit, plus the Pulsonic tooth brush holds enough charge that I can use it for a week without recharge when I am on the road - no need to have the charger with me which is nice ..one less thing to pack.  This is my second Pulsonic in about two years, and so far (knock on wood) I have not had any cavities and no gum problems.</li>
            <li> Have been using this gem for quite some time now. Have not had a new cavity in same time. On one tooth cleaning trip, they did notice I had some plaque on my lower left. They suggested I switch hands when brushing and replace the head. Voila! I HATE manual toothbrushes now. Spoiled to the max! My only complaint is that I wish the tip whirled in a circle. The movement is up and down. I miss the whirling motion as an added benefit, but for the price hubby paid for his electric toothbrush ... I&#x27;ll settle for the lack of that motion. My dentist says this is just as good of a brush as his and he paid double what I paid. :-)</li>
            <li> I have a few impacted teeth, and I didn&#x27;t think a sonic brush would make a difference, but it really does!  I have less tooth and gum pain and don&#x27;t even need to use sensitive toothpaste as often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have an issue in which you can&#x27;t leave this toothbrush plugged in constantly.  It gets VERY WARM.  The manufacturer says simply fully charge it, then leave it unplugged until you need to charge it again (theoretically this IS better for the battery, since a full cycle is consistently established so the battery will keep capacity better and work cleaner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get AT LEAST a week of brushing (2x a day, plus an occasional spot up) before a recharge, so it&#x27;s not too much of a big deal.  It also starts turning off a cycle or two prematurely when it gets low (just turn it back on to finish), so you know to plug it in after that use.  However, even though it is a budget-priced model this is a major oversight.  Hot electronics bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update 01/29/16*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS TOOTHBRUSH.  It is outdated and the replacement heads now cost the amount of a new toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B Pro 1000 is the new way to go, and it doesn&#x27;t overheat/overcharge like this one does!</li>
            <li> It works ok. It&#x27;s a little noisy and kind of grinds when it hit a tooth. I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li> You want a mouth massage? Well, this is the toothbrush for you. You want some serious cleaning? You need Philips Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are good things of this toothbrush, but I think the disappointing things outweigh them. For one thing, the brush&#x27;s head is larger than the Sonicare&#x27;s. This makes for a discomforting feeling as one struggles to make the turns around the mouth cavity. Then there is the quality of the cleaning, which at best is described as disappointing since even after a thorough cleaning, one is left if the sense that something was missed and one reaches for the manual toothbrush to make an extra scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one positive thing is the toothbrush&#x27;s compactness. It makes a good traveling companion for any road warrior. But if you are looking for healthy gum/teeth treatment, I recommend Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands of models of power toothbrushes.  While I tend to be an Oral-B fan I really felt this model was middle of the road.  It does offer some advantages, but at the end of the day the price to feature ratio does not equal up.    ADVANTAGES:    Quiet - While not a huge breaking point, this model does offer quiet operation.  Much quieter than any other unit I have used.    Powerful - This unit seems to be fairly powerful.  It&#x27;s not the most powerful brush I&#x27;ve used (as compared to higher priced models), but still works very well.  Note: power also shows up on disadvantages.    Size - Great for travel and resembles the smaller, slender size of a standard toothbrush.      Multi-mode - offers two different modes, clean and sensitive.    DISADVANTAGES:    Loose brush head - After some time and use, the brush head (or the mechanism itself) starts to become loose and can pop off.  This has also happened on previous Oral-B power toothbrushes I have owned.    Lacks cover - many units do not offer a brush cover, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option and this one does not.    Power - while this model does well to competitors priced similarly, there are other more powerful units on the market.  On a five star system, it&#x27;s power would rate 3 stars.    OTHER COMMENTS:    Does it whiten teeth?  It&#x27;s honestly hard to say.  I do not really believe any toothbrush that says it whitens teeth and I certainly did not notice a difference.  All in all, the price point for this power toothbrush is good.  You can pay more and get more (both features and power).  However, I consider this a mid-range model.  I would have given this model a little higher rating, but I feel that even at this price range the toothbrush should really impress me.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush. The size is impressive. It&#x27;s an electric toothbrush that&#x27;s about the same size a conventional toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it does a good job of cleaning my teeth. I&#x27;ve recently switched from the Sonicare Intelliclean and I&#x27;m impressed with both the size, the light weight as well as its cleaning performance. It&#x27;s a mighty little toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one and only drawback I&#x27;ve found -- and it&#x27;s a small one --  is that unlike the Sonicare the Pulsonic doesn&#x27;t have a 2 minute timer. Instead it has a 30 second timer.  You have to count to four without electronic assistance (Four 30-sec treatments equal 2 minutes which is my Dentist&#x27;s recommended brushing time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also as someone with a slightly smaller mouth, the toothbrush head is perfectly sized to reach the very back of the last row of big molars. Most toothbrushes -- both electric and non-electric -- fail this test. So that&#x27;s another big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in a nutshell, if you&#x27;re looking for a small form factor (both the brush and charger fit in my medium sized toiletry kit -- so it works well for travel), small brush head, light weigh and powerful brushing motor, this one, IMHO, has it all.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I really like this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve had power toothbrushes in the past, more specifically--sonicare ones, and really disliked them. They were loud, heavy and large in the hand. I was hesitant to try a power toothbrush again, but my dentist suggested it was time to cave and get another. So, after reading every review available, I purchased this one, the Oral-B Pulsonic Power toothbrush. It is light, easy to handle and, for an electric toothbrush, not too loud. I especially like the additional small brush head that comes with it. The smaller head is great for getting along the gumline and behind your front teeth. The small size of the brush is also great for travel. For short trips I just pack the toothbrush with a regular brushhead cover. For longer trips, I throw in the base and the brush. The base is not too large, so it is not a huge annoyance to pack. My one complaint (and thus the 4 stars) would be that it does not come with a travel case. Seems kind of odd since its size makes it a great travel power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend purchased this toothbrush for us, now I have buyer&#x27;s remorse and I didn&#x27;t even pay for it.  When I brush with an electric toothbrush, I want to be able to slowly move my toothbrush around while the cleaning power of the toothbrush head does all the work and leaves my mouth feeling dentist clean.  That is not the experience I have had with the pulsonic.  Although the brush head vibrates significantly and loosens plaque, I find I&#x27;m having to perform the laborious back-and-forth to the extent that I do with a manual brush.  Electric brushing is supposed to be fun and easy!  Oscillation is key, and this brush doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE HEAD WAS TO SMALL AND FOUND OUT IT WAS EASIER TO MANUVER IN YOUR MOUTH. SMALL AND COMPACT COMPARED TO PHILLIPS YET I LIKE IT. THE PRODUCT SO FAR IS GREAT AND THE PRICE CERTAINLY WAS GREAT. THE ORG PRICE $66.00 TO $99.00 AND MY PRICE FROM AMAZON WAS $19.00. HOW MUCH BETTER THAN THAT CAN YOU GET. { AT THAT PRICE IT WOULD OF MADE GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFTS }</li>
            <li> The brush is really comfortable for use and handle. It has two modes for normal and sensitive gums. And also vibes every 30 seconds to help you clean all the areas equally. I was also surprised by the battery life - it&#x27;s extremely long. I&#x27;ve been using electrical brushes for several years including other oral b products, but they&#x27;ve never shown such a long battery life.     Good brush, recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too bad: this toothbrush is sleek, silent, and looks like an advance on previous models. But sadly, every single time I attempted to use it in a week, the brush head portion popped off and came loose in my mouth, leaving me with a plastic brush in my mouth, and a vibrating electronically powered stick which I was afraid would electrocute me! &lt;:/ Well, at the least, I did not want a strong buzzing piece of metal in my mouth and a renegade plastic brush. Even worse: you have to power through the sensitive mode and hit the button twice to turn it off to save yourself from this... sorry - if it was solid construction, it would otherwise be fabulous. But I am returning mine and have now wasted money and time. Too bad... I will buy the more expensive ones I guess.</li>
            <li> I have been lead to believe that water and electricity can be a dangerous combination, so I am happy to report that I have not yet been electrocuted using my new Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush!  I will give this product high marks for not killing me. Oh, it makes my teeth feel really clean, too.</li>
            <li> I was encouraged when I received this toothbrush.  Electric toothbrushes have existed for more than 100 years, and they have become extremely innovative in the last ten, so surely this toothbrush would be a significant improvement over previous versions, well, yes and no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial impression was very positive.  This toothbrush is light and small, which means it fit in my mouth, and my wife&#x27;s mouth, quite well.  I also thought this toothbrush was much quieter than previous electric toothbrushes we have owned.  Though small and relatively inexpensive, this toothbrush also comes with a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode and a \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; mode, a big plus.  The toothbrush also features a brief pause every thirty seconds so that you may change quadrants, completing brushing of your teeth in two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this toothbrush has some drawbacks and a major flaw.  The biggest drawback is that the head unlocks too easily.  The head rotates on easily, and has a bit of a detent to keep it in position, but it rotates out of the supposedly locked position while brushing.  It is possible that I received a defective head, but receiving a defective head in a sample of one is not a positive sign.  I also noticed that at least one other reviewer experienced the same problem, so I suspect that Oral-B may have a quality problem that some buyers may experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other drawbacks are relatively minor.  This toothbrush came without any sort of carrying or travel case, which my other electric toothbrush had.  This toothbrush also continues to vibrate past two minutes, which is either a boon if you take longer than two minutes to brush your teeth or an annoyance if you have to shut it off.  Lastly, there is no way to tell how much charge remains.  I know this feature has some cost associated with it, but I became accustomed to having a charge indicator and using the indicator to know when to recharge the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though studies indicate that brushing with an electric toothbrush is usually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.  I was certainly looking forward to trying this toothbrush, and my initial impressions were positive, but the failure of the head to remain locked was a significant negative for me.  Had the head remained locked, I would have given this toothbrush four stars for its small size and weight.  The significant flaw pushes this toothbrush down to two stars.ually about as effective as manual brushing for most people, I seem to gain a positive effect from an electric toothbrush.

            <li> I received this electronic toothbrush as a gift, and good timing because my old Sonicare wasn&#x27;t holding it&#x27;s charge any more after 6 straight years of loyal cleaning.  I liked the slim design and two speed options.  The brush head looked more like a traditional manual toothbrush.  It appears to clean well, as my teeth feel clean, and look clean; but I can&#x27;t say that they appear whiter.  I find that the 30 second timer and two minute marker to be both helpful yet a bit annoying- its nice to know how long you&#x27;ve been working on a section of teeth but I tend to brush longer than the recommended 2 minutes so it isn&#x27;t broken up to my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I have used the old Sonicare for so long that it has colored my view of how an electronic toothbrush should feel.  The Pulsonic seems a bit flimsy- like it might not hold up as long as my Sonicare did.  I also don&#x27;t feel like the bristles get in between my teeth like the Sonicare did, either.  The curve of the brush head may be part of why I feel this way because it doesn&#x27;t sit completely flush or even; but on the other hand it does reach behind my wisdom teeth which the Sonicare had trouble doing.  I guess the bottom line is that it does clean your teeth but the proof of how well it really cleans will be found at my next dentist appointment!</li>
            <li> -----BACKGROUND and INTRO--------  This is my first negative review of any product on any website.  After trying this toothbrush I had to vent my anger somwhere :-)    My first elctric toothbrush was a Sonicare Advance, which lasted almost 7 years.  It was big and chunky, it did clean very well, but when it finally died I wanted something more slender.    After some online research, the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic caught my eye.  It is very slim and it costs a little less than a comparable product from Sonicare (like the Essence 5300).  So after reading some positive reviews here on Amazon, I went ahead and ordered one.    -----THE GIST OF IT---------  I&#x27;m surprised they even call this a sonic toothbrush (I think somebody already said that in their review here on Amazon).  The head barely moves.  It vibrates, but that&#x27;s all it does.  The bristles barely move, I mean barely.  At first I thought the battery wasn&#x27;t charged enough, so I charged it for 24 hours.  Same thing -- vibration, but very little bristle movement.  It&#x27;s like taping a manual toothbrush to a cellphone set on vibrate.  I brushed my teeth with it a couple of times, but unless you use it like a manual brush, there is very little cleaning done by this vibration.  This wasn&#x27;t a deffective unit.  When you take the brush head off the handle you can see that the design simply doesn&#x27;t allow for any movement other than vibreation.  It&#x27;s just a vibrating stick with a brush head attached.  I started using a manual toothbrush again.    -----ENDING------  Today I went to WalMart and bought the Sonicare E5300.  It was $12 more than the Braun/Oral-b Pulsonic.  It includes a travel case which I won&#x27;t need anyway.  Right out of the box, whith the low-battery indicator blinking, I was amazed.  It really cleans much much much better than the Orbal-b.  The bristles move really fast, instead of just sitting there vibrating.  I was going to submit a negative review to Oral-b on the questionare form that came in the box, but when I went to the website, it said that they are no longer giving $10 gift cards for submitting a review, so I won&#x27;t do it.  They&#x27;ll just have to look at their sales numbers and figure it out on their own.    Lastly, I don&#x27;t want to seem like a Sonicare fanatic.  I really wanted this Braun/Oral-b to work.  I used Braun electric shavers and they are really  great.  Other than looks, this toothbrush has no positive attributes.</li>
            <li> Very compact and does a great job. Bought this when there was a manufacturer rebate which made this an even better deal. You can purchase the refills on Amazon Subscribe and Save and save big over the local stores in your area.</li>
            <li> Makes your teeth feel SO clean.  We love this toothbrush it&#x27;s just like going to get a cleaning and it&#x27;s so awesome.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have had great electric toothbrushes that help me keep my lower teeth clean.  The Pulsonic toothbrush is even better, keeping them totally clean and removing totally the plaque, especially with the use of the precision tip.&lt;br /&gt;I have read that it is difficult to get replacement brushes.  With Amazon I have had no problem.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple of years, had great check up results. Small so easy to pack for travel lasts 10 days on a charge, similar brush head as regular tooth brush so can be still used effectively if  it runs low on power.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush thru Amazon.com. On the Amazon website was a link to a rebate stating send in proof of purchase and you will receive a $15 rebate check.  Well I printed out the coupon and sent it in with my Amazon.com receipt when it arrived. It stated the price I paid etc and was the receipt. There was no other receipt.    Yesterday I received something in the mail from P&amp;G that it did not meet their proof-of-purchase status and I needed some UPC code. Where was this? Wasn&#x27;t it on the receipt??? I am being given 7 days to reply and they include a website if you have questions. Well the website is obsolete. What to do???    This is the worst customer service I have ever received and I will never buy another P&amp;G product as long as I live.    Let them go down with Big Auto. SHAME ON YOU P&amp;G. This is why America is losing its edge.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Sonicare user. I typically get the bottom of the Sonicare line and have been very happy with the results and ease of use. This year I opted to try the Oral B Pulsonic and so far am VERY SATISFIED. I was initially disappointed as I realized I had a brush head that didn&#x27;t snap on well and was coming loose the first 2-3 times I brushed. URGH... I decided to give it the weekend before trying to call customer service on Monday to get a replacement. However, in that time I realized I was applying too much pressure when brushing in the circular pattern, as recommended in the instructions. When I used less pressue the brush head stayed on perfectly and my teeth are soooooo clean! Two bonuses that I am in love with (as compared to the Sonicare) are the smaller two bristled brush (forgot what they call it) and the fact that it continues to brush past 2 minutes. The smaller brush is great for cleaning between teeth and along the gum lines. And this smaller brush is also great for getting between a few misaligned teeth too!    So all in all this is one very loyal Sonicare user (6 plus years) who is now sold on the Oral B Pulsonic!! And an added bonus is that the replacement heads are even less expensive and the brush it self had a $15 rebate so less than the cheapest Sonicare too.    And I&#x27;ve only had it 4-5 days now but I am certain my teeth are already whiter than they were and less stained!!</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale to replace my old A-series Sonicare, which works fine but is looking a bit tired.  What a disappointment!  Shoddy construction -- the brush part twists off so easily that it came off twice while I was using it, and it vibrates your hand more than in your mouth.  It also lacks a brush cover, something I was used to with the Sonicare.  Seems more sanitary to cover the bristles of a toothbrush that lives in the bathroom, right?    I am returning the Pulsonic tomorrow.  I may just keep my old faithful Sonicare, which may be homely but has worked great for about 7 years.</li>
            <li> For my money, the power on this electric toothbrush is a little on the weak side.  And I have had problems knowing when it needs to be recharged, as electrical outlets in my bathroom are in high demand, and there&#x27;s no way of knowing when you&#x27;re about to run out of juice.    That said, the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great deal more efficient than the old \\&quot;analog\\&quot; toothbrushes most of us grew up with.  It does a better job of hitting hard-to-reach areas than I do in the morning (!) and my whole mouth feels pretty invigorated after using it.      The main concern consumers should have is the value for money one.  This is a pretty great deal when more powerful tooth-cleaning systems can cost more than $200.  You lose a little power by buying this item, which says for $33 or so.  But it&#x27;s portable (I travel a lot) and I find it a good value.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]    This my first time to use a electric tooth brush, my teeth have never felt so clean! The first time I used it was an experience, it tickled so much and took a while to get used to it.Now I think it is great! The little brush cleans nicely between the teeth.It seems to hold its charge for a long time. I will not be going back to my old tooth brush!!</li>
            <li> This thing is junk.  I&#x27;ve had the sonic 4100, the oral-b spinning head and the sonic advanced.  I got this for trips.  It is junk.  It is not really a sonic toothbrush.  It vibrates, but the WHOLE THING vibrates.  The only thing that does not produce sufficient vibrations are the bristles on the toothbrush.  In the instructions for good electric toothbrushes they tell you to hold the unit on your teeth.  Not so with this junk thing.  They tell you to brush like normal.      It&#x27;s like a glorified 5-dollar battery operated crest crapola.      Don&#x27;t buy at any price.    Also, the 5-dollar battery operated one would be better because of the design flaw that this one has.  The head does not stay on the unit.  I would have expected better from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Purchase this product because it was inexpensive and because considered Pulsonic to be a good name.  The product itself appears to be very advanced, with the sleek body and small footprint.  The toothbrush comes with 2 heads.  First head is a toothbrush and a second head is used for flossing. Evidently this item is made to quickly remove the toothbrush and install the flossing head.  However, in practical application when I use the toothbrush the head keeps coming off.  To the point that it makes the product unusable.  Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of those toothbrushes. One of them stopped working after only 5 months. I disassembled it to see what went wrong, and found out that water leaked into the housing where the electronic components were. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I find this pulsonic toothbrush cleans my teeth very well (better than traditional oralb electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve had in the past), and I like its slim design a lot. However I&#x27;m on my third and the 2 previous ones have lasted only about 2.5 years. I took them apart and it seems that after a while water starts leaking inside and they fail due to corrosion (note that I never use them in the shower).</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush the charge holds up for a week or so so if I go on a trip you don&#x27;t have to take the charger, it is a perfect size and works well.</li>
            <li> The best I could find at a reasonable price. Very slim.  Back and forth brushing more closely simulates non-electric brush. Friend has one going on third year.</li>
            <li> I used a Sonicare toothbrush for several years before it eventually died. This Oral-B is every bit as good, and the brush heads are quite a bit cheaper. It also does not turn off after two minutes, a feature that always annoyed me with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Does not compare to a Sonicare, my teeth don&#x27;t feel clean at all. It&#x27;s just not for me and my teeth were not better at my dental appointment like a high end Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is nothing special. The brush heads are hard and not cushioned like the better brands. It is also overpriced..</li>
            <li> One of the reason I bought this toothbrush was that it was an affordable entry into Sonic toothbrushes. The toothbrush is not bad, but being lured into buying something and than refusing the rebate for very shady reasons does make this purchase a big NO NO.&lt;br /&gt;Why shady: the rebate center denied the rebate request due to a wrong upc label. Enclosed with their denial letter are copies of the original form and the invoice I sent. The only thing they didn&#x27;t include was a copy of the upc label they don&#x27;t accept + there is no email nor phone number to inquire why they refused the upc label. I kept copies of all documentation I sent and as far as I can see it is the right label. Guess their tactic is to make it so hard to reach them that one just let&#x27;s it go, but this seller should not be on amazone, please?!</li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush, although it broke after a year of use. I was really irritated with the fact that I could only charge it with 110vAC, not a travel toothbrush (most countries don&#x27;t use 110v).</li>
            <li> I just recieved my new Oral-B Pulsonic Eletric Toothbrush in the mail yesterday. I used it for the first time an my teeth felt so clean. Just like when I come home from the dentist. The toothbrush head is nice an small for those who are looking for a well working toothbrush with a smaller head. I dont seem to have any problems with my button like I have read in other reviews for this toothbrush yet. The second head it comes with is handy for those teeth in the back you may not get clean enough with a regular toothbrush head, this reaches back there nicely an is small enough to get the job done. I highly recommend this toothbrush. Even if it turns out to be true as other reviews state an doesnt last but a year or 2 I would buy another one of these.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift last year.  I really wasn&#x27;t wanting an electric toothbrush--thought they were a little over the top.  But since I got this, I have been using it.  I love it!  I feel like my teeth get much cleaner than with a regular toothbrush.  I especially like the way it &amp;#34;massages&amp;#34; my gums, which is very healthy for them.  I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in all the time--waste of electricity.  I was amazed how long it stays charged.  I never kept track but I think it was literally months!  The only thing I wish, is that the charging cord could be disconnected when you don&#x27;t need it.  Make things less messy on the bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> My original Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush finally died after several years.  I bought another Oral-B rechargeable product because I was out of town and could not find this particular toothbrush.  What a disappointment it was - no comparison to this product at all.  So I ordered an exact replacement from Amazon.  It is an awesome toothbrush - once I started using this product a few years back there is no other toothbrush that makes my teeth and mouth feel clean.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who likes a clean, healthy mouth!</li>
            <li> Because I live in Australia I couldn&#x27;t return this when it dies unceremoniously after  a few weeks. Up to that point it was my favourite brush of all time.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping well worth the price and I would definitely recommend this product to a friend in need for one</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and its not bulky so easy to use and maneuver.  I have used many brands, and I liked this one the most even over my Sonic.</li>
            <li> I like this products small package and ease of use. I have had no problems with the toothbrush and look forward to many years of use. The timer makes it very easy to get the proper amount of brushing on all teeth. I have has no problems with using the normal brushing mode but if you have sensitive gums there is the sensitive mode which is less abrasive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a month now and enjoy using it a lot.  The replacement heads are reasonable priced.  Some of the reviews complain that you have to cycle from high to low speed them off - So What!    That&#x27;s how all Oral-B 2-speed brushes work, I believe.    It cleans and feels great.</li>
            <li> Been using for about 4 weeks now, and love it. I had never used electric before, and now cant imagine going back. I like the 2 speeds, as I prefer sensitive, as well as the compact size.  Overall, I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product.  However, I thought it would have a buzzer or something for the two minute timing of the bushing.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful brush... It is small enough to fit any mouth size.... Most importantly: it is  easy to clean...</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended getting an electric toothbrush to improve my dental health, so after a small bit of research, i purchased the oral-b pulsonic. It was a good for my budget and had positive reviews. At first I loved it, my dental check-ups were improving drastically. I loved it. Then after about 7 months it stopped turning on and off. The only way to turn it off was to put it back on the charger, and now you couldn&#x27;t change the modes either. Then about 2 months later it died altogether. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. I feel ripped off. There was no misuse or excessive wear and tear. It just wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to since it&#x27;s so thin compared to the old Oral it replaced but it actually works better and the battery seems to last and last. It would be nice if they made a softer brush head as it is a lot stiffer then the soft ones that were available for the old one.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush, no issues so far. I feel like it cleans my teeth well and glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Used a different brush in the past - this seems better. I had to get additional tips - make sure you get the right one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun Oral B toothbrushes for years. I&#x27;m frustrated with them. The Sonicare is much more expensive and the heads cost more, too, so I stick with this brand.  Last time I bought the Oral B  Sonic Complete and it is a great toothbrush, but for some reason Braun isn&#x27;t marketing it any longer, so now the Sonic Complete heads are not carried locally, and supplies on this site, with the exception of the generics, are dwindling. The Sonic Complete came as a set of two so I was able to let one run all the way down before charging, and this was supposed to extend the life of the tooth brush, but one of them eventually became so short I couldn&#x27;t finish brushing. For the life of me, I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t make the rechargeable battery replaceable - A perfectly good toothbrush is being trashed because the battery died. I found a place that replaced my battery in a previous brush, but on this one, the copper wire broke, and it was unable to be fixed so I had to buy this one as the Complete is now discontinued. This one is much lighter, doesn&#x27;t have as many cycles, and the brush head is awkward and the hard part bumps other teeth. My teeth are cleaner, though, and I like the smaller charging station and the spot brush head for between teeth.</li>
            <li> Very slim, and great for travellers - since it saves space. Brushes are much harder that the models before. The recharger feels &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; as the toothbrush fits loosely into a hole type slot.</li>
            <li> I never was impressed with electric toothbrushes. One of my daughters insisted on always using one. Well, hers stopped working so I started browsing around to replace it. I came across this one and decided to order not just one, but three. One for both my daughters and myself. It came very well packaged and my first use of it I fell in love. It really does make a difference! My teeth and gums feel cleaner and with little effort. The toothbrush does it all! I like how it has a sensitive setting. If you are looking for a first time electric toothbrush or to upgrade your old one, get this! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for years....years!  And it died on me so I needed a new one. Hard to find, I know I favored this one over a lot of others I&#x27;ve tried, bristles are soft but effective, it doesn&#x27;t do that pulsing that some other do (almost like it&#x27;s turning off and on very fast) it has a 60 second timer where it does a short burst so you can regulate your brushing, two power setting, lasts a long time on one charge, replacement heads are not too expensive. Charges fast too.  I love it and my navy dentist said she liked it as well.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush, however, I got it with a rebate to send in, and they refused my rebate money because they said I didn&#x27;t send in the original UPC. Take a picture if you send in rebate stuff! I couldn&#x27;t send the original UPC in after they refused me because I KNOW I sent it the first time. So I was out of luck. The toothbrush is good though. I like how its small, has two settings, and is the normal toothbrush shape. Holds its charge a loooooong time too! I charge it and then take it totally off and don&#x27;t have to recharge it again for about a month. I brush 2 times a day. So that is really nice to not have to keep the charger handy, can tuck it away until its needed.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have the older Oral B/Braun that is much wider.  Ours has been working for over 5 years.  We bought this one for our kids and it works great and is slimmer, so it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase. I would reccomend it to others. It cleans well. It handles well. I have no issues with it.</li>
            <li> The pulsing takes some getting used to, but I have a small jaw and regular-sized brushes -- even the rotary brushes -- may be difficult to fit into the tight areas.  I especially like the small brush used to clean along the gum line and between teeth as my mouth tends to form a lot of tartar.</li>
            <li> I have not owned a professional sonic toothbrush before, and have to say I&#x27;m impressed. The clean smooth feeling this leaves is amazing. That being said, I dont have much to compare this against. I have seen other people use different brands of electric toothbrushes, and in comparison they all seemed louder. Also, the size of the toothbrush is exactly what i was looking for - barely any different than a manual brush - again smaller than any other I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the timer feature (pulses every 30 seconds to tell you to change regions), I think this has improved my brushing habits significantly. From my research though, all of the more professional sonic brushes seem to have this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far have had no complaints with this product, so I am giving it 5 stars, I&#x27;d definitely buy it again with no hesitation!</li>
            <li> Good one. Quite powerful for the size. The size is almost same as regular brush, so I was not sure it would be powerful or not.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush yet. I have a small mouth and I do not have a problem with this tooth brush works very well. Cleaning results are far better than the older Vitality Oral B brush. Feels like I came from the dentist office without all the hassle.</li>
            <li> This is very maneuverable and oscillates in the normal brushing direction, aligned with the tooth crevices. It&#x27;s small size makes it easier than bulky brushes to get to all the teeth. Automatic halts in the pulse signal 30 seconds of brushing for each of the quadrants of the teeth (upper-in/out; lower-in/out). The small brush tip is good for crevice cleaning.</li>
            <li> Makes dental checkups much more pleasurable.  Does all that I want it to do and much cheaper than other electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Pulsonic I have bought. Never fails that I spend $20.00 on a pack of replacement brushes and the thing stops working so I am either out the price of the brushes or have to buy another toothbrush. I looked back at my records and they seem to last about 2 years. A little pricy for 2 years of brushing.</li>
            <li> Edit: Sometime around July, this sucker just quit on me. Dropped it in the sink one time... dead as Dillinger. My wife&#x27;s is still going strong. I replaced mine with the same model and haven&#x27;t looked back. Only thing I wish is that I could have gotten it apart to look at. I&#x27;m pretty sure something just popped lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: This has been my daily toothbrush for over two years now.  I got a pair of them at a steal of a price from a local grocery chain that was taking them out of stock, thinking, \\&quot;What the heck... if I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;m out 20 bucks.\\&quot;  After using it for this long, I&#x27;d pay full retail for it if I had it to do over again.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with other vibrating style electric brushes, only the oscillating ones.  I like this one better.  My dentist has never had a negative thing to say about my oral hygeine since I started using it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight, it travels well, it stays clean with a minimal amount of rinsing after each use, the battery lasted me the entirety of a 12 day cruise last summer (didn&#x27;t bring the charger with me), it&#x27;s quiet... and it gets the job done. What else could you want?</li>
            <li> This is certainly better than manual brushing however the better brushes by oral b like the triumph series are far superior.  Spend the extra money to get the better model.  It&#x27;s not worth the savings, in the end it will come back in dentist visits.  Ever since I upgraded to the triumph model, my dentist visits have been enjoyable.  I get compliments and praises.</li>
            <li> I love this Oral B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush. Nice feeling on gums and teeth. Make my mouth and gums feel clean and can definitely feel a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition. Gave as a Christmas present, and as far as I know she enjoys it. Still uses it 2 years later.</li>
            <li> I live this smaller, slimmer version of the pulsonic toothbrush, Works as well, if not better, than any other sonic toothbrush Great product!</li>
            <li> this is the best toothbush I have ever used,  oh ya, it was a good deal as well.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are too hard for my liking. Brushing the top teeth for me is an unpleasant experience. I wouldn&#x27;t say I get headaches, but not at all a pleasant experience for me. The brush works well, but I do prefer to use my [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] with the optional soft brush heads. The [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] is a very powerful brush, although not a sonic brush, does an effective job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one that I had purchased online. The first one was purchased a year ago and it just stopped working. I bought another one and it looks great and does a good job cleaning your teeth. It leaves you with that \\&quot;just came from the dentist&#x27;s office teeth cleaning feeling.\\&quot;      I hope this one lasts longer that a year.     I would give the product 5 stars if I knew it would last more than a year.</li>
            <li> To start I had 2 sonic care toothbrushes not a problem one just died of old age the other dropped and quit soon after. I looked at the oral B Pulsonic and decided to switch due to its smaller diameter like a regular toothbrush. The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t so sure as you brush in a circular motion. The 2nd time i was hooked. It does a great joband I can honestly say with the sonic care I could feel light tartar after brushing, so i would use a regular toothbrush every other brushing. This Oral B not so, its fantastic. Easier to clean by far. One last thing don&#x27;t press hard let the brush do the work. I have always after brushing with tooth paste then redo with just a clean brush. No problems in 12 years from the dentist. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing. My previous power toothbrush was a higher end model from Oral B that I bought years ago. That one was heavy and unwieldy and nothing like this little powerhouse. The toothbrush is very light and easy to use. The motor on it is strong and the vibrations kick just right.     I&#x27;ve read complaints about the size of the brush head but it is a non issue to me, it seems pretty standard for a toothbrush.    The pricing on this is perfect for someone who wants to be serious about oral health care but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a fancy brush that takes up half the counter-top.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Pulsonic from Amazon about a week ago.  I&#x27;d already purchased one at my local pharmacy -- total bill for the toothbrush and a set of replacement heads was $116.  Amazon price: $66!  So back to the drug store I went....    This is a great toothbrush so far.  I had a few years old Sonicare and I find the Pulsonic to be as powerful and easy to use, but in a much more elegant package.  The two speed mode is nice and easy to operate.  The brush head has been safe and secure with no evidence that it could come off as some report.  While I agree with those who would like to have a travel case, this brush fits easily into a plastic sandwich bag.  Overall a great purchase experience and a very good product so far.  BTW, like the Sonicare, the Pulsonic can be used in the shower -- to quote the user manual -- \\&quot;without hesitation.\\&quot;  Nice!</li>
            <li> I am no expert on this type of tooth brush, but I can tell you my impression of the first of this kind I have ever used.  At first, I was shocked.  This thing vibrates (like a buzz) your head when brushing the top teeth.  It is kind of like a dentist drill but much more dynamic.  It took me a week to get used to that, but after a week, I can only say good about this product.  The vibrations are intense as needed to give the results like a \\&quot;dentist office\\&quot; cleaning.  After one week I have already seen the difference.  The company advertises two weeks, but one will show results.  It is not hard on the gums, in fact it stimulates them unlike any toothbrush I have ever used.  The bristles are somewhat hard without the slightest irritation to the gums.  Since this device uses NiCad batteries, I do not keep the charger plugged.  It has gone 2 weeks without need for recharging.  That is amazing.  The replacement heads are reasonably priced which is unusual in this market.  The battery is replaceable, but I do not know where you would be able to purchase one.  The \\&quot;timer\\&quot; feature is great and is very useful.  The brushes detach easily if more than one person uses the motor section.  The tiny brush (floss head) supplied with it is useless.  I wish they would have placed an extra tooth brush in it&#x27;s place.  The overall feel, quality, and weight of the product is excellent.  It is hardly bigger than a manual tooth brush.    I very much recommend this tooth brush.  There may be better ones out there, but I bet it would be at a much higher price.  I question whether the costs difference would be worth it.</li>
            <li> Not giving such strong cleaning effect as Sonic Complete but is much easier to operate dure to compact design.</li>
            <li> I have seen a few reviews about the brush falling off but I haven&#x27;t had that problem and have used the brush twice daily and it does a great job, holds a charge for a week, very light and small</li>
            <li> The product that was delivered to me does not function properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t charge properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i plug it into a working outlet and it doesn&#x27;t light up but when i remove the plug from the outlet it charges for approximately 1 second.</li>
            <li> I have had an Oral B for 3 years but they only last so long, I couldn&#x27;t wait to brush my teeth with my Oral -B when I had to replace it</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush because it&#x27;s slim, quiet, has a timer, uses sonic technology, and is easy on the pocketbook.  I&#x27;ve had mine for less than two years and it died this week (the reason I have it less stars).  But I&#x27;m buying another same model as a replacement.  For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Have had for years and have always loved it.  I tried others when I couldn&#x27;t buy the replacement heads in stores and nothing compared.  Was so happy that they still make them as I recently lost mine (I think it accidentally got thrown away:-(</li>
            <li> I may be kidding myself - but my teeth seem whiter than ever before!!  Also it is much easier to get into the tiny spots...</li>
            <li> Our family have been using this product for more than 6 months. The results are excellent. With the timer, my son knows for how long he needs to brush his teeth. And our last checkup at the dentist&#x27;s office confirmed that the brushing was very effective in keeping the teeth and gum healthy. Thanks Oral-B.</li>
            <li> When I got this brush, I was expecting a nice electric brush but I was not expecting it to completely change my thinking about brushing.  When I first used it, I could almost feel it break up any buildup on my teeth.  It truly felt like I just had my regular cleaning at the dentist.      Besides the fact that the brush actually delivers on the results, the design is very well thought out.  The handle is slim and light and as easy to hold as a regular toothbrush.  The head vibration is well isolated from the handle and does not cause any discomfort.  The whole brush is completely water proof and can be washed easily.  There are no visible contacts for charging.  It just sits in the base and charges (I assume by induction) perfectly fine.    It has a couple of settings for brushing or massaging and although I prefer the brushing setting for regular brushing, the massaging setting felt nice on my gums.  It has a reminder in the form of a brief pause every thirty seconds to facilitate proper brush timing.    The brush comes with an additional smaller head that is meant to clean between the teeth.  It also does an excellent job at breaking up any particles and cleaning the space between the teeth and along the gum line.    This is a very well built and thought out brush and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used to brush so hard it damaged my gums.  This toothbrush stops if too much pressure is applied.  It is also perfect for cleaning my bite plate.Toothpaste on and the brushing is done for you at the right speed and pressure.  Perfect. Cleans up easily with just a rinse.</li>
            <li> does exactly what i wanted, love the action of the unit, teeth are whiter than ever and look forward to continued use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Pulsonic over a month now. It&#x27;s my first sonic brush and my teeth were a wee bit sensitive at first, but I got over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pulsonic replacement brushes are more affordable than most, which was one of the factors into my purchase decision. In addition, it runs SO long on a battery charge, it&#x27;s just amazing. The 30 second timer to move to another quadrant to brush is a nice feature. Not to mention the mail-in rebate that was available when I purchased - now expired but check the Oral-B website to see if there is anything new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still miss my Interplak with rotary head that lasted me 15 years before the battery couldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore &amp; brushes were near impossible to find. I wish they were still making the Interplak but the Pulsonic is a good replacement, even though it&#x27;s not a rotary head brush.</li>
            <li> Good, effective toothbrush with a great price.  It was recommended to me by my dentist, and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with it so far.  Came in 1 day even with the super saver shipping.</li>
            <li> Terrible, I was expecting an easy transaction, just a simple toothbrush and it doesn&#x27;t even function properly. It fails to charge, trying to charge it in different places to no avail. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve found is that the higher speed causes some bleeding -but maybe that&#x27;s just my aging gums.</li>
            <li> The brush head that comes with this unit is really hard. Not comfortable and not recommended for those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush OK, but just wish the brush heads were larger.  The timer function on the toothbrush is nice so you know what an adequate brushing time is.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife last Christmas and she loves this brush.  It is very quiet and leaves your teeth feeling like they were cleaned at the dentist office.  I&#x27;m considering replacing my professional 4000 with one of these.</li>
            <li> I own the Sonic Complete and while the toothbrush functions okay, the issue is the battery. Batteries last 3-5 years (meaning 3 years), AND once the battery is exhausted and no longer holds a charge, you have to throw away the entire unit.    The company&#x27;s explanation is that the unit is water tight so removing the battery breaks that seal. This is horrific design flaw - if they wanted they could allow for battery replacement.     BUT...allowing battery replacement means you wouldn&#x27;t have to BUY AN ENTIRE NEW UNIT.     So...essentially the consumer is being held hostage to a company that&#x27;s designed a product that has to be thrown away.    LASTLY...there is no easy means of recycling. I was told I had to go to a Braun service center. On Long Island. 30+ miles away. That&#x27;s irresponsible. A company should stand behind their product; offer, at the very least, a reasonable outlet to recycle something. If you build in \\&quot;planned obsolescence\\&quot; at least give the customer an easy means to recycle the darn thing.    And, like I said, design a product where the battery can be replaced. I won&#x27;t be buying a new one.</li>
            <li> Pros: The design is ergonomic, can reach inner most molars with ease. Vibrations make cleaning much easier and effortless. After getting addicted to it, i tried my old manual toothbrush and could clearly notice that my tooth were feeling like not cleaned at all. This toothbrush really makes a difference in cleaning.    Cons: none so far.    Other thought: If you are still using manual toothbrushes, then i&#x27;d highly recommend switching to this one. It will make your teeth feel fresh and clean as never before. Believe me. I bought my wife one too.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and to clean. It has a timimg device built in so that you spend 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth. I didn&#x27;t realize how long that really was until I started using the brush. Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend.  He likes it.  I got it for him because his dentist recommended an electronic toothbrush.  It does it&#x27;s job so far.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference between this and a regular toothbrush, but two dentists told me the sonic bit makes a big difference. It&#x27;s easy to use, and I like that it&#x27;s small and more affordable than other sonic toothbrushes. If the dentists are right, which apparently I&#x27;m betting on, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought this about a month ago and works great. Smaller size makes it easy to handle. Only draw back is the cost of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tried any other electric toothbrushes, so I really have nothing to compare this one too. BUT....I LOVE this one! I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it at all. The head stays on, charges fine. I even take it in the shower with me to brush. I love the 30 second increment timer. I brush 30 seconds in each quad of the mouth. As far as whitening, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve really seen anything that noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, LOVE it! For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the size of the brush handle and the charging unit.  takes up little space on a counter as well as in a travel bag.  My problem with the Oral-B Pulsonic, like many other reviewers, is the dependability.  It is very fortunate that it comes with a 2 year warranty.  Mine began to turn off just one second of turning it on.  I scrolled through my past Amazon purchases to see that I had purchased it exactly 18 months previous.  Braun&#x27;s own website has a form you MUST download to send the unit in for repair.  Without the purchase receipt and this form, the unit will NOT be touched.  A little jumping through hoops by a company who should NOT make the consumer do this.&lt;br /&gt;I sent the Oral-B Pulsonic in for repair (my expense) and received an email a week later that they would send me a new unit.  The new unit arrived via FedEx yesterday, just 10 days after I sent the defective one to them.  I am very happy they replaced my defective unit with an entirely new one.  However, I am sure not everyone has the time to go through their returns process, thus 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my long-time Pulsonic that finally died on me.</li>
            <li> It cleans well, just as promised and I do like the sensitive setting.  The only drawback is that brush is hard to get on and off, especially when you have wet hands.  I am used to a heavier handle too. The 50% off program came at a good time for us too.</li>
            <li> The pulsonic from oral-b is a solid choice for those of you who don&#x27;t want to spend $100 plus for a toothbrush. The pulsonic has two settings - regular and sensitive which should do the job for most people. The unit is slim, well designed, and light weight which is important to me.  The last thing I need is a toothbrush that looks and weighs like a lead pipe.        As for performance, the pulsonic does a great job of cleaning teeth. The sensitive mode is great if you don&#x27;t want the feeling of a Jack hammer inside your mouth.  As long as you take your time to brush  and utilize the recommended brushing technique (round, circular motion), you&#x27;re going to find this product does a superb job. It also helps whiten teeth as well.     Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for a simple, high quality electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. After using one of the large sonic toothbrushes for several years this one came as a surprise. Very thin and lightweight.    My only complaint is that I would like a smaller head.    Would buy again no problem.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush simply vibrates. The bristles don&#x27;t rotate or do anything to clean my teeth any better than a regular manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Just as described...nice slim brush- replace my old Oral B electric toothbrush which I had for many years and never had any problems with it till now. works well and of course the half price rebate helped also.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush after using a Sonicare for the past two years.  You see, my sonicare has broken one month exactly after its warranty ran out - TWICE!  I said to myself, \\&quot;enough with them, I&#x27;m going with a competitor.\\&quot;  Well, that was a bad move.  I read the reviews and got this Braun Pulsonic - what a waste of money.  The toothbrush moves your hand more than it does in your mouth, is hard to hold, and doesn&#x27;t clean as well.  The instructions even tell you that you have to move the brush around - something you don&#x27;t need to do with the sonicare.  Well, after using this thing for two weeks, I caved and went back to the sonicare and love it so much better.  Now that I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to compare the two - the sonicare is a much better product and gets my teeth much cleaner.  Spend the few dollars more.</li>
            <li> Got this for a X-Mas present and it doesn&#x27;t do the job @ all...not a good investment, would not recommend buying this item...there are much better toothbrushes on the market!</li>
            <li> It works good great battery. I just prefer the tooth brushes that spin and not just vibrate like this one.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this toothbrush,  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my teeth and gums.  Before using this toothbrush, had sore gums but the messaging action  of the tooth brush has eliminated this problem.</li>
            <li> I had been using my old Sonicare for years, refusing to upgrade bcz I didn&#x27;t want to start all over again w/ a new base + expensive replacement heads every few months.  &amp; then the old replacement heads became impossible to find.  My friend, who had moved overseas, was visiting &amp; had the Pulsonic.  I wanted it as soon as I saw it - so sleek &amp; compact - much slimmer than even the newer Sonicares; in fact, the size is comparable to a regular toothbrush.  He didn&#x27;t even have the charging base w/him bcz one charge lasted so long, but even the charging base is much smaller than Sonicare.  I was so thrilled to learn that he had purchased this in the States, I purchased it right away.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best. I love how thin the handle is so it feels like your just holding a regular toothbrush almost. The 30 second warnings are by far my favorite feature.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I both own this toothbrush and it is by far the best bang for your buck.  I have had mine for over a year and have absolutely no complaints.  A charge will last you for your long weekends away from home.  The ultrasonic vibration really cleans my teeth.  Repped.</li>
            <li> I like the small head and the concept, but to be honest, my old spin style brush left my teeth feeling far more clean and in less time brushing.  That brush did a lot of work.  This brush requires you to do all the work. Don&#x27;t let the pretty girl fool ya...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this toothbrush for a few years and still use it and love it! I actually got it from CVS after they clearanced it out one year for.. wait for it.... SIX DOLLARS. Best deal ever. My dad had just bought it a few weeks prior for the price you see here and had recommended it to me. I&#x27;ve been cavity free since! :)</li>
            <li> Bought this at the recommendation of my dental hygienist.  After 6 months she said it was like night and day.  But a few weeks later, it just stopped working, so because the cost of a replacement is much less than dental care, I am purchasing another one.  Just wish I knew how to fix it or what the problem was.  Googled it and I might have an overcharging problem so the next one will NOT be put back in the charger every night-maybe once every 10 days or so which will allow the battery to discharge a bit.  [...]. I purchased another toothbrush and it turned out that I was covered under the warrantee and they sent me another one.&lt;br /&gt;The new one has been working with no problem, and I still have a spare.&lt;br /&gt;I raised my rating.</li>
            <li> I had the Oral-B Sonic Complete model and liked it, but after 4 years the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge any longer so I needed a new one.  I saw this Pulsonic brush and had read some of the reviews but wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me, but I decided to try it anyway.  It&#x27;s slim and easy to hold and the brush head is the right size, fits in my mouth nicely, and I like the way it cleans.  I also like the little Precision brush that comes with it.  It does a nice job along the gumline. The noise isn&#x27;t bad either.  If you&#x27;ve never used an ultrasonic toothbrush, it will take a little getting used to because it feels different, but don&#x27;t give up because they clean great.  I would highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have an older and more expensive version of the oral-B pulsonic toothbrush. It was time to replace it because it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge for very long. I decided to try this cheaper version and I am not sorry. It does the same job as the more expensive version and is easier to hold. It feels good in your hand, just like a regular toothbrush except it has the sonic power behind it. Because it is lighter and thinner, I think I actually use it longer. It is also easier to find the replacement heads for it. I also think that the shape of the toothbrush makes it is easier to get at the back of the bottom teeth where the plaque is the worst. That means less time in the hygenist chair. Since using the sonic toothbrush I definitely see a decrease in the build up of plaque and that is makes this purchase worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Received my Pulsonic about a week ago, and so far I&#x27;m pleased with the performance, looks, and size.    At first, the clean mode was a bit much to take and felt uncomfortable; but after a couple of days on the sensitive mode I&#x27;ve eased into the clean mode quite nicely.     The main reason for the initial discomfort is attempting to use the Pulsonic as a regular toothbrush. By changing the way I brush my teeth (not as much pressure and allowing the brush to do most of the work), it began to meet my performance expectations. Whether my teeth will get whiter is another story; they certainly feel cleaner.    Looks and size: nice modern look without the typical bulkiness of most power brushes.    My only complaint so far is the lack of additional accessories; such as, travel case(s)/power (more emphasize needed in general on hygiene/bath items/conveniences being ready for travel), and optional brush heads (various shapes and sizes).    I would recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with this brush so far. No heads coming off or anything else. Someone else noted that if that the brushes are coming off, then chances are you are applying too much pressure. Hopefully the rebate will come through without any hassles. The actual head does not move much in motion, just vibrates, but I guess that must be the &#x27;sonic&#x27; part. Not used any sonic brushes before. Slim size and small head makes it easy to glide around your mouth.</li>
            <li> Works great - I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush this QUIET.  Arrived in super lightning time !  What more can I say ?</li>
            <li> I love the look and feel of the toothbrush works really well and my teeth feel very clean. The brush works with many different toothpastes which is another plus.</li>
            <li> For many months I have been evaluating various sonic toothbrushes online.  I finally decided to purchase an Oral B as I have always used this brand of toothbrushes.  I have been using this sonic toothbrush for 3 weeks now and I am extremely pleased with it.  I was able to use it right out of the box and I had one week before I had to charge it.  I prefer this brush head&#x27;s shape to the round ones as I think it is similar to that which we have been trained to use.  I have bought a second one (with the same $20 rebate) as a Christmas present (hope I get it in time!!)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a great slim size, great for travel!  Great for teenagers- the batteries last forever, the brushes are reasonably priced!!!</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing an electric toothbrush and I was looking forward to using it for a long time. Once I got it I was a little skeptical because it simply seemed like one of those vibrating toothbrushes that you can buy at the store for about $6. Granted it was quite a bit more powerful. After using it for a few days I kind of enjoyed it and really liked that it had a timer that would make it pause after 30 seconds so that you knew when to switch areas in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then about 10 days later it would only stay on for about 4 secs before going off an not coming back on. If I set it on the charger again it would come back on for about 4 secs before shutting off again. So then I decided to unplug everything and let it sit for a couple of days before plugging it back in and letting it charge overnight before I tried again. Now it won&#x27;t even turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for my paperwork on it so that I can return it but I had to send most of that in so I could get the $15 Mail-in-Rebate, which I have yet to receive. I would suggest that you spend the extra money and buy a better brush or simply go with the old manual style.</li>
            <li> This sonic toothbrush works very well,and is a pleasure to use.Dental checkups have markedly improved.Unit is easy to clean,we love it.So why the two stars for a five star product?Just try and get the right replacement heads-irritating.Maufacturers must delight in purposely frustrating consumers by forcing us to buy &amp;#34;improved &amp;#34; products with minor changes.Just want correct replacement heads,NOT a new $$$ toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Loved this product but stopped turning on after 1.5 years of owning. Tried to go on Oral B website and the &amp;#34;contact us&amp;#34; page gives an error. The product registration page to extend your warranty has a required &amp;#34;coupon code&amp;#34; field to fill out and doesn&#x27;t let you do so without it. Really annoying such a big company doesn&#x27;t invest in a user friendly website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have purchased another Oral-b product but now I will definitely try a different product not Braun/Proctor and gamble.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush makes my teeth feel so clean! I like the fact that it has two speeds - I use the lower speed- and I love the atachment for cleaning between the teeth.  I am thinking of buying one for my husband for Charistmas!</li>
            <li> This thing has some serious vibrating power.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is cleaning my teeth, or shaking them loose!  It does clean very well.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old oral b electric. This one is much smaller, like a normal toothbrush. Great size for traveling. There is a lot of vibration in the handle but overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had  Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and was very pleased that when I needed a new one I bought the Oral-B sonic.  Liked it so much I bought this Oral-B sonic for my daughter.</li>
            <li> The ultrasonic tooth brushes are excellent for dental hygiene even if you do not floss, I have used a similar probdut from Oral-B for over 5 years and when used twice a day it has done a better job than having my teeth cleaned by a professional every 6 months especially since there is no damage to the enamel with this type of brush. This model is very lightweight and takes up little space. I personally prefer a handle with a larger diameter but it&#x27;s not enough of an issue compared with its functionality. &amp;#34;Spin&amp;#34; brush can wear off your enamel and shouldn&#x27;t be used. This product was relavitely inexpensive and does not have the &amp;#34;bells and whisles&amp;#34; as some of the other models but it does the job quite well.</li>
            <li> is the customer review video...you can watch it above. Thoroughly compelling and my confidence in the product only grows after each subsequent viewing. Eventually, I forgot what the product was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had electric toothbrushes before but this one seems to work on my gums better thus keeping gingivitis at bay. Also does a better job on whitening the teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and it works splendidly.  The charge lasts for about a week before recharging, while the heads come in a wide variety of firmness and designs.  This is my favorite affordable sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had now for over a year. Works great</li>
            <li> Maybe its just me, but this thing feels like a jack hammer in my mouth. I like the size and feel even though i can only use on the sensitive setting.&lt;br /&gt;If it last as long as my previous oral b (10yrs) i will be happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an old Oral-B electric toothbrush, which I loved. I was less than impressed with the performance of this one, though the slim-line design of the brush was very appealing. I have used an electric toothbrush for many years, and so was not expecting to need the sensitive mode. However, as soon as I turned on the brush, the vibrations travelled down the handle and proved to be irritating to both my hand and my gums. The toothbrush head only vibrates, unlike many of the other Oral-B electric toothbrushes that oscillate. As a result, I found the quality of cleaning sub-par, and would go so far as to say that a regular manual toothbrush does a better job at cleaning my rear molars.  I also found the toothbrush head to be awkward in shape and size, which lead to a few scraped gums. I did like the precision tip, but I could not justify keeping this toothbrush for something that a toothpick and floss would do. Unfortunately, I have had to return this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We have received a damaged product. The charger don&#x27;t work and never worked. As a result the toothbrush iS not charged and don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. This is my third one. I do wish the battery would last a little longer, I seem to be able to get right about a year of use.</li>
            <li> This has been a great toothbrush. Hold a charge for a long time. Nice and slim and compact. Very easy to charge.</li>
            <li> I had always been reluctant to try this. But I wanted something more compact.  This fits the bill and cleans teeth way better.  Brushes also last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go fore it. (Golf expression)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about oral B is that too many products are made in China.  Bring it home.</li>
            <li> We like this toothbrush. It cleans well, and is light and easy to use. The only problem is replacement heads are quite expensive and there are no generic options.</li>
            <li> Great feel in my hand, lighter than my old sonicare from years ago,slim, hhold the charge a very long time</li>
            <li> This was a gift, so I can&#x27;t vouch for it myself, but the person I gave it too really really likes it.  Says his mouth has never felt so clean and the massage gum feature is just great.</li>
            <li> very good,I love it .It has great work to make tooth clear and white,So I will buy it again .</li>
            <li> Portable electric toothbrush that caters to both short and long term travel. Provides the same clean mouth feeling I get from the sonic care electric tooth brush I use at home.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband when his other Oral B finally died.  He&#x27;s very happy with it - no complaints at all</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush for several years without any issues.  My dental hygienist compliments me when I get cleanings.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare is several years old and the battery has about had so I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a new electric toothbrush.  I got this as a lightning deal with a mail in rebate that made it so cheap I couldn&#x27;t resist but as soon as I tried it I was disappointed.  It just doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the power of the Sonicare and the shape of the brush head causes it to not get in between my teeth as well.  It does, however, come with a second brush head to get in between teeth and those hard to reach places which is a really nice addition but having to swap out heads and then go back to get some of the heard to reach spots is a bit of a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if I dislike it so much why three stars? The battery seems to last linger than the battery in my Sonicare ever did even brand new.  That&#x27;s particularly impressive since this thing is quite a bit smaller.  That&#x27;s one of the other great things, it&#x27;s small.  Between the battery life and small size this is the ultimate travel toothbrush, it will be going on all my trips with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Small size&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life&lt;br /&gt;Additional very small brush head for those hard to reach places&lt;br /&gt;Great for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not very powerful&lt;br /&gt;Standard brush head doesn&#x27;t do the best job&lt;br /&gt;Power button feels cheap</li>
            <li> This is a very neat toothbrush. It is tiny in the hands, and the setting gives a very intense cleaning. I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: it&#x27;s become annoying but still is very effective.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complaint about this toothbrush at $50 with $15 mail in rebate.  We switched from Oral-B&#x27;s high end spin brush to the sonic types, much better results and easy on the gums.  We also have the Diamond clean from Sonicare.  Compared to Sonicare&#x27;s top of the line, the Pulsonic is not as strong in terms of vibration and its not as well made.  It is lighter and feels cheaper overall, right down to the charging stand.  However, as stated in the title of this review, this is a valued tooth brush.  Not only its 1/3 of the cost of DiamonClean, its replacement is also cheaper.  I don&#x27;t need all the different modes nor fancy lighting of the DiamondClean, I end up using really just one mode most of the time anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although not as powerful, I felt it easily clean just as well.  DiamonClean certainly doesn&#x27;t clean 3x-4x as much as its price would suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great toothbrush if you are looking for the sonic type, I would choose this over any Sonicare lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 2 yrs warranty....</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is light small shape and very effective brushing and cleaning my teeth&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it everyone</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these so far. The first one was for myself and I loved it so much that I bought more as gifts for my boyfriend and also for my super picky mother. My mother, who rarely likes or uses gifts that I have bought her, told me that her teeth feel so clean and healthy and that her teeth felt as smooth as glass. When she went to the dentist for a cleaning, they didn&#x27;t even need to scrape her teeth for tarter. The hygienist noticed the difference and asked her if she was using an electric tooth brush. Amazing. I really don&#x27;t know how anyone lives without an electric tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model in particular is very high quality. It&#x27;s compact, sturdy, attractive, and has great features like 2 speeds and a timer that lets you know when to move on to a different quadrant of your mouth. I&#x27;d highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone with teeth!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It times each quadrant of your teeth so it cleans evenly.</li>
            <li> I have used other Oral B power tooth brushes and found them to be of consistently high quality. This brush is the exception. I find it to be a very poor performer when compared to the alternative solutions from Oral B. Save your money and buy one of the better engineered Oral B power tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of the expensive electric toothbrushes and after my last one (Sonicare) finally died, I figured I&#x27;d try a cheaper model and see if it&#x27;s any different. There hasn&#x27;t been any significant difference. The Oral B Pulsonic is great.  First, I like that it is slim and light. Feels like an actual toothbrush.  Second, I like the charging stand--you can mount it on the wall and it holds the toothbrush snugly.  Third, I can get my teeth just as clean with this $50 product as I could with the $200 Sonicare.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B electric toothbrush before and it still worked but I wanted an ultrasonic so I got this.  It&#x27;s light, has a sleek design and really good value.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This has all the benefits of an electric toothbrush in a small and compact form factor. Its size is marginally bigger than a standard toothbrush and makes it the perfect traveling companion given it lasts a week of solid use (two times a day).</li>
            <li> I tried an electric toothbrush my dentist recommended.  Found the handle to be so annoying I didn&#x27;t want to use it.  Stopped using it. Discovered this model with its smaller handle.  Less vibration in the handle.  Works for me!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Takes a few days to adapt to this style of brushing, so the sensitive setting is a great bonus.  I feel like my smile is whiter already!</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for probably a year now.  I love it! 1) it cleans really well.  2) It is quiet compared to my last Oral B and 3)The &#x27;waterpik&#x27;-sized (very small) type brush attachment really gets in between the teeth. I have seen stains melt away from between my teeth using it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist to help save me from some intensive dental work.  Hopefully this works out.  I will let you know. In the meantime , it seems to clean well, the device is is easy to clean and the base is small and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> we used phillips dual action brushes for years and loved them, The sonic brushes move faster and seem to penetrate the gaps between your teeth even better. My dentist also said that these brushes definitely help you improve the health of your teeth and gums</li>
            <li> An excellent product, especially for those of us with bridges. It reaches into those hard-to-clean places. Also, outstanding customer service.</li>
            <li> I got it when it was on double rebate, So I ended up only paying like $30, but after having it, I would&#x27;ve payed full price,  it&#x27;s the exact same quality as the $100+ toothbrushes for half of that. I took this toothbrush to Vegas for 2 weeks and it didn&#x27;t die.  14 days x twice a day x 2 Minutes per Brushing &#x3D;  56 Minutes of being on, plus about 335 hours of standby time.</li>
            <li> The best way to discribe this toothbrush bristle is like using a tree branch to brush your teeth. my SIX YEAR OLD (who i bought a phillips sonic toothbrush for) said why are your bristles so hard, they cant bend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many different brands of toothbrushes in my 32 years, esp. when I had braces.  I&#x27;ve had this one for a little over a year and I LOVE it!  The only &#x27;con&#x27; is that only one of our local stores carries the replacement heads and they&#x27;ve marked it up a lot higher than amazon&#x27;s price.  Other than that I would absolutely recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This small handled rechargeable toothbrush is awesome. The charging stand fits neatly on your sink basin and holds the toothbrush straight up in the air. It has two additional holders for different brushing heads. The cord from the charging stand is long enough to reach the plug near your sink basin. It comes with a regular brushing head and a in between your teeth head (smaller bristle top). They easily come on and off the toothbrush without falling off while your brushing. The vibrating motion of the toothbrush can be changed for sensitive teeth. Lastly it has made my teeth cleaner and whiter as promised. Ultimately a good product.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it too.  In terms of this against a manual brush, I can say this seems to work much better.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as a replacement for one that I have had for years. This product does an excellent job of cleaning teeth and helps keep plaque to a minimum. The price was very good. I was just a bit surprised that it did not come with any paper work. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I owned the oral B Sonic complete toothbrush before, but this one doesn&#x27;t match in quality.  It doesn&#x27;t get inbetween the teeth.  I would not recomment this electic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is great. The bad thing about this product is that the charger is enormous. This makes the toothbrush relatively useless for traveling, unless your trip is less then two weeks (in which case the battery will probably last). Another problem is that the brush replacements include a useless 4th brush with a tiny head. It&#x27;s basically a ploy to make you have to buy more brush replacements than you otherwise would have to.</li>
            <li> This actually worked fine at first but its so powerful that it started to take the enamel off of my teeth and I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Follow-up 10 months later:  The battery life is fine.  It&#x27;s still a pain to have it falling over when stood up due to it&#x27;s slim size.  However it&#x27;s falls in to the sink do not seem to have harmed anything.&lt;br /&gt;  I suppose the germ issue is not a problem since I have had no infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; FoThe old Oral-B Sonic toothbrush heads do not fit the new handle.  Bummer!  I purchased about a dozen just before the old handle died.&lt;br /&gt;The new brush has to be twisted into place and the mechanism holds quite a lot of debris...cannot think that this is healthy to be inserting a germ--laden device into my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;  The older model fit better in the hand.  This new one is so small and being so slim it easily falls over when you stand it upright.  Being so small I suspect that the battery life is not going to be nearly as prolonged as the older larger model which lasted about 5 years.</li>
            <li> It was a nicely designed and it cleaned very well but after a year and a half it suddenly turned on by itself and would not turn off until you put it on the charger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2-3 months now and I love it.  It holds a very long charge and provides a very clean feeling once i&#x27;m done brushing.  I&#x27;m a fan of Oral-B and I&#x27;d highly recommend this toothbrush.  Best bang for your buck!!</li>
            <li> i use the pulsonic toothbrushes for many years now and i dont want to have any other now.&lt;br /&gt;my previous one was a little bigger in the hand while this new handpiece is small. I have to get used to that.&lt;br /&gt;but for the rest it works great..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;could have been 5 stars if it had more toothbrushes included instead of only one!&lt;br /&gt;and amazon does not sell the brushes that should go with that. i think that is silly.&lt;br /&gt;so my advice... buy this toothbrush, but not at amazon, buy it a some place where you can buy extra brushes at the same time.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. I like the feel of the slim handle and it gets my teeth clean. The only this is that I wish it would shut off when the two minutes were up to signal the when you can stop brushing. I think I brushed my teeth for five minutes the first time I used it. Whoops! The next time I noticed it does 3 beep sequence to signal you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about what I would get for a 40 toothbrush, but so far I love it. my mouth feels so much more clean than it did when I used a regular brush. the only issue I have is why it needs to be plugged in all the time? It holds a charge for weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a slender powerful little brush! I got it wanting to use it for travel for it&#x27;s size,which by the way it is perfect for but found that it would actually make a really nice everyday brush.    The size and lightness of this brush would also make it a perfect  candidate for children,even the head is the right size.    Very easy to use with one button.Push once for clean or twice for sensitive.    It is also great that it can be left on the charger with no worries of overcharging.Not to mention the extra brush to clean small hard to get to places like crowns or around braces.Don&#x27;t let the size fool you,this little brush has just as much power as some of the big ones and cleans very well.    An all around fantastic,simple to use brush that was perfect for my intened use as a travel brush!</li>
            <li> I have used many different power toothbrushes over the past several years.  All have been from the Sonicare and Oral-B line of products.  I have been amazed at how the technology and design of these products have changed over the years.  They continue to get smaller, more powerful, and now tend to include multiple operation modes and interchangeable brushes and accessories.  Although there is clearly nothing wrong with scrubbing your teeth the traditional way, with a good old-fashioned toothbrush, I find that the power toothbrushes tend to remove stains better and keep my teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gone are the days when a power toothbrush was a rather bulky, noisy product.  Oral-B has introduced a new, extremely slim, power toothbrush that is not much bigger than a traditional (manual) toothbrush.  The new Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is truly a breakthrough in power toothbrush design.  Weighing a mere 1.8 oz., with the brush head attached, the dimensions of the handle and brush assembly is roughly 8 1/4\\&quot; long and only 11/16\\&quot; (just under 3/4\\&quot;) around at the thickest part of the handle.  The brush head is about 2/3 of the width and 3/4 of the length of a traditional toothbrush.  The charging base measures approximately 1 3/4\\&quot; - H x 1 5/8\\&quot; - W x 3\\&quot; - D.  While I like the small footprint of the charging base, I find it a bit too light, which causes it to slide around on the countertop too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the manufacturer boasted features of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Provides Gentle Sonic Vibration - More than 27,000 Vibrations per Minute&lt;br /&gt;* Multiple User Modes:  Clean (normal) and Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;* Super-Thin Bristles for Precision Cleaning, Polishing  and Whitening&lt;br /&gt;*  Professional Timer, Providing Tactile Feedback at 30-second Intervals for Changing Quadrants of Your Mouth, and Once the Dental Expert Recommended 2-minute Brushing Time Has Been Reached&lt;br /&gt;* Provides Up To 30 Minutes Of Use Between Charges&lt;br /&gt;* Reduces Up to 94% of Surface Stains in 2 Weeks&lt;br /&gt;* Lightweight Slim Handle Provides Effective Maneuverability and Control&lt;br /&gt;* Warranty:  2-Year Limited&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current Pulsonic S15 kit includes the following items:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Oral-B Pulsonic Power Handle&lt;br /&gt;- One Standard Pulsonic Brush Head&lt;br /&gt;- One Precision Tip Brush Head&lt;br /&gt;- Charging Base w/ Brush Head Storage&lt;br /&gt;- Instruction Manual&lt;br /&gt;- Misc. Warranty and Registration Paperwork&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setting up and using the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush couldn&#x27;t be any easier.  The small charging base simply plugs into an available A/C outlet and sits on your countertop.  Although the instruction manual doesn&#x27;t specifically mention anything about mounting the charging base, there are two slotted holes on the backside, which would allow for wall mounting.  Once the charging base is plugged in you simply sit the Pulsonic Power Brush handle into a recessed opening on the front of the base.  As with most rechargeable products these days, you must initially wait several hours for the device to charge before you begin using it.  The Pulsonic toothbrush requires 12 hours on the charging base before it is fully charged.  The instructions do not say anything about using the toothbrush before it is fully charged, so I guess one could try it out within an hour or two if they wished.  There are two other recessed openings on the base, to allow for storage of the included Precision Tip brush head and a spare standard brush head.  The front of the toothbrush handle has a single power/mode button and three indicator lights.  Two of the LED indicators show what cleaning mode the brush is in, when powered on (clean or sensitive), while the third LED lights up when the device is charging.  A single push of the power/mode button activates the power toothbrush in \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode, while a second push of the button switches the toothbrush into \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; mode.  Pushing the button a third time powers the toothbrush off.  Therefore, if you push the button once, and use the standard clean mode, you will need to push the button twice more in order to power the device off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the typical oscillating head type power toothbrushes that Oral-B is known for, which require the user to simply hold the head on each tooth for cleaning, this Pulsonic model requires you to move the head around in a circular motion while cleaning.  This can take a little getting used to if you are more accustomed to the oscillating brush-type models, like I am.  There is no need to scrub your teeth with the Pulsonic toothbrush.  You simply move the brush head gently over your teeth (in the aforementioned circular motion), letting the sonic vibrations perform the work of cleaning and polishing your teeth.  Although these vibrations are fairly gentle, switching to the sensitive mode reduces the strength of the vibration by about 1/3.  The vibration speed remains the same, but the intensity becomes gentler and feels less abrasive against your teeth.  While brushing, the Pulsonic toothbrush provides a short stutter (a single break in vibration), at 30-second intervals, to let you know that you are supposed to switch quadrants in your mouth.  Once you have brushed for the professionally recommended 2-minutes, a longer stutter (two breaks in vibration) can be heard and felt.  This form of tactile feedback is quite effective in keeping the user informed as to the status of their brushing session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have finished brushing with the Pulsonic toothbrush, cleanup is a snap.  You simply run the brush head under water and rinse thoroughly.  To better clean the top portion of the toothbrush handle, you can easily remove the brush head attachment by turning the head counter-clockwise (about 1/4 turn) and lifting it off the handle.  The top portion of the handle can be rinsed under running water, but it is not recommended to run water over the lower, controller portion of the handle.  Reinstalling the brush head onto the handle is as simple as lowering it into place and giving about a 1/4 clockwise turn.  You will hear and feel it click into place.  Cleaning the charging base is just as easy.  Since you should never get the electrical portion of the charger base wet, Oral-B has designed the base with a removable top, which can then be cleaned under running water.  To remove the top you push down on a plastic tab, located at the rear of the base, and slide the top portion forward and lift off.  After cleaning the removable portion, you can wipe the bottom portion of the base with a dry cloth.  To reinstall the top portion, you sit it on the bottom portion and slide it back until you feel it click into place.  The included instruction manual goes over these steps in better detail, providing visual illustrations.  However, everything about the setup, use, and cleanup of the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush is very simple and straightforward, so I doubt one would need to refer to the instruction manual more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I prefer the Oscillating brush head of my Oral-B Triumph power toothbrush, my wife much prefers this new Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.  She has been using it regularly and has given me the following pros and cons for this Pulsonic model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;- Extremely slim and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;- Comfortable to hold and is well balanced&lt;br /&gt;- Very quiet operation&lt;br /&gt;- Medium-soft bristles are gentle on teeth &amp; gums&lt;br /&gt;- Sensitive Mode is much gentler on touchy teeth &amp; gums&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use and clean&lt;br /&gt;- Perfect size for travel&lt;br /&gt;- Precision Tip brush head is handy for cleaning between teeth and around dental work&lt;br /&gt;- Charging base takes up very little space on the countertop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;*******&lt;br /&gt;- Charging base slides around countertop too easily&lt;br /&gt;- No low battery warning indicator&lt;br /&gt;- No indication of when charging is complete&lt;br /&gt;- Spare brush storage is not covered&lt;br /&gt;- No travel/storage case included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife really loves the new Oral-B Pulsonic power toothbrush.  She has stayed away from power toothbrushes in the past because she didn&#x27;t like the fat handles, noisy operation, and uncomfortable brush heads.  Other than the few cons listed above, she feels that the Pulsonic toothbrush is perfect in every other way.  She doesn&#x27;t like leaving the brush heads exposed, so she keeps the spares in a drawer, due to the lack of covered brush storage on the base.  She also wishes that the charging base was weighted, so that it wouldn&#x27;t slide around on the counter so easily.  She informed me that she wants the base mounted to the wall so she doesn&#x27;t have to continue dealing with it sliding around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall we are quite pleased with the Pulsonic Power Toothbrush by Oral-B.  It is definitely a breakthrough in power toothbrush design and it is very easy and convenient to use.  After using this new toothbrush for a couple of weeks, my wife&#x27;s teeth are already noticeably brighter, so we definitely believe Oral-B&#x27;s claim that this brush removes stains and polishes teeth for a brighter smile.  I was very tempted to give this Pulsonic toothbrush a 5-star rating, but I honestly feel that Oral-B has overlooked a few important details that will hopefully be corrected on future model releases.  First of all, they need to provide covered storage for the spare brushes.  Most people have their toothbrushes in the bathroom, and I don&#x27;t think anyone would want their brush heads uncovered and fully exposed in that environment.  The charging base either needs to be weighted or should have better griping foot pads to prevent it from sliding all over the place.  And why they don&#x27;t have a low battery indicator on this toothbrush is anyone&#x27;s guess.  Nearly every rechargeable electronic device provides indication of when it requires charging.  Finally, the inclusion of a travel/storage case would really make sense.  Oral-B included a travel case for my Triumph power toothbrush, which is huge compared to this new Pulsonic model.  Since the Pulsonic is the perfect size for travel, including a travel case would make perfect sense.  Hopefully they will at least offer a Pulsonic travel case, as an optional accessory, in the near future.  My wife and I consider the Oral-B Pulsonic Power Toothbrush a 4 and 1/2 star product, and we highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a powered brush but doesn&#x27;t want the typical fat-handled, noisy products that have always been the norm.1/4 clockwise turn.

            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my young daughter.  It is light enough and simple enough for her to use without our help.    I would have given it 5 stars if the tips were compatible with other Oral-B brushes (Triumph series).</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  I originally purchased this about 2 years ago, but it stopped working because I left it in the shower and the screw at the bottom rusted.  So I finally bought a new one, and I love it.  My teeth are incredibly clean, and the timer on it is great!  I highly recommend purchasing this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Great and powerful sonic toothbrush. I love my buy. Recommend this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for a sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product no cavities, holds up to my mouth and the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;I have another of these toothbrushes. Toothbrush is worth buying another.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral-B Pulsonic. You can feel it cleaning your teeth. Gives me a big white and clean smile after I finish.</li>
            <li> Best Toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. My teeth feel and look better. Whiter smile and my mouth always feels fresher. Very recommended</li>
            <li> Fits my hand really-well.  Doesn&#x27;t drool down your hand.  Inductive charging.  Quiet.  Very compact.  I just wish it were easier to find!</li>
            <li> Quality product.  Highly recommend.  I especially like the two speeds it comes with.  My dentist was after me to purchase an electric toothbrush.  In fact he recommended this brand.</li>
            <li> do not buy [GENERIC Oral-B Sonic Compatible Replacement Brush Heads (4 ct.)]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that is not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;never buy that brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush is good.</li>
            <li> I bought this item in August 2012- at first it seems to work great but when the plastic nub on the handle starts wearing away, there&#x27;s nothing left to keep the head on the brush.  After having the whole brush replaced by Oral B twice, I am asking for a complete refund- disappointing because the old complete Oral B sonic toothbrush I had worked much better- do not buy this item unless you want to be disappointed.  Wish I could give it no stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using the toothbrush for several years and did not have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I usually use the oral b oscillating toothbrush.  It was time for a new one so I decided to try the pulsonic based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it the handle vibrates so much that my hands are still tingling after I have finished brushing.  I do like the thinner handle and the sleek design.  I noticed that it is easy to get all the toothpaste residue off the brush and handle and I don&#x27;t get the white gunk over time.&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed my teeth any whiter.  I miss the oscillating brush and feel that the vibrating one does not scrub my teeth clean enough.  I find my self almost moving it around my mouth like a manual brush.  I do like the flossing brush head and will keep this brush for that purpose only.  I will be purchasing the other kind of Oral B.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is OK, but the replacement heads....$8 a piece for tiny toothbrushes. Seriously? These wear out faster than the free toothbrush the dentist give out and yet cost more than the &amp;#34;Super toothbrush 2000 with color changing flex bristles&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the mold... the MOLD. The inside of these things grow mold like crazy. Disassembling the toothbrush after every use will not stop mold from growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were super white though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for quite a while now and it&#x27;s held up great.</li>
            <li> Comes with hard bristles. I&#x27;m used to soft, and my dentist recommends soft. I&#x27;m hoping they will wear down soon. I tried to get a replacement head for this and the one soft Oral B head I could find does not fit this toothbrush. I was told all Oral B heads would fit. Not true. Now it&#x27;s too late to return it. I am going back to SonicCare!!!</li>
            <li> My son uses it daily. It works very well.I would recommend this toothbrush, especially for teenagers. My son does a better job brushing now.</li>
            <li> The sleek design is the selling point. Most electric toothbrushes are bulky and this is one isn&#x27;t. It works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it was the cheapest rechargeable sonic toothbrush.  I have the much more expensive version of the Oral B sonic at my house, and bought this one to leave at my boyfriends.  This one is just as good for less than half the money!!  My teeth feel very clean and I love the little precision tip it comes with. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a good electric toothbrush for travelling, due to its small size. Initially I had a problem with the brush head twisting off during brushing, but either I have inadvertently changed my brushing style, or the head finally seated itself better with some of the toothpaste residue and it doesn&#x27;t come off accidentally any more. I don&#x27;t have any others to compare to, but I can definitely tell the difference when using this brush vs. a manual brush.  The two min. timer, broken up into 30 sec intervals is great for people like me who may not brush as long as they should without such a reminder.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my wife and myself.  They work fantastically.  My teeth stay nice and clean throughout the day, and my wife seems really happy with her teeth staying clean.  It is a much better clean than the old oral-B brushes we had that ran on AA batteries.  These stay charged all the time and work well even when taken on short trips for a few days without the charger.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oral-B Pulsonic to replace my old one which is probably at least 6 years old. The old one still works, but it will only hold a charge for 3 - 4 days and it used to hold it for 2 weeks (the max I tested it for.) It is the most similar in size &amp; shape to a regular toothbrush and I have had excellent check-ups since I started using it years ago.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I bought this toothbrush was that I needed one for my trip to Europe. I have been using Sonicare Flexcare for years and have no complaints. However, after misplacing all but one charger I had to either buy another one or another toothbrush altogether. Since the individual charger was way too expensive I decided to buy a whole new set. I chose Oral B Pulsonic because of the reviews and I also wanted to try something different that Sonicare, purely out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot give you a lengthy feedback about Pulsonic because I didn&#x27;t get to use it much. After putting it through a full charge, I was eager to try it out. It was alright so I put it into my carry-on happy that I will have a sonic brush to use while away for a month. I did, indeed, for a couple of days. After the battery ran out, I plugged the charger into an adapter (as I do with all other rechargeable devices) and NOTHING! I am no tech expert so I cannot tell you why the charger didn&#x27;t work but it didn&#x27;t. I had no such issue with Sonicare on my prior trips. So, if you are like me and are looking for a temporary toothbrush for your trip abroad don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Good good good!useful and beautiful. Why I need to write at least 20 words? It&#x27;s only a tooth brush. I love this piece. It will clean my teeth and save more time on everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I to buy Plusonic electric toothbrush.Unfortunately, the quality is not good.I buy it back from Amazon.com only spent more than three months, it is out of control.Switch once opened can not be closed.I do not know whether it can be returned?</li>
            <li> do not buy with rebate oral-b doesn&#x27;t honor rebate states upc wasn&#x27;t sent in when it was.called oral-b would not honor rebate</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much better my trips to the dentist are after using this type of toothbrush for over 5 years.  I used to be a two or three cavity a visit person but since I started using this, I now can go two or three times without a cavity.  Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he fell in love with it.  His teeth feel cleaner, it is quieter, slimmer built, just a great sonic toothbrush.  He said he doesn&#x27;t have to push on it like he did the previous one he had.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others like Sonicare or the other Oral B models.&lt;br /&gt;It still works perfectly after being used twice a day for three years.&lt;br /&gt;Although it feels normal now, I remember how much smoother and clean my teeth felt the first few times I used this after switching over from a manual toothbrush. Now I could never go back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this one over other more expensive models due to it&#x27;s slim size. I frequently travel for work and wanted something that had power yet was compact. The Pulsonic didn&#x27;t disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that Oral B doesn&#x27;t make a travel case for it and I haven&#x27;t been able to find one by another company that fits this toothbrush (although it isn&#x27;t much bigger than a standard size toothbrush, it won&#x27;t fit in the cases designed for them). Not a huge deal, but a case would have been nice since the main reason that I chose this toothbrush over others was that it is better suited for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great value for around $50 (often you can get it for less if you buy when they are offering rebates and compare prices on several websites).</li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten one of these long time ago! Love the size, it is quiet and sure beats the big old Phillips I used before!</li>
            <li> I have had one for over 4 years and I like the design and the slimness of the product. The original still works, however does not turn off. perhaps, a short.</li>
            <li> We had the older Oral B model but love the pulsonic.  You mouth feels so clean.  Everytime my husband brushes he said I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Have not really seen a marked difference considering the price!  Also, sent for the rebate with all the &amp;#34;required&amp;#34; paperwork.  Still have not received anything.  Somewhat disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush I have ever owned. My teeth are very noticeably whiter in just under two weeks of use. I am a coffee drinker and red wine drinker and while my oral hygiene is good, this toothbrush has made my smile GREAT!. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> these work better than brushing with a toothbrush. I tried to go back to the toothbrush and found out the hard way!</li>
            <li> My Oral B pulsonic tooth brush stopped working. Charger works.  Light is on toothbrush but no vibrating-the bottom charger is clean and the tooth brush should be connecting and charging. I had just invested in another brush replacement pack.  Less than two years ago, my husband and I bought new electric tooth brushes.  He bought another brand.  His electric tooth brush STILL WORKS.  Will now be buying a Phillips Sonic to match my husbands.</li>
            <li> Tough to get replacement brushes at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy the round spinning one instead.</li>
            <li> Bought my daughter an Oral B Pulsonic electric toothbrush for Christmas last year. It has stopped working. Call Oral B and they tell me since I do not have receipt they have to go from the manufacture date for the warranty and its 2 yrs from that date. Apparently is was manufactured in 08 so they are trying to tell me this thing sat on Targets shelf for 3 years??? Bottom line is they offer me a $10 coupon for another Oral B. I tell them they can keep it I will never buy Oral B again!</li>
            <li> I like it because it is small in size. easy to handle. keeps it  charge for a long time. nice whan one travels</li>
            <li> What is there to say? I love it and it keeps my teeth clean. I also use this toothbrush on my toddlers and they just went to the dentist and have ZERO cavities!</li>
            <li> Didnt work in Australia even though I had something to change the volts and actualy plug interface, kinda lame seeing as it was $70 should mention that it wont work over seas.</li>
            <li> Light weight and small handle brush that works well. A timer imbedded in brush lets you know how long you have brushed in minute intervals. Easy to replace brush head and put on gum tool, which is easy to use and really does a good job on gums. We brought two and enjoy them</li>
            <li> A super brush backed by dental associations and dentists who know teeth and a quality product to ensure great oral hygiene health..</li>
            <li> It doesn‘t support 220v yet ，so I bought a changer 220v to 110v yet.And Its made in CHINA, SO AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric tooth brush; I absolutely love it. I charge it about every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I do like the 30 second timer but my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they do with a rotary head electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> All the other reviews talk about what a good job it does cleaning and that is true, but I&#x27;d just like to mention that the first one I bought lasted for 3 1/2 years 2 of those years having two users. That&#x27;s about $50 a year if you replace the brush every couple months or so...a good investment for oral hygiene in my opinion. I should also mention I didn&#x27;t put any real effort into caring for it the best way. It broke cause the button wore out. Perhaps I am a hard button presser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just bought my second one. Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied as I feel I got my money&#x27;s worth. You probably don&#x27;t need the 2 year warranty, but if there were a 5 year I&#x27;d buy it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST electric toothbrush! I was concerned that its diminutive size would equate with a lack of effectiveness or short battery life. Not so. It wonderful to have a quiet, non-bulky electric brush that&#x27;s easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was always perplexed by the tiny circular brush heads, but now that&#x27;s MAINLY what I use. I need to focus on gum health, and this small head provide accuracy and a very reassuring sensation--you know you&#x27;re getting the intended area. And with the combination of a sleek handle and bristle it&#x27;s easy to get behind the back molars! Now that I&#x27;ve tried tiny round head I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One piece of general advice. A very light pressure works best. If you press hard with electric toothbrushes the tips stay still, the bristles flex in the middle, and FAIL to brush. Use a light touch and slowly move around the gum line. My dentist was astonished and the decrease in tartar. Unlike other Oral B toothbrushes, this one does not give a pressure warning. Not a big deal. Just remember to press lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re serious about oral/gum health I strongly recommend the Perio-Aid No.2 or Perio-Aid No. 3 -- THE best gum stimulator/cleaners on the market! It&#x27;s simple ingenious design for holding a toothpick, which allows you to gently rub every edge of your gums. Regular Diamond round toothpicks work best for me. And with a couple of bites to the tip you can \\&quot;soften\\&quot; and slightly dull the tip if you want. Just perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perio Aid products are not available at large drug stores, but you can order them direct from the manufacturer, which is Marquis Dental Manufacturing Company. And you can get a very low cost from them when purchasing in bulk. Their customer service and ordering department gets five stars!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast I tried the gum stimulator by G.U.M--you know that giant brass handle with the brownish-orange tip. They were OK, but I didn&#x27;t like the overly pointed tips, replacement tips were hard to find ... and the expensive replacements tips that I found were worthless, because they failed to stay attached to the handle. On top of that G.U.M didn&#x27;t respond to emails stating that faulty replacement tips are being sold on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So gladly, I&#x27;m done with G.U.M. and totally happy with Perio-Aid ... oh yes, and of course, with freakishly happy with my Oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the money.  While it doesn&#x27;t have all the features of more expensive models, it does have the essentials to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Great product, does the job 100%. Great for traveling as it is very compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sylvia Drew</li>
            <li> Be sure to check if your brushes being recommended are correct. By the time you want to use them your ability to return may have expired like what happened to me. I purchased the recommended replacements but didn&#x27;t verify and they won&#x27;t work so basically I lose $25</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works really well to clean teeth like a dentist.  It also holds a charge for a few days when traveling, even after a few months.  I would recommend anyone getting an electric toothbrush consider this one!</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago.  It&#x27;s held up well and I use it twice daily.</li>
            <li> No complaints.  Product is as described.  I would recommend it.  Wish it came with at least one feplacement brush.  I like it.</li>
            <li> We have used the Pulsonic for several years only to find out that it is impossible to buy a new one and that its replacement brushes tend to be defective and hard to find. I don&#x27;t understand how people write reviews on this product as recent as a couple of weeks ago. Bottom line is Procter and Gamble is still showing the product on its website but it is discontinued from the market. I guess it&#x27;s back to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Really cleans your teeth. Light weight. Just wish it would shut off after 2 minutes. The timer is confusing. Otherwise, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I got this because my Sonicare brush finally died, after 9 years of going strong. This was much cheaper and was from a good oral care company. This is an okay brush but not as good as the Sonicare. The head seems a bit big to me and therefore is hard to get is some of the tighter spots of my mouth. I would not get this toothbrush if you expecting the same results that you got from a Sonicare brush. But if you looking for a quick cheap sonic toothbrush then this will get the job done. I plan on using this as a travel toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I previously had an Oral B sonic toothbrush that lasted 5 years and I liked it fine.  I thought I was replacing it with something that would be similar.  This product is very lightweight - like holding a regular toothbrush. That&#x27;s ok, although the on-off button is kind of hard to press.  The main objection I have is that it&#x27;s too harsh.  It feels like a mini-jack hammer in my mouth, even on the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting.  Unfortunately a toothbrush is not something you can return if you&#x27;re unhappy with it.  If I&#x27;d realized what \\&quot;pulsonic\\&quot; meant, i would definitely have selected a different product.</li>
            <li> Pulsonic is the first brush to surpass the Sonicare in my professional opinion.  I am a dental professional and prefer this brush for several reasons: It is lighter  and easier to manipulate; packs easily into a ziplock sandwich bag on the go; both brush and replacement heads are far less expensive than sonicare and the clinical results are identical.  For patients who like to  have a brush with them during the day, this slim, light, professional quality brush is perfect.  I  have never had nor heard of the reported experience of  brush heads falling off before reading some of the reviews here on amazon.  I would hope these were just isolated instances!  However, be it hand or electric,  it is the TIPS of the bristles that clean , so a LIGHT PRESSURE is the most effective  with EVERY brush.  That sounds counter intuitive, but it can even be proven in a kitchen sink with a dishwashing brush.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush works well and gets everything off my teeth it is wroth every dollar you spend for it, and it gets in those hard to reach places</li>
            <li> Great product...makes your teeth feel so clean.  Purchased for gum health....hoping to get great report from dentist..can&#x27;t go wrong...arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly since I needed it for a trip.  Love it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and it works well. Replacements are pricy, though.</li>
            <li> I love the streamline shape. Of this Oral B , have used one for years. It provides great check ups every 6 months. Sonic brushes are the way to go, nothing cleans like them !! I especially like the sensitive mode for myself. My last Oral-B lasted 5-6 years give or take and just needed replacing. I like the full brush head the best and I know my kids when they were young, loved using anything electronic. My perodontist told me if everyone used a Sonic brush and a water pic , he would be out of business !!!  And Amazon has the best price!!!</li>
            <li> I brought his one for my daughter. I paid twice the amount for my own in shanghai and couldn&#x27;t believe it when I saw this one here</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars if the replacement heads were not so expensive (almost as much as the brush itself) and if the rebate advertised with the product had not already expired (which I did not realize until after I purchased the brush).</li>
            <li> Easier to clean and very light and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Great recharge capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each lasted about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the last one died, the toothbrush heads were loose and fell off while using. Replacing them did not help. This could be a chocking hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line- loved it while it worked properly, but is not worth the money considering the poor quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt such an amazing clean from a toothbrush before! It&#x27;s light weight, slim, and holds a charge for a long time. This is the best toothbrush i&#x27;ve ever purchased! It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush almost 3 years ago. It still works perfectly. I bought it so that I could get a better cleaning on my teeth, needless to say this has done just that. I noticed a slightly whiter smile after using this brush for about a month. The thing I love about this brush the most is that it looks like a regular toothbrush and feels like a regular toothbrush. The brush head is the perfect size for my mouth, not as large as the standard size oral-b cross action brush. The design of this product is flawless in my opinion. I have traveled all over the world with this and most trips I am able to go almost a week until I need to set it back in the charger. On a regular basis however I keep it in the charging base when I&#x27;m not using it because I feel that when you pull it straight off the charger the power output is much stronger than if you were to have it sitting on the counter the previous day or two. If you do happen to run out of a charge, its no problem. Other brushes have small circular or weird shaped heads making it impossible to use without battery power. If you use this brush without any power whatsoever it will still clean like a manual toothbrush, just without the sonic action. Its versatility is endless. I cant believe it has been running strong for THREE YEARS, now-a-days products seem to barely last for one year. Still holds charge very well, sounds the same, and cleans the same. I am extremely impressed with this toothbrush and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good quality as you can expect from Oral-B company. It does a very good job in reaching the back part of the upper and lower teeth. My hygeinist has also commented that I do not have much of the &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; unlike before when I was still using the manual toothbrush. The speed of the oscillation is what makes this product better than the other ones. The only thing that you have to watch out for is to buy the replacement heads which is not that cheap. But I am the type of person who looks into the brighter side as I only have 1 chance to take care of my teeth. Worth my money!</li>
            <li> I have a few annoying surface stains in my front teeth. A few minutes of brushing they are gone, just like when I went to the hygienist.</li>
            <li> at gums bled, but after a couple of days i got use to it&lt;br /&gt;It really get the job done, Love it</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  After using an Oral B rotating electric for years, this one surpasses the old by leaps and bounds.</li>
            <li> this is a great little toothbrush… its lightweight &amp; powerful… and was a steal when i bought it as a lightening deal. it has all the basic features required for a good powered brush &amp; its  rechargeable &amp; good for travel</li>
            <li> I like the size and the fit in my hand. Also, it seems to be doing a good job of cleaning my teeth. I recommend this Oral-B as a good choice, but I wish the timing feature was more clear.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush does what it is supposed to do. It brushes my teeth. It also came with a little flossing attachment that works pretty well. It is quieter than other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it. My teeth are so much cleaner and whiter; I actually look forward to going to the dentist to get a great check up.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I wish I had bought it sooner. It reduces plaque so well. We Love it</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these. We have a camper and wanted this item for our weekend trips love it</li>
            <li> This is my experience with an electric toothbrush and I am very pleasantly surprised. Not having the opportunity to compare it to similar products I still am very enthusiastic about its light weight, its effectiveness in cleaning - got rid of coffee-drinking related discoloration of my teeth, and its positive effect on my gums. Gum problems were, in fact, the impetus for me to get an electric tooth brush in the first place, at the recommendation of my dentist who, of course, tried to sell me another one before I scouted around for one myself. The bleeding from my gums has subsided, I feel a good massaging and thereby strengthening effect from the soft setting in the brush. I don&#x27;t use the stronger setting much and feel more comfortable with the softer one.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I think the shopping around has paid off with this one. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and it still remains to be seen, however, how it&#x27;s doing in the future.</li>
            <li> Well this is the electric toothbrush I just wrote about when writing aout the replacement brushes four more words required</li>
            <li> dentist recommended i buy one, this one is great, makes my mouth fell dentist office clean. first one i&#x27;ve ever owned, would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> My Sonicare AND then a Waterpic lectrobrush succumbed to a fusing of metal in the brush to the handle and irreparabl broke off.&lt;br /&gt;For serveral months, I swore off electric brushes until noticing this one for a great price since the Sonicare and Waterpik cost me $200 per at time of sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for $50, and I&#x27;m kinda ashamed to say it, but you could afford to just trash this OralB if it wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it uses fairly easy to find replacement brushes at Walmart or Walgreens, I can keep it until it stops and get my best money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This item works very well.  I would have prefered a round head on the brush rather than the rectangular, but otherwise it is just fine.  Holds charge very well.</li>
            <li> Well, I received my brush a couple of weeks ago. Checked it over and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Starts well. Good vibration. Lightweight. Lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: One button. Press once to turn on high, press again to lower the vibration, press third time to shut off. Has intervals but you have to track them yourself - doesn&#x27;t shut off or go low after the fourth interval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good so far. Keeps my teeth and gums clean. Oh, brings brush for between the teeth along with standard brush.</li>
            <li> Oral-B recommended this toothbrush after they quit making my ancient toothbrush.  I like the way it works and it really gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with my oral b and bought one for my daughter in law.  She likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> I like the compact diameter, easy to hold and use.  It has the same power of heaver rechargeable toothbrushes.  Holds a charge so I can take it along in my car for brushing when I&#x27;m away from home for a day.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. My dentist was happy</li>
            <li> if this matters but my dentist said i was doing the best i possibly could with a toothbrush and it&#x27;s all due to this. Thanks Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Reasoning:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s extremely simple, but works very well:  It&#x27;s basically just a lopsided weight attached to a motor—the motor spins, the thing shakes back and forth. One button cycles through &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; (slows the motor &#x3D; fewer vibrations). Put the whole thing inside a toothbrush-shaped casing and voila: you&#x27;ve got something you can brush your teeth with that&#x27;s vibrating at around ~30,000 times per minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s an extremely reasonable price: At $40 (as of this writing), it&#x27;s $40 more expensive than the free toothbrushes your dentist gives you after a visit. But compared to other electric toothbrushes, $40 is a steal. Your teeth should be worth $40 to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s extremely well-designed: Have you seen most electric brushes? They&#x27;re dorky monstrosities—little brush heads attached to gigantic bases, with some blue or aquamarine detailing that proudly and loudly declares: &amp;#34;I am for dental hygiene!&amp;#34; This one, on the other hand, is quite nice looking, and is the size and approximate shape of a regular toothbrush. Friends are surprised when I turn it on (&amp;#34;That thing is electric?&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;— Oral-B advises you to completely drain the battery every few months, which is hard to do when it&#x27;s charging every time you put it on its stand. So every once in a while, unplug the stand. The brush will last ~2-3 weeks before the battery&#x27;s dead (which is handy for traveling), then plug it back in again.&lt;br /&gt;— Don&#x27;t take it swimming. The brush is designed to be waterproof, but, in the interest of prolonging the life of the electronics, it can&#x27;t hurt to wipe the thing down before you put it away.&lt;br /&gt;— Brush in gentle circles. When I showed up to my first post-brush-purchase teeth-cleaning with red gums, the dental hygienist—while totally supportive of the purchase—pointed out that, since this is an electric brush, you shouldn&#x27;t brush with the same vigor that youwould with a manual brush. Just slowly massage the brush in circles, and let the ultrasonic vibrations do their job.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush model for over 5 years and just purchased a second one to replace the first one.  The first one stood up to wear and tear for 5 years at the hands and mouths of 2 adults, but a crack formed in the plastic near the base (possibly the battery inside was just old and starting to swell) and we suspect too much moisture got into it.  We really liked this model compared to other sonic toothbrushes because it not only does a great job cleaning our teeth, but the brush handle and charging base are very easy to keep clean.  We had previously used a more expensive sonic toothbrush and found that it was prone to collect moisture where the brush heads attached and mildew would develop which was tough to clean away (the visible mildew could be removed but the smell was still there).  With this particular model we found that as long as we remove the brush heads when not in use, mildew and foul smells are not a problem at all.  Mild disinfecting cleansers can be applied to the handle portion without damage, but over time the printed text/logos will fade.</li>
            <li> I have juvenile peridontitis so I bought this to see if it would help my teeth and gums. I was a little skeptical because it is half the price of some of the other major brands but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. I have been using it for a couple of months, probably more than I should, and the brush head has barely worn out at all. I recently went in to see my peridontist for a deep cleaning and she couldn&#x27;t believe how good my gums look because I did have a lot of build up of tartar below the gum line. She said I was doing a great job above the gum line but I needed to work on below the gum line. That is a result of poor flossing for much longer than I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush. I attribute much of my good gum health and white, tartar free teeth above the gum line to my good brushing habits and it&#x27;s only gotten better since I invested in this toothbrush. It is an investment that will hopefully save you much more over the long run in professional dental costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you&#x27;re reading this you know that electronic toothbrushes are probably much better than manual toothbrushes so you are just wondering which one to invest in. I have had a few electronic toothbrushes and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this one, especially for $50! I have owned some at tripple the cost that seemed to work well but the brush heads would wear out quickly or they would break after a short time. I know I&#x27;ve only had this one for a few months but even if it only lasts as long as some of the others I&#x27;ve owned, at least I&#x27;m only paying 1/3 or 1/2 the price for it so I&#x27;ll just buy another one! I also like that the brush head is a little larger than others I have used.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush I found so far, small, light, works great and the battery last for for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for travel, slim and small but durable. I have a sonicare at home. I have used this brush for travel for many years and I travel a lot for work.  This is my 2nd one I&#x27;ve ordered from amazon. the first lasted almost 3 years and not a bad price at all!!</li>
            <li> Excellent cost-effective electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Many years later is still working like the 1st day. Feeling of you are getting out of the dentist. No need to bleach or something drastic for your dental needs.&lt;br /&gt;The small attachments fit perfect</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it.  Good item for the price.</li>
            <li> The size and sleek design of this brush is what caught my eye.  I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to purchase it at the $70 MSRP but on sale at $50 I couldn&#x27;t resist. Ever since getting braces, I&#x27;ve become an oral healthcare gadget enthusiast.  Even though I&#x27;ve been happy with my Sonicare Flexcare for a few years, I couldn&#x27;t wait to add this to my ever-growing cache. Unlike most Oral-B electric brushes that oscillate at super fast rates to the point where the brush heads look like they&#x27;re spinning, the Oral-B Pulsonic&#x27;s motions are more akin to Sonicare brushes which vibrate at super fast rates. However, my trusty Sonicare Flexcare definitely vibrates at a faster rate. The Pulsonic seems considerably weaker. The Oral-B Pulsonic&#x27;s information pamphlet instructs you to brush your teeth in circular motions like a manual toothbrush, with the Sonicare Flexcare I&#x27;m only supposed to run the brush over my teeth and gums. To me that suggests that the Pulsonic&#x27;s vibrations aren&#x27;t as effective as the Sonicare Flexcare. I&#x27;m no dentist, ,so maybe the Sonicare is overkill and the Pulsonic is adequate. All I know is that my teeth just *feel* cleaner with the Sonicare Flexcare over the Orl-B Pulsonic. The bristles on the Pulsonic are stiffer than I like. But boy do I absolutely LOVE the precise tip brush to get in between my braces. I wish Oral-B would sell these on their own instead of having to buy a pack with one and 3 regular brush heads. The Pulsonic has become my brush of choice to throw in my purse to brush my teeth at work/school/out and about. I use my Sonicare at home when I want a more thorough cleaning. As a travel brush for touch-ups or if you need extra cleaning between you braces, it&#x27;s great. If you&#x27;re looking for your main toothbrush I&#x27;d skip it and look into Sonicare or the more traditional Oral-B electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I want to add that I&#x27;ve never had the brush head pop off like many have complained here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Affordable (less than $70)&lt;br/&gt;Slim design&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Precision Tip attachement (LOVE this for my braces)&lt;br /&gt;Quieter than some other Oral B toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;Affordable brush heads&lt;br /&gt;Charging unit is wall mountable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as effectively as other electric brushes&lt;br /&gt;The plastic feels cheap&lt;br /&gt;Vibrates my hand more than other brushes&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are too sitff&lt;br /&gt;Louder than my Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;NiMh battery (overcharging may lead to unit breaking down)</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this toothbrush, I had the cheap Crest spinbrush that I bought for about $10 from walgreens, which had the &#x27;dual&#x27; action in one head. But of course for $10 it eventually died on me and I figured if I&#x27;m going to buy another electric toothbrush, I&#x27;ll go for one that&#x27;s worth it and from a top brand. Unfortunately, this pulsonic wasn&#x27;t it...even after the $20 rebate I was able to get. I had high expectations for this thing and it turned out to be a complete disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;  To sum, all this toothbrush is is a standard toothbrush with extra vibrating power. I found myself brushing my teeth as I would with a manual $1 toothbrush, except it wasn&#x27;t $1! The head does not move, the complete body of the toothbrush simply has this vibration that when you put it against your teeth, it does nothing but hum slightly. It doesn&#x27;t even give me that clean glossy feel like the Crest spinbrush did.&lt;br /&gt; I was pretty excited ordering an electric toothbrush that&#x27;ll finally make my dentist proud :P, and get the job done! I had been looking over some reviews for a while before purchasing this ..and i was debating with myself between this one and another oral b toothbrush that just had the spinhead, which I wish I should have ordered instead. I chose this because it came with the precision tip head (which does not do much either). But now I honestly feel like I wasted $30, and I&#x27;m forcing myself to continue using it to get my money&#x27;s worth!&lt;br /&gt;In all, if you&#x27;re going to buy an oral b brush, get the one that has the spin head only. This brush is the equivalent of a standard manual brush that you have to put work into, instead of it doing the work for you.</li>
            <li> Love it! So slim and amazing!!! Cleans your teeth fast! Very Effective on teeth! soft and powerful! You must Get!</li>
            <li> The device provide satisfactory effect for tooth protection and cleaning, which provides two modes. Very useful and beneficial to health.</li>
            <li> I liked the look of this toothbrush and it traveled well but was very upset that it just died right after the warranty ended.  It never did a great cleaning like my old Sonicare did and during the time I owned it I had the most plaque/cavity problems.  I am now going back to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> If I had never used a sonic toothbrush before, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d be happy with this. I have, though, and it doesn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean in three minutes as my Sonicare does in two. I&#x27;m going back to the Sonicare. The replacement heads are a little more expensive, but it works better, too.</li>
            <li> Everything you would expect and more. Replaces older Sonic model which died after many years. .Lighter, more compact and shape is much easier to use.</li>
            <li> This was recommended bt dentist. it works very well and has cut down on gum disease. we share the toothbrush and just change the heads after using. So you do not need one for each member of your fsmily, just different toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> We recently needed to replace the Pulsonic that we bought years ago. This works just as well, but might seem a little flimsier than its predecessor. True enough, we dropped it. It landed on the tip (the brush had already been removed), and it broke. We tried gluing it, but predictably it broke again because of the vibration. This recent purchase was its replacement, and it has worked without any problems.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting use to an electronic toothbrush when you have used the manual for years and years. This one is no different and it takes some getting use to. The brush does vibrate heavily and sends a &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; through your mouth when the head touches your teeth instead of the bristles, but you get use to it and using it makes that happen less often. It seems to do a good job at cleaning and the head interchange easily. It is small so it does not feel like a huge electric brush in your mouth and it pops in and out of the charging stand with ease.</li>
            <li> I bought my Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush 2.5 years ago and was pleased with the performance. This was my first electric toothbrush and it seemed to do a good job cleaning my teeth. The toothbrush works, but all the attachments didn&#x27;t seem to do much... I tried them once and never touched them again. The current model doesn&#x27;t even come with the attachments, so I guess they figured this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the smaller handle brushes, so the size was perfect for me. My only beef with the product is that it died on me twice. The first time was a year ago, then it came back to life on its own somehow. Then again recently for good. I think this should have lasted longer based on the reviews I&#x27;ve seen for other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you can get this for a good price, go for it... you should be pleased. Just start saving up for the replacement.</li>
            <li> I ordered one for me and one for my fiance.  We really like the narrow handle of the tooth brush and are happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li> This replace my crest sonic, which I&#x27;ve been unable to find recently in stores. It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but cheaper than many other sonic brushes. It works great. I love the two speeds and two minute timer. The little flossing pick that came with it is neat, but doesn&#x27;t get used much. Dental floss is just simpler. I may buy another for my daughter or my husband.</li>
            <li> My grandson has this toothbrush and I like the way it looks.  It is compact and looks efficient.  However, I am not totally sold on the toothbrush.  Good thing it has a sensitive mode or I would not be using it.</li>
            <li> I like the traditional brush head as opposed to the small round one of other electric toothbrushes.  I also like the slim handle and built in timer.  This is my 3rd type of rechargeable in 5 years because the batteries have died within a few months of the warranty expiring so I hope the 3rd time is the charm.</li>
            <li> Teeth are noticeably whiter and this brush has power to spare.  On full charge last more than 15 days, brushing twice a day.  Outstanding purchase.  Less than half the price of better known models.</li>
            <li> i like it because it&#x27;s compact, takes up very little counter space.  it&#x27;s lightweight &amp; easy to hold.  the interchangeable heads, for brushing between the teeth &amp; gum line are quick to change.  it has a 15 second timer, so brushing each quadrant is timed.  so far, so good.</li>
