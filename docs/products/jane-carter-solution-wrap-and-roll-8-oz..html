            <li>it does stay shiny on the bright side..</li>
            <li>I have tried everything so that means I have tons of good products in my bathroom</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>I loved the way my hair came out..</li>
            <li>The price is good and the product came packaged in plastic so as to prevent spillage during shipping.</li>
            <li>It smelt so dang good though.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fairly kinky.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>and she said it smells good)</li>
            <li>It is a good product</li>
            <li>but i put a drop of lavender oil in it and am good.</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>It smells good and leaves me with shiny, defined hair.  </li>
            <li>but it smells good.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see that this stuff does much good.</li>
            <li>This product smells incredibly good.</li>
            <li>- it gives me the most gorgeous defined curls!</li>
            <li>The bottle itself arrived quickly and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>The curls were easy to separate, shiny, and my hair smells good!  </li>
            <li>I love the foam, the smell is great</li>
            <li>I used this for a rollerset and my hair came out shiny, beautiful, and full of life!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite JCS product!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>and I liked the end results.</li>
            <li>Foams up and works kind of like moose.  </li>
            <li>Well this has a nice, lemony smell to it and does the job as advertised.</li>
            <li>My hair curls very easily on its own</li>
            <li>My hair was very smooth and healthy looking!</li>
            <li>made using curler formers easy to use and at a fair price this product was non greasy and worked well</li>
            <li>Perfect for stretching out my natural hair for twist outs.  </li>
            <li>and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found to bring out the natural corkscrew curls in my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time with the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; brush rollers and it works perfectly every time.</li>
            <li>I was able to get some nice curls after using a bendy roller/flexi rod.</li>
            <li>IT smells great and gets my hair very curly when I sit under the dryer!</li>
            <li>Top came off during shipping.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>However, I am so thoroughly pleased with this product that I have to give it</li>
            <li>so I was looking mostly for a smoothing solution when I roll it</li>
            <li>and this does seme to do ok -</li>
            <li>I love the way that the product smells, and it&#x27;s nice a light.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>If I retwist I do not need to add more product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking into trying more of the Jane Carter line.</li>
            <li>Please note this product doesn&#x27;t protect against humidity, so I would advice use of an anti-humectant in summer on top of the layer of this product to prevent your hair from frizzing up if you use it in the summer.</li>
            <li>most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I set my hair and my daughters with it and everything was nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>love it, love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be wearing roller sets more often.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am able to maintain a rollerset for 4-5 days by applying pin curls each night.  </li>
            <li>You hair will love this product.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so dang good and just right bounce, volume and shine.</li>
            <li>And it does pretty good job at holding curls in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and soft but has great hold.</li>
            <li>Will need to be paired with something stronger for frizz-protection, but does seem to blend easily with many products.</li>
            <li>I have a fair amount of straight, medium-fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls for more than a day, and this didn&#x27;t break the mold, but held up as well as</li>
            <li>but I will enjoy the scent and use the rest of the bottle mostly for that reason.</li>
            <li>use it all the time on my 5 yr old and it works great with curlers!!&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft, Great when combined with nourish &amp; shine.</li>
            <li>No flakes and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>The negatives: does not provide a strong hold.</li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning with beautiful hair that was bouncy.</li>
            <li>Was fine</li>
            <li>I have fine 4 a hair</li>
            <li>Received product quickly, have been a fan of  Jane Carter for years!</li>
            <li>Light hold and light weight, doesn&#x27;t lead to build-up and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>This is a OK product gives a nice soft bouncy hold to my curly hair</li>
            <li>It was frizz free and looked smooth looking..</li>
            <li>I also like the scent - light and floral.</li>
            <li>The hold is medium light.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I ran it through my hair just for fun and found that i love it as a curl refresher.  </li>
            <li>It was a light foam.</li>
            <li>It smells good, it&#x27;s all natural and my hair is SMOOTH, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This light foam helps to stretch the hair and dries clean with no residue.  </li>
            <li>I just took out my first bantu-knot-out today after sleeping on it overnight like I always do, and the results were fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I originally got this product as part of a sampler pack.  </li>
            <li>Very good price for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair very soft and in the perfect condition to use the flat iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so lightly scented and smells so fresh out of the bottle as well as on hair.</li>
            <li>it contains ingredients that are actually plant based and GOOD for my hair.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have almost the full amount which I don&#x27;t know who fault</li>
            <li>I would have gave it full 5 stars but because I received mines damaged</li>
            <li>It is made of all natural ingredients, and it dries to a nice, but not crunchy, hold.</li>
            <li>I have tried other foaming wraps, and the hold has been great, but the frizziness of my hair always breaks through.  </li>
            <li>This made my hair soft and light but it didn&#x27;t hold the curls for a full dsay I&#x27;m going to have to look into another product with a better hold</li>
            <li>What I like about this product is the natural ingredient that are good for the hair, it gave my hair a nice hold, my hair lasted all day long and would have lasted even longer if I didn&#x27;t comb out the curls</li>
            <li>I used this in combination with the Jane Carter Twist and Lock to act as a mild holding agent for the finger coils.</li>
            <li>You know how you know it&#x27;s going to look good when it&#x27;s dry?  </li>
            <li>I can use this in my hair and it doesn&#x27;t build up or make my hair heavy and best off all, my hair is not hard or flakey.</li>
            <li>I love it because it makes my hair soft and shiny with minimal flaking, dries quickly and smells just charming.</li>
            <li>Overall using this when roller setting will make your hair come out amazing</li>
            <li>Such a nice product.</li>
            <li>There simply isn&#x27;t enough holding agent to make in an effective setting lotion.  </li>
            <li>the products are good, but the package for this item is not very well.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to use a product with more natural ingredients...which this has...</li>
            <li>I love that all the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>Im not crazy about the chamomile smell</li>
            <li>I also used to when I straightened my hair, and I still had the same frizz free fabulous results!  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair smells refreshing and soft while curling it.</li>
            <li>Jane Carter Solution works really well to help give body to straight hair and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>The hold is just right too, so I can go about three days before I wrap my hair again.</li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s right considered that the product it self worked.</li>
            <li>The delivery was very fast .</li>
            <li>kinda makes me think why order on line when cant see it first...</li>
            <li>Needless to say I&#x27;m very impressed</li>
            <li>Though I would use it more than what I actually do, but it works well.</li>
            <li>I gave it a four because I only used it once and haven&#x27;t been able to try it</li>
            <li>So you have smooth hair where you have the chemicals, and then wild hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you want soft hair with a little bit of hold.</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with adapting to short, textured hair, but now I have really fallen in love.  </li>
            <li>It was super soft to the look and touch!</li>
            <li>When you actually use it as a wrapping/setting solution, it provides hold with a really brilliant shine without being stiff or crunchy or drying.  </li>
            <li>Drys quickly and leaves hair really soft.</li>
            <li>However, customs does not allow certain liquids into the country I am in and this is one of the things they dont allow</li>
            <li>but I certainly learned a lesson.</li>
            <li>I did not find it to provide a strong enough hold nor did it provide me with much shine.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I used, or the way I used it........</li>
            <li>I only used a light leave-in conditioner and the JC Wrap and Roll.  </li>
            <li>I really like this, and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>Used with curlformers and sets the hair really well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use as much when I do use it..</li>
            <li>; I put it on wet hair and used it with curlers, and my hair came out a nice and soft, though it didn&#x27;t look like it should be (somewhat looked like it had gel or something in it).  </li>
            <li>Really foamy, goes onto the hair easily, helps the curl stay all day long</li>
            <li>I live in a hot and humid climate.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair sticky and kind if stiff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many gels, sprays and other wrap solutions that just don&#x27;t work over the years.</li>
            <li>This is great wrap lotion a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li>and it can be used in different ways such as you can put it on natural wet hair if you want a natural look it will give it a nice hold and keep your curls nice if you have curly hair.</li>
            <li>itsa good but subtle hold</li>
            <li>Now of course you may eventually get the natural hair re-permed or re-relaxed, but if you are in between, be aware that the poof may be troublesome if you don&#x27;t want to have to deal with something else with your hair.</li>
            <li>Took my hair down, and its FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>I definitely see more braid outs in my future!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Perfect solution for a bad hair day fix.</li>
            <li>I have very kinky, coily, natural hair (4B/C)</li>
            <li>I would normally have to blow out my hair, then roll it to achieve this look.  </li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t wait to complain to sender to send me a new one</li>
            <li>not sure it is any better than using diluted Infusium in water sprayed on or any other product that is lightly setting</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be interested in seeing how this product performs when mixed with a stronger hold product.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair very smooth and shiny, which is normally hard for me to achieve.</li>
            <li>i use it right after i shampoo and during the blow dry process.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>It creates the right amount of hold without making the hair crispy , crunchy and dry.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve become natural I&#x27;ve retired Lottabody and replace it with JC Solution.  </li>
            <li>I found Jane Carter when Target started selling natural hair products, and discontinued that for some reason.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it didn&#x27;t work as well when my hair was shorter and all natural.  </li>
            <li>this professional looking</li>
            <li>My hair was fairly soft, and I&#x27;d venture to say shiny, but it didn&#x27;t look \\&quot;done.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I did like how soft my hair felt.</li>
            <li>Oh by the way...I have natural hair</li>
            <li>After watching a YouTube instructional on how to use this with curlformers for curly natural hair</li>
            <li>I purchased this in combo with the snail rollers for my 5 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my daughter&#x27;s hair crunchy and lets her have a natural look.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves the smell, but what 5-year old wouldn&#x27;t like it?</li>
            <li>It works well with my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>Also keeps hair shine and soft.</li>
            <li>Ms Jane Carter&#x27;s products rock for natural girls.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My curls are so soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really oily and last throughout the day..</li>
            <li>This is what I have noticed if you have natural hair with a relaxer or perm.</li>
            <li>Sense I am going natural</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty frizzy after blow dry and this solution seems to help to get it under control too.</li>
            <li>It was way to watery when trying to mold my hair that my hair didn&#x27;t really mold flat.</li>
            <li>I had such high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just recently started doing braid outs on my naturally curly hair, and I originally bought products specifically for curling the hair (i.e. curling jellies, gels, etc.), but even after sitting under the dryer for over an hour AND waiting overnight to take my hair down, my hair would still be damp, and therefore would come out frizzy.</li>
            <li>This worked absolute wonders on my 4c textured African American hair.  </li>
            <li>and sometimes it&#x27;s hard finding products to make my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I finally gave up fighting with the natural texture of my hair and stopped using chemical relaxers; it&#x27;s been almost two years</li>
            <li>The praise you might find on the beauty blogs for this product doesn&#x27;t go quite far enough.  </li>
            <li>Several people have thought my daughter&#x27;s hair was naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>Incidentally, I noticed upon application that it gives my random curl pattern nice definition -</li>
            <li>I think this will benefit me later as I get further in the natural process</li>
            <li>It left my hair very soft but still had enough hold for my curls to last for days.  </li>
            <li>I initially had concerns about applying too much but even if you seem to over due it, it dissolves and does not build up as you would expect...</li>
            <li>Once dry, my hair was still soft and there was a shine to my hair</li>
            <li>Hair is left soft and not crunchy/hard after letting hair air dry.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This wrap solution has great reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li> but I did not find it to that great.</li>
            <li> and it does not flake and smells great too.</li>
            <li> It is great for my summertime wash and go hairstyles.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> so it doesnt harden the hair and since it has really great ingredient I didn&#x27;t notice a lot of buildup of product.</li>
            <li> Great product and</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> The positives : it does not flake, has a pleasant smell, the price is acceptable.</li>
            <li> it does stay shiny on the bright side..</li>
            <li> I have tried everything so that means I have tons of good products in my bathroom</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> I loved the way my hair came out..</li>
            <li> The price is good and the product came packaged in plastic so as to prevent spillage during shipping.</li>
            <li> It smelt so dang good though.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s fairly kinky.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> and she said it smells good)</li>
            <li> It is a good product</li>
            <li> but i put a drop of lavender oil in it and am good.</li>
            <li> good product</li>
            <li> It smells good and leaves me with shiny, defined hair.  </li>
            <li> but it smells good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see that this stuff does much good.</li>
            <li> This product smells incredibly good.</li>
            <li> - it gives me the most gorgeous defined curls!</li>
            <li> The bottle itself arrived quickly and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> The curls were easy to separate, shiny, and my hair smells good!  </li>
            <li> I love the foam, the smell is great</li>
            <li> I used this for a rollerset and my hair came out shiny, beautiful, and full of life!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite JCS product!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> and I liked the end results.</li>
            <li> Foams up and works kind of like moose.  </li>
            <li> Well this has a nice, lemony smell to it and does the job as advertised.</li>
            <li> My hair curls very easily on its own</li>
            <li> My hair was very smooth and healthy looking!</li>
            <li> made using curler formers easy to use and at a fair price this product was non greasy and worked well</li>
            <li> Perfect for stretching out my natural hair for twist outs.  </li>
            <li> and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found to bring out the natural corkscrew curls in my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time with the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; brush rollers and it works perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> I was able to get some nice curls after using a bendy roller/flexi rod.</li>
            <li> IT smells great and gets my hair very curly when I sit under the dryer!</li>
            <li> Top came off during shipping.  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> However, I am so thoroughly pleased with this product that I have to give it</li>
            <li> so I was looking mostly for a smoothing solution when I roll it</li>
            <li> and this does seme to do ok -</li>
            <li> I love the way that the product smells, and it&#x27;s nice a light.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> If I retwist I do not need to add more product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking into trying more of the Jane Carter line.</li>
            <li> Please note this product doesn&#x27;t protect against humidity, so I would advice use of an anti-humectant in summer on top of the layer of this product to prevent your hair from frizzing up if you use it in the summer.</li>
            <li> most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I set my hair and my daughters with it and everything was nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> love it, love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be wearing roller sets more often.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am able to maintain a rollerset for 4-5 days by applying pin curls each night.  </li>
            <li> You hair will love this product.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> so dang good and just right bounce, volume and shine.</li>
            <li> And it does pretty good job at holding curls in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and soft but has great hold.</li>
            <li> Will need to be paired with something stronger for frizz-protection, but does seem to blend easily with many products.</li>
            <li> I have a fair amount of straight, medium-fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls for more than a day, and this didn&#x27;t break the mold, but held up as well as</li>
            <li> but I will enjoy the scent and use the rest of the bottle mostly for that reason.</li>
            <li> use it all the time on my 5 yr old and it works great with curlers!!&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft, Great when combined with nourish &amp; shine.</li>
            <li> No flakes and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> The negatives: does not provide a strong hold.</li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning with beautiful hair that was bouncy.</li>
            <li> Was fine</li>
            <li> I have fine 4 a hair</li>
            <li> Received product quickly, have been a fan of  Jane Carter for years!</li>
            <li> Light hold and light weight, doesn&#x27;t lead to build-up and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> This is a OK product gives a nice soft bouncy hold to my curly hair</li>
            <li> It was frizz free and looked smooth looking..</li>
            <li> I also like the scent - light and floral.</li>
            <li> The hold is medium light.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> I ran it through my hair just for fun and found that i love it as a curl refresher.  </li>
            <li> It was a light foam.</li>
            <li> It smells good, it&#x27;s all natural and my hair is SMOOTH, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This light foam helps to stretch the hair and dries clean with no residue.  </li>
            <li> I just took out my first bantu-knot-out today after sleeping on it overnight like I always do, and the results were fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I originally got this product as part of a sampler pack.  </li>
            <li> Very good price for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair very soft and in the perfect condition to use the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so lightly scented and smells so fresh out of the bottle as well as on hair.</li>
            <li> it contains ingredients that are actually plant based and GOOD for my hair.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have almost the full amount which I don&#x27;t know who fault</li>
            <li> I would have gave it full 5 stars but because I received mines damaged</li>
            <li> It is made of all natural ingredients, and it dries to a nice, but not crunchy, hold.</li>
            <li> I have tried other foaming wraps, and the hold has been great, but the frizziness of my hair always breaks through.  </li>
            <li> This made my hair soft and light but it didn&#x27;t hold the curls for a full dsay I&#x27;m going to have to look into another product with a better hold</li>
            <li> What I like about this product is the natural ingredient that are good for the hair, it gave my hair a nice hold, my hair lasted all day long and would have lasted even longer if I didn&#x27;t comb out the curls</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with the Jane Carter Twist and Lock to act as a mild holding agent for the finger coils.</li>
            <li> You know how you know it&#x27;s going to look good when it&#x27;s dry?  </li>
            <li> I can use this in my hair and it doesn&#x27;t build up or make my hair heavy and best off all, my hair is not hard or flakey.</li>
            <li> I love it because it makes my hair soft and shiny with minimal flaking, dries quickly and smells just charming.</li>
            <li> Overall using this when roller setting will make your hair come out amazing</li>
            <li> Such a nice product.</li>
            <li> There simply isn&#x27;t enough holding agent to make in an effective setting lotion.  </li>
            <li> the products are good, but the package for this item is not very well.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to use a product with more natural ingredients...which this has...</li>
            <li> I love that all the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> Im not crazy about the chamomile smell</li>
            <li> I also used to when I straightened my hair, and I still had the same frizz free fabulous results!  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair smells refreshing and soft while curling it.</li>
            <li> Jane Carter Solution works really well to help give body to straight hair and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> The hold is just right too, so I can go about three days before I wrap my hair again.</li>
            <li> and I think that&#x27;s right considered that the product it self worked.</li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast .</li>
            <li> kinda makes me think why order on line when cant see it first...</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m very impressed</li>
            <li> Though I would use it more than what I actually do, but it works well.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four because I only used it once and haven&#x27;t been able to try it</li>
            <li> So you have smooth hair where you have the chemicals, and then wild hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want soft hair with a little bit of hold.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with adapting to short, textured hair, but now I have really fallen in love.  </li>
            <li> It was super soft to the look and touch!</li>
            <li> When you actually use it as a wrapping/setting solution, it provides hold with a really brilliant shine without being stiff or crunchy or drying.  </li>
            <li> Drys quickly and leaves hair really soft.</li>
            <li> However, customs does not allow certain liquids into the country I am in and this is one of the things they dont allow</li>
            <li> but I certainly learned a lesson.</li>
            <li> I did not find it to provide a strong enough hold nor did it provide me with much shine.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much I used, or the way I used it........</li>
            <li> I only used a light leave-in conditioner and the JC Wrap and Roll.  </li>
            <li> I really like this, and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> Used with curlformers and sets the hair really well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use as much when I do use it..</li>
            <li> ; I put it on wet hair and used it with curlers, and my hair came out a nice and soft, though it didn&#x27;t look like it should be (somewhat looked like it had gel or something in it).  </li>
            <li> Really foamy, goes onto the hair easily, helps the curl stay all day long</li>
            <li> I live in a hot and humid climate.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair sticky and kind if stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many gels, sprays and other wrap solutions that just don&#x27;t work over the years.</li>
            <li> This is great wrap lotion a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> and it can be used in different ways such as you can put it on natural wet hair if you want a natural look it will give it a nice hold and keep your curls nice if you have curly hair.</li>
            <li> itsa good but subtle hold</li>
            <li> Now of course you may eventually get the natural hair re-permed or re-relaxed, but if you are in between, be aware that the poof may be troublesome if you don&#x27;t want to have to deal with something else with your hair.</li>
            <li> Took my hair down, and its FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> I definitely see more braid outs in my future!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for a bad hair day fix.</li>
            <li> I have very kinky, coily, natural hair (4B/C)</li>
            <li> I would normally have to blow out my hair, then roll it to achieve this look.  </li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t wait to complain to sender to send me a new one</li>
            <li> not sure it is any better than using diluted Infusium in water sprayed on or any other product that is lightly setting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be interested in seeing how this product performs when mixed with a stronger hold product.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair very smooth and shiny, which is normally hard for me to achieve.</li>
            <li> i use it right after i shampoo and during the blow dry process.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> It creates the right amount of hold without making the hair crispy , crunchy and dry.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve become natural I&#x27;ve retired Lottabody and replace it with JC Solution.  </li>
            <li> I found Jane Carter when Target started selling natural hair products, and discontinued that for some reason.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it didn&#x27;t work as well when my hair was shorter and all natural.  </li>
            <li> this professional looking</li>
            <li> My hair was fairly soft, and I&#x27;d venture to say shiny, but it didn&#x27;t look \\&quot;done.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I did like how soft my hair felt.</li>
            <li> Oh by the way...I have natural hair</li>
            <li> After watching a YouTube instructional on how to use this with curlformers for curly natural hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this in combo with the snail rollers for my 5 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my daughter&#x27;s hair crunchy and lets her have a natural look.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves the smell, but what 5-year old wouldn&#x27;t like it?</li>
            <li> It works well with my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> Also keeps hair shine and soft.</li>
            <li> Ms Jane Carter&#x27;s products rock for natural girls.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My curls are so soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really oily and last throughout the day..</li>
            <li> This is what I have noticed if you have natural hair with a relaxer or perm.</li>
            <li> Sense I am going natural</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty frizzy after blow dry and this solution seems to help to get it under control too.</li>
            <li> It was way to watery when trying to mold my hair that my hair didn&#x27;t really mold flat.</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started doing braid outs on my naturally curly hair, and I originally bought products specifically for curling the hair (i.e. curling jellies, gels, etc.), but even after sitting under the dryer for over an hour AND waiting overnight to take my hair down, my hair would still be damp, and therefore would come out frizzy.</li>
            <li> This worked absolute wonders on my 4c textured African American hair.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes it&#x27;s hard finding products to make my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up fighting with the natural texture of my hair and stopped using chemical relaxers; it&#x27;s been almost two years</li>
            <li> The praise you might find on the beauty blogs for this product doesn&#x27;t go quite far enough.  </li>
            <li> Several people have thought my daughter&#x27;s hair was naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> Incidentally, I noticed upon application that it gives my random curl pattern nice definition -</li>
            <li> I think this will benefit me later as I get further in the natural process</li>
            <li> It left my hair very soft but still had enough hold for my curls to last for days.  </li>
            <li> I initially had concerns about applying too much but even if you seem to over due it, it dissolves and does not build up as you would expect...</li>
            <li> Once dry, my hair was still soft and there was a shine to my hair</li>
            <li> Hair is left soft and not crunchy/hard after letting hair air dry.</li>
            <li> Watering this down is not a good idea unless you just happen to have that type of hair that needs a more diluted solution.</li>
            <li> But this product, even though it doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;slip\\&quot; of other products, really held my hair and my hair was completely dry in an hour!</li>
            <li> After doing a normal &amp;#34;wash and condition&amp;#34;, I applied this product to my slightly damp hair before applying curlformers.</li>
            <li> I use it for when puttin in larger rolls rather than the tight curls that I naturally deal with.</li>
            <li> I found that my roller sets were soft with little build up.</li>
            <li> I rarely review stuff on Amazon even though I&#x27;m addicted to shopping on this website.  </li>
            <li> I have used many products that claim they will never harden your hair or flake up and needless to say they are not very truthful....</li>
            <li> I shampoo, condition, and then apply the Jane Carter Solution to my damp hair and air or bonnet dry</li>
            <li> I wrapped my hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I used it on damp hair with satin-covered sponge rollers, and let it dry overnight.  </li>
            <li> I immediately took the product to a sink and used towels to wipe it dry.  </li>
            <li> I watered this down upon the first use after reading a review that said it was thick like soap.</li>
            <li> I got so many complements from random people passing me about the curliness of my hair and my &amp;#34;body mist.&amp;#34; :) Only bad thing is that it dries the hair a little, so I combine it with Moroccan oil and it works just wondrously!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t loose a lot.</li>
            <li> I will use it again, but I will wait until it is in stock in a local store where I can get it for less.</li>
            <li> This product flaked and made my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> I use it on top of Curlisto&#x27;s Structura Lotion, and between the two of them, I have stopped having bad hair days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last thought.</li>
            <li> I use this solution with my CurlFormers on wet hair.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a mailer envelop that was wet.  </li>
            <li> The problem was the product should have been wrapped in an absorbent material with the top solidly secured to the base.  </li>
            <li> I am not certain how much product was lost due to poor shipping</li>
            <li> I wanted to use something for my roller sets other than setting lotion.  </li>
            <li> I used it that night to test it with my other order:</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any other products with it except evo on my ends.</li>
            <li> No flakes like other wrappong mouses.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount needed for&lt;br /&gt;Short hair.</li>
            <li> only  negative</li>
            <li> and this does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve stayed away from roller sets in the past because my hair would come out frizzy, crunchy, or dry.</li>
            <li> It was a mess of the liquid from the package but cleaned it off.</li>
            <li> Leaked a little.  </li>
            <li> It made my ends a little crunchy, therefore prone to breakage, and the end result would sometimes be frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no hold!!!  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair and added a few drops of this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect for stretching out my natural hair for twist outs.  Not sticky.  Leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> Received open.  Leaked a little.  Didn&#x27;t loose a lot. Top came off during shipping.  It did not work for my hair type.  I have mixed hair: curly/straight.  I gave it away to someone with finer hair.</li>
            <li> This product flaked and made my hair very dry. I had immediate hair breakage with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything so that means I have tons of good products in my bathroom but this Jane Carter Wrap and Roll?!  The best yet.  It smells good, it&#x27;s all natural and my hair is SMOOTH, and shiny.  I dont wrap my hair.  I use it like moouse since my hair is curly wavy.  No frizz...perfect everytime.  You know how you know it&#x27;s going to look good when it&#x27;s dry?  I have that feeling everytime I use the product.  Good stuff.  Hard to find but good stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! IT smells great and gets my hair very curly when I sit under the dryer! Good Job Jane Carter!</li>
            <li> Such a nice product. It&#x27;s so lightly scented and smells so fresh out of the bottle as well as on hair. And it does pretty good job at holding curls in. My hair is pretty frizzy after blow dry and this solution seems to help to get it under control too. Very good price for such a large bottle. It will last forever.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect mousse for wash and go days!  I use it on top of Curlisto&#x27;s Structura Lotion, and between the two of them, I have stopped having bad hair days.  Seriously, I don&#x27;t know anyone who has been disappointed after using it.</li>
            <li> I have 4a/3 hair. Since I&#x27;ve become natural I&#x27;ve retired Lottabody and replace it with JC Solution.  This is my go to product whenever I want to rock a set. JC Solution provides hair with a great shine and great hold.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> this product is great.  i use it right after i shampoo and during the blow dry process.&lt;br /&gt;it leaves my hair very soft and in the perfect condition to use the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how on earth I lived without this stuff. I&#x27;ve used so many gels, sprays and other wrap solutions that just don&#x27;t work over the years. I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair like this since I was 14 in 2004, so that&#x27;s a lot of useless product. I found Jane Carter when Target started selling natural hair products, and discontinued that for some reason. FYI, my hair is medium length and super-kinky. I love it because it makes my hair soft and shiny with minimal flaking, dries quickly and smells just charming. The hold is just right too, so I can go about three days before I wrap my hair again. I&#x27;ve found that every product flakes at least a bit, so I know when it does, it&#x27;s just time to wash my hair. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product!</li>
            <li> I rarely review stuff on Amazon even though I&#x27;m addicted to shopping on this website.  However, I am so thoroughly pleased with this product that I have to give it props.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently big-chopped after transitioning for a year.  I now have about 5-6 inches of hair.  My go-to hair style is a bantu-knot-out, during transition and currently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially using another setting lotion with argan oil in it.  It worked alright; I used it for quite a while.  I noticed that it didn&#x27;t work as well when my hair was shorter and all natural.  It made my ends a little crunchy, therefore prone to breakage, and the end result would sometimes be frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this product!  I just took out my first bantu-knot-out today after sleeping on it overnight like I always do, and the results were fantastic!  The curls were easy to separate, shiny, and my hair smells good!  There is no frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this product, my confidence is truly bolstered.  I have been struggling with adapting to short, textured hair, but now I have really fallen in love.  I also appreciate that the ingredients are all natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and try this product if you&#x27;re all-natural and do setting styles.</li>
            <li> I loved the way my hair came out..It was frizz free and looked smooth looking..I did a bantu knot set, my hair don&#x27;t usually come out this professional looking</li>
            <li> I like that this is a pump mousse that is not under pressure. I also like the scent - light and floral. I initially had concerns about applying too much but even if you seem to over due it, it dissolves and does not build up as you would expect...a plus.&lt;br /&gt;As for effectiveness...I would say &#x27;meh&#x27;. There is some smoothing effects but that could be my hair type (2b/c). My hair curls very easily on its own so I was looking mostly for a smoothing solution when I roll it and this does seme to do ok - not sure it is any better than using diluted Infusium in water sprayed on or any other product that is lightly setting but I am speaking for my hair type. Won&#x27;t buy again but I will enjoy the scent and use the rest of the bottle mostly for that reason.</li>
            <li> I use this product to set my natural (unprocessed) hair for roller sets. This light foam helps to stretch the hair and dries clean with no residue.  The price is good and the product came packaged in plastic so as to prevent spillage during shipping.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product only after purchasing the Jane Carter Nourish and Shine.  I wanted to use something for my roller sets other than setting lotion.  I love the way that the product smells, and it&#x27;s nice a light. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff.  It has body and shine.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, but my hair had almost 0 curl after sitting under the dryer in rollers with this product.  There simply isn&#x27;t enough holding agent to make in an effective setting lotion.  My hair was fairly soft, and I&#x27;d venture to say shiny, but it didn&#x27;t look \\&quot;done.\\&quot;  I&#x27;d be interested in seeing how this product performs when mixed with a stronger hold product.</li>
            <li> great product&lt;br /&gt;we use it all the time on my 5 yr old and it works great with curlers!!&lt;br /&gt;we love it.</li>
            <li> I have used several Jane Carter products and have not been disappointed by any of them.  The Wrap &amp; Roll is one of my favorites.  I use it for my twist outs and braid outs.  My hair comes out shiny with lots of hold.  If I retwist I do not need to add more product.  I am a product junkie but this is one product I will continue to buy over and over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started doing braid outs on my naturally curly hair, and I originally bought products specifically for curling the hair (i.e. curling jellies, gels, etc.), but even after sitting under the dryer for over an hour AND waiting overnight to take my hair down, my hair would still be damp, and therefore would come out frizzy. But this product, even though it doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;slip\\&quot; of other products, really held my hair and my hair was completely dry in an hour! Took my hair down, and its FABULOUS! Lots of bounce and body...I definitely see more braid outs in my future!</li>
            <li> Does wonders on my roller set.</li>
            <li> This wrap solution has great reviews on Amazon but I did not find it to that great. The positives : it does not flake, has a pleasant smell, the price is acceptable. The negatives: does not provide a strong hold. I use this solution with my CurlFormers on wet hair. I did not find it to provide a strong enough hold nor did it provide me with much shine.  I did like how soft my hair felt.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up fighting with the natural texture of my hair and stopped using chemical relaxers; it&#x27;s been almost two years and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found to bring out the natural corkscrew curls in my hair. I shampoo, condition, and then apply the Jane Carter Solution to my damp hair and air or bonnet dry - it gives me the most gorgeous defined curls! Adds shine and controls frizz without that crispy thing that happens with gels or mousse. I like that it contains ingredients that are actually plant based and GOOD for my hair.</li>
            <li> the products are good, but the package for this item is not very well.  When I opened it, it leaked some already so that I will not think to order liquid from Amazon for a while.</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations for this product.  It has absolutely no hold!!!  It did nothing for my braidouts and twistouts.  It was like I was applying water that foamed on my head.  NO HOLD!  No matter how much I used, or the way I used it........Nada.</li>
            <li> i hate to say it but the last 3 items i purchased from amazon was not up to my standards of what i wanted...kinda makes me think why order on line when cant see it first...may not do it again</li>
            <li> Works well but definitely dries the hair.</li>
            <li> I have type 4a hair. I only used a light leave-in conditioner and the JC Wrap and Roll.  Excellent results.  No flaking.  Shiny and bouncy.  I used them with knock-off curlformers.  Will try with rollerset next.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and added a few drops of this product. I wrapped my hair and let it air dry. My hair was very smooth and healthy looking!</li>
            <li> Holds well, I need instructions on wrap curlers I purchased none were included so I just use when curling my hair with iron.</li>
            <li> Gave me a few flakes, but I misted my hair w/coconut oil spray. Was fine and I liked the end results.</li>
            <li> My hair type needs a stronger hold. My roller set didn&#x27;t last, maybe I&#x27;ll try it for another hair style.</li>
            <li> When it arrived it was leaking so I didn&#x27;t have almost the full amount which I don&#x27;t know who fault it is the sender or carrier? It was a mess of the liquid from the package but cleaned it off. It smelt so dang good though. I used it that night to test it with my other order: Curl former.(Followed the instructions from Youtuber) I was amazed by the results. It was super soft to the look and touch! Made my entire head smell so dang good and just right bounce, volume and shine. (I know they say don&#x27;t use the product if it have been broken,leaking,seal missing or w.e but I couldn&#x27;t wait to complain to sender to send me a new one so I was like challenge accepted and tried it anyways but you don&#x27;t have to do that and it&#x27;s up to you if you receive your product damaged). I would have gave it full 5 stars but because I received mines damaged I gave it 4 and I think that&#x27;s right considered that the product it self worked. I don&#x27;t base the rating all on how soon or late it arrived or if product is intact or damaged like other reviewers. This product is amazing and I&#x27;m looking into trying more of the Jane Carter line.</li>
            <li> made using curler formers easy to use and at a fair price this product was non greasy and worked well</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It creates the right amount of hold without making the hair crispy , crunchy and dry. Its great for curls, braid outs twist outs etc and the curls will hold for days until you wash it out!</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with the Jane Carter Twist and Lock to act as a mild holding agent for the finger coils. It works as expected.Love it!!</li>
            <li> I did a roller set using the solution. I didn&#x27;t use any other products with it except evo on my ends. It&#x27;s not sticky, flakes, or drying. The hold is medium light. Results...bouncy curls with shine and movement. Curls lasted 2 to 3 days. Oh by the way...I have natural hair that&#x27;s fairly kinky.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a good amount of time. My curls were shiny just like the bottle described. I will definitely purchase this again</li>
            <li> The praise you might find on the beauty blogs for this product doesn&#x27;t go quite far enough.  This worked absolute wonders on my 4c textured African American hair.  When you actually use it as a wrapping/setting solution, it provides hold with a really brilliant shine without being stiff or crunchy or drying.  Incidentally, I noticed upon application that it gives my random curl pattern nice definition - so I may try it as a wash and go product.</li>
            <li> After watching a YouTube instructional on how to use this with curlformers for curly natural hair I purchased the product. After doing a normal &amp;#34;wash and condition&amp;#34;, I applied this product to my slightly damp hair before applying curlformers. Once dry, my hair was still soft and there was a shine to my hair so I consider this product to have worked well.  (I have not tried the curlformers without using this product).  Please note this product doesn&#x27;t protect against humidity, so I would advice use of an anti-humectant in summer on top of the layer of this product to prevent your hair from frizzing up if you use it in the summer.</li>
            <li> Jane Carter Solution works really well to help give body to straight hair and is super easy to use. I use it all the time with the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; brush rollers and it works perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> Foams up and works kind of like moose.  But not that foamy.  Used &amp;#34;as directed,&amp;#34; I put it on wet hair and used it with curlers, and my hair came out a nice and soft, though it didn&#x27;t look like it should be (somewhat looked like it had gel or something in it).  I have a fair amount of straight, medium-fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curls for more than a day, and this didn&#x27;t break the mold, but held up as well as most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Received product quickly, have been a fan of  Jane Carter for years! This product is no exception!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in combo with the snail rollers for my 5 year old daughter.  This is a great product! Doesn&#x27;t make my daughter&#x27;s hair crunchy and lets her have a natural look.  Several people have thought my daughter&#x27;s hair was naturally curly.  Go figure!  My daughter loves the smell, but what 5-year old wouldn&#x27;t like it?</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use with my Curlformers and was very disappointed.  My curls fell out by noon, and it made my hair greasy.  I was hoping to use a product with more natural ingredients...which this has...but I will have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and soft but has great hold. No flakes and washes out easily. I used it on my color treated hair and it did not strip the color.</li>
            <li> I bought it and my friend was going to send it to me as I am in another country. However, customs does not allow certain liquids into the country I am in and this is one of the things they dont allow so I gave it to my friend. She llikes it a lot and will buy some for herself. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;(oh and she said it smells good)</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It works well with my naturally curly hair.  I use it for when puttin in larger rolls rather than the tight curls that I naturally deal with.</li>
            <li> My  daughter says so...</li>
            <li> The reviews I read prior to purchasing this product were spot on. It is a good product only  negative it doesn&#x27;t give a lasting set or hold.</li>
            <li> I have used many products that claim they will never harden your hair or flake up and needless to say they are not very truthful....well I have finally found the one! I can use this in my hair and it doesn&#x27;t build up or make my hair heavy and best off all, my hair is not hard or flakey.</li>
            <li> I love that all the ingredients are natural.I have fine 4 a hair and this does not weigh my hair down.Drys quickly and leaves hair really soft.I have used this over 2 different hair mosturizers with no white flakes noted.The ingredients on this bottle is different than the one on her website.The one on her website has shea butter in it which my hair doesnt like so i hope this version doesnt run out.Im not crazy about the chamomile smell but i put a drop of lavender oil in it and am good.Will try the rest of her products soon</li>
            <li> This product works well. It comes out like foam and it does not flake and smells great too. Thumbs up</li>
            <li> Did not hold the curl</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and sometimes it&#x27;s hard finding products to make my hair smooth. I set my hair and my daughters with it and everything was nice and smooth. It has a wonderful smell also.</li>
            <li> love it, love it. No flakes like other wrappong mouses. Makes my hair so soft, Great when combined with nourish &amp; shine., A must for all who blow and curl their hair.</li>
            <li> I have very kinky, coily, natural hair (4B/C) and I&#x27;ve stayed away from roller sets in the past because my hair would come out frizzy, crunchy, or dry. I got this in a sample pack from Target and decided to give it a go.  I am amazed at how well my hair turned out.  I used it on damp hair with satin-covered sponge rollers, and let it dry overnight.  This product made my hair very smooth and shiny, which is normally hard for me to achieve. It left my hair very soft but still had enough hold for my curls to last for days.  No flakes, no crunch, no drying out my hair.  I would normally have to blow out my hair, then roll it to achieve this look.  Needless to say I&#x27;m very impressed and I&#x27;ll be wearing roller sets more often.</li>
            <li> Really foamy, goes onto the hair easily, helps the curl stay all day long and then some.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite JCS product! It is great for my summertime wash and go hairstyles. It is made of all natural ingredients, and it dries to a nice, but not crunchy, hold. and the smell is very pleasant!</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair smooth and silky.  Does not leave the hair flaky. Only a small amount needed for&lt;br /&gt;Short hair. I love this product. Perfect solution for a bad hair day fix.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want soft hair with a little bit of hold. I found that my roller sets were soft with little build up. But my curls had dropped by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Came on time, hold hair style without cruching and flaking. Also keeps hair shine and soft. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its because my hair is relaxed or what? But I didn&#x27;t like this product. It was way to watery when trying to mold my hair that my hair didn&#x27;t really mold flat. I had to add gel in some places. I like the smell though. I wanted to like this and to support black/operated businesses, but I&#x27;m going back to my Nairobi foam wrap.😞</li>
            <li> I normallly have frizz!  Even though I moisturize, moisturize, moisturize, I tend to have frizz.  I have tried other foaming wraps, and the hold has been great, but the frizziness of my hair always breaks through.  Not so with this stuff!  I really like this, and will continue to use it.  I used this for a rollerset and my hair came out shiny, beautiful, and full of life!  I am able to maintain a rollerset for 4-5 days by applying pin curls each night.  I also used to when I straightened my hair, and I still had the same frizz free fabulous results!  BTW, I am an African American woman with 4A kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!!! I use for twist outs, braids, and sets. Ms Jane Carter&#x27;s products rock for natural girls. Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Used with curlformers and sets the hair really well. I used a small little pump on each strand before rolling. Helps a lot to keep style in place. I live in a hot and humid climate. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> good product but was sticky</li>
            <li> I originally got this product as part of a sampler pack.  I don&#x27;t often set or twist my 3C curls, I just cowash, moisturize and wear.  I didn&#x27;t really need it but I tried the product just because I wanted to see what it felt like on my fingers.  I ran it through my hair just for fun and found that i love it as a curl refresher.  I love the foam, the smell is great and I use it to refresh my curls for 2 day and 3 day curls.</li>
            <li> I have not yet tried this product.  It arrived in a mailer envelop that was wet.  The fluid had leaked through the bubble wrap.  The problem was the product should have been wrapped in an absorbent material with the top solidly secured to the base.  It had one strip of scotch tape which did not hold.  I immediately took the product to a sink and used towels to wipe it dry.  I am not certain how much product was lost due to poor shipping but I certainly learned a lesson.</li>
            <li> This is the one solution that actually does the job, its not necessary to look any further it&#x27;s very good product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Makes my hair smells refreshing and soft while curling it. You hair will love this product.</li>
            <li> Though I would use it more than what I actually do, but it works well. Heated rollers and the wrap solution work well together.</li>
            <li> I used these with a curlformers set I bought. My curls are so soft and bouncy. I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last thought. And no frizz!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I used it when I set my hair in roller I woke up the next morning with beautiful hair that was bouncy. What I like about this product is the natural ingredient that are good for the hair, it gave my hair a nice hold, my hair lasted all day long and would have lasted even longer if I didn&#x27;t comb out the curls itsa good but subtle hold so it doesnt harden the hair and since it has really great ingredient I didn&#x27;t notice a lot of buildup of product. Overall using this when roller setting will make your hair come out amazing and it can be used in different ways such as you can put it on natural wet hair if you want a natural look it will give it a nice hold and keep your curls nice if you have curly hair. Great product and It is a very good price. I gave it a four because I only used it once and haven&#x27;t been able to try it n a lot of ways yet but the product is very good and smells good.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. It does minimize frizz, so the curl is smoother. Hair is left soft and not crunchy/hard after letting hair air dry. I experimented with different types of rollers. This did not work with all of my different types of rollers. I was able to get some nice curls after using a bendy roller/flexi rod. Curls also lasted longer when I used the bendy rollers. I watered this down upon the first use after reading a review that said it was thick like soap. Watering this down is not a good idea unless you just happen to have that type of hair that needs a more diluted solution. I didn&#x27;t find this product thick at all. It was a light foam. I will use it again, but I will wait until it is in stock in a local store where I can get it for less.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am going back natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my twist and and it works for me</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Would recommend to anyone. The delivery was very fast .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use as much when I do use it..but it&#x27;s really oily and last throughout the day..it does stay shiny on the bright side..but I think I&#x27;ll stick with coconut oil</li>
            <li> This made my hair soft and light but it didn&#x27;t hold the curls for a full dsay I&#x27;m going to have to look into another product with a better hold</li>
            <li> Well this has a nice, lemony smell to it and does the job as advertised. This is what I have noticed if you have natural hair with a relaxer or perm. Any &amp;#34;new growth&amp;#34; hair may end up wilder than usual. So you have smooth hair where you have the chemicals, and then wild hair. Now of course you may eventually get the natural hair re-permed or re-relaxed, but if you are in between, be aware that the poof may be troublesome if you don&#x27;t want to have to deal with something else with your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or heavy feeling. It feels like air and the smell is WONDERFUL!!!!! I love it I used it on my brother hair as we&#x27;ll LOL!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Does what it&#x27;s suppose too and smells great!</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail wrap lotion for twist outs. It smells good and leaves me with shiny, defined hair.  The bottle itself arrived quickly and in excellent condition. Since I ordered it, however, I have found it at a lower price elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Sense I am going natural I think this will benefit me later as I get further in the natural process but this and all leave in products seem to make me shed. but it smells good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see that this stuff does much good. It comes out as a foam and is hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Smells great! And works well</li>
            <li> This product smells incredibly good. I got so many complements from random people passing me about the curliness of my hair and my &amp;#34;body mist.&amp;#34; :) Only bad thing is that it dries the hair a little, so I combine it with Moroccan oil and it works just wondrously!</li>
            <li> Light hold and light weight, doesn&#x27;t lead to build-up and rinses easily. Will need to be paired with something stronger for frizz-protection, but does seem to blend easily with many products.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair sticky and kind if stiff. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a OK product gives a nice soft bouncy hold to my curly hair but I am unable to use everyday as it makes my scalp itch.  Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works even for my hair type. I will be purchasing this product again. www.createmine.com</li>
            <li> This is great wrap lotion a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Works real good on my hair.</li>
