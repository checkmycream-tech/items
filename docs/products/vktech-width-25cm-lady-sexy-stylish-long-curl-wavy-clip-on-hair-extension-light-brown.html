            <li>They are exactly as described, and match my hair perfectly (my boyfriend asked how they knew what color to make them s they matched, to give you an idea of how close the match is).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Great for synthetic and they ship very quickly.</li>
            <li>These extensions are amazing.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing, even though it is synthetic you can still iron curl or straighten.</li>
            <li>The color was nice and the clips hold to my hair well; it never slips.  </li>
            <li>so I bought another one and they look really nice in my hair-</li>
            <li>A nice hair piece.</li>
            <li>FOR A NICE CLIP ON EXTENSION</li>
            <li>buy at your own risk is all I have to say.</li>
            <li>and it looks nice..</li>
            <li>but all in all i think its nice looking .</li>
            <li>or my daughter liked about it.  </li>
            <li>Nice clips that stayed in through all my dancing.  </li>
            <li>Made extremely nice.</li>
            <li>I liked mine, after a while i straightened them.</li>
            <li>So,so surprised!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li>Loved the look and how easy it was to attach in my hair.</li>
            <li>and the hair falls out very easily</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clip in and gives volume</li>
            <li>pretty good for the price!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very happy is beauty and match perfectly with my hair, soft and come very early that I can expect...</li>
            <li>I have to buy more than one, but that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li>It is soft, the clips were perfectly aligned and snapped into place.</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>this looks so amazing in my daughters hair,feels like real hair, styles like real hair, Beautiful Just Beautiful</li>
            <li>I brush it gently and the curls are good to go!</li>
            <li>This looked super cute when I wore it the first time, I loved it!!</li>
            <li>They are very secure when fastened to my hair, and I&#x27;m planning to wear them on a motorcycle ride tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>Nice and soft with a beautiful bouncy curl.</li>
            <li>Its still wearable, but more of if</li>
            <li>wait for better quality ....</li>
            <li>Wish me luckk! :)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m considering getting one or two more &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The price for what I bought these for they are way better than what you expect for spending $4.50</li>
            <li>so I am more than please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, these are more of a medium brown.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would be so pleased with synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>I like wearing it as a ponytail better than the ones that comes with a comb because those combs make my scalp sore.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be more brown like pictured.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to have curly hair on one of those days when I just really want to.</li>
            <li>I hope this review helped you all in some way :)</li>
            <li>In love.</li>
            <li>I tend to get compliments more often on my hair.</li>
            <li>I was expecting better color match, not what I got.</li>
            <li>Realy prays it fit!</li>
            <li>I love how the hair is so curly</li>
            <li>better even than the ken paves ive been using.  </li>
            <li>wanted more of the curls</li>
            <li>It feels awesome, only problem...</li>
            <li>and it feels better</li>
            <li>You wont be able to get it out.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will tell all my friends and definatly order more</li>
            <li>looked ok but the hair was falling out</li>
            <li>oh one more thing the hair is a bit shinny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more permanent (human-hair) extensions before -</li>
            <li>the more I tried to de-tangle this product the more of a rat nest I made, I ended up throwing away before I even wore it</li>
            <li>I would just say to buy 2 or more.</li>
            <li>and I love the color.</li>
            <li>Awesome, especially for the money!</li>
            <li>I also put the curl back in mine using a curling iron on medium heat setting and it works great!</li>
            <li>I wish they had more shades.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I never leave reviews, but am so pleased with these clip-on extensions for the price that</li>
            <li>Need to buy me more .</li>
            <li>Bought these extensions for prom night- wore my hair in a low side ponytail and it blended with my hair color and style perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered .</li>
            <li>my frinds love it.</li>
            <li>so if you want a piece like that, you need to spend more money.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use them</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive these-</li>
            <li>so i decided to reorder because i loved the first pair.</li>
            <li>This is gorgeous and feels like real hair, my daughters were both excited as heck to get this, and I love it!</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s pretty good quality</li>
            <li>these are definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>I know she&#x27;s gonna like this - it matches her hairs original color and style!</li>
            <li>Happy with my new extension.</li>
            <li>and I tried combing it out and.its only.worse other than that service was okay not the greatest</li>
            <li>I bought a wide hand band from the dollar store and it works great!</li>
            <li>The clips hold good, and it looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>The hair is very nice, and soft.</li>
            <li>It made my hair look like I had a lighter color underneath ombre sooo cool!</li>
            <li>It does tend to tangle easily</li>
            <li>but  easy to use</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get over how easily it tangles and</li>
            <li>Easy to clip into hair.  </li>
            <li>It came with in 3 weeks, it got tangle easily,  one of the clips didn&#x27;t even work,</li>
            <li>Easy to use and care for.  </li>
            <li>Tangles easy, does not go all the way around head.</li>
            <li>and they get so tangled so easily</li>
            <li>It does knot easy</li>
            <li>These were nice and full but tangles up so quickly.</li>
            <li>Ok so not a bad product, but I doubt it would fool anyone.</li>
            <li>then these will do fine.</li>
            <li>It will take several hours to dry(I leave mine overnight) and it comes out smooth and curled beautifully.</li>
            <li>and it worked fine for that..</li>
            <li>these came very quickly and are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>so I still have a HUGE learning curve.  </li>
            <li>It was so cheap and shiny that i wore it for halloween then threw it away.</li>
            <li>If you have thicker hair you may want to consider buying two, overall a great product if these are the things you are looking for in extentions.</li>
            <li>AND you get free shipping.</li>
            <li>I ordered light brown</li>
            <li>Though it is not as light as the picture shown for the product, it does have some realism to the medium brown.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>hair is short between shoulders and neck and it didn&#x27;t look great.</li>
            <li>It is also comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>, that was no surprise, but they look, feel, and act like cheap doll hair.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t go all the way around her head - maybe an inch short on either side, but it still looked great.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy wearing this extension.</li>
            <li>Once they are snapped in they won&#x27;t come out, and the clips are comfortable too.</li>
            <li>But worth the price for sure.</li>
            <li>Enjoy ,ladies.</li>
            <li>the clips are comfortable.</li>
            <li>Cheap and clips fell off.</li>
            <li>definitely a great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old loved it.  </li>
            <li>I can say they are very persistent about helping you and making sure you are satisfied.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!  </li>
            <li>, I actually think because they aren&#x27;t super straight and &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; looking they work best.</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>All the same, I love it and already thinking of purchasing more!</li>
            <li>This is is a great value if you just want to had some density or length to your already long hair.</li>
            <li>but it was ok the first time you wear it</li>
            <li>Worth what you pay!</li>
            <li>its exactly what you see on the picture but a bit long in the head band area,  so measuring the circumference of your head would be a good idea to make sure that it does not run over the ear area and avoid becoming noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have many synthetic hair pieces that are of far better quality than this.</li>
            <li>Loved it, although the color was much darker in real</li>
            <li>A little too shiny but very good otherwise.</li>
            <li>Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future !</li>
            <li>and they were just so cheap but look real on my hair!!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get these</li>
            <li>It is true to the length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a more real hair look</li>
            <li>However, within probably 3 hours of clipping this into my hair, and styling it, it began to mat up underneath, the curls started to frizz, and the nice soft texture was lost.</li>
            <li>Brown color was true to picture.  </li>
            <li>I rinsed it with cool water and some conditioner</li>
            <li>3 stars though because the overall quality is good.</li>
            <li>Overall it was good</li>
            <li>not bad.  </li>
            <li>They knotted up really quick.</li>
            <li>I ordered this on a whim....not expecting it to be of super quality</li>
            <li>It gets tangle quick is like the wigs people use for halloween ...</li>
            <li>They arrived remarkably quickly, considering the distance traveled.  </li>
            <li>But they are very silky smooth and very curly. :)</li>
            <li>they took light heat pretty well.</li>
            <li>Really good quality and really long!</li>
            <li>Good quality but much darker than pics, more of a dark brown.</li>
            <li>although I cut about an inch off to make it appear more natural-</li>
            <li>but I cut it to make it look more natural.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth the money</li>
            <li>It was worth what it cost, but not anymore than that.</li>
            <li>Actually looked nice braided into hair, fun to play with, don&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re wanting &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and it will look more natural.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is good quality product.</li>
            <li>I think it is very real looking - looks like healthy, natural hair.</li>
            <li>and it turned it a rats nest right away.</li>
            <li>right looks like made for child&#x27;s size head</li>
            <li>Get what u pay for right?</li>
            <li>They were thick and beautiful but a red/orange color..</li>
            <li>It just looks like I was born with thick beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>It is darker than I anticipated, very dark brown rather than the light brown as advertised, but it is still nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is vary soft easy to put in and also matches my hair well</li>
            <li>The light brown hair extensions match my hair and look very natural.</li>
            <li>I bought it in a dark brown because that is my natural hair color and it blends in perfectly with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>This is my first ever time buying extensions</li>
            <li>I really like these extensions!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty damn</li>
            <li>The color was exactly what i thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>I bought two and never got them even a couple weeks after the latest delivery date of in mid February 2014, even though I had ordered them in December 2013.</li>
            <li>I recommend this most definitely!!!</li>
            <li>If it was longer, thicker,and didn&#x27;t tangle after the first 30 minutes I would give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t get them hot with a curling iron or anything they melt</li>
            <li>It is only one piece so if you have shoulder length hair and don&#x27;t pin the sides up you will be able to tell its a piece.</li>
            <li>i only were it until i can get somthing better</li>
            <li>the colour isnt exactly as the picture though but for the price ..</li>
            <li>and after i took it out the clip in was really ratty!</li>
            <li>Could be that I&#x27;m just not used to that much hair!</li>
            <li>Hair extension was exactly like it was described.</li>
            <li>These were the first extensions I&#x27;ve ever ordered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li>If you are a first timer or not .GO</li>
            <li>My first time using clip in hair extensions.</li>
            <li>I like the look and color, but after the first two times wearing it, it became horridly matted.  </li>
            <li>but I used heat on them and burnt them, but they were the exact color of my hair</li>
            <li>First time getting extensions</li>
            <li>It made the extensions a little more easy to handle.</li>
            <li>But it seems to be more of a light brown slightly greyed looking compared to my hair.</li>
            <li>i loved it....not too thin not too shiny ...can easily blend with my hair ...</li>
            <li>They are breath taking , the hair looks very real eventhough it is not natural hair looks very cute and soft .</li>
            <li>This item looks very nice, is thick and soft-feeling.</li>
            <li>Little darker than pictured but great for young girls</li>
            <li>/&gt;Contrary to belief synthetic extensions can last a good while IF you know how to properly care for them.</li>
            <li>Very much like real hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a long, beautiful, &amp; full set - however I opted to buy a second set to augment the short length of my hair (at shoulder) &amp; create a fuller look, having my hair colored to match the extensions.</li>
            <li>But to try to pass off as your own, or at least similar to your own hair, no way.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so beautiful, thick and long and fit well.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasure to buy from Vktech.üòÄ</li>
            <li>very thick and good quality,  very pretty brown just like the picture, the model must be like 6 years old because it isn&#x27;t that big, but still nice and does the job</li>
            <li>but it does tangle alot after the first use, and kind of heavy,</li>
            <li>Makes it look super full and long.  </li>
            <li>And it looked real.</li>
            <li>im wearing a hat or going out at night as to not show how discolored from my real hair it is</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t blend or even pass it off as remotely real hair.</li>
            <li>They are very silky but do not try using heat on them.</li>
            <li>When you do they feel very matted but what do you expect for synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>–≤ad qœÖalŒπ—Çy and looƒ∏—ï very “ìaƒ∏e.</li>
            <li>Very affordable .</li>
            <li>So much better than expected for the price</li>
            <li>It looks real already, but I am going to get another one and layer it with the existing one I got.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different from what i accepted it was going to be light for a synthetic one hair piece</li>
            <li>The cost is cheaper and reasonable.  </li>
            <li>and it looks and feels real</li>
            <li>In the picture the piece is a whole shade lighter than what they send you.</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t really the problem tho bc it can look  like an under shadow.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like how it tangles after 30 mins.</li>
            <li>But i really like the way it looks.</li>
            <li>and I must say, they&#x27;re really crappy.</li>
            <li>Arrived ina very timely manner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Very happy&lt;</li>
            <li>3 months was more than i expected with synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Looks so real on also.</li>
            <li>the color is very off.</li>
            <li>it is much darker.</li>
            <li>If I had bought a shorter length set than 1 would be enough for a smooth look.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I believed it would look real??</li>
            <li>Ordered and got them in a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li>I think this would be GREAT for someone with thin hair.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>I know a second one would make it much fuller and give it a more natural look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not that good with them to say the least.</li>
            <li>Just wow !!!</li>
            <li>i thought it was very pretty , but to dark for my hair even thogh i ordered it in light brown .</li>
            <li>However, it is extremely to shiny to look natural in any way &amp; it tangles very easy.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that it&#x27;d just go right over my head, exactly like in the picture, but it was too short.</li>
            <li>but I sprayed some dry shampoo in it and smells fine now.  </li>
            <li>The picture makes it look super thick, and it is not like that, it is, however, a nice synthetic hair peice well-made and secure little clips.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn these a few times already and they haven&#x27;t gotten really frizzy like most synthetic extensions have.</li>
            <li>and  looks decent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Super thin, but extremely easy to use!</li>
            <li>I never dreamed it was so nice and actually had to cut in due to the style I was going for.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a little more fullness and additional layers</li>
            <li>The product was as described, shipping could of been a little better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product but WOW was i surprized.</li>
            <li>Lol the hair is fake is like a Barbie hair..</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s worth for what the price is $7-8.</li>
            <li>The clip on part didn&#x27;t have enough length to go completely around the top of my head like a plastic head band -- it only covered almost an inch or so before my ears.</li>
            <li>One broken comb on the hair, otherwise it is good for the price.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to accommodate the thickness -- the picture did not accurately portray the curls at all.</li>
            <li>Then I put the clips in evenly right in the middle, and then pulled all of it into a pony tail.</li>
            <li>A little heavy but looks great</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend anyone buying this Mabie if you already have long hair and your hair mixes with the extensions and make it look more natural but short hair</li>
            <li>I live in jersey .</li>
            <li>I thought It be a little more different like a hailr clip which would be much easier.</li>
            <li>as an avid extension user I am estatic to say I will no longer be purchasing human hair that is anywhere from $60-$200; I will be reordering this hair again &amp; again.</li>
            <li>the color ,the curls all exactly the same.</li>
            <li>soooo surprised!</li>
            <li>I ordered dark brown which came as what looks light brown.</li>
            <li>its a little darker than the photo but can blend easily.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve worn it a few times as a ponytail added to my own hair that is fairly long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very thick.</li>
            <li>The color is true to the picture, despite what other reviews say.</li>
            <li>Very thick and nice.  </li>
            <li>But if you cut it a little shorter I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll only need one.</li>
            <li>when I opened them I was incredibly surprised by the length and weight.</li>
            <li>and when I curled my natural hair and then clipped these in...</li>
            <li>It is something that would be okay to wear for very brief periods of time, such as to an outing lasting only a couple of hours, where you are not sweating, and are sitting still.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>but so does natural hair</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SOFT &amp; NATURAL</li>
            <li>I can buy one of these a month for an entire year and still not even have close to the amount I would have invested if I bought real ones.  </li>
            <li>I wore them outside and the wind tangles them up too much</li>
            <li>it was getting all over the place , i gave it to my 6 year old niece who loves dressing up</li>
            <li>No way to make that look natural like the picture.</li>
            <li>suggest maybe buying two of these, so then it can go completely around your head</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;ll look a bit fuller and thicker -- instead of completely bald underneath where the band goes.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I did to make it look natural, was</li>
            <li>It is long, and the wave/curls are pretty.</li>
            <li>is a bigger ponytail than my real hair makes.</li>
            <li>Pretty but too long for me.</li>
            <li>I ordered mine thinking it would at least be ok.</li>
            <li>Glad it was only $4... Was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>hope it last more then a few uses.</li>
            <li>It is beautiful on, but a little thin.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that it does tangle a little bit, but if you take care of the hair and be patient with it, it&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
            <li>to small to fit head</li>
            <li>but it came out to be heavy and really full of hair</li>
            <li>Overall a very decent product for a low price!</li>
            <li>They are more of a choclate brown, lighter than black but still dark.</li>
            <li>The only issue i had was that the clips on the end were sewn too far away from the edges</li>
            <li>They are soft and look just like the picture would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li>it feels kind of fake.</li>
            <li>Theyre not too thin or anything, but I ended up being able to straighten them.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I highly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s considering buying a temporary extension!</li>
            <li>this is long and thick and super natural.</li>
            <li>it will look like two different textures these extensions are super super shiny and fake looking not even dry shampoo helped</li>
            <li>The black fabric also ripped off the clips fast.</li>
            <li>I recommend using two hair extensions in order to make your hair appear super thick.</li>
            <li>This hair is not good for wearing a whole day, and if you have an active job, or are moving around a lot, it will start looking rough very quickly.</li>
            <li>Except for the tiny little girl in the picture having it almost as large as her body...</li>
            <li>highly recommend buying them if they have a dark brown extensions</li>

            <li> Wish me luckk! :)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m considering getting one or two more &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The price for what I bought these for they are way better than what you expect for spending $4.50</li>
            <li> so I am more than please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , these are more of a medium brown.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be so pleased with synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> I like wearing it as a ponytail better than the ones that comes with a comb because those combs make my scalp sore.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be more brown like pictured.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to have curly hair on one of those days when I just really want to.</li>
            <li> I hope this review helped you all in some way :)</li>
            <li> In love.</li>
            <li> I tend to get compliments more often on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was expecting better color match, not what I got.</li>
            <li> Realy prays it fit!</li>
            <li> I love how the hair is so curly</li>
            <li> better even than the ken paves ive been using.  </li>
            <li> wanted more of the curls</li>
            <li> It feels awesome, only problem...</li>
            <li> and it feels better</li>
            <li> You wont be able to get it out.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I will tell all my friends and definatly order more</li>
            <li> looked ok but the hair was falling out</li>
            <li> oh one more thing the hair is a bit shinny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more permanent (human-hair) extensions before -</li>
            <li> the more I tried to de-tangle this product the more of a rat nest I made, I ended up throwing away before I even wore it</li>
            <li> I would just say to buy 2 or more.</li>
            <li> and I love the color.</li>
            <li> Awesome, especially for the money!</li>
            <li> I also put the curl back in mine using a curling iron on medium heat setting and it works great!</li>
            <li> I wish they had more shades.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews, but am so pleased with these clip-on extensions for the price that</li>
            <li> Need to buy me more .</li>
            <li> Bought these extensions for prom night- wore my hair in a low side ponytail and it blended with my hair color and style perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered .</li>
            <li> my frinds love it.</li>
            <li> so if you want a piece like that, you need to spend more money.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use them</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive these-</li>
            <li> so i decided to reorder because i loved the first pair.</li>
            <li> This is gorgeous and feels like real hair, my daughters were both excited as heck to get this, and I love it!</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s pretty good quality</li>
            <li> these are definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> I know she&#x27;s gonna like this - it matches her hairs original color and style!</li>
            <li> Happy with my new extension.</li>
            <li> and I tried combing it out and.its only.worse other than that service was okay not the greatest</li>
            <li> I bought a wide hand band from the dollar store and it works great!</li>
            <li> The clips hold good, and it looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> The hair is very nice, and soft.</li>
            <li> It made my hair look like I had a lighter color underneath ombre sooo cool!</li>
            <li> It does tend to tangle easily</li>
            <li> but  easy to use</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get over how easily it tangles and</li>
            <li> Easy to clip into hair.  </li>
            <li> It came with in 3 weeks, it got tangle easily,  one of the clips didn&#x27;t even work,</li>
            <li> Easy to use and care for.  </li>
            <li> Tangles easy, does not go all the way around head.</li>
            <li> and they get so tangled so easily</li>
            <li> It does knot easy</li>
            <li> These were nice and full but tangles up so quickly.</li>
            <li> Ok so not a bad product, but I doubt it would fool anyone.</li>
            <li> then these will do fine.</li>
            <li> It will take several hours to dry(I leave mine overnight) and it comes out smooth and curled beautifully.</li>
            <li> and it worked fine for that..</li>
            <li> these came very quickly and are fabulous.  </li>
            <li> so I still have a HUGE learning curve.  </li>
            <li> It was so cheap and shiny that i wore it for halloween then threw it away.</li>
            <li> If you have thicker hair you may want to consider buying two, overall a great product if these are the things you are looking for in extentions.</li>
            <li> AND you get free shipping.</li>
            <li> I ordered light brown</li>
            <li> Though it is not as light as the picture shown for the product, it does have some realism to the medium brown.</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> hair is short between shoulders and neck and it didn&#x27;t look great.</li>
            <li> It is also comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> , that was no surprise, but they look, feel, and act like cheap doll hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t go all the way around her head - maybe an inch short on either side, but it still looked great.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy wearing this extension.</li>
            <li> Once they are snapped in they won&#x27;t come out, and the clips are comfortable too.</li>
            <li> But worth the price for sure.</li>
            <li> Enjoy ,ladies.</li>
            <li> the clips are comfortable.</li>
            <li> Cheap and clips fell off.</li>
            <li> definitely a great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old loved it.  </li>
            <li> I can say they are very persistent about helping you and making sure you are satisfied.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!  </li>
            <li> , I actually think because they aren&#x27;t super straight and &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; looking they work best.</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> All the same, I love it and already thinking of purchasing more!</li>
            <li> This is is a great value if you just want to had some density or length to your already long hair.</li>
            <li> but it was ok the first time you wear it</li>
            <li> Worth what you pay!</li>
            <li> its exactly what you see on the picture but a bit long in the head band area,  so measuring the circumference of your head would be a good idea to make sure that it does not run over the ear area and avoid becoming noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have many synthetic hair pieces that are of far better quality than this.</li>
            <li> Loved it, although the color was much darker in real</li>
            <li> A little too shiny but very good otherwise.</li>
            <li> Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future !</li>
            <li> and they were just so cheap but look real on my hair!!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get these</li>
            <li> It is true to the length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a more real hair look</li>
            <li> However, within probably 3 hours of clipping this into my hair, and styling it, it began to mat up underneath, the curls started to frizz, and the nice soft texture was lost.</li>
            <li> Brown color was true to picture.  </li>
            <li> I rinsed it with cool water and some conditioner</li>
            <li> 3 stars though because the overall quality is good.</li>
            <li> Overall it was good</li>
            <li> not bad.  </li>
            <li> They knotted up really quick.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim....not expecting it to be of super quality</li>
            <li> It gets tangle quick is like the wigs people use for halloween ...</li>
            <li> They arrived remarkably quickly, considering the distance traveled.  </li>
            <li> But they are very silky smooth and very curly. :)</li>
            <li> they took light heat pretty well.</li>
            <li> Really good quality and really long!</li>
            <li> Good quality but much darker than pics, more of a dark brown.</li>
            <li> although I cut about an inch off to make it appear more natural-</li>
            <li> but I cut it to make it look more natural.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth the money</li>
            <li> It was worth what it cost, but not anymore than that.</li>
            <li> Actually looked nice braided into hair, fun to play with, don&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re wanting &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it will look more natural.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is good quality product.</li>
            <li> I think it is very real looking - looks like healthy, natural hair.</li>
            <li> and it turned it a rats nest right away.</li>
            <li> right looks like made for child&#x27;s size head</li>
            <li> Get what u pay for right?</li>
            <li> They were thick and beautiful but a red/orange color..</li>
            <li> It just looks like I was born with thick beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> It is darker than I anticipated, very dark brown rather than the light brown as advertised, but it is still nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is vary soft easy to put in and also matches my hair well</li>
            <li> The light brown hair extensions match my hair and look very natural.</li>
            <li> I bought it in a dark brown because that is my natural hair color and it blends in perfectly with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever time buying extensions</li>
            <li> I really like these extensions!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty damn</li>
            <li> The color was exactly what i thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> I bought two and never got them even a couple weeks after the latest delivery date of in mid February 2014, even though I had ordered them in December 2013.</li>
            <li> I recommend this most definitely!!!</li>
            <li> If it was longer, thicker,and didn&#x27;t tangle after the first 30 minutes I would give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t get them hot with a curling iron or anything they melt</li>
            <li> It is only one piece so if you have shoulder length hair and don&#x27;t pin the sides up you will be able to tell its a piece.</li>
            <li> i only were it until i can get somthing better</li>
            <li> the colour isnt exactly as the picture though but for the price ..</li>
            <li> and after i took it out the clip in was really ratty!</li>
            <li> Could be that I&#x27;m just not used to that much hair!</li>
            <li> Hair extension was exactly like it was described.</li>
            <li> These were the first extensions I&#x27;ve ever ordered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li> If you are a first timer or not .GO</li>
            <li> My first time using clip in hair extensions.</li>
            <li> I like the look and color, but after the first two times wearing it, it became horridly matted.  </li>
            <li> but I used heat on them and burnt them, but they were the exact color of my hair</li>
            <li> First time getting extensions</li>
            <li> It made the extensions a little more easy to handle.</li>
            <li> But it seems to be more of a light brown slightly greyed looking compared to my hair.</li>
            <li> i loved it....not too thin not too shiny ...can easily blend with my hair ...</li>
            <li> They are breath taking , the hair looks very real eventhough it is not natural hair looks very cute and soft .</li>
            <li> This item looks very nice, is thick and soft-feeling.</li>
            <li> Little darker than pictured but great for young girls</li>
            <li> /&gt;Contrary to belief synthetic extensions can last a good while IF you know how to properly care for them.</li>
            <li> Very much like real hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long, beautiful, &amp; full set - however I opted to buy a second set to augment the short length of my hair (at shoulder) &amp; create a fuller look, having my hair colored to match the extensions.</li>
            <li> But to try to pass off as your own, or at least similar to your own hair, no way.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so beautiful, thick and long and fit well.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasure to buy from Vktech.üòÄ</li>
            <li> very thick and good quality,  very pretty brown just like the picture, the model must be like 6 years old because it isn&#x27;t that big, but still nice and does the job</li>
            <li> but it does tangle alot after the first use, and kind of heavy,</li>
            <li> Makes it look super full and long.  </li>
            <li> And it looked real.</li>
            <li> im wearing a hat or going out at night as to not show how discolored from my real hair it is</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t blend or even pass it off as remotely real hair.</li>
            <li> They are very silky but do not try using heat on them.</li>
            <li> When you do they feel very matted but what do you expect for synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> –≤ad qœÖalŒπ—Çy and looƒ∏—ï very “ìaƒ∏e.</li>
            <li> Very affordable .</li>
            <li> So much better than expected for the price</li>
            <li> It looks real already, but I am going to get another one and layer it with the existing one I got.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different from what i accepted it was going to be light for a synthetic one hair piece</li>
            <li> The cost is cheaper and reasonable.  </li>
            <li> and it looks and feels real</li>
            <li> In the picture the piece is a whole shade lighter than what they send you.</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t really the problem tho bc it can look  like an under shadow.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like how it tangles after 30 mins.</li>
            <li> But i really like the way it looks.</li>
            <li> and I must say, they&#x27;re really crappy.</li>
            <li> Arrived ina very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Very happy&lt;</li>
            <li> 3 months was more than i expected with synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Looks so real on also.</li>
            <li> the color is very off.</li>
            <li> it is much darker.</li>
            <li> If I had bought a shorter length set than 1 would be enough for a smooth look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I believed it would look real??</li>
            <li> Ordered and got them in a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li> I think this would be GREAT for someone with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I know a second one would make it much fuller and give it a more natural look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that good with them to say the least.</li>
            <li> Just wow !!!</li>
            <li> i thought it was very pretty , but to dark for my hair even thogh i ordered it in light brown .</li>
            <li> However, it is extremely to shiny to look natural in any way &amp; it tangles very easy.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it&#x27;d just go right over my head, exactly like in the picture, but it was too short.</li>
            <li> but I sprayed some dry shampoo in it and smells fine now.  </li>
            <li> The picture makes it look super thick, and it is not like that, it is, however, a nice synthetic hair peice well-made and secure little clips.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn these a few times already and they haven&#x27;t gotten really frizzy like most synthetic extensions have.</li>
            <li> and  looks decent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Super thin, but extremely easy to use!</li>
            <li> I never dreamed it was so nice and actually had to cut in due to the style I was going for.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a little more fullness and additional layers</li>
            <li> The product was as described, shipping could of been a little better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product but WOW was i surprized.</li>
            <li> Lol the hair is fake is like a Barbie hair..</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s worth for what the price is $7-8.</li>
            <li> The clip on part didn&#x27;t have enough length to go completely around the top of my head like a plastic head band -- it only covered almost an inch or so before my ears.</li>
            <li> One broken comb on the hair, otherwise it is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to accommodate the thickness -- the picture did not accurately portray the curls at all.</li>
            <li> Then I put the clips in evenly right in the middle, and then pulled all of it into a pony tail.</li>
            <li> A little heavy but looks great</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend anyone buying this Mabie if you already have long hair and your hair mixes with the extensions and make it look more natural but short hair</li>
            <li> I live in jersey .</li>
            <li> I thought It be a little more different like a hailr clip which would be much easier.</li>
            <li> as an avid extension user I am estatic to say I will no longer be purchasing human hair that is anywhere from $60-$200; I will be reordering this hair again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> the color ,the curls all exactly the same.</li>
            <li> soooo surprised!</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown which came as what looks light brown.</li>
            <li> its a little darker than the photo but can blend easily.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve worn it a few times as a ponytail added to my own hair that is fairly long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very thick.</li>
            <li> The color is true to the picture, despite what other reviews say.</li>
            <li> Very thick and nice.  </li>
            <li> But if you cut it a little shorter I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll only need one.</li>
            <li> when I opened them I was incredibly surprised by the length and weight.</li>
            <li> and when I curled my natural hair and then clipped these in...</li>
            <li> It is something that would be okay to wear for very brief periods of time, such as to an outing lasting only a couple of hours, where you are not sweating, and are sitting still.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> but so does natural hair</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SOFT &amp; NATURAL</li>
            <li> I can buy one of these a month for an entire year and still not even have close to the amount I would have invested if I bought real ones.  </li>
            <li> I wore them outside and the wind tangles them up too much</li>
            <li> it was getting all over the place , i gave it to my 6 year old niece who loves dressing up</li>
            <li> No way to make that look natural like the picture.</li>
            <li> suggest maybe buying two of these, so then it can go completely around your head</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;ll look a bit fuller and thicker -- instead of completely bald underneath where the band goes.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I did to make it look natural, was</li>
            <li> It is long, and the wave/curls are pretty.</li>
            <li> is a bigger ponytail than my real hair makes.</li>
            <li> Pretty but too long for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine thinking it would at least be ok.</li>
            <li> Glad it was only $4... Was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> hope it last more then a few uses.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful on, but a little thin.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it does tangle a little bit, but if you take care of the hair and be patient with it, it&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
            <li> to small to fit head</li>
            <li> but it came out to be heavy and really full of hair</li>
            <li> Overall a very decent product for a low price!</li>
            <li> They are more of a choclate brown, lighter than black but still dark.</li>
            <li> The only issue i had was that the clips on the end were sewn too far away from the edges</li>
            <li> They are soft and look just like the picture would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> it feels kind of fake.</li>
            <li> Theyre not too thin or anything, but I ended up being able to straighten them.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I highly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s considering buying a temporary extension!</li>
            <li> this is long and thick and super natural.</li>
            <li> it will look like two different textures these extensions are super super shiny and fake looking not even dry shampoo helped</li>
            <li> The black fabric also ripped off the clips fast.</li>
            <li> I recommend using two hair extensions in order to make your hair appear super thick.</li>
            <li> This hair is not good for wearing a whole day, and if you have an active job, or are moving around a lot, it will start looking rough very quickly.</li>
            <li> Except for the tiny little girl in the picture having it almost as large as her body...</li>
            <li> highly recommend buying them if they have a dark brown extensions</li>
            <li> Also, other reviews are saying that you should purchase two because it&#x27;s not very thick.</li>
            <li> Putting it around the bottom of my hair, and in the middle (I tried quite a few ways), like normal extensions go (I actually have no idea how extensions work</li>
            <li> My hair covered where the clips went in, and because the wig was the same color as my hair, it looked like I had an extra long pony</li>
            <li> Pretty thick, I definitely didn&#x27;t have to buy two.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I was super not happy.</li>
            <li> Also I after wearing several times, when it starts to dull all you have to do is wash it out with shampoo (no conditioner) comb out gently and hang to dry.</li>
            <li> The other item I ordered in the flax yellow was actually auburn.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty, but it&#x27;s a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Took to long to get here.</li>
            <li> I purchased the long curl wafy clip-on hair extension.</li>
            <li> TOOK TOO LONG FOR DELIVERY.&lt;br /&gt;HOPING</li>
            <li> I wanna know how long these are.</li>
            <li> the color is almost orange and the hair has a strange smell</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the hair extensions to be so long.</li>
            <li> Got here 2 weeks earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> thought I would like long hair, but have decided to go with a pixie cut for the summer, will give this to someone else.</li>
            <li> It looked just like my hair, the same color, and people thought that I had grown my hair out over night (they were extremely confused at first, which was funny).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got two, but my hair is thick and I really like volume</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair and the extension by itself</li>
            <li> When I received the clip-on extension it was very long</li>
            <li> Very long so you can cut them.</li>
            <li> This is very long</li>
            <li> If you dont mess with the tangles, it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Way too thin, but pretty</li>
            <li> , this is my first try), made it look silly because my hair is too short</li>
            <li> And is super fake a plastic looking.</li>
            <li> After one day of wearing, it was a little tangled (and can&#x27;t really be brushed), but my daughter didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is it is a little bit heavy, I can only stand about 4 hours because of the weight.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I took the hair apart and it was so big and heavy that my impression was \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li> NOT AS EXPECTED , DOLLS HAIR&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to b so careful with the hair.</li>
            <li> The ends are so tangled and rough.</li>
            <li> I say don&#x27;t buy, total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real hair</li>
            <li> but I used a wide toothed comb</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not what I expected at all</li>
            <li> Arrived way before expected.</li>
            <li> Blend it with your hair carefully</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected at all the hair was so tangle</li>
            <li> Tangles a lot but trimming it and a wide tooth comp will fix that.  </li>
            <li> Guess it wasnt a total waste cause</li>
            <li> Ill give it a 3 star right now</li>
            <li> Looked very real and the color wasn&#x27;t fake.</li>
            <li> but more than disappointed-</li>
            <li> Its only gd for a one time wear :/</li>
            <li> it took forever for me to get it in , i wanted this because i had to cut my hair due, i started missing my long hair</li>
            <li> so I ordered this hair in desperate need to replace my human hair extensions but could not afford the real deal at the time</li>
            <li> Right once I brushed it, the hair got all tangled and ugly looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than i expected</li>
            <li> the quality is average ...</li>
            <li> but you can wear it down.</li>
            <li> It works with my hair down, in a ponytail or braid, or in a bun.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if I would use it with my hair down unless my hair was longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Disappointed again beacuse sheds alto and knotty really easy</li>
            <li> The hair look very unnatural and is very thin.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews saying they get messy</li>
            <li> They can be made to look less synthetic with hairspray.</li>
            <li> Slightly darker than advertised.</li>
            <li> A tangled mess.</li>
            <li> NOT LIGHT BROWN DARK AND REDDISH.</li>
            <li> Dont mess with the tangles.</li>
            <li> but they ended up being gross and not good</li>
            <li> It was also very heavy and made my hairline sore, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected from every extension?</li>
            <li> I was a little dissapointed when i opened this one because its kinda purple tinted and looks as if someone had tried to crimp it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I have been devastated about the sudden loss of my long hair!</li>
            <li> Needs to be a little longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> But after a few hours it started to tangle really badly and looked super messy..</li>
            <li> I have a few different ones and this one was easily the worst...</li>
            <li> This made it look very thin and very unnatural looking -- at least when I wore it with my hair down.</li>
            <li> this synthetic hair is very thick and this is coming from an Italian girl with a ton of hair.</li>
            <li> no, I think I wasted my money\\&quot;</li>
            <li> how messy it looks after a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li> and it was realy heavy</li>
            <li> Waste of $$$$ doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> (mine don&#x27;t get oily because I wash my hair everyday).  </li>
            <li> and there so heavy</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Was NOT pleased with how fast it lost the curl and now that the ends are all &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; and like a big knot. :(</li>
            <li> too dark and to silky!!</li>
            <li> Not sure why I brought this...</li>
            <li> I bought extensions in the past</li>
            <li> not sure if you can dye it...</li>
            <li> This is too wide for my (average) size head, it comes all the way to my temples and looks weird.  </li>
            <li> its sad to see that i only wore it once</li>
            <li> I am planning on braiding it, and I&#x27;m not sure how it will hold up.</li>
            <li> Still havent revieved them, but i think im just being VERY impatient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so bad though, o received mine earlier than expected</li>
            <li> Real long and thick, but dont take flash pictures.!!</li>
            <li> Also girl in picture is really small and the hair is not quite as thick as it is in the picture</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to maintain.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected  looks to fake can&#x27;t curl either.</li>
            <li> the product is now three months late.</li>
            <li> Sucks it wont stay in hir has like clip things that do not work</li>
            <li> this hair extention seriously sucks, I bought two of them, I can&#x27;t blend them I into my hair and they get tangled within like 3 seconds of you having them.</li>
            <li> They are not as thick as the picture shown.</li>
            <li> It is thick</li>
            <li> Well, I have moderately thick hair</li>
            <li> Not as thick as shown in picture.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> but I never ended up wearing them because they looked fake and not full at all.</li>
            <li> This was not at all what I was expecting got it for my daughter the color the way it was made how to use it their is not 1 good thing</li>
            <li> This hair looks just like the hair from a Barbie doll in texture &amp; sheen &amp; it is quite thin, not like the picture in which it looks thick &amp; glossy.</li>
            <li> This is a very thin and messy hair.</li>
            <li> Why not perfect?, came in an small envelope</li>
            <li> ‚Ä¶ I made that dumb mistake</li>
            <li> Wish I could have my money back :(</li>
            <li> Its just dumb.</li>
            <li> SUPER fake and terrible looking.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this</li>
            <li> The clip in is thin and over glossy.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> Another issue is the length and poor quality.</li>
            <li> A bit thin, if you want lots of volume</li>
            <li> Too thin.</li>
            <li> So a few months ago a horrible stylist messed up my hair so bad that I had to have it redone and cut above my shoulders!</li>
            <li> no one can tell its fake.  </li>
            <li> Fake hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they do not provide that.</li>
            <li> You can just tell they&#x27;re fake.</li>
            <li> SORRY....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely obsessed with this</li>
            <li> Wrong color</li>
            <li> Fake cause</li>
            <li> falls in a weird angle...</li>
            <li> anyways, this was just too fake for me, my daughter plays with it on her dolls.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels fake.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, wrong color and looks to fake.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> It was very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Feels way to fake and extreamly impossible to brush.</li>
            <li> Around the end of those 3 months they started looking a little nasty.</li>
            <li> —Çangle—ï lŒπƒ∏e crazy.</li>
            <li> After I cutting it, I used hair rollers to roll it and it curled, but you do not have to roll it every day because the curls will stay.</li>
            <li> And wearing them after that just made it impossible to detangle.</li>
            <li> They are impossible to blend into my hair.</li>
            <li> BAD</li>
            <li> but I try it on and did not look that bad.</li>
            <li> whatever they used to make the extensions was bad</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Very artificial looking.</li>
            <li> Crap but wasn&#x27;t a lot of money</li>
            <li> I hate it</li>
            <li> I hate them they were not what the picture showed‚Ä¶</li>
            <li> So I opened and a very bad smell came out.</li>
            <li> It looked awful on me.</li>
            <li> Hate it!!!!</li>
            <li> Probably the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> It was A pain in the butt to get in my hair, it looked horrible after an hour and it wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair...</li>
            <li> they are terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, price, and shipping!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this I&#x27;ve order this before like a year ago. And it looked real. Looks nothing like the picture. It has a burgundy red tint brown. And is super fake a plastic looking.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I brought this...</li>
            <li> Ive used this extention before and loved it. I lost them in a move so i decided to reorder because i loved the first pair. I was a little dissapointed when i opened this one because its kinda purple tinted and looks as if someone had tried to crimp it. Its still wearable, but more of if im wearing a hat or going out at night as to not show how discolored from my real hair it is</li>
            <li> ....Not the same physical color in photo .... need to put the actual colors .... the quality is average ... wait for better quality ....</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this, but sadly with the way my hair is layered I have to buy more than one, but that&#x27;s my own fault. This is my first ever time buying extensions and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really good quality and really long! to make it blend well with my hair I had to wear 2 of these. But if you cut it a little shorter I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll only need one. It does tend to tangle easily so you need to take good care of them. For 4.99 I wouldn&#x27;t complain, these usually last me 2 months before they start getting too tangled</li>
            <li> pretty good for the price!</li>
            <li> Disappointed again beacuse sheds alto and knotty really easy</li>
            <li> Love it matches my hair perfectly. Would be 5 stars but the clips don&#x27;t stay in and rip my hair out</li>
            <li> I really like these extensions! The color was nice and the clips hold to my hair well; it never slips.  I wanted a little more fullness and additional layers so I bought another one and they look really nice in my hair- no one can tell its fake.  The only drawback is it is a little bit heavy, I can only stand about 4 hours because of the weight. Overall a very decent product for a low price!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these they arrived earlier then planned and I have short hair it matched great a nd the length is perfect I will definitely buy from them again</li>
            <li> A nice hair piece. Very much like real hair</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these on the 28th of nov. Still havent revieved them, but i think im just being VERY impatient. I am very excited to get them and try em outt. !! Ill give it a 3 star right now cause i have a good feeling about them! Will change them to a 5 star after i recieve them &amp; if i absolutley love them! Wish me luckk! :)</li>
            <li> The picture is deceptive!! The clip in is thin and over glossy. Can&#x27;t blend or even pass it off as remotely real hair. Glad it was only $4... Was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was so cheap and shiny that i wore it for halloween then threw it away.</li>
            <li> I rate it a 5 for price &amp; softness. However, it is extremely to shiny to look natural in any way &amp; it tangles very easy. It can not be heated for any reason to restyle or anything it will get fried. So you get what you pay for in this case. Fake hair</li>
            <li> One broken comb on the hair, otherwise it is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Super thin, but extremely easy to use! I got it to use as a side ponytail extension and works great for that but not for adding length. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
            <li> Matches my hair almost perfectly! I got two, but my hair is thick and I really like volume so I&#x27;m considering getting one or two more &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Pretty thick, I definitely didn&#x27;t have to buy two. They can be made to look less synthetic with hairspray.</li>
            <li> I just got these extentions in the mail today and they are not the same color as the picture. They are more of a choclate brown, lighter than black but still dark. If you have medium-darker hair these are good for you. They are very silky but do not try using heat on them. When you do they feel very matted but what do you expect for synthetic hair. If you have thicker hair you may want to consider buying two, overall a great product if these are the things you are looking for in extentions.</li>
            <li> Took to long to get here. But I did get it. It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected  looks to fake can&#x27;t curl either.</li>
            <li> I bought two.. I had a hair cut and the bitch butchered my hair!! I bought a wide hand band from the dollar store and it works great! Thinking about buying another one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than i expected but it LOVEEEEEEE IT anyways.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m giving this product a four star rating.&lt;br /&gt;This is from a couple different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD ;)&lt;br /&gt;1. The price for what I bought these for they are way better than what you expect for spending $4.50 AND you get free shipping. So there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The hair is very nice, and soft. But be reminded it is SYNTHETIC so you will have stays and stragglers so don&#x27;t try and brush them out with your fingers. Overall though the quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. They arrived today which is about a week ahead of schedule so I am more than please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It is true to the length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD (but not so bad)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I ordered light brown, these are more of a medium brown. Though it is not as light as the picture shown for the product, it does have some realism to the medium brown. If you look at the up close shot of the hair in my attached pictures, they have added lighter strands of hair so it does give it a bit of dimension&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. They are not as thick as the picture shown. I have ordered two of these and I would have to say that if you want the amount of hair shown in the products picture where it seems she is only holding up one extension then you need two to have that thicker effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. They do not provide a tracking number for your package. I am one to like to know when and where the things I buy are. Unfortunately they do not provide that. It&#x27;s not so bad though, o received mine earlier than expected so I&#x27;m pretty damn satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a decent product for the price. If your looking for extensions for just an occasion and don&#x27;t mind spending 9$ then these will do fine. And I say 9$ because trust me you need two of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to belief synthetic extensions can last a good while IF you know how to properly care for them. You can&#x27;t just go at them with a brush or your fingers, but they can last if you know how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was an informative review &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;AshPanda outüëç</li>

            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite the color the description said but is workable</li>
            <li> I bought two of these. The color was exactly what i thought it was going to be. The only issue i had was that the clips on the end were sewn too far away from the edges so they stuck out. i had to remove and re-sew them on. I&#x27;ve worn these a few times already and they haven&#x27;t gotten really frizzy like most synthetic extensions have.</li>
            <li> they were not this color but they were still good to use.</li>
            <li> They knotted up really quick.</li>
            <li> Cheap. Shiny. A tangled mess. Won&#x27;t be ordering again. Very poor quality. I have many synthetic hair pieces that are of far better quality than this.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get these but the shipping took forever!!!!!!!!!!! Like three weeks. I was super not happy. And there was no way i could track it. And when I opened my package you can just tell that its kinda like wig hair instead of a more real hair look you can straighten the curls out I did. It made the extensions a little more easy to handle. But it doesn&#x27;t mattch my hair at all. You can just tell they&#x27;re fake. Not happy with this purchase at all. Do not buy I promise you&#x27;ll be dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I live in jersey . Not a thing to dislike about this product . Very affordable . Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future ! üòçüí≥ brown looks good with my eye color üëç</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy is beauty and match perfectly with my hair, soft and come very early that I can expect... I recommend this extensions.... great price great extensions!</li>
            <li> Why not perfect?, came in an small envelope so I did not know what I was receiving in the mail. So I opened and a very bad smell came out. Like plastic, synthetic product. I took the hair apart and it was so big and heavy that my impression was \\&quot;oh no, I think I wasted my money\\&quot; lol, but I try it on and did not look that bad. The color is too shiny, didn&#x27;t match my hair color because of the shiny parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short between shoulders and neck and it didn&#x27;t look great. I put it away until my hair grow longer so I can play with the extension. Hopefully some day I can use it.</li>
            <li> I was promised another set of extensions- I bought two and never got them even a couple weeks after the latest delivery date of in mid February 2014, even though I had ordered them in December 2013. I was promised a replacement set and never got that set either- the product is now three months late. I asked for a refund but received no response. I was very excited to receive these- but more than disappointed- I have been ripped off.</li>
            <li> So much better than expected for the price</li>
            <li> A little heavy but looks great</li>
            <li> So a few months ago a horrible stylist messed up my hair so bad that I had to have it redone and cut above my shoulders! Needless to say I have been devastated about the sudden loss of my long hair! I figured for the price I would give this extension a try and I love it, but I would buy two!! It is beautiful on, but a little thin. I know a second one would make it much fuller and give it a more natural look. It looks real already, but I am going to get another one and layer it with the existing one I got.</li>
            <li> I wore the extensions for a concert. The hair started falling out. And the curls came undone. The hair look very unnatural and is very thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different from what i accepted it was going to be light for a synthetic one hair piece but it came out to be heavy and really full of hair I loved it but of course it tangles alot but when washing it it&#x27;ll go away.</li>
            <li> Crap but wasn&#x27;t a lot of money so what do u expect...</li>
            <li> so I ordered this hair in desperate need to replace my human hair extensions but could not afford the real deal at the time, I figured this would do until then. when I opened them I was incredibly surprised by the length and weight. this synthetic hair is very thick and this is coming from an Italian girl with a ton of hair. although I cut about an inch off to make it appear more natural- one set it all you need! matched my hair color perfectly and when I curled my natural hair and then clipped these in... I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased. as an avid extension user I am estatic to say I will no longer be purchasing human hair that is anywhere from $60-$200; I will be reordering this hair again &amp; again. I never thought I would be so pleased with synthetic hair. it looks amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the long curl wafy clip-on hair extension. I like it because the only thing I have to do is snap and blend it into my hair. I wear it as a ponytail but you can wear it down. When I received the clip-on extension it was very long but I cut it to make it look more natural. After I cutting it, I used hair rollers to roll it and it curled, but you do not have to roll it every day because the curls will stay. It is thick but if you want it thicker you can buy two of these extensions and clip it into your hair. I bought it in a dark brown because that is my natural hair color and it blends in perfectly with my natural hair. I like wearing it as a ponytail better than the ones that comes with a comb because those combs make my scalp sore.  This does not make my scalp sore and by the way I can not feel it in when I am wearing it and I can leave it on without any harm.  The cost is cheaper and reasonable.  I like my clip-on hair exentsion.</li>
            <li> SORRY.... NOT AS EXPECTED , DOLLS HAIR&lt;br /&gt;TANGLED , WILL NOT RE ORDER . WILL KEEP CLIPS...TOOK TOO LONG FOR DELIVERY.&lt;br /&gt;HOPING FOR A NICE CLIP ON EXTENSION&lt;br /&gt;COLOR NOT LIGHT BROWN DARK AND REDDISH.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be more brown like pictured. But it seems to be more of a light brown slightly greyed looking compared to my hair. but overall i like it alot and it looks and feels real</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product but WOW was i surprized. I went and bought 2 more! It is soft, the clips were perfectly aligned and snapped into place. I recommend this most definitely!!!</li>
            <li> I thought It be a little more different like a hailr clip which would be much easier. I have to use bobby pins to keep it in place thought.</li>
            <li> These were nice and full but tangles up so quickly.</li>
            <li> If it was longer, thicker,and didn&#x27;t tangle after the first 30 minutes I would give it a 5 star. In the picture the piece is a whole shade lighter than what they send you.That isn&#x27;t really the problem tho bc it can look  like an under shadow. I really don&#x27;t like how it tangles after 30 mins. You have to b so careful with the hair. Another issue is the length and poor quality. Needs to be a little longer and thicker. The ends are so tangled and rough. Its only gd for a one time wear :/ buy at your own risk is all I have to say.</li>
            <li> I have shot wavy hair that I straighten out a lot. This is a great way to have curly hair on one of those days when I just really want to.</li>
            <li> I wanna know how long these are. All you give in the description is the 25cmwidth and not length. Anyone know??????!</li>
            <li> I love this hair extension! For the price, it&#x27;s really great. The color is true to the picture, despite what other reviews say. Also, other reviews are saying that you should purchase two because it&#x27;s not very thick. Well, I have moderately thick hair and I think this extension looks great my hair just by using one! The only downfall is that it does tangle a little bit, but if you take care of the hair and be patient with it, it&#x27;ll be just fine. The texture is also really nice! The only really big problem I have is that when I got the package, it was ripped open to the point where I could see the hair extension. But other than that, I highly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s considering buying a temporary extension! I hope this review helped you all in some way :)</li>
            <li> In love. Will buy again. I dont like that i cant straighten it. But i really like the way it looks.</li>
            <li> it feels kind of fake. but  easy to use and  looks decent. hope it last more then a few uses.</li>
            <li> Not as thick as shown in picture. Maybe two of those might create the thickness shown in picture. Looks great though.</li>
            <li> This is a lot fuller than any I have seen. I really like this!</li>
            <li> This is gorgeous and feels like real hair, my daughters were both excited as heck to get this, and I love it!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s Great for synthetic and they ship very quickly. I tend to get compliments more often on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am growing out my hair &amp; have been purchasing pieces on &amp; off from Sally Beauty &amp; a wig shop at the mall. This hair looks just like the hair from a Barbie doll in texture &amp; sheen &amp; it is quite thin, not like the picture in which it looks thick &amp; glossy. If you need a piece for a costume party or an acting gig where the audience won&#x27;t be close by this will probably work for you. But to try to pass off as your own, or at least similar to your own hair, no way.</li>
            <li> I finally got these yesterday and I must say, they&#x27;re really crappy. They started getting frizzy and tangled twenty minutes aafter wearing them. Theyre not too thin or anything, but I ended up being able to straighten them. And wearing them after that just made it impossible to detangle.</li>
            <li> You can wash and condition and set with spongy curlers while still damp. It will take several hours to dry(I leave mine overnight) and it comes out smooth and curled beautifully.</li>
            <li> This looked super cute when I wore it the first time, I loved it!! But after a few hours it started to tangle really badly and looked super messy.. I have a few different ones and this one was easily the worst... I feel like it&#x27;s pretty good quality and it looks nice.. I just can&#x27;t get over how easily it tangles and how messy it looks after a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li> I say don&#x27;t buy, total waste of money. I was expecting better color match, not what I got. I repeat, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely obsessed with this I even ordered to a second one! it&#x27;s totally worth the money and they were just so cheap but look real on my hair!! just don&#x27;t get them hot with a curling iron or anything they melt‚Ä¶ I made that dumb mistake</li>
            <li> This is just what you see. Am yet to try this. Realy prays it fit! All the same, I love it and already thinking of purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I like the color a lot. The tip is lighter and I like it. It&#x27;s not real hair so it gets tangle and it&#x27;s hard to maintain. Overall it&#x27;s worth for what the price is $7-8.</li>
            <li> my daughter wanted it for a gimmick and it worked fine for that..</li>
            <li> Wrong color I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> This is is a great value if you just want to had some density or length to your already long hair. It is only one piece so if you have shoulder length hair and don&#x27;t pin the sides up you will be able to tell its a piece. Also the curl was perfect. It does come from China so it will take some time to get to you if your in the states.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful wig and the color is fantastic. I think it is very real looking - looks like healthy, natural hair.</li>
            <li> I love how the hair is so curly and it adds a perfect length to your hair. Their is 5 clips to clip it in and its just perfect! Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better! P.s. You can even wash it! (:</li>
            <li> best extensions ive used.  better even than the ken paves ive been using.  when its in you can pony tale it, pig tale it, everything.... and it stays in!</li>
            <li> This item looks very nice, is thick and soft-feeling. It is also comfortable to wear. However, within probably 3 hours of clipping this into my hair, and styling it, it began to mat up underneath, the curls started to frizz, and the nice soft texture was lost. It is something that would be okay to wear for very brief periods of time, such as to an outing lasting only a couple of hours, where you are not sweating, and are sitting still. This hair is not good for wearing a whole day, and if you have an active job, or are moving around a lot, it will start looking rough very quickly. It was worth what it cost, but not anymore than that.</li>
            <li> Yes, I knew they were synthetic, that was no surprise, but they look, feel, and act like cheap doll hair. They are impossible to blend into my hair.</li>
            <li> The color was way darker that what it said it was going to be. It looked awful on me. I gave it to my Daughter-in-law and it matched her hair and looks great.</li>
            <li> still watting for it to come in</li>
            <li> im disapointed. i still were it somtimes but im deff sticking to human hair. and it was realy heavy i felt uncompftble.  i only were it until i can get somthing better</li>
            <li> Good for synthetic.  Don&#x27;t use a brush.</li>
            <li> It is A LOT thinner than in the picture. Does not look like the color shown AT ALL. And It gets tangled A LOT!  I was so disappointed :(</li>
            <li> i thought it was very pretty , but to dark for my hair even thogh i ordered it in light brown . could have been thicker as well . but all in all i think its nice looking .</li>
            <li> My 12 year old loved it.  Brown color was true to picture.  Easy to clip into hair.  After one day of wearing, it was a little tangled (and can&#x27;t really be brushed), but my daughter didn&#x27;t mind. It didn&#x27;t go all the way around her head - maybe an inch short on either side, but it still looked great.</li>
            <li> too dark and to silky!! wanted more of the curls</li>
            <li> I really enjoy wearing this extension. It&#x27;s lightweight, the color was good - except for the reddish tips, which I cutoff. I brush it gently and the curls are good to go! I pull it and my hair back in a barrette, and inside it&#x27;s about fool-proof!</li>
            <li> Good quality extensions. I was pleasantly surprised. They don&#x27;t match my hair as well as I would like, they are darker than they look in the picture. I still make them work. Very long so you can cut them. Once they are snapped in they won&#x27;t come out, and the clips are comfortable too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim....not expecting it to be of super quality but it was surprisingly a very good set of extensions..i loved it....not too thin not too shiny ...can easily blend with my hair ...the colour isnt exactly as the picture though but for the price ..these are definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> Waste of $$$$ doesn&#x27;t. Stay in Ur head. Tangles so easily!!  Hate it!!!!</li>
            <li> These extensions are amazing. I bought extensions in the past but I never ended up wearing them because they looked fake and not full at all. But these are perfect. Super full, hair looks like J.Lo&#x27;s, really wonderful. I wish I could upload pic but I don&#x27;t know how to, anyway just like the girl in the picture. I read other reviews saying they get messy but so does natural hair, I actually think because they aren&#x27;t super straight and &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; looking they work best. I even got a compliment at a party. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for, i wore it once and after i took it out the clip in was really ratty! but it was ok the first time you wear it</li>
            <li> Probably the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought. SUPER fake and terrible looking. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Right once I brushed it, the hair got all tangled and ugly looking.</li>
            <li> this is a great hair extension and the price is wonderful will be ordering more from them easy in easy out and got to me quick</li>
            <li> WOW Just wow !!! this looks so amazing in my daughters hair,feels like real hair, styles like real hair, Beautiful Just Beautiful</li>
            <li> Looks pretty, but it&#x27;s a little heavy. Could be that I&#x27;m just not used to that much hair!</li>
            <li> It came with in 3 weeks, it got tangle easily,  one of the clips didn&#x27;t even work, whatever they used to make the extensions was bad material- basically you pay for what you get in this.</li>
            <li> Arrived ina very timely manner. Hair extension was exactly like it was described. A littlelonger than I needed, cut it and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> It feels awesome, only problem... I dunno how to attach it to my head! Douh!</li>
            <li> i Ordered On The 2nd Got it on The 13th&lt;br /&gt;It Said it was Suppose To come Aug27-Sept15&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m Very happy&lt;br /&gt;When I took it outta the bag it felt Fake cause it is lol&lt;br /&gt;but I rinsed it with cool water and some conditioner and it feels better it&#x27;s a Lil bit lighter then my hair but inna ponytail it looks real good</li>
            <li> SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SOFT &amp; NATURAL</li>
            <li> Love this product! matches great. I get tons of compliments daily.  Easy to use and care for.  Mine last about a month and I wash them once a week (mine don&#x27;t get oily because I wash my hair everyday).  I can buy one of these a month for an entire year and still not even have close to the amount I would have invested if I bought real ones.  Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is vary soft easy to put in and also matches my hair well</li>
            <li> Good quality but much darker than pics, more of a dark brown.</li>
            <li> These were the first extensions I&#x27;ve ever ordered. I was so happy when i tried it on. The shipping took quite a bit tho. You can not brush them, it will uncurl and get poofy. So if you get any tangle, leave it alone. You wont be able to get it out. Dont mess with the tangles. If you dont mess with the tangles, it will last you a long time. It actually lasted me 3 months. Around the end of those 3 months they started looking a little nasty. I wore them outside and the wind tangles them up too much and they were just done. But worth the price for sure. 3 months was more than i expected with synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect color but too wimpy. In order to cover an not been see through you will need to buy 2.  I really like it but I will order another one in order to make it fuller.</li>
            <li> I love it. Good quality and beautiful color.</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail today. So,so surprised!!!!!!!! I never had extentions before so i&#x27;m unaware of what they should be like. However, i have seen them on others. Except for the tiny little girl in the picture having it almost as large as her body...the color ,the curls all exactly the same. It&#x27;s really pretty. Looks so real on also. If you are a first timer or not .GO FOR IT! CAN YOU BEAT THE PRICE?????!!!! I WILL DEFF BUY MORE!  Enjoy ,ladies.</li>
            <li> soooo surprised! this is long and thick and super natural. ive read a lot of ppl say that it was too shiny but it matched my hair perfect. the clips are comfortable. its a little darker than the photo but can blend easily. it does tangle a bit but I used a wide toothed comb and it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out.  I will tell all my friends and definatly order more</li>
            <li> the color is very off. it is much darker. they look nicer online. not sure if you can dye it...</li>
            <li> Loved it, although the color was much darker in real</li>
            <li> it took forever for me to get it in , i wanted this because i had to cut my hair due, i started missing my long hair and i was always wearing hats because i looked like a boy with my hair , when i got it in it looked ok but the hair was falling out it was getting all over the place , i gave it to my 6 year old niece who loves dressing up</li>
            <li> Great price and product!</li>
            <li> I loved it! The color was lighter than the picture. It made my hair look like I had a lighter color underneath ombre sooo cool!</li>
            <li> No way to make that look natural like the picture.</li>
            <li> its exactly what you see on the picture but a bit long in the head band area,  so measuring the circumference of your head would be a good idea to make sure that it does not run over the ear area and avoid becoming noticeable. oh one more thing the hair is a bit shinny but maybe powder might help.</li>
            <li> Tangles easy, does not go all the way around head.</li>
            <li> My first time using clip in hair extensions. I&#x27;ve had more permanent (human-hair) extensions before - I&#x27;m not that good with them to say the least. These clip-in well, they haven&#x27;t slid or moved on me yet &amp; don&#x27;t hurt my head. It&#x27;s a long, beautiful, &amp; full set - however I opted to buy a second set to augment the short length of my hair (at shoulder) &amp; create a fuller look, having my hair colored to match the extensions. If I had bought a shorter length set than 1 would be enough for a smooth look.</li>
            <li> they weren&#x27;t the color I ordered and they get so tangled so easily and there so heavy and the hair falls out very easily I hate it it&#x27;s not what I expected at all</li>
            <li> I like the look and color, but after the first two times wearing it, it became horridly matted.  I had to spend hours washing detangling and it was still messed up.</li>
            <li> This is too wide for my (average) size head, it comes all the way to my temples and looks weird.  I guess it could be because I have thinner hair or my hair falls in a weird angle... either way the piece is very obvious. 3 stars though because the overall quality is good.</li>
            <li> the more I tried to de-tangle this product the more of a rat nest I made, I ended up throwing away before I even wore it</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Feels way to fake and extreamly impossible to brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend anyone buying this Mabie if you already have long hair and your hair mixes with the extensions and make it look more natural but short hair it won&#x27;t look good it will look like two different textures these extensions are super super shiny and fake looking not even dry shampoo helped</li>
            <li> Cheap and clips fell off. Actually looked nice braided into hair, fun to play with, don&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re wanting &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; extensions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I believed it would look real?? anyways, this was just too fake for me, my daughter plays with it on her dolls. No I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I would just say to buy 2 or more. It&#x27;s not very thick.</li>
            <li> The product was as described, shipping could of been a little better. Overall it was good</li>
            <li> Was very happy when it arrived... Loved the look and how easy it was to attach in my hair. Was NOT pleased with how fast it lost the curl and now that the ends are all &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; and like a big knot. :(</li>
            <li> They are breath taking , the hair looks very real eventhough it is not natural hair looks very cute and soft . The color is not the same extrenciones photo so I &#x27;ll have to paint the hair. highly recommend buying them if they have a dark brown extensions</li>
            <li> I had already purchased these before but I used heat on them and burnt them, but they were the exact color of my hair but now I know not to use heat</li>
            <li> Arrived way before expected. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Sucks it wont stay in hir has like clip things that do not work</li>
            <li> Ordered and got them in a reasonable time.  Really similar to the picture but definitely synthentic hair.</li>
            <li> Real long and thick, but dont take flash pictures.!!</li>
            <li> A bit thin, if you want lots of volume it&#x27;s best to get two. Other than that, it is good quality product. Nice and soft with a beautiful bouncy curl.</li>
            <li> Excellent color match. A little too shiny but very good otherwise. Blend it with your hair carefully&lt;br /&gt; and it will look more natural.</li>
            <li> I needed this for a Molly Hooper cosplay. I was hoping that it&#x27;d just go right over my head, exactly like in the picture, but it was too short. The clip on part didn&#x27;t have enough length to go completely around the top of my head like a plastic head band -- it only covered almost an inch or so before my ears. This made it look very thin and very unnatural looking -- at least when I wore it with my hair down. Putting it around the bottom of my hair, and in the middle (I tried quite a few ways), like normal extensions go (I actually have no idea how extensions work, this is my first try), made it look silly because my hair is too short and it just didn&#x27;t work out that way.&lt;br /&gt;When I put it up in a pony tail, it was completely perfect. It looked just like my hair, the same color, and people thought that I had grown my hair out over night (they were extremely confused at first, which was funny).&lt;br /&gt;I suggest maybe buying two of these, so then it can go completely around your head and then it&#x27;ll look a bit fuller and thicker -- instead of completely bald underneath where the band goes.&lt;br /&gt;What I did to make it look natural, was I parted some of my hair towards my face, like they were bangs. Then I put the clips in evenly right in the middle, and then pulled all of it into a pony tail. My hair covered where the clips went in, and because the wig was the same color as my hair, it looked like I had an extra long pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, definitely a great product, especially for the price. Just be sure to accommodate the thickness -- the picture did not accurately portray the curls at all.</li>
            <li> I hate them they were not what the picture showed‚Ä¶</li>
            <li> Hermosa extenciones me gustaron mucho lo que realmente queria</li>
            <li> I can say they are very persistent about helping you and making sure you are satisfied.</li>
            <li> This item was as described. The other item I ordered in the flax yellow was actually auburn.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product.They are soft and look just like the picture would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Very stylish wig for my girlfriend. I know she&#x27;s gonna like this - it matches her hairs original color and style!</li>
            <li> Good for price and I love the color. Got allot of compliments! I just wish it was fuller and last longer but I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> These would have been great it they were actually brown. They were thick and beautiful but a red/orange color.. not what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This was not at all what I was expecting got it for my daughter the color the way it was made how to use it their is not 1 good thing I did like or my daughter liked about it.  I would compare it to the dollar tree hair.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than it looks in the picture and I could not get it untangled. The black fabric also ripped off the clips fast.</li>
            <li> It was A pain in the butt to get in my hair, it looked horrible after an hour and it wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair...</li>
            <li> I needed hair extensions for a play I was in...these came very quickly and are fabulous.  Very thick and nice.  Nice clips that stayed in through all my dancing.  I never dreamed it was so nice and actually had to cut in due to the style I was going for.  Highly recommend!!!!  Looked very real and the color wasn&#x27;t fake.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clip in and gives volume but it does tangle alot after the first use, and kind of heavy,</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look super thick, and it is not like that, it is, however, a nice synthetic hair peice well-made and secure little clips. It is long, and the wave/curls are pretty.</li>
            <li> Lol the hair is fake is like a Barbie hair.. It gets tangle quick is like the wigs people use for halloween ...</li>
            <li> very thick and good quality,  very pretty brown just like the picture, the model must be like 6 years old because it isn&#x27;t that big, but still nice and does the job</li>
            <li> Happy with my new extension. They&#x27;re so beautiful, thick and long and fit well.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasure to buy from Vktech.üòÄ</li>
            <li> Awesome, especially for the money! Also I after wearing several times, when it starts to dull all you have to do is wash it out with shampoo (no conditioner) comb out gently and hang to dry. I also put the curl back in mine using a curling iron on medium heat setting and it works great! You can also put sponge rollers in the end and let sit over night to get the curls back in it! LOVE!</li>
            <li> the color is almost orange and the hair has a strange smell</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the hair extensions to be so long. But they are very silky smooth and very curly. :)</li>
            <li> Honestly when I ordered these I thought they were gonna be really good but they ended up being gross and not good doesn&#x27;t feel like hair at all</li>
            <li> This is a very thin and messy hair. Nothing looks like in the picture</li>
            <li> this hair extention seriously sucks, I bought two of them, I can&#x27;t blend them I into my hair and they get tangled within like 3 seconds of you having them. they are terrible.</li>
            <li> Great. It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful. Made extremely nice. Totally worth the money. I wish they had more shades. I am a cosmologists. I love it. I would recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> Little darker than pictured but great for young girls</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture.  Looks and feels fake.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this product!  I actually bought it twice so it would last longer.  Excellent quality for this price.</li>
            <li> It was horible it matted it got ratty through out the day and it smelled of somthing toxic you get what you pay for good thing I wasn&#x27;t the one who paid</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected at all the hair was so tangle and I tried combing it out and.its only.worse other than that service was okay not the greatest</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, wrong color and looks to fake.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews, but am so pleased with these clip-on extensions for the price that, I had to leave one.  They arrived remarkably quickly, considering the distance traveled.  They are exactly as described, and match my hair perfectly (my boyfriend asked how they knew what color to make them s they matched, to give you an idea of how close the match is).  I am very pleased, and am thinking of ordering a spare now.  They are very secure when fastened to my hair, and I&#x27;m planning to wear them on a motorcycle ride tomorrow.  These are awesome :)</li>
            <li> Got here 2 weeks earlier than expected.  Good.  Ok so not a bad product, but I doubt it would fool anyone. Looks and feels like barbie hair.  First time getting extensions so I still have a HUGE learning curve.  not bad.  Smelled like fish oil but I sprayed some dry shampoo in it and smells fine now.  For the price I am not complaining.  It does knot easy but my hair does too.  Also girl in picture is really small and the hair is not quite as thick as it is in the picture but it is manageable.  I think this would be GREAT for someone with thin hair.</li>
            <li> its sad to see that i only wore it once and it turned it a rats nest right away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful! Definitely going to wear this for homecoming to make my hair thicker!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Need to buy me more . lol</li>
            <li> Bought these extensions for prom night- wore my hair in a low side ponytail and it blended with my hair color and style perfectly. Only downside is that it only lasted for the one night because it began to tear. It was also very heavy and made my hairline sore, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected from every extension? Worth what you pay!</li>
            <li> Very artificial looking. Wish I could have my money back :(</li>
            <li> It looks nothing like the picture however it matches my roots perfectly. Tangles a lot but trimming it and a wide tooth comp will fix that.  This is very long so I cut mine a good 6 inches. I have thick hair so I bought two.</li>
            <li> thought I would like long hair, but have decided to go with a pixie cut for the summer, will give this to someone else.</li>
            <li> to small to fit head right looks like made for child&#x27;s size head</li>
            <li> I liked mine, after a while i straightened them. they took light heat pretty well. i also cut them and they stopped tangling. matched my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product. The price is amazing, even though it is synthetic you can still iron curl or straighten. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like the one pictured.  It was very poor quality.  Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> The light brown hair extensions match my hair and look very natural. When I style my hair, you can not tell I am wearing hair extensions. It just looks like I was born with thick beautiful hair. I recommend using two hair extensions in order to make your hair appear super thick. Shipping took longer then expected, but that is because it was shipped directly from China. Definitely worth the wait. I love them.</li>
            <li> It came sooner than they estimated, and it seems to be of good quality.  I have very thin, fine hair and the extension by itself is a bigger ponytail than my real hair makes. The clips hold good, and it looks like real hair. It is darker than I anticipated, very dark brown rather than the light brown as advertised, but it is still nice. It works with my hair down, in a ponytail or braid, or in a bun. It blends well if you curl your ends before clipping it in. I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> my fianc√© loved it and had to order another one</li>
            <li> I am so very happy with mine.üòÉ I am so glad I ordered .</li>
            <li> Quite a bit darker than I thought it would be. Have to wait to wear it until I color my hair again.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, and it looks great. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t actually used it yet. I bought it for Halloween this year, and will update it after I use it. I compared it to my daughter&#x27;s hair, and it&#x27;s a perfect match. I am planning on braiding it, and I&#x27;m not sure how it will hold up.</li>
            <li> Too thin. Way too thin, but pretty</li>
            <li> Pretty but too long for me.</li>
            <li> I bought for gift. my frinds love it. thank the seller</li>
            <li> Great for price.  Slightly darker than advertised.</li>
            <li> I use this for updos and no one can tell it&#x27;s not my hair. Matches perfect but I don&#x27;t know if I would use it with my hair down unless my hair was longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine thinking it would at least be ok. Get what u pay for right? I ordered dark brown which came as what looks light brown. It doesnt match up. Its just dumb. Guess it wasnt a total waste cause my kids now use it as a toy beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive piece but I&#x27;ve worn it a few times as a ponytail added to my own hair that is fairly long.  Makes it look super full and long.  For the price, it&#x27;s an excellent buy.  It won&#x27;t last long so if you want a piece like that, you need to spend more money.  It matches my hair color perfectly.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying out the clip-on hair extension. I haven&#x27;t been able to use them but I will when I get a chance.</li>
