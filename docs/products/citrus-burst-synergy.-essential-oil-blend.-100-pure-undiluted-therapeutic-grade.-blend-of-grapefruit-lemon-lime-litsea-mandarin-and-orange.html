            <li>This is my favorite scent so far!</li>

            <li>I am very pleased with this Citrus Burst Synergy as well as all of the Plant Therapies Essential Oils that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>, I love it will definitely buy from plant therapy...</li>
            <li>They should call this stuff \\&quot;Lemon Lollipop\\&quot; oil, because that is exactly what it smells like.</li>
            <li>This literally smells exactly like a lemon lollipop or a lemon drop.</li>
            <li>and I love the essential oils.</li>
            <li>So Thanks Again!</li>
            <li>While I was aware of the size of the bottle when I bought it, it didn&#x27;t \\&quot;register&#x27; until I got it.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the kitchen and the smell lingers throughout the first floor.  </li>
            <li>It covered a first floor of a 2700 square foot home.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>The oils smell fantastic and are instantly invigorating.</li>
            <li>Thanks..</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with some of the other Plant Therapy oils and this one was a bit of a dissapointment.</li>
            <li>I also love to just inhale from the bottle when I&#x27;m feeling down.</li>
            <li>Normally, even with a room air purifier, my allergies react to dog urine.  </li>
            <li>If you add it to a diffuser, it&#x27;s nice for a short time but doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to the world of aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li>I received the bottle and it brand new just as it stated.  </li>
            <li>I always diffuse a citrus blend of essential oils during the summer months as it relieves the heaviness of hot and humid days, and freshens the house when the air conditioning is used.  </li>
            <li>This Citrus Burst far surpassed my expectations.  </li>
            <li>So far it keeps bugs at bay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but the name Citrus Burst makes you think you&#x27;re going to be smelling a lively blend of orange and grapefruit, etc, with maybe a little lemon in there.</li>
            <li>I am new to aromatherapy, but I have ordered from three companies total, and I do not see or smell any difference in the three..  </li>
            <li>It is a very subtle scent and you can only really smell it when inhaling it out of the bottle or being on top of the oil diffuser.</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous, I just dap a little on my skin and the smell lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have only finished one bottle.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t mask the vinegar smell completely but definitely helps brighten and freshen it up.  </li>
            <li>I set my diffuser near the pads and use various Plant Therapies Essential Oils.  </li>

            <li> but this smell is not a natural or synthetic citrus smell for me.</li>
            <li> I have only tried 3 other brands</li>
            <li> I always get them in a day earlier than the delivery due date.</li>
            <li> But after putting it in an essential oil warmer, I found I couldn&#x27;t smell it like other scents I have used.</li>
            <li> Like I said, not a bad smell, but really lame compared to what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it as part of a natural spider repellent so far but plan to use it as part of other natural product formulas.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other scents.</li>
            <li> Also keeps other insects away..</li>
            <li> I use this scent/brand in my diffuser, on cotton pads placed in my car and a few other places.</li>
            <li> Citrus blends are typically use to energize and refresh.</li>
            <li> well, not true..  </li>
            <li> Plant Therapy is a little less.  </li>
            <li> Hurt me for a little while  </li>
            <li> I feel that the price is a little steep.  </li>
            <li> i diffused it everyday using my deneve river rock diffuser.i also like to smell it from the bottle so relaxing</li>
            <li> So I put a few drops of lavender oil on it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t an unpleasant scent by any means, just not very strong.  </li>
            <li> but still there is a faint smell.  </li>
            <li> Did not like because the smell was very faint.</li>

            <li> This company provides excellent essential oil blends at affordable pricing.  No MLM and therefore you can afford quality.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent so far! Just 2-3 drops in my diffuser and my room is bright and happy. It arrived very safely wrapped.</li>
            <li> This oil smells amazing!! I diffuse it in my classroom and my room is full if happy children! I also love to just inhale from the bottle when I&#x27;m feeling down.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite EO from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice. Have not used it yet.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance. Nice blend of citrus with a hint of sweetness.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist who uses essential oils in my massage practice.  I was looking for a quality citrus blend to satisfy a client.  This Citrus Burst far surpassed my expectations.  This is an excellent oil with a clean, clear, fragrance.  I will definitely be buying more oils from this company.</li>
            <li> I always diffuse a citrus blend of essential oils during the summer months as it relieves the heaviness of hot and humid days, and freshens the house when the air conditioning is used.  This particular blend is not heavy in any one citrus oil, is well-balanced, bright, and very refreshing. I will definitely buy this again.  And such a great price!</li>
            <li> Love love love love love the scent. It&#x27;s nice and affordable - great product for making homemade scrubs!! Pick it up!</li>
            <li> This review is for Citrus Burst Synergy Essential Oil Blend by Plant Therapies.  I am fairly new to the world of aromatherapy.  I started this in hopes of helping my breathing allergies.  I have dogs.  Dogs have smells, especially the soiled &amp;#34;puppy pads&amp;#34; that my dogs use indoors.  I change the puppy pads daily but still there is a faint smell.  I set my diffuser near the pads and use various Plant Therapies Essential Oils.  I like the Citrus Burst best for destroying the puppy pad odor.  I put 10 drops into the diffuser (maybe up to 15 drops if the air in the room does not have that clean, fresh smell.  Viola!  The room smells great!  Best of all, my allergies are gone as long as the diffuser runs (approx. 3 hrs.).  Normally, even with a room air purifier, my allergies react to dog urine.  Once the diffuser runs out, the allergies return in approx. 1 hr.  Initially, when I started using the Citrus Burst, I could smell that wonderful citrus smell.  I cannot smell it any longer (the body builds up a resistance to the aroma after awhile in many cases), but the effect is still there:  no allergies!  In an effort to reduce potential allergic responses to these essential oils, I rotate the essential oil in the diffuser daily: mint one day, citrus the next, cinnamon the next, etc.  I am very pleased with this Citrus Burst Synergy as well as all of the Plant Therapies Essential Oils that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I received the bottle and it brand new just as it stated.  It was delivered just as it stated.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this for my homemade furniture polish and I must say it smells divine!  It works great in DIY cleaning products.</li>
            <li> Smells great. I love this synergy. I mix it with olive oil and apply it on problem areas like by abdomen arms and thighs to get rid off petrochemicals build up under my skin.  I also drink it in water or in gel capsules. So far, I have only finished one bottle.</li>
            <li> Used in an all-purpose house hold cleaner.  Citrus Burst Synergy Essential Oil blend smells great and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This smell is amazing! Can&#x27;t wait to use it in my cleaning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product three times but so far I&#x27;m very happy with the scent.  I&#x27;ve only used it as part of a natural spider repellent so far but plan to use it as part of other natural product formulas.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blend  to make a sugar scrub for some friends, and I&#x27;ve added it to my vinegar based cleaning products. I&#x27;m moving away from chemicals, and love love love this fresh clean scent. I&#x27;ve also used it in my air freshener mix, and I&#x27;m extremely pleased. Product arrived timely, and was packaged properly. I can&#x27;t wait to try other scents.</li>
            <li> These essential oils were used for making our home made body wash and shampoo products.  The oils smell fantastic and are instantly invigorating.</li>
            <li> I just began using essential oils about a month ago. I use this scent/brand in my diffuser, on cotton pads placed in my car and a few other places. I&#x27;m still learning on where to use. The few oils that I purchased from Plant Therapy seem to be of high quality. Right now they are my first choice of brands. I have only tried 3 other brands so I&#x27;m obviously not an expert. I will continue to build up my collection from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> very nice smell citrucy, fruity &amp; refreshing. i diffused it everyday using my deneve river rock diffuser.i also like to smell it from the bottle so relaxing, I love it will definitely buy from plant therapy...</li>
            <li> Great scent, I add it to a vitamin c serum and I love that it&#x27;s not too strong of a smell, just enough to give a nice energizing effect. If you add it to a diffuser, it&#x27;s nice for a short time but doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> I bought this make shave oil.&lt;br /&gt;3 parts olive oil, 1 part castor oil, and about 10-12 drops of the Citrus Burst.&lt;br /&gt;Works great and I get compliments from my classmates saying I smell &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I make my own hand cream and my husband prefers the scent of this oil to others. It is a fresh clean smell and invigorating.</li>
            <li> They should call this stuff \\&quot;Lemon Lollipop\\&quot; oil, because that is exactly what it smells like. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but the name Citrus Burst makes you think you&#x27;re going to be smelling a lively blend of orange and grapefruit, etc, with maybe a little lemon in there. This literally smells exactly like a lemon lollipop or a lemon drop. Like I said, not a bad smell, but really lame compared to what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It is a very subtle scent and you can only really smell it when inhaling it out of the bottle or being on top of the oil diffuser. It isn&#x27;t an unpleasant scent by any means, just not very strong.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with some of the other Plant Therapy oils and this one was a bit of a dissapointment.</li>
            <li> So far it keeps bugs at bay.</li>
            <li> good for depression-hurray</li>
            <li> Regularly use it dissolved in coconut oil for massages and it does wonders to the muscles and for relaxation. All oils from this line are great</li>
            <li> I love the way this oil smells- so clean and citrusy! I make my own home cleaning products and air fresheners and am now exclusivly using this to scent them. My home smells great!</li>
            <li> It smells very crisp, fresh and clean! It&#x27;s great quality!</li>
            <li> Tried to use it for toilet deodorizer but did not work for that application.</li>
            <li> We use this essential oil blend in our household cleaner solution.  It doesn&#x27;t mask the vinegar smell completely but definitely helps brighten and freshen it up.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best essential oil brands I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of the more expensive brands and thought I&#x27;d give this a try after reading the reviews. I am very pleased with the fragrance and the effectiveness of the Citrus Burst Synergy. Citrus blends are typically use to energize and refresh. I diffuse this in the mornings to get my day started on a BRIGHT note. It seems to help this &amp;#34;not a morning&amp;#34; person greet the morning with a better attitude.</li>
            <li> Wonderful citrus scent that is refreshing!</li>
            <li> Have been making my own scrubs and I love the essential oils. I received this very quickly and would buy again from this retailer!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and I use it in homemade cleaning solutions, body scrubs, and even a DIY bug deterrent spray. Definitely a good blend to have on hand since it can be used for so many purposes and smells so invigorating.</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous, I just dap a little on my skin and the smell lasts for a long time.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Your shipping is great! I always get them in a day earlier than the delivery due date.Packing was great too.Thanks..The oils smells wonderful and have many uses with me. I mostly use them to diffuse in my home and in baths. While working outside in my yard I got stung by a honey bee on the front of my head and boy did it hurt. My husband got the stinger out but I was worried about swelling and that I&#x27;m allergic. So I put a few drops of lavender oil on it. Hurt me for a little while  then it stopped..No swelling.. So I decided to mix some oils with distilled  water in a spray  bottle (lemongrass,eucalyptus,lemon and lavender..well I decided  to test it out, so I sprayed me from head. to toe, clothes and all. Especially  my hair. Well I have a nest of honey bees by my house and I went by them, not to close of course.. It works great..they don&#x27;t like it at all..Now I bring my bottle out with me all the time. Also keeps other insects away..So Thanks Again! Great Job Well Done</li>
            <li> I bought this essential oil to add fragrance to my homemade floor cleaner.  It leaves a nice, clean fragrance and makes my floors smell clean.</li>
            <li> Love the flavor of this oil in my water. Love the scent in my diffuser. Will continue to use this for sure</li>
            <li> I bourght this product because I am having behaviour problems with one of my cats and read that they don&#x27;t like the smell of citrus.  While I was aware of the size of the bottle when I bought it, it didn&#x27;t \\&quot;register&#x27; until I got it.  I feel that the price is a little steep.  It made my basement smell good, but didn&#x27;t work for what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite, very fresh and energizing. My kids love it too.</li>
            <li> The citrus burst smells amazing  I use it in the kitchen and the smell lingers throughout the first floor.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Used this in a diffuser while having our home up for sale. It creates a fresh and clean scent that help any environment smell clean. It covered a first floor of a 2700 square foot home.</li>
            <li> Citrus burst, peppermint strong, wakes you up, I need 14 letters or something, hope I&#x27;ve made it. Didn&#x27;t quite make it yet.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent ,my husband even loves the scent. Smells great in the body wash I make. Very fast delivery. I love thias product.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, just a couple of drops will do it. Great for making homemade foam soap that&#x27;s lightly scented for those with sensitive skin and allergies.</li>
            <li> love it! use it in my homemade cleaners and diffuser!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the uplifting scent it was wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this oil - it smells awesome &amp; really is uplifting! I use it in a diffuser &amp; can&#x27;t help by smile whenever I catch a whiff of this beautiful, citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I got this product to make home made lip balm...Love the smell and it tastes good too! Makes me think of summer! Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> At first, I was very happy with the scent of this oil. But after putting it in an essential oil warmer, I found I couldn&#x27;t smell it like other scents I have used. Maybe it&#x27;s just that the citrus scent isn&#x27;t good for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy is a quality company to get oils from, in my opinion.  I am new to aromatherapy, but I have ordered from three companies total, and I do not see or smell any difference in the three..  well, not true..  the difference is the cost.  Plant Therapy is a little less.  For someone new to aromatherapy, the synergy blends are a great way to get started</li>
            <li> Did not like because the smell was very faint. Citrus product was needed for household freshener, cleaning, etc. Did not need an overwhelming aroma but this smell is not a natural or synthetic citrus smell for me. Good luck for others. Thanks</li>
            <li> This essential oil exceeded my expectations! I love the scent!</li>
