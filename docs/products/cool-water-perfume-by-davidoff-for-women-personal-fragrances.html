            <li>As a long-time wearer of Cool Water for Women, it has become my &#x27;signature&#x27; fragrance and my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>This perfume smells good but the scent does not last.</li>
            <li>I ordedred this perfume Cool Water By Zino Davidoff For Women.</li>
            <li>I use Cool Water for men.</li>
            <li>Cool Water.  </li>
            <li>I think I prefer men&#x27;s cool water than women</li>
            <li>Its light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was outstanding and very prompt.  </li>
            <li>i bought this nice battle for a friend of mine, and so far i hear no complains</li>
            <li>is that Cool Water?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for some Cool Water</li>
            <li>As I loved the scent of the male version of this, I got one for myself.</li>
            <li>I never tried Davidoff cool water perfume.</li>
            <li>and I still love it as much as I did when I discovered it.</li>
            <li>The packing was a bit basic but the spray and the box arrived in good condition from OTC</li>
            <li>If in a 100-200 years, history will speak of one fragrance, it must be of cool water by davidoff.</li>
            <li>It is a light, clean, crisp scent that isn&#x27;t musky at all.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to ask her to use more next time and see if that works better.  </li>
            <li>Packaged well, arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Item shipped quickly, in fact the rest of my order hasn&#x27;t even shipped yet.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, product arrived as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume since high school and love the scent.</li>
            <li>I wear this fragrance pretty much purely for the nostalgia. :)</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and a light scent lingers all day long.</li>
            <li>I remembered how much I liked Cool Water in my younger years and decided to try this as a gift for my wife.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much on as it will be a bit strong.</li>
            <li>Pretty bottle, too!</li>
            <li>If you are shopping for teenage girl, you would absolutely love this fragrance!</li>
            <li>Received it in a few days and am very pleased!</li>
            <li>Great perfume...been wearing it everyday...</li>
            <li>By far my all time favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I think its always better to spend some extra amount on Genuine perfumes rather then buying FAKE/DUPLICATE perumes from vendors at Amazon.com</li>
            <li>Fresh feel.</li>
            <li>Fragrance smells great so far and last as it should.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heady, but has a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the scent to be lighter and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice summer fragrance but this falls short of the mark.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments with this perfume, so I&#x27;m glad to have it in a larger size bottle for a decent price.</li>
            <li>A very nice scent - not the fresh outdoorsy scent I expected, but still very nice and subtle.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be a very light scent though as it&#x27;s barely noticeable, even in close quarters.  </li>
            <li>Great choice for someone who doesn&#x27;t like heavy or spicy scents and wants something more natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and don&#x27;t really think of it as a young person/teens fragrance but more an natural, refreshing, outdoor scent for women of all ages.</li>
            <li>This product smells fresh and crisp.</li>
            <li>Cool Water for Women is a very summer-ish fragrance.</li>
            <li>The small sizes or the lotion is a great scent pick me up to carry in your purse for touch ups.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild, flowery essense that is not too strong and comes in a cute little bottle.</li>
            <li>Super relieved its the real thing</li>
            <li>Its a nice subtle tone, watery, fresh and this amazon price online makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shopped many stores for this fragrance, I was able to purchase this on amazon for almost half the price and no tax!</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very responsible seller.</li>
            <li>Other perfumes are too strond or over powering, where Cool Water is a light, fresh, clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is not the first time I purchase this Eau de Toilette.</li>
            <li>I love the blue bottle which reminds me of a \\&quot;genie in a bottle\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Item was exact to how it was described .</li>
            <li>I love the smell, buy a gift to my wife and she loves it, and now she uses it daily.</li>
            <li>The price is extra bonus!! :)</li>
            <li>Smells pretty.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I should order more actually! !</li>
            <li>I wear Cool Water mostly in the spring/summer and use my other &#x27;go to&#x27; scent of Anais Anais which is a bit heavier during fall and winter.</li>
            <li>This is the legitimate product, packaged in bubble wrap, new box, unopened, full bottle, with real perfume inside.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely ecstatic when I first sniffed it at a department store counter.</li>
            <li>I reported to the vendor that the box was opened the conent wasnt full, nearly 1/3 of the bottle was gone.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s still hanging in there 18 hours after I tried a quick spritz.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a strong perfume, find one that actually says \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; or \\&quot;parfum\\&quot; on the label!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t even smell like perfume pure alcohol..</li>
            <li>This is certainly a summer or spring time scent.</li>
            <li>I have been using Cool Water for over 7 years, this is the first time that the contents of the bottle came out in a heavy stream instead of a fine mist and it burns when first applied.</li>
            <li>classy smell, long lasting, great price.</li>
            <li>Especially for this price I double love!</li>
            <li>Water is a clean, fresh, scent that stays with you all day long yet does not overpower/offend.  </li>
            <li>Just a little spray and u spell amazing the whole day</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like the perfume</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
            <li>Really like it..</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister for her birthday, and she really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Again</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>The scent soft, citrus and fresh.</li>
            <li>really like the scent.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t give you as much product</li>
            <li>but then its also only 3/4 filled....</li>
            <li>DELIVERY WAS REALLY FAST.</li>
            <li>straight out of the shower smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The perfume was delivered fast.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Worth a try as I expected Amazon to do better than selling imitations.</li>
            <li>Real Deal.  </li>
            <li>I like this scent because it is very clean-smelling and feminine, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Get the whole set if you can find it reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The male scent is far better.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and stays pretty long time.</li>
            <li>The perfume seems a knock-off version, the smell is not the same and it goes away pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and the scent is long lasting and neutral enough to wear on many occasions</li>
            <li>It seems to me, however, a perfume that speaks more of a younger person than I am; or perhaps a more youthful fragrance than I usually wear.  </li>
            <li>The Cool Water scent is both gentle and lasting.  </li>
            <li>, is also very fresh, not very flowery, it is also very light which is a plus and a minus.</li>
            <li>so I am a fan of Cool Water, especially the one for men, the womens version</li>
            <li>P.Looks and smells decent though.</li>
            <li>smell good but weak longevity.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to everyone..would like to buy again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone at this price of $14.99.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this scent off and on since high school.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>It has such a clean and fresh sent to it that lasts a fairly long time.  </li>
            <li>For a long time I paid top dollar at local department stores for the 3.4 and 6.7 oz.</li>
            <li>the person loves the smell and does not indicate is is nothing but the real deal, some knock amazon as having other than original manuf.</li>
            <li>It is something that keeps me fresh the entire day!</li>
            <li>the bottle was a good condition however the box was in poor condition, as if they reused the box before.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to anyone that likes a light scent and tends to have problems with other scents/perfumes becoming too sweet/heavy after wearing for a few hours.</li>
            <li>Smells really good and it last quite long, even longer than expected!</li>
            <li>Its not expensive and it such a soft scent, expecially for a young lady!</li>
            <li>My wife keeps trying all kinds of different perfumes but keeps coming back to Cool Water.  </li>
            <li>I know fragrances work differently with everyone&#x27;s body chemistry, but Cool Water does not last on me.</li>
            <li>Everybody will love the smell - last long enough - probably for abt 8 hrs without needing to respray.</li>
            <li>so I compared it to my almost-empty spray bought several years ago from a major department store and this one is exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding this product in stores, and was pleased with my buying experience here.</li>
            <li>1/5th of the perfume was not there.anyone can clearly say that its used.</li>
            <li>Surprised to find them here for a lower cost.</li>
            <li>I recently got this for my girlfriend who wasn&#x27;t wearing much perfume.  </li>
            <li>It seems like one of those fragrances that should be put on early and allowed to mellow a bit.</li>
            <li>I like the freshness of it, very soft and invigorating any time of the day or year, so I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys subtle, refreshing scents.</li>
            <li>Gave it to my wife over 10 years ago and still prefer this over her many other more expensive perfumes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty concentrated and will last and last!</li>
            <li>Smells on me almost exactly like the Avon pink bubble bath that i used to have when I was a child.</li>
            <li>I personally love several scents that I cannot wear because they become too heavy and cloying after a short period.</li>
            <li>Outstanding, just like in the department stores, but at less than half the price.</li>
            <li>It smells OK, the scent is not lasting and is too subtle.</li>
            <li>GREAT BUY, DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND THE BAD REVIEWS.</li>
            <li>It is barely worn.</li>
            <li>Purchased for a young friend of mine who only wears this.  </li>
            <li>It has a floral base with a light overtone of cucumber or melon which make it airy and refreshing without making the wearer smell like a \\&quot;fruit</li>
            <li>I usually have to smell it first!  </li>
            <li>The box had no plastic wrapping and it looked like very worn off, scratched and a little teared.</li>

            <li> THEN I found Amazon was a supplier of this great fragrance and low and behold, the price was even better!!!  </li>
            <li> , it is not at all floral, more lemony- very refreshing and the name is apt.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely light fragrance that is wonderful for summertime but can easily be worn through all seasons of the year.</li>
            <li> She loves Cool Water and was happy to get a bottle before Valentines day...</li>
            <li> Super happy üòå</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this fragrance is by far the best!</li>
            <li> and i loved the price and the good service; i will buy it again because the price is just right.</li>
            <li> its great that i can have this sent right to my door.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>

            <li> looks original and smells good too.</li>
            <li> 100% original all good</li>
            <li> great for the summer - it is exactly what it is called.  </li>
            <li> Great gift for my daughter on her first mothers day.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE, RECEIVED EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED,</li>
            <li> Very light.</li>
            <li> The scent is VERY light . . .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my best fragrance, but for this price it is great for everyday use!</li>
            <li> It was received quickly and at a good price.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re happy with Cool Water like it is (as I am), then order this and enjoy.</li>
            <li> To be able to buy 2 and have them shipped in 2 days for free with Prime membership makes this perfume even more lovable!</li>

            <li> The perfume itself is great, and I love it, the package is not that good, no wrapping, and the perfume bottle itself is not full, it looks like it has been used before!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume - very fresh and outdoorsy.</li>
            <li> but luckily my mom liked it and confirmed it smelled legit.</li>

            <li> The aroma is soft and smells good.</li>

            <li> I have been wearing this for years, I&#x27;m just as happy with this bottle as I have been with every other bottle of cool water I have ever had :-)</li>
            <li> It has a light crisp scent that is very unique.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell like original one what i bought from macy&#x27;s.</li>

            <li> Original package, cool smell...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  think there is anything special about this perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right!</li>
            <li> and I get it right away!</li>
            <li> Smells good and last for a good time (not very long though).</li>
            <li> As a long-time wearer of Cool Water for Women, it has become my &#x27;signature&#x27; fragrance and my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> This perfume smells good but the scent does not last.</li>
            <li> I ordedred this perfume Cool Water By Zino Davidoff For Women.</li>
            <li> I use Cool Water for men.</li>
            <li> Cool Water.  </li>
            <li> I think I prefer men&#x27;s cool water than women</li>
            <li> Its light and fresh.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was outstanding and very prompt.  </li>
            <li> i bought this nice battle for a friend of mine, and so far i hear no complains</li>
            <li> is that Cool Water?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for some Cool Water</li>
            <li> As I loved the scent of the male version of this, I got one for myself.</li>
            <li> I never tried Davidoff cool water perfume.</li>
            <li> and I still love it as much as I did when I discovered it.</li>
            <li> The packing was a bit basic but the spray and the box arrived in good condition from OTC</li>
            <li> If in a 100-200 years, history will speak of one fragrance, it must be of cool water by davidoff.</li>
            <li> It is a light, clean, crisp scent that isn&#x27;t musky at all.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to ask her to use more next time and see if that works better.  </li>
            <li> Packaged well, arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Item shipped quickly, in fact the rest of my order hasn&#x27;t even shipped yet.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, product arrived as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume since high school and love the scent.</li>
            <li> I wear this fragrance pretty much purely for the nostalgia. :)</li>
            <li> It smells nice, and a light scent lingers all day long.</li>
            <li> I remembered how much I liked Cool Water in my younger years and decided to try this as a gift for my wife.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too much on as it will be a bit strong.</li>
            <li> Pretty bottle, too!</li>
            <li> If you are shopping for teenage girl, you would absolutely love this fragrance!</li>
            <li> Received it in a few days and am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great perfume...been wearing it everyday...</li>
            <li> By far my all time favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I think its always better to spend some extra amount on Genuine perfumes rather then buying FAKE/DUPLICATE perumes from vendors at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Fresh feel.</li>
            <li> Fragrance smells great so far and last as it should.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heady, but has a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the scent to be lighter and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice summer fragrance but this falls short of the mark.  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments with this perfume, so I&#x27;m glad to have it in a larger size bottle for a decent price.</li>
            <li> A very nice scent - not the fresh outdoorsy scent I expected, but still very nice and subtle.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a very light scent though as it&#x27;s barely noticeable, even in close quarters.  </li>
            <li> Great choice for someone who doesn&#x27;t like heavy or spicy scents and wants something more natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and don&#x27;t really think of it as a young person/teens fragrance but more an natural, refreshing, outdoor scent for women of all ages.</li>
            <li> This product smells fresh and crisp.</li>
            <li> Cool Water for Women is a very summer-ish fragrance.</li>
            <li> The small sizes or the lotion is a great scent pick me up to carry in your purse for touch ups.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is mild, flowery essense that is not too strong and comes in a cute little bottle.</li>
            <li> Super relieved its the real thing</li>
            <li> Its a nice subtle tone, watery, fresh and this amazon price online makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shopped many stores for this fragrance, I was able to purchase this on amazon for almost half the price and no tax!</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very responsible seller.</li>
            <li> Other perfumes are too strond or over powering, where Cool Water is a light, fresh, clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It is not the first time I purchase this Eau de Toilette.</li>
            <li> I love the blue bottle which reminds me of a \\&quot;genie in a bottle\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Item was exact to how it was described .</li>
            <li> I love the smell, buy a gift to my wife and she loves it, and now she uses it daily.</li>
            <li> The price is extra bonus!! :)</li>
            <li> Smells pretty.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I should order more actually! !</li>
            <li> I wear Cool Water mostly in the spring/summer and use my other &#x27;go to&#x27; scent of Anais Anais which is a bit heavier during fall and winter.</li>
            <li> This is the legitimate product, packaged in bubble wrap, new box, unopened, full bottle, with real perfume inside.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely ecstatic when I first sniffed it at a department store counter.</li>
            <li> I reported to the vendor that the box was opened the conent wasnt full, nearly 1/3 of the bottle was gone.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s still hanging in there 18 hours after I tried a quick spritz.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a strong perfume, find one that actually says \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; or \\&quot;parfum\\&quot; on the label!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t even smell like perfume pure alcohol..</li>
            <li> This is certainly a summer or spring time scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cool Water for over 7 years, this is the first time that the contents of the bottle came out in a heavy stream instead of a fine mist and it burns when first applied.</li>
            <li> classy smell, long lasting, great price.</li>
            <li> Especially for this price I double love!</li>
            <li> Water is a clean, fresh, scent that stays with you all day long yet does not overpower/offend.  </li>
            <li> Just a little spray and u spell amazing the whole day</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like the perfume</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
            <li> Really like it..</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for her birthday, and she really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Again</li>
            <li> I really like this scent.</li>
            <li> The scent soft, citrus and fresh.</li>
            <li> really like the scent.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t give you as much product</li>
            <li> but then its also only 3/4 filled....</li>
            <li> DELIVERY WAS REALLY FAST.</li>
            <li> straight out of the shower smell.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The perfume was delivered fast.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth a try as I expected Amazon to do better than selling imitations.</li>
            <li> Real Deal.  </li>
            <li> I like this scent because it is very clean-smelling and feminine, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Get the whole set if you can find it reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The male scent is far better.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and stays pretty long time.</li>
            <li> The perfume seems a knock-off version, the smell is not the same and it goes away pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the scent is long lasting and neutral enough to wear on many occasions</li>
            <li> It seems to me, however, a perfume that speaks more of a younger person than I am; or perhaps a more youthful fragrance than I usually wear.  </li>
            <li> The Cool Water scent is both gentle and lasting.  </li>
            <li> , is also very fresh, not very flowery, it is also very light which is a plus and a minus.</li>
            <li> so I am a fan of Cool Water, especially the one for men, the womens version</li>
            <li> P.Looks and smells decent though.</li>
            <li> smell good but weak longevity.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to everyone..would like to buy again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone at this price of $14.99.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent off and on since high school.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It has such a clean and fresh sent to it that lasts a fairly long time.  </li>
            <li> For a long time I paid top dollar at local department stores for the 3.4 and 6.7 oz.</li>
            <li> the person loves the smell and does not indicate is is nothing but the real deal, some knock amazon as having other than original manuf.</li>
            <li> It is something that keeps me fresh the entire day!</li>
            <li> the bottle was a good condition however the box was in poor condition, as if they reused the box before.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this to anyone that likes a light scent and tends to have problems with other scents/perfumes becoming too sweet/heavy after wearing for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and it last quite long, even longer than expected!</li>
            <li> Its not expensive and it such a soft scent, expecially for a young lady!</li>
            <li> My wife keeps trying all kinds of different perfumes but keeps coming back to Cool Water.  </li>
            <li> I know fragrances work differently with everyone&#x27;s body chemistry, but Cool Water does not last on me.</li>
            <li> Everybody will love the smell - last long enough - probably for abt 8 hrs without needing to respray.</li>
            <li> so I compared it to my almost-empty spray bought several years ago from a major department store and this one is exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this product in stores, and was pleased with my buying experience here.</li>
            <li> 1/5th of the perfume was not there.anyone can clearly say that its used.</li>
            <li> Surprised to find them here for a lower cost.</li>
            <li> I recently got this for my girlfriend who wasn&#x27;t wearing much perfume.  </li>
            <li> It seems like one of those fragrances that should be put on early and allowed to mellow a bit.</li>
            <li> I like the freshness of it, very soft and invigorating any time of the day or year, so I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys subtle, refreshing scents.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my wife over 10 years ago and still prefer this over her many other more expensive perfumes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty concentrated and will last and last!</li>
            <li> Smells on me almost exactly like the Avon pink bubble bath that i used to have when I was a child.</li>
            <li> I personally love several scents that I cannot wear because they become too heavy and cloying after a short period.</li>
            <li> Outstanding, just like in the department stores, but at less than half the price.</li>
            <li> It smells OK, the scent is not lasting and is too subtle.</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY, DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND THE BAD REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> It is barely worn.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a young friend of mine who only wears this.  </li>
            <li> It has a floral base with a light overtone of cucumber or melon which make it airy and refreshing without making the wearer smell like a \\&quot;fruit</li>
            <li> I usually have to smell it first!  </li>
            <li> The box had no plastic wrapping and it looked like very worn off, scratched and a little teared.</li>
            <li> I would say its more of daytime wear and keeps it casual.</li>
            <li> Cost $25.00 a bottle but doesn&#x27;t last long neither.</li>
            <li> fragrance didnt last long.</li>
            <li> And I would say it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I read a review of the perfume not lasting long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took the gamble, was excited for my wife upon receiving it but to our dismay, the scent is not good as her previous one and doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long.</li>
            <li> spent the following couple of hours making every-five-minutes comments like \\&quot;Amazing\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> your scent will stay on all day long.</li>
            <li> It has been around for a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not over powering and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer that the scent isn&#x27;t long lived, but it IS toilette water, not perfume.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I think the neck on the bottle is just too long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed that when I went back the next day to order more, the price had practically doubled.</li>
            <li> My husband is obsessed with this perfume, so I bought it, but personally, its a little strong, like when I stray it, it gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> Allow Moisturizer to absorb and dry</li>
            <li> Does seem slightly watered down compared to the old formula that I remember in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about ordering due to the negative reviews, but I received the real deal</li>
            <li> Putting on a little extra is recommended.</li>
            <li> It did not smell fresh, smelled stale.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent, you cant go wrong with Davidoff.</li>
            <li> These are pulse points where the natural heat of the skin slowly releases the ingredients in the perfume</li>
            <li> It competes right up there with some of her expensive perfumes like Burberry Brit.  </li>
            <li> usually theres a tight clear plastic paper wrap around the box.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t really smell like the real deal.</li>
            <li> For me,a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Usually bought this for my wife in big department stores.</li>
            <li> I tend to prefer deeper sents with overtones of sandlewood or other woody scents.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only worn this scent for a few days and am already getting compliment after compliment on it!</li>
            <li> Do NOT rub wrists together after you spray, this will break down the ingredients in the perfume</li>
            <li> Item arrived unwrapped causing half of the bottle to be out of the box when i opened the package.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> It is not overpowering or heavy.</li>
            <li> Actually ordered the wrong perfume...</li>
            <li> Amazon shipping was on time as usual.</li>
            <li> Neither does the fragrance last.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this from Amazon thinking it would be better from others; but it turned out to be worst!</li>
            <li> not pleased with product</li>
            <li> This is just an ordinary  perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the worst Cool Water Davidoff I ever got from this Vendor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Others complained that the scent is too weak.</li>
            <li> Not too powerful and not too boring.</li>
            <li> And hope that they will adjust this problem, or at least answer my email!</li>
            <li> smells like the stuff i&#x27;ve bought at the usual expensive department stores.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Amazon stands behind it&#x27;s products and that means alot to me when I shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Before dressing, spritz on each wrist, behind the ear, behind the knee and/ or at your elbow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews and claims that this product is fake.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging, it looked like a returned product.</li>
            <li> It has a faint flowery smell but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it</li>
            <li> i heard it is fake, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I just bouthg a perfume by amazon.com and the one the just send is so fake</li>
            <li> I used to think people who claimed that in amazon reviews were crazy</li>
            <li> Besides, \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\\&quot; -- how could that possibly be fake?!</li>
            <li> smells make me so sick.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> smell good but weak longevity.</li>
            <li> excellent price. fast shipping. i recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is not the first time I purchase this Eau de Toilette. I like the freshness of it, very soft and invigorating any time of the day or year, so I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys subtle, refreshing scents.</li>
            <li> Perfect Gift; my wife loves it</li>
            <li> Received my order today &amp; loved the perfume! Came nicely packaged. I will be gifting it to a loved one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the buy, it arrived before the promised date and was authentic...the beautiful bottle with the silver rings and the unmistakable scent.  I really like the perfume, it is not at all floral, more lemony- very refreshing and the name is apt. Reminds me of the ocean.   The only drawback, and this seems to be a feature of the perfume itself, is that it tends to fade in say 5-6 hours or so. Putting on a little extra is recommended. That&#x27;s not a problem because I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now but it&#x27;s pretty concentrated and will last and last!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Great price. Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase. Will buy again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for several years now and still get compliments.  Most perfumes give me headaches, but this one doesn&#x27;t.  Try it!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells good but the scent does not last.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this product. It did not smell fresh, smelled stale.</li>
            <li> Cost $25.00 a bottle but doesn&#x27;t last long neither.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present for my daughter.  I was very happy with the ordering process.</li>
            <li> If you want your wife to smell great and get attention from strangers buy her this stuff.  People everywhere will ask her what she is wearing and that will make her happy, which should make you happy.  Great Summer scent.  Very light.</li>
            <li> One of the best fragrances - very pleasant, not too strong or overpowering..perfect for work or casual wear.  Everybody will love the smell - last long enough - probably for abt 8 hrs without needing to respray.</li>
            <li> I reported to the vendor that the box was opened the conent wasnt full, nearly 1/3 of the bottle was gone. And hope that they will adjust this problem, or at least answer my email!</li>
            <li> Not the best, but not bad either.</li>
            <li> By far my all time favorite perfume. I have worn it for years, and still get compliments on it. It smells nice, and a light scent lingers all day long. Also, the scent doesn&#x27;t clash with the types of scented lotions I wear with it from time to time. Pretty bottle, too!</li>
            <li> Recommended..All good.Thx</li>
            <li> Excellent time delivery and good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shopped many stores for this fragrance, I was able to purchase this on amazon for almost half the price and no tax! I love shopping amazon and recommend it to all my friends. I really enjoy this fragrance it is excellent for everyday use. I have received many compliments on how nice I smell!</li>
            <li> It is mine and my best friends favorite smell.  To be able to buy 2 and have them shipped in 2 days for free with Prime membership makes this perfume even more lovable!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time actually earlier than expect, great product love it.</li>
            <li> i could not get this order cancelled to save my life... i tried chat and the girl \\&quot;Mylene\\&quot; told me i had to call the \\&quot; large items department\\&quot; which was also the \\&quot;hazardous material department\\&quot; fantastic customer service......</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble. If I hadn&#x27;t thrown the packaging,I would be returning this one. Still puzzles me how Amazon carried this perfume. Usually bought this for my wife in big department stores. Surprised to find them here for a lower cost. Took the gamble, was excited for my wife upon receiving it but to our dismay, the scent is not good as her previous one and doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long.I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t read the 1-star reviews and trusted the overall rating and being sold by Amazon. Well, lesson learned and I hope this review also will make you think twice before buying...or better yet, don&#x27;t buy at all.You have been warned!</li>
            <li> My daughter love the scent of this perfume excellent</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume - very fresh and outdoorsy. I always have a bottle of this at hand.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t over powering. I would say its more of daytime wear and keeps it casual. I love the blue bottle which reminds me of a \\&quot;genie in a bottle\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I got this because my boyfriend says he likes it...  I really can&#x27;t stand the smell so I haven&#x27;t worn it once.  To each their own I guess...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this as a gift for my mother&#x27;s birthday, she just loved it! Just after receive it she open the box and put it in the same moment spent the following couple of hours making every-five-minutes comments like \\&quot;Amazing\\&quot;, \\&quot;I loved it\\&quot; and \\&quot;thank you!\\&quot;! So, it made me a very happy son either :)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to smell as sexy as he*%, then Cool Water is a perfect choice for you.  I&#x27;ve had so many men tell me I smell, \\&quot;Sexy as ____\\&quot;, and I have to agree.  YUMMMMMMM!</li>
            <li> As a long-time wearer of Cool Water for Women, it has become my &#x27;signature&#x27; fragrance and my absolute favorite.  For a long time I paid top dollar at local department stores for the 3.4 and 6.7 oz. bottles.  Then I found a discount fragrance website (which will remain unnamed) that offered &#x27;demo&#x27; bottles at a great discounted price (they came w/o the caps but I didn&#x27;t care!).  THEN I found Amazon was a supplier of this great fragrance and low and behold, the price was even better!!!  Add to that the free shipping and the security of shopping at Amazon that I thorougly enjoy, it was a no brainer!  I now order my fragrance from Amazon and also find many gift fragrances for my friends here as well.  Amazon stands behind it&#x27;s products and that means alot to me when I shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool Water is a clean, fresh, scent that stays with you all day long yet does not overpower/offend.  I receive so many compliments about this fragrance....once you try it, you will agree I am sure.</li>
            <li> bought to give gift to relative, she liked it good products. rest of the words for amazon 20 counts one two three</li>
            <li> I sent this gift to my house mother. She likes it</li>
            <li> I ordedred this perfume Cool Water By Zino Davidoff For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Oz.&lt;br /&gt;But to my surprize whenever my wife would use this perume its fragrance will just vanish in two hours. This is the worst Cool Water Davidoff I ever got from this Vendor. I think its always better to spend some extra amount on Genuine perfumes rather then buying FAKE/DUPLICATE perumes from vendors at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> My wife keeps trying all kinds of different perfumes but keeps coming back to Cool Water.  Other perfumes are too strond or over powering, where Cool Water is a light, fresh, clean fragrance.  I use Cool Water for men.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  This did not make it in time for Christmas but was still a very welcome present.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> I have received my order, the delivery was excellent.  As to the product, I love this perfume, it is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Smells on me almost exactly like the Avon pink bubble bath that i used to have when I was a child. I wear this fragrance pretty much purely for the nostalgia. :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I love this scent by Davidoff, and I am a total fragrance snob. I was absolutely ecstatic when I first sniffed it at a department store counter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, I am disappointed by its longevity. I know fragrances work differently with everyone&#x27;s body chemistry, but Cool Water does not last on me. After two hours, it&#x27;s like I didn&#x27;t use any perfume. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will work better for you. I&#x27;m looking for something else.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years, I&#x27;m just as happy with this bottle as I have been with every other bottle of cool water I have ever had :-)</li>
            <li> excellent product, 100% recommended ... very happy with Amazon</li>
            <li> great for the summer - it is exactly what it is called.  Cool Water.  refreshing wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cool Water for over 7 years, this is the first time that the contents of the bottle came out in a heavy stream instead of a fine mist and it burns when first applied. It also does not have the same scent. I was thrilled to get the product at such a great price but I will not order perfume through here again.</li>
            <li> This is one of those amazing fragrances that, when you wear it, strangers will come up to you and tell you that you smell great! This was a good price for a great product!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing. Fresh feel. Stays for longer. Just a little spray and u spell amazing the whole day</li>
            <li> After searching through brand name after brand name, I came across this product. I remembered how much I liked Cool Water in my younger years and decided to try this as a gift for my wife. She loved and wears it every day.</li>
            <li> I think I prefer men&#x27;s cool water than women</li>
            <li> Super happy üòå it smells good and it stays throughout  the day..  Super relieved its the real thing</li>
            <li> My son found this on one of the big sales and said &amp;#34;buy it mom!&amp;#34;  Well, I did.  I&#x27;ve never done that before.  I usually have to smell it first!  It arrived today and I really love it.  It has a citrus smell to it and will be perfect for spring and summer.  Its light and fresh.  Really glad I took a chance and bought it.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap knock off. Very mild scent. Not the same as a store bought bottle. Beware!</li>
            <li> A very nice scent - not the fresh outdoorsy scent I expected, but still very nice and subtle.  It has a faint flowery smell but not overpowering. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Item was exact to how it was described . Fast shipping and product packaged good.</li>
            <li> Total excellent satisfaction Perfume</li>
            <li> It is the same product one would buy in Mervyn&#x27;s or Sears, but cheaper and delivered to your home.  I have already placed a second order from them.  Good job!!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent! Glad I took a chance and bought!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff.  Over the last decade I have bought it for a lot of girlfriends.  Definitly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fragrance smells great so far and last as it should.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume&lt;br /&gt;Always get lots of compliments</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments with this perfume, so I&#x27;m glad to have it in a larger size bottle for a decent price.</li>
            <li> My favorite and I receive many compliments when I wear it#</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite and for a wonderful price.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance many years ago. It still smells great!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Seller shipped quickly! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The perfume more than met my expectations.  I&#x27;m just disappointed that when I went back the next day to order more, the price had practically doubled.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Really like it.. The best perfume in the market. Highly recommended to everyone..would like to buy again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s not too heady, but has a fresh scent.  Wearable every day.  Thanks amazon, you&#x27;re absoulutely the best place to shop.</li>
            <li> It didnt have the plastic wrap that all perfume bottles have.and 1/5th of the perfume was not there.anyone can clearly say that its used.Dont buy this product.M disappointed with amazon.</li>
            <li> It was a very good deal to get a genuine perfume in a very cheap price. Smells good and last for a good time (not very long though). Amazon is doing a great job. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I recently got this for my girlfriend who wasn&#x27;t wearing much perfume.  I&#x27;ve always liked the Cool Water fragrances, and she likes it a lot too.  It seems to be a very light scent though as it&#x27;s barely noticeable, even in close quarters.  I&#x27;m going to ask her to use more next time and see if that works better.  Anyway, the scent is a nice clean, refreshing scent that isn&#x27;t too floral or overpowering.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Not too powerful and not too boring. Actually ordered the wrong perfume...was supposed to order the &#x27;Wave&#x27; but ended up keeping this for myself. Don&#x27;t put too much on as it will be a bit strong. Spray and step into the mist and you are good to go!</li>
            <li> got this item for a gift. the bottle was a good condition however the box was in poor condition, as if they reused the box before. i feel like they package was open before. usually theres a tight clear plastic paper wrap around the box.</li>
            <li> Love love love it the fragrance lasted longer than when I buy it at the drugstore I was impressed!</li>
            <li> great quality and came fast.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Just as my expectations i love it</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!  I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume since high school and love the scent. It&#x27;s just right! It smells pleasant not to strong but enough that others know you are wearing it. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I got the perfume, I was waiting for it, and got it on time! Started using it as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> The perfume itself is great, and I love it, the package is not that good, no wrapping, and the perfume bottle itself is not full, it looks like it has been used before! This was supposed to be a gift but it can&#x27;t be gifted like that...</li>
            <li> Love it. Received package on time. Great gift for my daughter on her first mothers day. Thank you</li>
            <li> Item arrived unwrapped causing half of the bottle to be out of the box when i opened the package. If it wasn&#x27;t for a mother&#x27;s day gift I would have returned it but luckily my mom liked it and confirmed it smelled legit.</li>
            <li> One of the nicest fragrances  around!</li>
            <li> Terrific product for a great price!  The shipping was outstanding and very prompt.  It sure beat fighting the crowds and the traffic.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very fresh and light.  It has a floral base with a light overtone of cucumber or melon which make it airy and refreshing without making the wearer smell like a \\&quot;fruit salad.\\&quot;  It seems to me, however, a perfume that speaks more of a younger person than I am; or perhaps a more youthful fragrance than I usually wear.  I tend to prefer deeper sents with overtones of sandlewood or other woody scents.  Would make an especially nice gift for a teen or 20-something.</li>
            <li> great product for a gift</li>
            <li> the box looked used and I was  upset because it was a gift and had no time to buy another, I was very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I just love the sweet smell cool water has, smells great.</li>
            <li> Loved this scent on women for years. Gave it to my wife over 10 years ago and still prefer this over her many other more expensive perfumes.</li>
            <li> did not use but looks good</li>
            <li> This perfume is one of my wife&#x27;s favorites.  It competes right up there with some of her expensive perfumes like Burberry Brit.  The Cool Water scent is both gentle and lasting.  Two thumbs up from my wife and I.</li>
            <li> Great price and the wife loves it</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell like original one what i bought from macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent.  Packaged well, arrived quickly.  Thank You!!</li>
            <li> I always feel happy about it, because I love this perfum and I buy with prime and was here on time!</li>
            <li> Love the product and love the price more!!</li>
            <li> Great scent at a great price!</li>
            <li> This product smells fresh and crisp. Love it</li>
            <li> Just what my love like it</li>
            <li> I bought this to my wife and she loves it a lot. The design of this bottle is elegant and we both love the smell of this perfume. Got this one  with a great deal so it&#x27;s worth every penny. I would recommend this to guys who are looking for an inexpensive gift for their wifes/gfs</li>
            <li> I love the smell, buy a gift to my wife and she loves it, and now she uses it daily.</li>
            <li> classy smell, long lasting, great price. great product. love it</li>
            <li> i bought this nice battle for a friend of mine, and so far i hear no complains, she loves it and i loved the price and the good service; i will buy it again because the price is just right.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so overrated. It smells OK, the scent is not lasting and is too subtle. The male scent is far better. It is barely worn. Sorry I bought it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for her birthday, and she really like it. It smells so smooth and wonderful. Oh, it definitely catches guys&#x27; attention too!</li>
            <li> glad to find my go to perfume at an affordable price. smells like the stuff i&#x27;ve bought at the usual expensive department stores.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Repeat customer now and in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and it lasted longer than I anticipated. would recommend to others.  will purchase in the future hopefully.</li>
            <li> excellent product reached me in time</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent, you cant go wrong with Davidoff. Used daily for office and get compliments all the time. The price is extra bonus!! :)</li>
            <li> fragrance didnt last long. didnt look like an original piece which i received. not happy with the product. Amazon shipping was on time as usual.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and product was accurate</li>
            <li> Outstanding, just like in the department stores, but at less than half the price.</li>
            <li> The scent is VERY light . . . which is nice, but I thought nobody were smell the pleasant fragrance. Much to my surprise a co-worker said &amp;#34;who smells so good . . . is that Cool Water?&amp;#34;  So, I guess others can smell it, but I can&#x27;t !</li>
            <li> This was a nice gift to my wife and she loved it.  It was received quickly and at a good price.  If you are looking for some Cool Water this is the place to buy it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a young friend of mine who only wears this.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Five star service....couldn&#x27;t have been better....Thanks Again</li>
            <li> It was opened and used.</li>
            <li> I am 38 so I am a fan of Cool Water, especially the one for men, the womens version, is also very fresh, not very flowery, it is also very light which is a plus and a minus.</li>
            <li> Great perfume...been wearing it everyday...super love it! Satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Have got a lot of compliments about how pleasant the smell from my perfume is and how refreshing!!! Very pleased with this product!!!!</li>
            <li> The aroma is soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents and I refuse to pay full price in the department stores. Received it in a few days and am very pleased! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great perfume.  My fiance loved it. And the price was awesome. Lower than anywhere else.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good price</li>
            <li> Extremely refreshing fragrance, Tried a lot and they are good but but somehow always resort to this one!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because I really love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> As I loved the scent of the male version of this, I got one for myself. I am not disappointed, though it is, of course, much more feminine.</li>
            <li> Great perfume at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this off and on for years. For me,a little goes a long way. Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this fragrance is by far the best! If you are shopping for teenage girl, you would absolutely love this fragrance! Its not expensive and it such a soft scent, expecially for a young lady!</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. I never tried Davidoff cool water perfume. The scent soft, citrus and fresh. I used it my sleeve of my shirt n at night when I was in my&lt;br /&gt;PJs my arm still had the scent of it after changing the dress where I put on.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the scent. And I would say it is long lasting. These days all perfumes have same duration of scent.</li>
            <li> I just love dis ,product as described</li>
            <li> This is a lovely light fragrance that is wonderful for summertime but can easily be worn through all seasons of the year.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister. The box had no plastic wrapping and it looked like very worn off, scratched and a little teared. The bottle is ok size and ok, its fine that it has that thing on the bottom so they don&#x27;t give you as much product but then its also only 3/4 filled.... -__-&#x27; Never again!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE, RECEIVED EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED, GREAT BUY, DON&#x27;T UNDERSTAND THE BAD REVIEWS. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS, IT&#x27;S THE SAME AS IF I BOUGHT IT IN A STORE. DELIVERY WAS REALLY FAST. IF YOU&#x27;RE A FAN OF COOL WATER, YOU WON&#x27;T FIND A BETTER PRICE.</li>
            <li> It came faster than I expected, the wifey opened the package and was surprised that finally she got something for her. Lots of points for me.... She loves Cool Water and was happy to get a bottle before Valentines day...</li>
            <li> For man, for woman, for cat, for dog.&lt;br /&gt;For you.</li>
            <li> good one! bought it as a Christmas gift to my aunt she loves it.Good deal on Amazon.will buy more in the future</li>
            <li> I liked it as it looked good. looks original and smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it as it looked good. looks original and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a gift!</li>
            <li> i heard it is fake, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> got it at a great price, and it smells great. Does seem slightly watered down compared to the old formula that I remember in the 90&#x27;s. I used to think people who claimed that in amazon reviews were crazy but now i&#x27;m starting to understand where they are coming from.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling fragrance at a great price. Wifey liked it very much. The fragrance is mild, flowery essense that is not too strong and comes in a cute little bottle. Highly recommend to anyone at this price of $14.99.</li>
            <li> love the smell of cool water</li>
            <li> I got this online for myself dad and have always loved it. Its a nice subtle tone, watery, fresh and this amazon price online makes it even better.</li>
            <li> this was given as a gift. the person loves the smell and does not indicate is is nothing but the real deal, some knock amazon as having other than original manuf. products in this department, I have not found this to be ture.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty. I enjoy it. Product was shipped withing 7 days and was nicely packaged Thanks!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent,and describes it as a clean and refreshing...straight out of the shower smell. I like the way it smells on her and will continue to add it to her wish list of parfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Worries!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected at a wonderful price!</li>
            <li> It smells Great, and my Lady likes it.  What else you need to know about it? ! ! ! !</li>
            <li> las especificaciones descritas en la pagina del producto se ajusta con el fisico del mismo, por lo que este cubre las espectativas.</li>

            <li> Beautiful soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> Fantastic fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> It is a good product meets specifications, is good quality and best price is even worth it. Since I use has not presented any problems. Recommended 100%.</li>
            <li> Excellent parfum. Excellent service.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent off and on since high school. It is still and will always be one of my all time favorites. It has a light crisp scent that is very unique. It is not overpowering or heavy. It truly reminds me of the ocean with hints of lily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t pick up any fruity notes; I would say it is closer to a floral scent. This is certainly a summer or spring time scent. Very refreshing. I read a review of the perfume not lasting long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips when applying perfume;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Moisturize your skin while damp, this will help the perfume stay longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Allow Moisturizer to absorb and dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Before dressing, spritz on each wrist, behind the ear, behind the knee and/ or at your elbow. These are pulse points where the natural heat of the skin slowly releases the ingredients in the perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Do NOT rub wrists together after you spray, this will break down the ingredients in the perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow these steps your scent will stay on all day long.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this product in stores, and was pleased with my buying experience here. Perfume came as described.</li>
            <li> Came in time.perfume smell original.</li>
            <li> Excelente Perfume y Original</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It has such a clean and fresh sent to it that lasts a fairly long time.  You can put this on in the morning and smell it through out the afternoon.  It has been around for a long time and I still love it as much as I did when I discovered it.</li>
            <li> Cool Water is the perfect fragrance to wear in the summer heat.  The scent is clean and refreshing, not overpowering.  I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
            <li> Cool Water for Women is a very summer-ish fragrance. It is something that keeps me fresh the entire day! Plus the color of the bottle is really cool!</li>
            <li> My husband is obsessed with this perfume, so I bought it, but personally, its a little strong, like when I stray it, it gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with both the product and the pricing. Last week the same item was twice the price at my local drugstore. Item shipped quickly, in fact the rest of my order hasn&#x27;t even shipped yet. The packing was a bit basic but the spray and the box arrived in good condition from OTC Trading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for years so I compared it to my almost-empty spray bought several years ago from a major department store and this one is exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be. So far it&#x27;s still hanging in there 18 hours after I tried a quick spritz. Great choice for someone who doesn&#x27;t like heavy or spicy scents and wants something more natural. It seems like one of those fragrances that should be put on early and allowed to mellow a bit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews and claims that this product is fake. I was somewhat hesitant to order it because of the reviews here, but I decided to take the chance. Besides, \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\\&quot; -- how could that possibly be fake?! It&#x27;s not. This is the legitimate product, packaged in bubble wrap, new box, unopened, full bottle, with real perfume inside. What a concept! Not only that, but I selected \\&quot;Free Super Saver Shipping\\&quot; which said it would arrive within two weeks. It was here in TWO DAYS. Thanks Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others complained that the scent is too weak. I have a tendency to agree, but guess what? That&#x27;s what \\&quot;eau de toilette\\&quot; means: it&#x27;s not as concentrated as perfume. So if you are looking for a strong perfume, find one that actually says \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; or \\&quot;parfum\\&quot; on the label! But if you&#x27;re happy with Cool Water like it is (as I am), then order this and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected,fast delivery and the product is authentic.</li>
            <li> would recommend it to every one</li>
            <li> Disappointed because it doesn&#x27;t really smell like the real deal.</li>
            <li> This product arrived unsealed, used, and the sprayer didn&#x27;t work. I just threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  It is a light, clean, crisp scent that isn&#x27;t musky at all.  I have worn it for years and try to layer it with the lotion...excellent and speedy service from Amazon!</li>
            <li> its great that i can have this sent right to my door.&lt;br /&gt;and having the larger size is a plus also!</li>
            <li> Poor packaging, it looked like a returned product. Neither does the fragrance last.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this from Amazon thinking it would be better from others; but it turned out to be worst! Amazon won&#x27;t let me return this product.</li>
            <li> If in a 100-200 years, history will speak of one fragrance, it must be of cool water by davidoff. i have been buying cool water men &amp; women for many years and the fragrance keeps getting better and better!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  Received very quickly.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this stuff, so that&#x27;s all that matters.  Come to think of it, I kind of like it too. ; )</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase. Very responsible seller. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> LOVE this perfume!  And this is a really great deal.  The 1.7 oz size is sold at WalMart for $29.99.  Package arrived intact and on time.  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> when I was younger so I had to purchase it again, I been without it forever so I had to recapture them...</li>
            <li> i am completly satisfy i tell my friends the name  and also the price is incredible some are allready buying it. thanks</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant and strong smells make me so sick. This perfume is just enough to smell and last all day, without overdoing it!</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for some oneas a thank you gift.  I personally do not like it. It was sent to Fl.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and lasts for a long time. I loved it!</li>
            <li> Really nice. Not an overwhelming or cloying scent. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this smell. Especially for this price I double love!</li>
            <li> Great product. Perfect packaging</li>
            <li> Original package, cool smell...</li>
            <li> A wonderful and unique fragrance.  I cannot get enough of it.  I love when my fiance wears it.  It&#x27;s not over powering and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;m very happy about my purchase!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, got it at a steal of a price!!!</li>
            <li> The perfume was delivered fast.  The perfume is one of the best scents out there!!  My boyfriend is crazy about it!!  Thank you so much! Wonderful in every way!!  I should order more actually! !</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and hope she likes it. I had no idea before buying this, so opened it and checked before actually gifting it :P.Looks and smells decent though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reall a good deal!</li>
            <li> The perfume seems a knock-off version, the smell is not the same and it goes away pretty quick. Seems liquid. Please do not purchase it. It is cheap and I guess it means that it is not real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try as I expected Amazon to do better than selling imitations. But I guess I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> My wife loved it. DAVIDOFF all the way.</li>
            <li> I was drawn to this product by the description and the packaging (which I felt reflected the description).  I was expecting the scent to be lighter and fresh.  I was looking for a nice summer fragrance but this falls short of the mark.  It does not leave me feeling refreshed rather I feel a bit overpowered by the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, and she is loving it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my best fragrance, but for this price it is great for everyday use! Very fresh and stays pretty long time.</li>
            <li> 100% original all good</li>
            <li> not pleased with product</li>
            <li> I have been using channel  for years. Wanted to try something  different  and bought this reading review but I didn&#x27;t  like it and wouldn&#x27;t  buy it again. I don&#x27;t  think there is anything special about this perfume. This is just an ordinary  perfume.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about ordering due to the negative reviews, but I received the real deal and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase! üòç</li>
            <li> Real Deal.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, product arrived as described.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent for anyone that don&#x27;t care for heavy, musky scents or that have problems wearing oil based perfumes. I agree with another reviewer that the scent isn&#x27;t long lived, but it IS toilette water, not perfume. I personally love several scents that I cannot wear because they become too heavy and cloying after a short period. I wear Cool Water mostly in the spring/summer and use my other &#x27;go to&#x27; scent of Anais Anais which is a bit heavier during fall and winter. I would suggest this to anyone that likes a light scent and tends to have problems with other scents/perfumes becoming too sweet/heavy after wearing for a few hours. The small sizes or the lotion is a great scent pick me up to carry in your purse for touch ups. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and don&#x27;t really think of it as a young person/teens fragrance but more an natural, refreshing, outdoor scent for women of all ages.</li>
            <li> un buen perfume nos gusta la fragancia es suave y duradera. lo recomiendo les aseguro que le van a preguntar donde lo adquirio.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and it last quite long, even longer than expected!</li>
            <li> absolutely love this perfume and thank Amazon for the wonderful sale just recently - I always buy here because Amazon always has the best prices - thank you</li>
            <li> this was a great price for a perfume that I buy my client every year, it&#x27;s her favorite and I get it right away!</li>
            <li> I like this scent because it is very clean-smelling and feminine, in my opinion.  However, the bottle&#x27;s design makes it a bit of a challenge to grip and spray.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I think the neck on the bottle is just too long.  The eau de toilette, however, is wonderful.  Get the whole set if you can find it reasonably priced. It includes shower gel and body lotion with the scent spray.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and the scent is long lasting and neutral enough to wear on many occasions</li>
