            <li> I first tried this in a salon in columbus. I Fell in Luv with it right away. I am a mixed cuban mexican and my hair is so thick and curly and i relax it and i have to part my hair in sections just to wash it plus my hair is right below my shoulder blades. Ive used all types of shampoo but they dont clean, smell, moisterize, and defrizz like this shampoo. Salon brand and many store bought shampoos do not compare. I recommend this shampoo to anyone who has curly or relaxed ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this shampoo.  My daughter is transitioning from relaxed to natural and this makes her hair so soft.</li>

            <li> I had never used this product before. I love what it does for my hair and I would recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I began using the product after watching several Loc videos by Damian Walter. He suggested trying his system which includes the shampoo and moisturizing conditioner.  I was hesitant at first because I had bought into the idea that Locs couldn&#x27;t be conditioned. I am so glad I decided to buy the product because not only have I seen a considerable amount of growth using his system by my Locs have grown a noticeable amount in the last month or so!!!! It is worth the money. The only issue I had initially is that it does not suds up like the drugs store brands on the first wash yet,, it feels cleaner; evermore so when I use a clarifying shampoo first.</li>
            <li> Very good for natural hair</li>

            <li> My hair feels so soft after shampooing. I haven&#x27;t had a chemical relaxer in my hair since July because of breakage and thinning.</li>
            <li> I like Desgin products, as my stylist uses them, but the shampoo was not the best when using it. There was no lather the first two washes, I&#x27;d hate to go through the bottle quickly because of this.</li>
            <li> Nice product. I can see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair feel so soft and good. I was loving it. It has a nice sweet scent to it.</li>
            <li> Good results for my thick, coarse hair. Helped to prevent breakage and leave my hair looking healthy. Recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> Using this product has improved the health of my hair. I have thick, course hair that needs a lot of maintenance. This shampoo leaves it feeling soft and hydrated. Not sold in stores... this product is of professional quality. It smells great too. Try it.</li>
