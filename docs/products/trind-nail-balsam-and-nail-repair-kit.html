    <ol>
            <li>THANK YOU, TRIND, for giving me what I never thought I could have - nails that I feel good about!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used trind faithfully now for about a year and my nails are gorgeous!</li>
            <li>My nails stool have a way to go before they look great</li>
            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>But now I don&#x27;t need salon services to have great nails.</li>
            <li>a nice neutral shade will look very nice and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably keep using the buffer, though, and I&#x27;m going to miss the balsam, which felt good on my nails, although my cuticles have never been drier or more brittle.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think I could ever grow my own nails.  </li>
            <li>Much to my great surprise and delight, my nails are significantly stronger than ever before.</li>
            <li>I finally have nails, I have purchased every product, this is the best.  </li>
            <li>and I recommend it to all who care to know about better care of your nails</li>
            <li>okay?</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many.</li>
            <li>The polish protects and strengthens them even more.  </li>
            <li>so I make sure to not let it touch skin.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of the nail balm and the nail repair has done wonders for my nails.</li>
            <li>Helps keep nails healthy and strong and enables them to grow.</li>
            <li>It has turned my nails into strong and healthy nails.  </li>
            <li>People cannot believe that these are my real nails, they look that good.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get the special nail file also.</li>
            <li>had all but given up on the prospect of any product working for me until I read something that confirmed what I&#x27;d suspected for some time</li>
            <li>Primarily, I feel this is an excellent value because the amount of product you&#x27;re getting for the price goes a pretty long way.</li>
            <li>My nails mostly stopped splitting at the ends (a real pain when you work in the garden</li>
            <li>This is because I used both products with success</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, here is what I did -</li>
            <li>and I wanted to endorse them in as many places as possible to maximize the likelihood that those considering purchase will see my testimonials.&lt;br</li>
            <li>exactly</li>
            <li>After the first 2 (even 3) weeks, my nails seemed a bit stronger, but they were still flimsy and still cracking at the sides.</li>
            <li>my* nails, I&#x27;m confident that it can help many, if not most others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the beginning I did not think it worked because my nails were very soft, but  In about a month my nails are actually over the nail bed and very strong.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d pretty much lost hope that anything else was a possibility for me</li>
            <li>However, given how resistant to other products my nails have always been and how dramatically they&#x27;ve improved with Trind, I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a fair try.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Trind is responsible.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>so they get a chance to really harden and air out.</li>
            <li>-  Essentially, products that are brushed on one layer on-top of another really can&#x27;t make a significant difference for nails in need of real help because the fresh product doesn&#x27;t make contact with (and thus can&#x27;t penetrate) the nail&#x27;s surface.</li>
            <li>how different the over-all condition of my nails is right now for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>After 6 weeks of frequent use (much more frequent than prescribed), I&#x27;ve only gone through about 2/3.</li>
            <li>All ten of my nails are long and strong and they&#x27;re mine!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend .</li>
            <li>No matter how quickly I acted or how tiny the initial split was, nothing would prevent these splits from progressing right across the nail.</li>
            <li>Although it is possible to purchase the individual components of this kit on their own, in my experience they are both critical.</li>
            <li>Each day, the previous day&#x27;s layer must be removed with non-acetone polish remover and replaced with a fresh coat of Nail Balsam, followed by a fresh coat of</li>
            <li>Let me be clear - my mind was open enough to allow Trind a fair shot, but I definitely did not expect major results because frankly, I&#x27;ve heard it all before and products that are near-universally miraculous for others have never worked for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s only in the last 2 weeks (weeks 5 and 6 of consistent use) that I&#x27;ve started going &amp;#34;Woah, are these really MY nails?&amp;#34; If you&#x27;re starting out with super- crummy nails like mine, I recommend you go in expecting it to take a month of consistent, proper use (maybe even a little more) before you&#x27;re jumping for joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, I did find one other product that seemed to make my nails a tiny bit stronger, but before trying Trind, they never got more than a little less flimsy and they never stopped splitting at the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Before using Trind, absolutely nothing, however highly recommended or raved about, helped enough to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to report that for the past 6 weeks, I have been using the Trind Nail Repair and Nail Balsam and they have actually *</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was not working because my nails were still thin, but I have been wearing acrylic nails for 13 years or more</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who has problems with weak, splitting nails that break and chip very easily.</li>
            <li>Although Trind seems confident that 2 weeks of daily use should be long enough to heal what ails your nails (heh!), in my case it took longer.</li>
            <li>which was that in order to see true improvement of real problem nails, both must be applied to naked nails daily for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this system (with the buffer that comes with the complete kit) per the instructions for four or five years.</li>
            <li>a lot and soil gets *inside* -- not under -- the nail) early in the process</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li>Happily surprised at my nails within 2weeks---FINALLYðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>I have been using this product so far for 3 weeks as instructed and I can already see a marked improvement in my nails.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t just say this because it works so much better than other, more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>* how I finally made my crummy nails much nicer, I will offer some info/advice below that I obtained from some  customer reviews at various sites around the web:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they still break deep down in the quick.</li>
            <li>Now, I didn&#x27;t notice significant results till after the second bottle AND faithfully applying it everyday, but if you give it time it WILL work.</li>
            <li>recently, no matter what, my nails had two main (possibly related) issues: 1.</li>
            <li>Most importantly though, I&#x27;ve been nothing short of shocked by the dramatic decrease in the ever-present splitting/cracking for the first time EVAR.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I would nurture any tiny amount of growth (with topical treatments, proper unidirectional filing, etc), the little white tips would always, always start splitting at the side some time before reaching about 1/8 inch.</li>

            <li> know that this brand may seem expensive at first glance, but let me assure you that from my perspective, it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Following that, I applied every other day (same application routine as above) for about a week, and then I resumed near-daily use about a week ago.</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t read other testimonials saying 2 weeks wasn&#x27;t quite enough to see results (and in some cases, that it took several weeks for the WOW-style improvement), I might have given up.</li>
            <li> your initial purchase will last a little over 2 months, and if you use it as recommended, you&#x27;ll probably get enough product for 3 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who wish to know *</li>
            <li> I  will not let my nails get nearly as long as my acrylics were...</li>
            <li> The honest-to-goodness truth is that in the last 2 weeks, my nails have grown little white tips that haven&#x27;t split and/or needed to be trimmed off at all!</li>
            <li> My nails generally peel and are not strong at all.  </li>
            <li> Although Trind prescribes the above routine daily for the first two weeks followed by a break and then intermittent application a couple of times a week, my nails were bad enough that I chose to follow guidelines I found in a number of reviews.</li>
            <li> Because they would always occur right where the nail bed ended and the tip began, if left unattended the inevitable result was a painful, unsightly (occasionally infected) mess.</li>
            <li> As a life-time nail biter whose nails were so very thin whenever I attempted to grow them, I think I have finally quit thanks to TRIND Nail Repair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably take a break for a few days again now and then do every other day (3 or 4 times a week) for awhile before I drop back to twice a week or less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the past 2 decades, I&#x27;ve spoken to about a billion nail techs and tried everything they recommended from brush-on treatments (e.g. Nailtiques, Pink Armor, etc) to lotions (e.g. Mane N&#x27; Tail Hoof Maker) to dietary remedies (e.g. gelatin, various vitamins).</li>
            <li> They were extremely weak/thin and overly flexible.</li>
            <li> BUT I am seeing a difference due to using TRIND.</li>
            <li> (my nails were always so weird even high-end salon artificials would pop right off after a few days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to cut down on the cost of my trips to the nail salon and avoid the carcinogenic vapors</li>
            <li> That said, it can dry out your cuticles pretty bad</li>
            <li> They were brittle,  terribly short, striped and thin as paper.</li>
            <li> What I mean by this is, they&#x27;re much less flexible and they feel thicker and &amp;#34;harder.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot over-state</li>
            <li> /&gt;I must start by explaining that life-long, I have had terrible, stubby nails with problems that were resistant to absolutely every remedy I could find (specifics below).</li>
            <li> Since I was a kid, I&#x27;ve typically worn my nails in this ugly, stubby condition</li>
            <li> Granted, I haven&#x27;t done a blind trial of Trind versus a placebo (I didn&#x27;t have someone to help with it every day</li>
            <li> Very expensive for no results.</li>
            <li> Painful and ugly.</li>
            <li> I use it alone or as a base coat.</li>

            <li> Did not do anything as advertised.  Very expensive for no results. Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I finally have nails, I have purchased every product, this is the best.  I will be back and I recommend it to all who care to know about better care of your nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system (with the buffer that comes with the complete kit) per the instructions for four or five years. My nails mostly stopped splitting at the ends (a real pain when you work in the garden a lot and soil gets *inside* -- not under -- the nail) early in the process but they still break deep down in the quick. Painful and ugly. So I&#x27;m thinking of taking a break for a while, using something cheaper, and seeing what happens then. I&#x27;ll probably keep using the buffer, though, and I&#x27;m going to miss the balsam, which felt good on my nails, although my cuticles have never been drier or more brittle.</li>
            <li> Please note that this review is almost identical to those I left for the individual components of this kit (Trind Nail Repair &amp; Trind Nail Balsam). This is because I used both products with success and I wanted to endorse them in as many places as possible to maximize the likelihood that those considering purchase will see my testimonials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise that what you&#x27;re about to read is a legitimate customer review and not an advertisement or commercial product endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must start by explaining that life-long, I have had terrible, stubby nails with problems that were resistant to absolutely every remedy I could find (specifics below). Over the past 2 decades, I&#x27;ve spoken to about a billion nail techs and tried everything they recommended from brush-on treatments (e.g. Nailtiques, Pink Armor, etc) to lotions (e.g. Mane N&#x27; Tail Hoof Maker) to dietary remedies (e.g. gelatin, various vitamins). Before using Trind, absolutely nothing, however highly recommended or raved about, helped enough to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until recently, no matter what, my nails had two main (possibly related) issues: 1. They were extremely weak/thin and overly flexible. 2. No matter how much I would nurture any tiny amount of growth (with topical treatments, proper unidirectional filing, etc), the little white tips would always, always start splitting at the side some time before reaching about 1/8 inch. No matter how quickly I acted or how tiny the initial split was, nothing would prevent these splits from progressing right across the nail. Because they would always occur right where the nail bed ended and the tip began, if left unattended the inevitable result was a painful, unsightly (occasionally infected) mess. Thus once a split would start, I had no choice but to clip the entire tip off. Since I was a kid, I&#x27;ve typically worn my nails in this ugly, stubby condition and I&#x27;d pretty much lost hope that anything else was a possibility for me (my nails were always so weird even high-end salon artificials would pop right off after a few days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I did find one other product that seemed to make my nails a tiny bit stronger, but before trying Trind, they never got more than a little less flimsy and they never stopped splitting at the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had all but given up on the prospect of any product working for me until I read something that confirmed what I&#x27;d suspected for some time -  Essentially, products that are brushed on one layer on-top of another really can&#x27;t make a significant difference for nails in need of real help because the fresh product doesn&#x27;t make contact with (and thus can&#x27;t penetrate) the nail&#x27;s surface. This, combined with the countless Trind testimonials all over the web inspired me to give it a try. Let me be clear - my mind was open enough to allow Trind a fair shot, but I definitely did not expect major results because frankly, I&#x27;ve heard it all before and products that are near-universally miraculous for others have never worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to report that for the past 6 weeks, I have been using the Trind Nail Repair and Nail Balsam and they have actually *drastically* improved my nails! Much to my great surprise and delight, my nails are significantly stronger than ever before. What I mean by this is, they&#x27;re much less flexible and they feel thicker and &amp;#34;harder.&amp;#34; Most importantly though, I&#x27;ve been nothing short of shocked by the dramatic decrease in the ever-present splitting/cracking for the first time EVAR. I say &amp;#34;dramatic decrease&amp;#34; because I&#x27;m scared to jinx it. okay? The honest-to-goodness truth is that in the last 2 weeks, my nails have grown little white tips that haven&#x27;t split and/or needed to be trimmed off at all! I seriously cannot over-state how different the over-all condition of my nails is right now for the first time in my life. I&#x27;m a scientist so believe me, I&#x27;ve been watching out for the possibility that something otherthan Trind is responsible. Granted, I haven&#x27;t done a blind trial of Trind versus a placebo (I didn&#x27;t have someone to help with it every day or I would have), but other than that I&#x27;ve been as diligent as possible and as far as I can tell, the only thing that could account for the drastic change is Trind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that this brand may seem expensive at first glance, but let me assure you that from my perspective, it really isn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t just say this because it works so much better than other, more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried. Primarily, I feel this is an excellent value because the amount of product you&#x27;re getting for the price goes a pretty long way. After 6 weeks of frequent use (much more frequent than prescribed), I&#x27;ve only gone through about 2/3. So figure if you use it as often as I have (see below) your initial purchase will last a little over 2 months, and if you use it as recommended, you&#x27;ll probably get enough product for 3 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who wish to know *exactly* how I finally made my crummy nails much nicer, I will offer some info/advice below that I obtained from some  customer reviews at various sites around the web:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Although it is possible to purchase the individual components of this kit on their own, in my experience they are both critical. I followed what I&#x27;d read in several reviews which was that in order to see true improvement of real problem nails, both must be applied to naked nails daily for the first few weeks. Each day, the previous day&#x27;s layer must be removed with non-acetone polish remover and replaced with a fresh coat of Nail Balsam, followed by a fresh coat of Nail Repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Although Trind prescribes the above routine daily for the first two weeks followed by a break and then intermittent application a couple of times a week, my nails were bad enough that I chose to follow guidelines I found in a number of reviews. For what it&#x27;s worth, here is what I did - I used both productsreligiously every day (as described above) for 3 weeks solid and then took a break for about 4 days. Following that, I applied every other day (same application routine as above) for about a week, and then I resumed near-daily use about a week ago. I&#x27;ll probably take a break for a few days again now and then do every other day (3 or 4 times a week) for awhile before I drop back to twice a week or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Although Trind seems confident that 2 weeks of daily use should be long enough to heal what ails your nails (heh!), in my case it took longer. After the first 2 (even 3) weeks, my nails seemed a bit stronger, but they were still flimsy and still cracking at the sides. If I hadn&#x27;t read other testimonials saying 2 weeks wasn&#x27;t quite enough to see results (and in some cases, that it took several weeks for the WOW-style improvement), I might have given up. For me, it&#x27;s only in the last 2 weeks (weeks 5 and 6 of consistent use) that I&#x27;ve started going &amp;#34;Woah, are these really MY nails?&amp;#34; If you&#x27;re starting out with super- crummy nails like mine, I recommend you go in expecting it to take a month of consistent, proper use (maybe even a little more) before you&#x27;re jumping for joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, I obviously can&#x27;t guarantee with 100% certainty that your nails will respond the way mine did - Lord knows, I have read thousands of reviews like this for products that did nothing for me. However, given how resistant to other products my nails have always been and how dramatically they&#x27;ve improved with Trind, I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a fair try. If this can help *my* nails, I&#x27;m confident that it can help many, if not most others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review has been helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And THANK YOU, TRIND, for giving me what I never thought I could have - nails that I feel good about!</li>
            <li> Helps keep nails healthy and strong and enables them to grow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these 2 products as directed for 3 weeks  and can see an improvement in nails. I&#x27;m keeping nails short for now, letting them heal after 15+ years of acrylics.</li>
            <li> over priced product that did not deliver on promise.  DO NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a recommendation from a friend.  My nails generally peel and are not strong at all.  After using this product for a couple of weeks there has been a big improvement.  I use it alone or as a base coat.</li>
            <li> Just started using it a month ago. My nails stool have a way to go before they look great BUT I am seeing a difference due to using TRIND.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and love it.  It is the only thing that would help my nails after I took off acrylic nails.  It is great.</li>
            <li> These two products used together are a miracle nail treatment system. I have tried many. They have even repaired a nail that was permanently scarred, ridged and chipping from acrylics. I highly recommend .</li>
            <li> As a life-time nail biter whose nails were so very thin whenever I attempted to grow them, I think I have finally quit thanks to TRIND Nail Repair. The balsam softens and keeps my cuticles under control. It nourishes and strengthens my nails so they don&#x27;t tear. The polish protects and strengthens them even more.  Be sure to get the special nail file also.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal. I&#x27;ve used trind faithfully now for about a year and my nails are gorgeous! People cannot believe that these are my real nails, they look that good. Now, I didn&#x27;t notice significant results till after the second bottle AND faithfully applying it everyday, but if you give it time it WILL work. That said, it can dry out your cuticles pretty bad so I make sure to not let it touch skin. Hope you all give it a chance and it works as well for you as it did for me!</li>
            <li> I was told by a nail technician, to try trend.  I love it.  It has turned my nails into strong and healthy nails.  They stopped peeling and splitting.</li>
            <li> Happily surprised at my nails within 2weeks---FINALLYðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I have tried several nail strengtheners but nothing works like this! I love the smell of the nail balm and the nail repair has done wonders for my nails. They started out so weakened from all the filling the salons do. I used to get no chip polish just to keep them from breaking. But now I don&#x27;t need salon services to have great nails. All ten of my nails are long and strong and they&#x27;re mine!</li>
            <li> I have nails that peel and break.  This does the trick and I have tried everything else over the years...</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was not working because my nails were still thin, but I have been wearing acrylic nails for 13 years or more and I didn&#x27;t think I could ever grow my own nails.  They were brittle,  terribly short, striped and thin as paper. I wanted to cut down on the cost of my trips to the nail salon and avoid the carcinogenic vapors so I bought this product and the cuticle conditioner. In the beginning I did not think it worked because my nails were very soft, but  In about a month my nails are actually over the nail bed and very strong. I am not polishing them yet so they get a chance to really harden and air out. I rub the conditioner on my cuticles and massage it in. My cuticles are gone and I did not have to cut them,  It is a miracle! I  will not let my nails get nearly as long as my acrylics were...therey are &amp;#34;sport length&amp;#34;. a nice neutral shade will look very nice and soon even a french manicure I can do by myself.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product so far for 3 weeks as instructed and I can already see a marked improvement in my nails. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has problems with weak, splitting nails that break and chip very easily.</li>
