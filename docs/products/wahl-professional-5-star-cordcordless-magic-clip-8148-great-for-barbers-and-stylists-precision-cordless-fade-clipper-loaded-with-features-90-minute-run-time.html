            <li>Love the light weight!</li>
            <li>my go to clipper is now the wahl magic clipper.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s gotten slightly better</li>
            <li>, maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the metal blades gets more break-in to where they stop snagging.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m ordering one more.</li>
            <li>VERY POWERFUL, NEVER RUNS OUT OF POWER!</li>
            <li>... high and tights lol...</li>
            <li>This is a good machine thanks I got it on time 2</li>
            <li>LITE WEIGHT DESIGN IS EASY ON THE THE WRISTS AND HANDS.</li>
            <li>I love and own the oster 76, oster fast feed and the andis bgrv  clippers, but</li>
            <li>These are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>They glide easily and are hassle free.</li>
            <li>So far is good ,,,,,,</li>
            <li>I would give them 10 stars, great power (strong as corded clippers, if not stronger than some) and long battery life between charges.</li>
            <li>Being that I shave my head weekly, I needed some new clippers and after trying a couple different ones, these work the best!</li>
            <li>Other than that these are great clippers and I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li>great clippers i use them everyday</li>
            <li>the clipper is surprisingly powerful.  </li>
            <li>but they stopped charging right after a year of having them.</li>
            <li>The new blade cuts so smooth, plenty of power and battery life.  </li>
            <li>I use this clipper for personal use only and it did great job.</li>
            <li>THANKS WAHL!</li>
            <li>I use these on the daily and I love them</li>
            <li>They cut great in even thick curly hair..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I got these, and hoping they last me a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li>A PLEASURE DOING A FLAT TOP WITH THESE</li>
            <li>AND THE BLADE GETS VERY CLOSE</li>
            <li>The blue light cuts off after 3-5 minutes</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping it still charges when the blue light goes off.</li>
            <li>Really like these clippers.  </li>
            <li>Received these in the mail, standard packaging nothing special, charged them up as required and made adjustments to the blades immediately.</li>
            <li>The power of this clipper is amazing my Go to pair everyday at the shop!</li>
            <li>But I have to say I adapted quickly to the feel and use of these, quicker than I imagined actually.</li>
            <li>I found this clipper to be of high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended this clipper</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>First of all I have to say I&#x27;m a big fan of WAHL clippers.</li>
            <li>I readjusted mine after my first hair cut because of the soreness of my skin after their initial use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only one problem it didn&#x27;t come with a instruction manual I called wahl and they told me to let it charge overnight when I first get it.</li>
            <li>it is a professional quality clipper.</li>
            <li>in a busy salon.</li>
            <li>My only real issue here and this may or may not be due to the build or quality of the clipper, is when I use/make the raking motion to blend my hair it has snagged my hair a couple times and we all know what that feels like.</li>
            <li>They are a teeny bit louder than a normal clipper, due to them being cordless</li>
            <li>By far one of my personal favorites youd expect it to be somewhat weak consideing it being wireless, but yet is a powerful clipper.</li>
            <li>it is hard to beat a quality powerful cordless clipper.</li>

            <li> 5 stars enough said!!!! I&#x27;m a 20 years barber veteran and a long time Andis man and I use to hate cordless anything years ago. I decided to give cordless another try, since battery improvement. Whals out did themselves with this one. I would give them 10 stars, great power (strong as corded clippers, if not stronger than some) and long battery life between charges. Great job Whals.</li>
            <li> Great clippers... I&#x27;m deployed and use these on all my Joes.. it&#x27;s the perfect solution to dealing with 220w issues over seas... they are nice and light and cut like they are going through butter... these are exceptional when giving skin fades and my favorite... high and tights lol...</li>
            <li> Love the light weight! The power of this clipper is amazing my Go to pair everyday at the shop!</li>
            <li> This is a good machine thanks I got it on time 2</li>
            <li> Package came damaged&lt;br /&gt;And blade was dull</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE CLIPPERS! LITE WEIGHT DESIGN IS EASY ON THE THE WRISTS AND HANDS. VERY POWERFUL, NEVER RUNS OUT OF POWER! NO CORDS TO TRIP ON, OR DANGLE ON YOUR CLIENT. IT A PLEASURE DOING A FLAT TOP WITH THESE AND THE BLADE GETS VERY CLOSE, NO HAIR IS SKIPPED OR MISSED. BEST CLIPPERS I HAVE EVER HAD! I AM A VERY SATISFIED STYLIST AND WILL USE FROM HERE ON OUT. THANKS WAHL!</li>
            <li> I found this clipper to be of high quality. it is  solid and well built. it feels good in the hand and what a pleasure to have a cordless clipper. I use this clipper for personal use only and it did great job. the clipper is surprisingly powerful.  it is a professional quality clipper. it exceeded my expectations.  I love and own the oster 76, oster fast feed and the andis bgrv  clippers, but my go to clipper is now the wahl magic clipper. it is hard to beat a quality powerful cordless clipper.</li>

            <li> One of my fave clippers to do house calls💈👌</li>
            <li> Cuts great and keeps a charge. This is by far my best experience with a cordless clipper.</li>
            <li> So far is good ,,,,,,</li>
            <li> First of all I have to say I&#x27;m a big fan of WAHL clippers. Why did I opt to purchase these clippers? Well I&#x27;m over seas and even with a converter my conventional clippers just don&#x27;t operate correctly. The voltage still doesn&#x27;t regulate properly and my clippers go out of control basically so I intentionally looked to remedy this problem by going cordless. Received these in the mail, standard packaging nothing special, charged them up as required and made adjustments to the blades immediately. Took a few shoots to get the zero adjustment I was looking for so I can get the close cut I&#x27;m looking for. Be careful and use your hand or similar body part to test the sharpness as these are quite sharp out the box. I readjusted mine after my first hair cut because of the soreness of my skin after their initial use. At this point I&#x27;ve used them three times and they still cut close just like I like but still leaves my head/skin a little tender. I don&#x27;t mind the weight or lack there of. I know some like the weighted feel of standard cord clippers; I do also. But I have to say I adapted quickly to the feel and use of these, quicker than I imagined actually. My only real issue here and this may or may not be due to the build or quality of the clipper, is when I use/make the raking motion to blend my hair it has snagged my hair a couple times and we all know what that feels like. I&#x27;ve lubed and cleaned them after each use and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s gotten slightly better, maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the metal blades gets more break-in to where they stop snagging. This is the only reason I didn&#x27;t go 5 stars. If I&#x27;m at fault I apologize. Other than that these are great clippers and I&#x27;d purchase again. Hope this helps you in your decision.</li>
            <li> I have performed several hair cuts with out having to charge it. Wahl products are thee best!!</li>
            <li> Great clippers! They glide easily and are hassle free.</li>
            <li> By far one of my personal favorites youd expect it to be somewhat weak consideing it being wireless, but yet is a powerful clipper. Lightweight housing super comfortable and battery gives you a good run time! Highly recommended this clipper</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t ladt as long as if like but I also do an avg of 20 cuts a day</li>
            <li> I have had these since April and they are some heavy hitters. The crunch blade makes for a smoother fade and the battery is great. I get about 8-10cuts on one charge. I use these on the daily and I love them so I&#x27;m ordering one more. No cords is great and if it dies on you you can use them corded.</li>
            <li> Very good clipper........</li>
            <li> These are pretty amazing. I&#x27;ve used them for about a week now..in a busy salon. I&#x27;ve had no issues! I&#x27;ve done about 5 or 6 haircuts in a row with them without noticing any change in the strength of battery. They are a teeny bit louder than a normal clipper, due to them being cordless but really not noticeable. They cut great in even thick curly hair.. I&#x27;m really glad I got these, and hoping they last me a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 1 year later.&lt;br /&gt;They are amazing clippers but they stopped charging right after a year of having them. I just repurchased because they are great, just wished they lasted longer. I do 100+ cuts a week though, so that might be why.</li>
            <li> This clipper is awesome for self barbering. If youre in to self barbering you can&#x27;t go wrong with this clipper. It&#x27;s only one problem it didn&#x27;t come with a instruction manual I called wahl and they told me to let it charge overnight when I first get it. And afterwards let it charge for 1hr. The blue light cuts off after 3-5 minutes so I&#x27;m hoping it still charges when the blue light goes off. Performance wise these things are a mothafuckin beast. I&#x27;m just hoping everything is good with my charger. If you&#x27;re having the same problem or any suggestions please let me know.</li>
            <li> Really like these clippers.  Nice design, its lightweight and feels good in the hand.  The new blade cuts so smooth, plenty of power and battery life.  I highly recommend these.</li>
