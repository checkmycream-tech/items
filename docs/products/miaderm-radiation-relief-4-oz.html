            <li>My skin is doing great.</li>
            <li>doctor recommended it and said my skin did great</li>
            <li>I was happy I purchased it.</li>

            <li>It is not greasy and provides great relief.</li>
            <li>Great to find this needed product.</li>
            <li>is very effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an RN, I&#x27;m taking my health in my own hands and some of my Dr&#x27;s did not even know about it!</li>
            <li>she loved it and said it help with the pain.</li>
            <li>I have had good results with this and recommend it for those undergoing radiation treatments.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good to know it is there.&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
            <li>This product is quite good.</li>
            <li>10 more rounds of radiation, hoping it continues to work as great as it has been.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I was was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s working for so many people, but it just hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me.</li>
            <li>I felt it would be best to start right away</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product we used on our daughter&#x27;s skin as she was going through Proton Radiation.</li>
            <li>Miaderm was absolutely wonderful for me and worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Effective relief post radiation therapy.</li>
            <li>yes, nice smell.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>And I liked that this was a lotion as opposed to a gel (wasn&#x27;t sticky).  </li>
            <li>Others without the allergy issue may like it and find it works well for them - nice odor</li>
            <li>He liked it because it did not have a scent</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and absorbs nicely into skin.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the BEST cream to use.</li>
            <li>Too soon to say whether it&#x27;s been effective.  </li>
            <li>Great for your skin and helped my scar fade tremendously once I started to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this cream a day early and have found what an excellent improvement and use it 3 times a day</li>
            <li>My breast is becoming redder and redder and drier and more itchy by the day!</li>
            <li>Since I am a very light skinned redhead, my radiologist warned me of the possibilities of radiation burns to my chest during and remaining after treatments.  </li>
            <li>Put just a very light coating on the area - no need to slather it on.</li>
            <li>I did put it on more often some days, which is fine, as it feels SO nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I hope to never have to go through that again, but if I do, I will be ordering miaderm for sure....</li>
            <li>Gladly suggest to anybody going through treatments.</li>
            <li>This worked much better than Aquaphor or my aloe plant.</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Miaderm mostly at the end of the radiation process for healing.</li>
            <li>Just received two more tubes.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Pleased with product.</li>
            <li>Will continue to suggest this product and wish more radiation oncologists recommeded it to their patients.  </li>
            <li>Nothing more to say.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely yours</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than halfway through radiation treatment.</li>
            <li>More than $70 out the window.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use the Miaderm, since I purchased two tubes of it, but I&#x27;m going to step up the Aquaphor usage because it gives so much more relief at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Great product Works great when kept in the refrigerator and is extremely cooling and releaves breakdown of the skin.</li>
            <li>Being very fair skinned, I had a severe radiation burn so used it generously daily.  </li>
            <li>Used 3 different creams and had very good luck with my skin.</li>
            <li>It has made this ordeal so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but best I found for relieving itch due to radiation damage.</li>
            <li>I found Miaderm to be easy to apply and soothing.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply &amp; blends in well.</li>
            <li>Easy to dispense and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about $25.00 cheaper and easy to find.</li>
            <li>still was bright red and itching and so went online and found this cream to be rated as excellent by others who have dealt with the same situation</li>
            <li>it dries quickly, it probably dries out the skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;Needs to be applied ALOT more often than on the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What a blessing to have this available.</li>
            <li>It is odor free and does not stain clothes.</li>
            <li>Works great at preventing radiation related burns.</li>
            <li>The amount was perfect for one round of radiation therapy and the aftermath.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to see a dermatologist who confirmed that it was the Miaderm</li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I am getting just a bit of light redness around the area but</li>
            <li>We hope to never have to use the product again and that she will stay cancer free.</li>
            <li>Be sure and understand exactly what area is being irradiated so you are covering everything.  </li>
            <li>It was worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:    </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and you really have to look to find the radiation outline but some of my friends still have very pronounced skin discoloration.</li>
            <li>Great for radiation treatment, due to cancer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure those with smaller breasts would get more benefit from it.</li>
            <li>, I could see a tremendous improvement.  </li>
            <li>We highly recommend it:)</li>
            <li>I only have one more week of radiation left and my skin is doing great.  </li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly so it didn&#x27;t get all over my clothes or sheets.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but worth the cost</li>
            <li>this production is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>It was worth it and hope it works well for others.</li>
            <li>cream is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Thius product worked well and was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Somewhat pricey to some but worth the luxury and benefits derived...</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The cost was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Not the news anyone wants to hear, especially after dropping more than $70 on some lotion and applying it even more often than directed.     </li>
            <li>Worked as expected and smells good.</li>
            <li>I used this right after I finished radiation.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, works well, wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t help me very much.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.  </li>
            <li>and I think my skin post-lumpectomy and radiation maintained pretty well.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>She was going through enough without having to worry about one more thing.</li>
            <li>Patients need to spread the word about what really works!</li>
            <li>Miaderm worked very well on skin for radiation treatment!</li>
            <li>but it did a good job of eliminating the dead skin.</li>
            <li>At my last treatment, my doctor said, &amp;#34;your skin looks really good, no, your skin looks amazing.&amp;#34;  Continue to use for a week -10 days after your last treatment, as redness can still appear.</li>
            <li>I think I had better results from using pure Aloe Vera Gel and Eucerin that the Cancer Center gave me samples of.</li>
            <li>Miaderm really helped me with my skin during radiation</li>
            <li>This cream really takes the burn out, and helps with the soreness of radiation.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast my radiation burns healed this time.</li>
            <li>I used it every day after treatment as well as before going to bed and my skin has held up very well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Yeah, I will look better soon &amp; not so rough on treatment sights.</li>
            <li>No one wants to have breast cancer and undergo radiation.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY RECOMENDET</li>
            <li>Even at the very beginning when I couldn&#x27;t really rub it in to the skin</li>
            <li>Treatment can really do a number on your skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for someone going through radiation, it was recommended to me by another friend and said it worked really well</li>
            <li>you veru much</li>
            <li>I am having radiation and Miaderm really soothes the skin where the treatment is.  </li>
            <li>Miaderm has a creamy texture that really felt soothing on my sore skin.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>My brother used it for his radiation burn and healed very well</li>
            <li>I just got done with 5 weeks of radiation treatment and they gave me some cream that really did not help at all,</li>
            <li>We continued to use it for her 6 weeks of treatment and believe that this lotion really worked miracles on our daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>During treatment it didn&#x27;t seem to be making much of a difference</li>
            <li>Doctors told us this worked really well for the skin during radiation treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Thankful to find something that worked so well.</li>
            <li>This product was very helpful</li>
            <li>It feels very soothing to the skin when applied, and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get burning sensation much relief from Miaderm.  </li>
            <li>Really helped me through the skin issues associated with my neck/throat RadOnc Tx.</li>
            <li>Really helped.</li>
            <li>I found Miaderm very soothing and it soaked into the skin faster than some of the others I tried.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon prime, the cream came in one day, and she said it helped immediately.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>This product really helped soothe the burning and itching caused from the radiation.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s radiation therapy is over and Miaderm was very beneficial to her.</li>
            <li>It really calmed the burn and it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothing and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>I even gave some to my sister-in-law, who was really burned from radiation, and it really helped her skin.</li>
            <li>One bottle is plenty as you dont need much per application.</li>
            <li>I will join others in saying that my treatment team was pleased with how well my skin held up to 7 weeks of radiation due to breast cancer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was told that most get sores in the armpit area due to the rubbing that occurs there,</li>
            <li>pretty much a waste of money.other creams where more helpful and cheaper.thank</li>
            <li>It did not help with my radiation burns near as much as aloe straight from the plant.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion instead of Aquafore.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for anyone going through radiation.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I had high hopes of it working for me.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product for anyone experiencing radiation burns.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly for anyone who has to go through the radiation therapy process.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for anyone having radiation therapy and having skin issues.</li>
            <li>Normal lotions just don&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>From my standpoint as a husband, absolutely worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>It is readily absorbed by the skin and applied regularly</li>
            <li>During and after radiation for a cancer on my  nose Miaderm helped keep the redness down and upon completion really made a difference in a rapid recovery and the skin on my nose is so smooth now.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After very busy day and neglecting my usual  liberal applications my skin felt sore and noticed more redness.</li>
            <li>I began using the first day of treatment (21 total), and my skin never burned where I used it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this before radiation, used it 3 times a day after, and I had minimal skin redness, and skin was not painful.</li>
            <li>It really helped to save my skin from further pain and irritation.</li>
            <li>It keeps the skin soft and eases the redness from Radiation.  </li>
            <li>works very well, would definitely recommend to others having radiation therapy.</li>
            <li>I saw the difference my skin is completely healed.</li>
            <li>I started using it the day treatment started, and have faithfully applied it four times a day, including directly after treatment.</li>
            <li>This may be more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Samples would be a good way to help patients determine whether they want to experince the benefits of Miaderm during a series of difficult radiation treatments.  </li>
            <li>A little spendy but worth it!  </li>
            <li>This lotion is thin and soft and very easy to apply without any extra pressure and is gentle.  </li>
            <li>I used this in conjunction with several other creams, including Udderly Smooth which I started using a month before radiation at my radio-oncologist&#x27;s recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Worked as advertised with no mess.</li>
            <li>No mess.</li>
            <li>The soothing effect it had on my radiation burn was well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to anyone starting radiation therapy.  </li>
            <li>For 5 treatments,  I missed an area under my arm and on front center chest as I didn&#x27;t know the exact &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; that I needed to include.  </li>
            <li>after radiation the miaderm worked well and my skin finally returned to normal.  </li>
            <li>Miaderm helped somewhat, but I was burned pretty severely so it had minimal effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>And now, after 2 weeks of using the Miaderm his skin is back to normal.  </li>
            <li>It dried quickly and didn&#x27;t stick to clothes.  </li>
            <li>so I was very conscious to keep my arm away from my side as much as possible.  </li>
            <li>While it may seem a little pricey, I have used this cream for 7 weeks of radiation and it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Would also suggest starting the product early before visible signs of any issues.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it worked any better than the other recommended Eucerin cream ( 3 times cheaper) would have.</li>
            <li>The Miaderm seems to help the skin repair itself, but I&#x27;ve found cocoa butter to be an absolute necessity to keep the skin moist regardless of what other creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>For the first few weeks I used a mixture of Traumeel gel, Rescue remedy cream and colloidal silver gel.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> 10 more rounds of radiation, hoping it continues to work as great as it has been.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I was was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s working for so many people, but it just hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me.</li>
            <li> I felt it would be best to start right away</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product we used on our daughter&#x27;s skin as she was going through Proton Radiation.</li>
            <li> Miaderm was absolutely wonderful for me and worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Effective relief post radiation therapy.</li>
            <li> yes, nice smell.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> And I liked that this was a lotion as opposed to a gel (wasn&#x27;t sticky).  </li>
            <li> Others without the allergy issue may like it and find it works well for them - nice odor</li>
            <li> He liked it because it did not have a scent</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and absorbs nicely into skin.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the BEST cream to use.</li>
            <li> Too soon to say whether it&#x27;s been effective.  </li>
            <li> Great for your skin and helped my scar fade tremendously once I started to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this cream a day early and have found what an excellent improvement and use it 3 times a day</li>
            <li> My breast is becoming redder and redder and drier and more itchy by the day!</li>
            <li> Since I am a very light skinned redhead, my radiologist warned me of the possibilities of radiation burns to my chest during and remaining after treatments.  </li>
            <li> Put just a very light coating on the area - no need to slather it on.</li>
            <li> I did put it on more often some days, which is fine, as it feels SO nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I hope to never have to go through that again, but if I do, I will be ordering miaderm for sure....</li>
            <li> Gladly suggest to anybody going through treatments.</li>
            <li> This worked much better than Aquaphor or my aloe plant.</li>
            <li> Much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Miaderm mostly at the end of the radiation process for healing.</li>
            <li> Just received two more tubes.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Pleased with product.</li>
            <li> Will continue to suggest this product and wish more radiation oncologists recommeded it to their patients.  </li>
            <li> Nothing more to say.  </li>
            <li> Sincerely yours</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than halfway through radiation treatment.</li>
            <li> More than $70 out the window.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use the Miaderm, since I purchased two tubes of it, but I&#x27;m going to step up the Aquaphor usage because it gives so much more relief at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Great product Works great when kept in the refrigerator and is extremely cooling and releaves breakdown of the skin.</li>
            <li> Being very fair skinned, I had a severe radiation burn so used it generously daily.  </li>
            <li> Used 3 different creams and had very good luck with my skin.</li>
            <li> It has made this ordeal so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but best I found for relieving itch due to radiation damage.</li>
            <li> I found Miaderm to be easy to apply and soothing.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply &amp; blends in well.</li>
            <li> Easy to dispense and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about $25.00 cheaper and easy to find.</li>
            <li> still was bright red and itching and so went online and found this cream to be rated as excellent by others who have dealt with the same situation</li>
            <li> it dries quickly, it probably dries out the skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;Needs to be applied ALOT more often than on the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a blessing to have this available.</li>
            <li> It is odor free and does not stain clothes.</li>
            <li> Works great at preventing radiation related burns.</li>
            <li> The amount was perfect for one round of radiation therapy and the aftermath.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to see a dermatologist who confirmed that it was the Miaderm</li>
            <li> and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I am getting just a bit of light redness around the area but</li>
            <li> We hope to never have to use the product again and that she will stay cancer free.</li>
            <li> Be sure and understand exactly what area is being irradiated so you are covering everything.  </li>
            <li> It was worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW:    </li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and you really have to look to find the radiation outline but some of my friends still have very pronounced skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> Great for radiation treatment, due to cancer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure those with smaller breasts would get more benefit from it.</li>
            <li> , I could see a tremendous improvement.  </li>
            <li> We highly recommend it:)</li>
            <li> I only have one more week of radiation left and my skin is doing great.  </li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly so it didn&#x27;t get all over my clothes or sheets.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but worth the cost</li>
            <li> this production is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> It was worth it and hope it works well for others.</li>
            <li> cream is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Thius product worked well and was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Somewhat pricey to some but worth the luxury and benefits derived...</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The cost was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Not the news anyone wants to hear, especially after dropping more than $70 on some lotion and applying it even more often than directed.     </li>
            <li> Worked as expected and smells good.</li>
            <li> I used this right after I finished radiation.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, works well, wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t help me very much.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.  </li>
            <li> and I think my skin post-lumpectomy and radiation maintained pretty well.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> She was going through enough without having to worry about one more thing.</li>
            <li> Patients need to spread the word about what really works!</li>
            <li> Miaderm worked very well on skin for radiation treatment!</li>
            <li> but it did a good job of eliminating the dead skin.</li>
            <li> At my last treatment, my doctor said, &amp;#34;your skin looks really good, no, your skin looks amazing.&amp;#34;  Continue to use for a week -10 days after your last treatment, as redness can still appear.</li>
            <li> I think I had better results from using pure Aloe Vera Gel and Eucerin that the Cancer Center gave me samples of.</li>
            <li> Miaderm really helped me with my skin during radiation</li>
            <li> This cream really takes the burn out, and helps with the soreness of radiation.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast my radiation burns healed this time.</li>
            <li> I used it every day after treatment as well as before going to bed and my skin has held up very well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Yeah, I will look better soon &amp; not so rough on treatment sights.</li>
            <li> No one wants to have breast cancer and undergo radiation.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY RECOMENDET</li>
            <li> Even at the very beginning when I couldn&#x27;t really rub it in to the skin</li>
            <li> Treatment can really do a number on your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone going through radiation, it was recommended to me by another friend and said it worked really well</li>
            <li> you veru much</li>
            <li> I am having radiation and Miaderm really soothes the skin where the treatment is.  </li>
            <li> Miaderm has a creamy texture that really felt soothing on my sore skin.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> My brother used it for his radiation burn and healed very well</li>
            <li> I just got done with 5 weeks of radiation treatment and they gave me some cream that really did not help at all,</li>
            <li> We continued to use it for her 6 weeks of treatment and believe that this lotion really worked miracles on our daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> During treatment it didn&#x27;t seem to be making much of a difference</li>
            <li> Doctors told us this worked really well for the skin during radiation treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Thankful to find something that worked so well.</li>
            <li> This product was very helpful</li>
            <li> It feels very soothing to the skin when applied, and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get burning sensation much relief from Miaderm.  </li>
            <li> Really helped me through the skin issues associated with my neck/throat RadOnc Tx.</li>
            <li> Really helped.</li>
            <li> I found Miaderm very soothing and it soaked into the skin faster than some of the others I tried.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon prime, the cream came in one day, and she said it helped immediately.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> This product really helped soothe the burning and itching caused from the radiation.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s radiation therapy is over and Miaderm was very beneficial to her.</li>
            <li> It really calmed the burn and it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothing and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li> I even gave some to my sister-in-law, who was really burned from radiation, and it really helped her skin.</li>
            <li> One bottle is plenty as you dont need much per application.</li>
            <li> I will join others in saying that my treatment team was pleased with how well my skin held up to 7 weeks of radiation due to breast cancer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was told that most get sores in the armpit area due to the rubbing that occurs there,</li>
            <li> pretty much a waste of money.other creams where more helpful and cheaper.thank</li>
            <li> It did not help with my radiation burns near as much as aloe straight from the plant.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion instead of Aquafore.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for anyone going through radiation.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I had high hopes of it working for me.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product for anyone experiencing radiation burns.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly for anyone who has to go through the radiation therapy process.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for anyone having radiation therapy and having skin issues.</li>
            <li> Normal lotions just don&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> From my standpoint as a husband, absolutely worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> It is readily absorbed by the skin and applied regularly</li>
            <li> During and after radiation for a cancer on my  nose Miaderm helped keep the redness down and upon completion really made a difference in a rapid recovery and the skin on my nose is so smooth now.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After very busy day and neglecting my usual  liberal applications my skin felt sore and noticed more redness.</li>
            <li> I began using the first day of treatment (21 total), and my skin never burned where I used it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this before radiation, used it 3 times a day after, and I had minimal skin redness, and skin was not painful.</li>
            <li> It really helped to save my skin from further pain and irritation.</li>
            <li> It keeps the skin soft and eases the redness from Radiation.  </li>
            <li> works very well, would definitely recommend to others having radiation therapy.</li>
            <li> I saw the difference my skin is completely healed.</li>
            <li> I started using it the day treatment started, and have faithfully applied it four times a day, including directly after treatment.</li>
            <li> This may be more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Samples would be a good way to help patients determine whether they want to experince the benefits of Miaderm during a series of difficult radiation treatments.  </li>
            <li> A little spendy but worth it!  </li>
            <li> This lotion is thin and soft and very easy to apply without any extra pressure and is gentle.  </li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with several other creams, including Udderly Smooth which I started using a month before radiation at my radio-oncologist&#x27;s recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised with no mess.</li>
            <li> No mess.</li>
            <li> The soothing effect it had on my radiation burn was well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to anyone starting radiation therapy.  </li>
            <li> For 5 treatments,  I missed an area under my arm and on front center chest as I didn&#x27;t know the exact &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; that I needed to include.  </li>
            <li> after radiation the miaderm worked well and my skin finally returned to normal.  </li>
            <li> Miaderm helped somewhat, but I was burned pretty severely so it had minimal effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> And now, after 2 weeks of using the Miaderm his skin is back to normal.  </li>
            <li> It dried quickly and didn&#x27;t stick to clothes.  </li>
            <li> so I was very conscious to keep my arm away from my side as much as possible.  </li>
            <li> While it may seem a little pricey, I have used this cream for 7 weeks of radiation and it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Would also suggest starting the product early before visible signs of any issues.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it worked any better than the other recommended Eucerin cream ( 3 times cheaper) would have.</li>
            <li> The Miaderm seems to help the skin repair itself, but I&#x27;ve found cocoa butter to be an absolute necessity to keep the skin moist regardless of what other creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> For the first few weeks I used a mixture of Traumeel gel, Rescue remedy cream and colloidal silver gel.</li>
            <li> given the physical benefits in the long run.</li>
            <li> I think the combination of using this product along with showering with thick lotion-like shower wash and rinsing with water that is not too hot may have kept skin problems in check for the time being.</li>
            <li> In total I have used 4 1/2 of the 4 oz tubes, but due to lymph node involvement had a larger area done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I made it through 21 radiation treatments with only minimal redness or burning.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> It did not take long for my skin to heal.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth every Penney !</li>
            <li> and it did work well for his dry skin.</li>
            <li> The burning sensation and the dark red places were quite uncomfortable and there was rarely any relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin felt better after use &amp; healed quicker in some bad areas that looked like a curling iron had been placed on skin.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> The technicans, doctors, and radiologist were amazed that the only the effect the radiation had was a very slight reddening of the skin which disappeared when treatments stopped.</li>
            <li> As soon as I included those areas,  no more red.  </li>
            <li> Have ordered Miaderm three times and have recommeded it to other people who are experiencing or about to experince radiation therapy.  </li>
            <li> (I wasn&#x27;t using any other product).  </li>
            <li> The radiation techs had other views; they said not start using it until I started seeing signs of sunburn-like symptoms during treatment.  </li>
            <li> irritations that could result due to radiation</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical when I read all the positive reviews of Miaderm.  </li>
            <li> Gave some relief to my wife but didn&#x27;t handle the tough rash that developed after her radiation treatment</li>
            <li> The radiation was to the side of my face and neck down to the collarbone.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my husband&#x27;s neck radiation - using it on other burn sources!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know it was a reaction as I thought it was the typical radiation outcome</li>
            <li> Was given a sample of Miaderm half way through radiation therapy.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but just a small amount applied 2-3 times per day is very affective for radiation treament.</li>
            <li> No better than other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a rich person.    </li>
            <li> Lots of people seem to adore this lotion, including my own radoncs who recommended it, but I&#x27;m very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t doing squat to relieve my symptoms, and I find that it&#x27;s really no better than any average lotion.    </li>
            <li> Turned a pealing, itching, painful radiation burn into completely healed skin in just a few days,  Needed regular application of course.</li>
            <li> Her doctor had recommended calendula cream, which worked for awhile, but then as treatments progressed the burn was getting worse and worse and very itchy/painful.  </li>
            <li> I have no more to&lt;br /&gt;say.</li>
            <li> I was quite red and uncomfortable as well.  </li>
            <li> Then they gave him a small sample of the Miaderm and with just ONE application</li>
            <li> Other lotions were very thick and you had to apply pressure to get it applied.</li>
            <li> This lotion started out working well but within a few days, I developed a bad rash from using it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had a bad reaction to the radiation and developed 3rd degree burns</li>
            <li> Buy at least two tubes.</li>
            <li> After radiation treatments this does have a cooling effect &amp; re hydration of delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> If you need to be in the car a lot, I&#x27;d suggest a very small pillow be placed between the shoulder strap and your chest.  </li>
            <li> Although a little expensive, I recommend it for those going through radiation therapy.</li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> Last night, I became so frustrated by the increasing soreness and redness that I slathered Aquaphor on instead.</li>
            <li> In speaking with other women at treatment, the ones that didn&#x27;t use Miaderm and used a less expensive cream ended up burning badly.  </li>
            <li> Not a great product</li>
            <li> but it would have been worse without it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would have been worse if I hadn&#x27;t been using the cream?  </li>
            <li> so I was unable to start using it the week before my treatments started as recommended.  </li>
            <li> While this lotion is expensive, it is specifically created for patients undergoing radiation treatment.  </li>
            <li> nothing that makes me uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Your mileage may vary, but in my opinion, this stuff is useless.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO disappointed I wasted money on this stuff!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is scented - not good for people who having gone thru or going thru chemo and get sick from scents.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> A disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine what it feels like to have worse!!  </li>
            <li> My doctor told me to find an alcohol-free cream (which is very difficult) and I searched until I found this.  </li>
            <li> I blistered quite badly and peeled.  </li>
            <li> The radiated areas weren&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> A friend on mine who went through radiation is shocked since by this time she had an uncomforable rash/burn.  </li>
            <li> but the Dr. was appalled.</li>
            <li> Although this lotion was recommended by my radiation oncologist, I had the misfortune of developing a very bad rash from it.  </li>
            <li> He looked like he had been burned by a torch or been in a horrific fire.  </li>

            <li> Miaderm really helped me with my skin during radiation</li>
            <li> This cream really takes the burn out, and helps with the soreness of radiation. I have been through 33 days of radiation twice now, once in 2000 and again in 2012, I did not know about miaderm in 2000, but in 2012 i was given samples and immediately ordered some. I was amazed at how fast my radiation burns healed this time. I hope to never have to go through that again, but if I do, I will be ordering miaderm for sure....</li>
            <li> I faithfully used it every day and I think my skin post-lumpectomy and radiation maintained pretty well. Buy at least two tubes. I brought one with me to treatments and put it in the locker when I put on the gown. That way when I got dressed I remembered to use it and put it in my purse for the next day. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised! Would recommend for anyone undergoing radiation therapy. A bit pricey but worth the cost given the physical benefits in the long run.</li>
            <li> Gave some relief to my wife but didn&#x27;t handle the tough rash that developed after her radiation treatment</li>
            <li> My mom had to get radiation therapy and this kept her from having any rashes or skin troubles.  What a blessing to have this available.</li>
            <li> Prompt service and great product.</li>
            <li> Great for radiation treatment, due to cancer.</li>
            <li> While it may seem a little pricey, I have used this cream for 7 weeks of radiation and it is worth the price. I used it every day after treatment as well as before going to bed and my skin has held up very well.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I used Miaderm for relief during a recent 7 week radiation therapy.  The radiation was to the side of my face and neck down to the collarbone.  I found Miaderm to be easy to apply and soothing.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my grandmother for her face during her radiation treatments. she loved it and said it help with the pain.</li>
            <li> After radiation treatments this does have a cooling effect &amp; re hydration of delicate skin. Gladly suggest to anybody going through treatments. Easy to apply &amp; blends in well. My skin felt better after use &amp; healed quicker in some bad areas that looked like a curling iron had been placed on skin. Yeah, I will look better soon &amp; not so rough on treatment sights.</li>
            <li> I tried aloe and calendula, but neither of these worked as well as Miaderm which contains both aloe and calendula.  Although a little expensive, I recommend it for those going through radiation therapy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion instead of Aquafore.  This is a non-greasy product and I have experienced no radiation burn at all.</li>
            <li> Incredible for Radiation patients.  It heals &amp; soothes the skin instantly.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I used this product twice daily during my radiation treatments. It really helped to save my skin from further pain and irritation. I would highly recommend for anyone going through radiation.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The scent was not nauseating.  It dried quickly and didn&#x27;t stick to clothes.  Easy to dispense and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is scented - not good for people who having gone thru or going thru chemo and get sick from scents.&lt;br /&gt;Because it dries quickly, it probably dries out the skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;Needs to be applied ALOT more often than on the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I ended up going back to just basic Aquafor by Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy again or recommend</li>
            <li> I have had twenty treatments of radiation for skin cancer. This miaderm of all the burn ointments I have tried is the only one that gives me any relief.  It is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Timely shipment. I was not thrilled with the product. It did not help with my radiation burns near as much as aloe straight from the plant.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing.  I began using the first day of treatment (21 total), and my skin never burned where I used it.  Be sure and understand exactly what area is being irradiated so you are covering everything.  For 5 treatments,  I missed an area under my arm and on front center chest as I didn&#x27;t know the exact &amp;#34;square&amp;#34; that I needed to include.  As soon as I included those areas,  no more red.  I highly recommend this cream.  At my last treatment, my doctor said, &amp;#34;your skin looks really good, no, your skin looks amazing.&amp;#34;  Continue to use for a week -10 days after your last treatment, as redness can still appear.</li>
            <li> No one wants to have breast cancer and undergo radiation.  I bought this before radiation, used it 3 times a day after, and I had minimal skin redness, and skin was not painful.</li>
            <li> This worked much better than Aquaphor or my aloe plant. Much better. It was cooling, un-greasy and lessened the pain.</li>
            <li> Have used this throughout radiation treatment and skin is doing wonderful.  This lotion is thin and soft and very easy to apply without any extra pressure and is gentle.  Other lotions were very thick and you had to apply pressure to get it applied. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> yes. I would recommend  Miaderm cream. It keeps the skin soft and eases the redness from Radiation.  this production is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Miaderm mostly at the end of the radiation process for healing. For the first few weeks I used a mixture of Traumeel gel, Rescue remedy cream and colloidal silver gel. The Miaderm seems to help the skin repair itself, but I&#x27;ve found cocoa butter to be an absolute necessity to keep the skin moist regardless of what other creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> i USED AFTER MY LAST RADIATION, ALSO I USED IN COMBINATION WITH THE CREAM I USED FROM DE RADIATION CLINIC, AND I CAN TELL WORKS, I REALLY RECOMENDET</li>
            <li> after radiation the miaderm worked well and my skin finally returned to normal.  use as directed 2 x a day</li>
            <li> Excellent results also cooling, calming,effect. Even at the very beginning when I couldn&#x27;t really rub it in to the skin I just walked around with the affected area exposed to the air.</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad who has cancer. His doctor recommended it. Treatment can really do a number on your skin. Normal lotions just don&#x27;t help. This may be more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> A disappointment.  Dr. office recommended this product for my radiation burns.  My skin split and peeled after using cream for 2 weeks. Perhaps I would have had a different outcome if I began using at onset of radiation treatment.</li>
            <li> This item was purchase for my Mother  she was taking radiation treatments and this product help her  thank you</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical when I read all the positive reviews of Miaderm.  Miaderm was absolutely wonderful for me and worked very well.  I used it 4 times a day and I brought it with me to my 33 radiation treatments and applied it in the changing room after each treatment. It saved my skin, thank G-d. It was worth every penny!  It is odor free and does not stain clothes.</li>
            <li> Simply stated: a miracle cream! Great for your skin and helped my scar fade tremendously once I started to use it. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone going through radiation, it was recommended to me by another friend and said it worked really well</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised with no mess.</li>
            <li> Miaderm helped me going to 30 sessions of radiation. A very good product. Had to find on the web myself, wish the radiologist would have recommended it to beginn with.</li>
            <li> Not a great product but it did a good job of eliminating the dead skin.I have said enough now.I have no more to&lt;br /&gt;say.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t help me very much. pretty much a waste of money.other creams where more helpful and cheaper.thank you veru much</li>
            <li> I am having radiation and Miaderm really soothes the skin where the treatment is.  I Can&#x27;t imagine doing without it.</li>
            <li> After undergoing radiation treatment this product was recommended for burn relief.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to see that Amazon carried it.</li>
            <li> This is used for burns from radiation treatment and works well.  My doctor told me to find an alcohol-free cream (which is very difficult) and I searched until I found this.  After daily treatments (not before), I applied this 3 or 4 times a day and the burns improved.  I have had good results with this and recommend it for those undergoing radiation treatments.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with several other creams, including Udderly Smooth which I started using a month before radiation at my radio-oncologist&#x27;s recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;All of them worked well. But each one has a different consistency and absorbs differently. Miaderm has a creamy texture that really felt soothing on my sore skin.</li>
            <li> Effective relief post radiation therapy. No mess. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I just finished treatment 24. This cream is wonderful. It takes away any soreness, burning or itching you might have. It is very soothing to the skin. Just received two more tubes. Have been using it 3 to 4 x day. I would not use anything else. It has made this ordeal so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> 13 rounds of radiation using Miaderm 4-5 times a day. My skin is doing great. After very busy day and neglecting my usual  liberal applications my skin felt sore and noticed more redness. I love this cream. Soothing, no dryness and yes, nice smell. 10 more rounds of radiation, hoping it continues to work as great as it has been. I would highly recommend this. I&#x27;m an RN, I&#x27;m taking my health in my own hands and some of my Dr&#x27;s did not even know about it!</li>
            <li> Product works as intended.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, works well, wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much. Pleased with product. Should be avaiable as a prescription though so insurance will cover the cost!</li>
            <li> This product is the best. It worked immediately on my areas of rash. I started it about halfway through my 33 days of radiation. I recommend starting it at the beginning of your treatment.</li>
            <li> My brother used it for his radiation burn and healed very well</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Used it through all radirion. Had no burning..</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Expensive but worth every Penney !</li>
            <li> No better than other products. Pricy.</li>
            <li> I made it through 21 radiation treatments with only minimal redness or burning.&lt;br /&gt;My doctor recommended it and said my skin did great&lt;br /&gt;I am still using it and will until my next surgery is over</li>
            <li> I just got done with 5 weeks of radiation treatment and they gave me some cream that really did not help at all, still was bright red and itching and so went online and found this cream to be rated as excellent by others who have dealt with the same situation and I got&lt;br /&gt;this cream a day early and have found what an excellent improvement and use it 3 times a day and I am very pleased with this product. It was worth it and hope it works well for others. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband&#x27;s neck radiation - using it on other burn sources!</li>
            <li> I will join others in saying that my treatment team was pleased with how well my skin held up to 7 weeks of radiation due to breast cancer.  Can&#x27;t imagine what it feels like to have worse!!  My radiologist had suggested I purchase the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told that most get sores in the armpit area due to the rubbing that occurs there, so I was very conscious to keep my arm away from my side as much as possible.  Didn&#x27;t have any sores.  If you need to be in the car a lot, I&#x27;d suggest a very small pillow be placed between the shoulder strap and your chest.  Our local Cancer Society gives out these with straps on them to hold them in place.  Call and see if yours does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When purchasing know that it is recommended to use the cream for 1 week prior to radiation and during radiation with applications 3x daily.  I did put it on more often some days, which is fine, as it feels SO nice on the skin.  My radiologist had me continue the cream for a month post radiation to aid healing.  In total I have used 4 1/2 of the 4 oz tubes, but due to lymph node involvement had a larger area done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheapest place I found to purchase this product was through Amazon with the 4 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewer also mentioned Domeboro which I too was advised to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Amazing product we used on our daughter&#x27;s skin as she was going through Proton Radiation. She noticed signifigant change in her skin just after using it only two times. We continued to use it for her 6 weeks of treatment and believe that this lotion really worked miracles on our daughter&#x27;s skin. We highly recommend it:)</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Canada and it took quite some time to arrive so I was unable to start using it the week before my treatments started as recommended.  I started using it after my 9th radiation treatment and continued using it until the 3rd tube ran out about 2 weeks after my 30th treatment.  I blistered quite badly and peeled.  I was quite red and uncomfortable as well.  During treatment it didn&#x27;t seem to be making much of a difference but I think it was working.  It would be like applying a cream to your hand while you were still holding it on the stove.  As soon as treatments stopped I could see the healing begin.  I belong to a group of women who had their breast cancer surgery the same week that I did but because of the chemo I was the last to go through the radiation.  I can say that of the 7 of us my skin has healed the best.  I am fair skinned and you really have to look to find the radiation outline but some of my friends still have very pronounced skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> This is the best radiation relief I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my Dad, he is on his second bout of radiation.  The doctors recommended this product for my Dad so that it would help with the pain on his face.  The doctors recommended it but they didn&#x27;t know where to send my parents to get it.  After my parents tried 6 stores I tried Amazon and from here it is all history.</li>
            <li> Great product Works great when kept in the refrigerator and is extremely cooling and releaves breakdown of the skin.</li>
            <li> I used the cream three times a day, as directed by my radiation doctor. At the end of my 28 radiation treatments I had no burns whatsoever. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Since I am a very light skinned redhead, my radiologist warned me of the possibilities of radiation burns to my chest during and remaining after treatments.  I purchased the cream immediately and applyied it quite liberally&lt;br /&gt;doing the 7 week treatments (several times a day)  The technicans, doctors, and radiologist were amazed that the only the effect the radiation had was a very slight reddening of the skin which disappeared when treatments stopped. It&#x27;s creamy - not greasy - so it did not stain clothing.  This product is a must during radiation.</li>
            <li> Doctors told us this worked really well for the skin during radiation treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Thankful to find something that worked so well.</li>
            <li> My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer and after surgery needed to have radiation.  The Miaderm was excellent to prevent the burning.  In speaking with other women at treatment, the ones that didn&#x27;t use Miaderm and used a less expensive cream ended up burning badly.  From my standpoint as a husband, absolutely worth the extra money.  She was going through enough without having to worry about one more thing.</li>
            <li> Works great at preventing radiation related burns.</li>
            <li> This non-greasy lotion has relieved the cumulative effects of 21 radiation treatments.</li>
            <li> This product was very helpful and I would highly recommend it to anyone starting radiation therapy.  Use it as soon as you start your treatments. Don&#x27;t wait until you see any redness!</li>
            <li> Miaderm helped somewhat, but I was burned pretty severely so it had minimal effectiveness.  I&#x27;m sure those with smaller breasts would get more benefit from it.</li>
            <li> I read about this cream on a cancer forum site. I was just starting radiation and wanted to avoid burns. This cream appears to work. It is very soothing and smells wonderful. Does not stain clothes or interfere with radiation acording to manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Thius product worked well and was worth the price. I was happy I purchased it. The amount was perfect for one round of radiation therapy and the aftermath.</li>
            <li> While this lotion is expensive, it is specifically created for patients undergoing radiation treatment.  That gave me the confidence to purchase it after using a tiny sample from my physician.  While nothing can reverse the effects of radiation on the skin during treatment, Miaderm has helped reduce irritation and itchiness. (I can feel it if I have missed the mid-afternoon application!)  It feels very soothing to the skin when applied, and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  I&#x27;m in my 5th week of treatment and my skin has that cooked lobster look, but three daily applications of Miaderm help me get through the day with a minimum of discomfort.</li>
            <li> Have ordered Miaderm three times and have recommeded it to other people who are experiencing or about to experince radiation therapy.  Will continue to suggest this product and wish more radiation oncologists recommeded it to their patients.  Samples would be a good way to help patients determine whether they want to experince the benefits of Miaderm during a series of difficult radiation treatments.  Somewhat pricey to some but worth the luxury and benefits derived...</li>
            <li> I used this right after I finished radiation.  It did not take long for my skin to heal.  Great smell and absorbs into skin well.</li>
            <li> works very well, would definitely recommend to others having radiation therapy. if used properly no blisters appear, no breakage of skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get burning sensation much relief from Miaderm.  The burning sensation and the dark red places were quite uncomfortable and there was rarely any relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to voice my opinion.</li>
            <li> Both used by my mom and mother-n-law.  It helped drastically.  Would recommend to anyone undergoing radiation to use this product</li>
            <li> Really helped me through the skin issues associated with my neck/throat RadOnc Tx.</li>
            <li> would recommend it to anyone going through radiation. Really helped.</li>
            <li> seemed to work well...prevented redness and blistering</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my doctor before I started radiation.  I have very sensitive skin so I was concerned about how my skin would react to the radiation treatment.  I used this product twice a day (once in the morning and once after my  treatment each day).  I was was very pleased with the results.  The radiated areas weren&#x27;t too bad.  And I liked that this was a lotion as opposed to a gel (wasn&#x27;t sticky).  It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Was delivered on time product works well</li>
            <li> Miaderm Lotion has been a Godsend!  I used it 2x daily beginning the day of my radiation treatment and continue using it a month later. The soothing effect it had on my radiation burn was well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> This is truly a wonderful product.  My husband had 30 radiation treatments in his neck area.  He looked like he had been burned by a torch or been in a horrific fire.  The veteran&#x27;s hospital gave him a different ointment, which was not helping at all.  Then they gave him a small sample of the Miaderm and with just ONE application, I could see a tremendous improvement.  And now, after 2 weeks of using the Miaderm his skin is back to normal.  It&#x27;s almost like a miracle.</li>
            <li> Although this lotion was recommended by my radiation oncologist, I had the misfortune of developing a very bad rash from it.  I ended up having to see a dermatologist who confirmed that it was the Miaderm (I wasn&#x27;t using any other product).  I must say it did smell wonderful and I had high hopes of it working for me.  Not the case!</li>
            <li> This was the best medication ever in one week I saw the difference my skin is completely healed. Thank you</li>
            <li> I found Miaderm very soothing and it soaked into the skin faster than some of the others I tried.  Being very fair skinned, I had a severe radiation burn so used it generously daily.  It does not remove pain but does soothe pain.  It was the best of the three recommended to me.  I still had to ice my breast often.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who underwent breast cancer radiation.  It was recommended by her radiologist.  She said it relieved a lot of her discomfort.  The cost was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I am on day 18 of radiation treatment to my chest and back. Not so much as a red spot. This product works! Put just a very light coating on the area - no need to slather it on.</li>
            <li> Must have if you receive radiation</li>
            <li> I sent this cream to my mom.  Her doctor had recommended calendula cream, which worked for awhile, but then as treatments progressed the burn was getting worse and worse and very itchy/painful.  Thanks to Amazon prime, the cream came in one day, and she said it helped immediately.  Why not just start off with this one?  Patients need to spread the word about what really works!</li>
            <li> I use it immediately after treatment and then again before bed.  It alleviates that \\&quot;irritated\\&quot; feeling I was getting after treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Three weeks after 28 treatments.  My skin feels great, all traces of pinkness are gone.  I would recommend this to anyone undergoing radiation treatment.</li>
            <li> Miaderm worked very well on skin for radiation treatment!</li>
            <li> Very soothing. Helped me get through radiation.  Would buy again.  Thank you very much.  Nothing more to say.  Sincerely yours</li>
            <li> This lotion started out working well but within a few days, I developed a bad rash from using it. Didn&#x27;t know it was a reaction as I thought it was the typical radiation outcome but the Dr. was appalled. So ended up going back to my regular body creme - Cetaphyl Cream - and that cleared up everything. Others without the allergy issue may like it and find it works well for them - nice odor and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I was told by my oncologist nurse to use this nightly even before starting radiation.  The radiation techs had other views; they said not start using it until I started seeing signs of sunburn-like symptoms during treatment.  So, here I was in a quandary as to which way to go.  Since I have eczema I felt it would be best to start right away and faithly put it on nightly before bed so as not to interfere with the treatment the following day.  I only have one more week of radiation left and my skin is doing great.  I am getting just a bit of light redness around the area but nothing that makes me uncomfortable. A friend on mine who went through radiation is shocked since by this time she had an uncomforable rash/burn.  I think the combination of using this product along with showering with thick lotion-like shower wash and rinsing with water that is not too hot may have kept skin problems in check for the time being.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my radiologist.&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly it has fewer chemicals that cause&lt;br /&gt;skin irritations that could result due to radiation&lt;br /&gt;therapy. A little expensive but it worked well for me.</li>
            <li> This product really helped soothe the burning and itching caused from the radiation. Would highly recommend this product for anyone experiencing radiation burns.</li>
            <li> I had really good experience with this product, love it!!!</li>
            <li> We did not discover this until after my husband had 30  Radiation txs. He liked it because it did not have a scent and it did work well for his dry skin. Not sure if it worked any better than the other recommended Eucerin cream ( 3 times cheaper) would have.</li>
            <li> I think I had better results from using pure Aloe Vera Gel and Eucerin that the Cancer Center gave me samples of. It&#x27;s about $25.00 cheaper and easy to find. I have Radiation Rash &amp; the Aloe Vera is helping it heal but the Eucerin takes the itch away along with&lt;br /&gt;hydrocortizone.</li>
            <li> During and after radiation for a cancer on my  nose Miaderm helped keep the redness down and upon completion really made a difference in a rapid recovery and the skin on my nose is so smooth now.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s radiation therapy is over and Miaderm was very beneficial to her. We hope to never have to use the product again and that she will stay cancer free. But it&#x27;s good to know it is there.&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
            <li> This product is quite good.It is expensive, but just a small amount applied 2-3 times per day is very affective for radiation treament. It is readily absorbed by the skin and applied regularly is very effective. One tube should last 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> AN UPDATE: After my radiation treatment today, my radiation oncologist informed me that if my breast gets any redder than it is, they will have to pause treatment and let it heal. Not the news anyone wants to hear, especially after dropping more than $70 on some lotion and applying it even more often than directed.     After getting this news, I&#x27;m downgrading my rating of Miaderm to one star. It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s working for so many people, but it just hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me. Your mileage may vary, but in my opinion, this stuff is useless.     ORIGINAL REVIEW:    I&#x27;m more than halfway through radiation treatment. My short review? I&#x27;m SO disappointed I wasted money on this stuff! More than $70 out the window. I&#x27;m not a rich person.    I started using it the day treatment started, and have faithfully applied it four times a day, including directly after treatment. My breast is becoming redder and redder and drier and more itchy by the day! This lotion isn&#x27;t doing squat to relieve my symptoms, and I find that it&#x27;s really no better than any average lotion.    Last night, I became so frustrated by the increasing soreness and redness that I slathered Aquaphor on instead. When I woke up this morning, the redness was gone.    I&#x27;ll continue to use the Miaderm, since I purchased two tubes of it, but I&#x27;m going to step up the Aquaphor usage because it gives so much more relief at a fraction of the price. Wish I could get my money back.    Lots of people seem to adore this lotion, including my own radoncs who recommended it, but I&#x27;m very, very disappointed. And now broke.    If I notice any improvements or changes, I&#x27;ll post an update. But for now...your mileage may vary with Miaderm.</li>
            <li> It does not relieve the pain but it does help sooth radiation burned skin. My wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> Turned a pealing, itching, painful radiation burn into completely healed skin in just a few days,  Needed regular application of course.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!!  This is one that actually works.  Would recommend highly for anyone who has to go through the radiation therapy process.</li>
            <li> I us it daily after treatments. It works well and helps with the burning and healing as well, Must Have!</li>
            <li> Worked as expected and smells good.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and absorbs nicely into skin. No stains on clothing either.</li>
            <li> I used Miraderm when I had 6 weeks of radiation for throat cancer. This is absolutely the BEST cream to use. It is not greasy and provides great relief. I had some peeling but it would have been worse without it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Would highly recommend for anyone having radiation therapy and having skin issues. Would also suggest starting the product early before visible signs of any issues.</li>
            <li> This product works well while undergoing treatment. Not as greasy as others. Used 3 different creams and had very good luck with my skin.</li>
            <li> Was given a sample of Miaderm half way through radiation therapy.  It really calmed the burn and it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothing and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I even gave some to my sister-in-law, who was really burned from radiation, and it really helped her skin.</li>
            <li> Too soon to say whether it&#x27;s been effective.  Although my radiation sessions have ended, there&#x27;s still a lot of redness.  Maybe it would have been worse if I hadn&#x27;t been using the cream?  Who&#x27;s to say?</li>
            <li> Helped relief burning after radiation , soothes the skin.</li>
            <li> Great to find this needed product.</li>
            <li> Worked great to relieve the pain!  A little spendy but worth it!  One bottle is plenty as you dont need much per application.</li>
            <li> This product was wonderful to use on my radiation area.  It provided instant relief and soothed my skin.  It absorbed quickly so it didn&#x27;t get all over my clothes or sheets.  Unfortunately I had a bad reaction to the radiation and developed 3rd degree burns so I had to start using a medicated cream.  I would recommend this product to anyone undergoing radiation for the soothing it provides.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but best I found for relieving itch due to radiation damage.</li>
