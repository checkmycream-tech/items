            <li>While searching amazon for a good deal on my alba face lotion</li>
            <li>I love this product it does wonders for my skin!  </li>
            <li>Feels great on my skin and arrived very quickly.</li>

            <li>This is a nice, soothing eye gel.  </li>
            <li>Nice, slippery texture.</li>
            <li>After trying many products I thought this would be a good one.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a good news though :)</li>
            <li>cannot in good conscience give it more than a 1 star because *never* should a company put people at risk of injury for the sake of beauty.</li>
            <li>I cannot in good conscience give it more than a 1 star because *never* should a company put people at risk of injury for the sake of beauty.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and use many of their products, but this was not so great.</li>
            <li>and I am super happy that I gave this a try.</li>
            <li>Love this product and better priced on Amazon than cosmetic counters at the mall!</li>
            <li>refreshing, cooling and soothing.</li>
            <li>lovely, would buy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more.</li>
            <li>Leaves nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I can see my eyelids again! :)</li>
            <li>I love Alba products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 4 years and love it.</li>
            <li>Nice, light, a favor to your skin.</li>
            <li>I concluded that this was an allergic reaction to one or more of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I think (at times) that men age better than women, this gel was surely helping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I have to decide between giving this a 5 for making my eyes look lovely or a 1 for the dastardly ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have bought many products from alba and have been satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love ALBA.  </li>
            <li>Not horrible, sort of like Dr. Bronners, but it&#x27;s on your eye.</li>
            <li>I love the eye gel.  </li>
            <li>Bought this in February, it is now June :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean product with good ingredients and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>This stuff feels nice and cool under your eyes; you can feel yourself waking up after applying it.</li>
            <li>Nice cool feeling on eyes.</li>
            <li>I always liked thicker eye creams but this gel is super hydrating.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s absolutely great for people with sensitive, acne prone skin that want moisture that is not shiny.  </li>
            <li>She loved it so much that she ordered herself some.  </li>
            <li>only nice thing I can say about this product is that it smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>on easily and is not oily.  </li>
            <li>It works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>However, an added bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t allow your makeup to settle into the fine lines.</li>
            <li>rather have fine lines and wrinkles rather than suffer from genetic mutations and chromosomal</li>
            <li>Helps the fine lines showing up around the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Green tea is excellent for your skin so don&#x27;t just use this under your eyes!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The skin around his eyes was really looking nice.</li>
            <li>eye gel from a fabulous company like Alba and</li>
            <li>Alba overall has great skin care products.</li>
            <li>I feel secure wearing it knowing it will sooth my under eyes.</li>
            <li>For such a reasonable price, it immediately relaxs and rejuvenates the skin around the eye and is perfect for relaxing before bed.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something with good and natural ingredients for under my eyes.</li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>Natural and effective.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t notice much difference with many.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I didn&#x27;t give it much of a chance, but its ok..  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid- found in organ meats, cod liver oil and non animal sources like guavas and acerola sweet cherries.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and helps hide my fine lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not plastic surgery in a bottle, but for my purposes it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apart from that,  the product itself is OK if you have sensitive skin eye area, &#x27;cause isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
            <li>Also leaves a fresh feeling...</li>
            <li>For this reason alone, I&#x27;d purchase it and it&#x27;s economical.</li>
            <li>golden brown kelp</li>
            <li>gel really does such a good job</li>
            <li>i even use it on my face but then maybe too tight :P</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only just started using this, but I love how it glides on and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>but this is the first product that i bought it again and again.</li>
            <li>I tried this stuff for several weeks and mostly it just made the skin under my eyes all oily.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>husband was still using without any trouble and an item he loved and wanted to always keep in</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;m 66 with sleep apnea, so I think I&#x27;m a good test subject for it&#x27;s effectiveness against some real world problems.</li>
            <li>Phenoxyethanol: a preservative.&lt;br /&gt;Safety Measures/Side Effects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studies have shown that Phenoxyethanol can be an extreme irritant to the eyes and skin, and can even cause blistering; it is hazardous in the case of ingestion and inhalation as well.</li>
            <li>the next time I&#x27;m going to make my own eye cream or try one for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I first bought this from Whole Foods but have found it&#x27;s CHEAPER on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Goes a long way! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 years old, and thought all the super moisturizing products were the way to go, but this stuff is it for me.</li>
            <li>Green tea is also amazing</li>
            <li>It really works...</li>
            <li>Very Soothing Eye Gel.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel like it is doing anything.  </li>
            <li>It really helps to tighten under my eyes.</li>
            <li>didnt notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this and much to my amazement, this gel really works.</li>
            <li>I swear it really helps with lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Very soothing to the eye area.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay more for other brands as I have tried tons and have found this is the one that REALLY works.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product!  </li>
            <li>A half a pump is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>leaves a nice subtle sheen/glow around the eyes which is much needed at 46.  </li>
            <li>I have used a few Alba products before and have always been pleased.  </li>
            <li>Relatively quick to dry and absorb.</li>
            <li>past year I noticed I had a few more fine lines and wrinkles that I hoped would disappear.</li>
            <li>This one is light on the skin and seems to make the area under my eyes a little brighter and softer.</li>
            <li>Old product that burned the tissue by my eye.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper on Amazon than local stores.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because its made with natural ingredients and says that is hypoallergenic  </li>
            <li>Have I received it complete?  </li>
            <li>Ethylhexylglycerin: natural preservative derived from glycerin acts as skin</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.</li>
            <li>Just with a small amount (one drop for each eye) is more than enough.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long before the fine lines looked less harsh--noticeable from up close</li>
            <li>I spent too much time out in the sun.</li>
            <li>I developed a red rash around my eye.</li>
            <li>It looks like I have barely used it.</li>
            <li>It also is easy to use and lasts fairly long since you only use a little each day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I like it as much as the other Alba products.</li>
            <li>And a little goes a super long way.</li>
            <li>last but not least (and certainly not benign)...</li>
            <li>Few days ago I opened the bottle and realized surprisingly that is less than half!!!</li>

            <li> This one is light on the skin and seems to make the area under my eyes a little brighter and softer.</li>
            <li> Old product that burned the tissue by my eye.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper on Amazon than local stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because its made with natural ingredients and says that is hypoallergenic  </li>
            <li> Have I received it complete?  </li>
            <li> Ethylhexylglycerin: natural preservative derived from glycerin acts as skin</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.</li>
            <li> Just with a small amount (one drop for each eye) is more than enough.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long before the fine lines looked less harsh--noticeable from up close</li>
            <li> I spent too much time out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I developed a red rash around my eye.</li>
            <li> It looks like I have barely used it.</li>
            <li> It also is easy to use and lasts fairly long since you only use a little each day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I like it as much as the other Alba products.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a super long way.</li>
            <li> last but not least (and certainly not benign)...</li>
            <li> Few days ago I opened the bottle and realized surprisingly that is less than half!!!</li>
            <li> this bottle could last a whole year because a little goes long .wont</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m picky due to my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love how it reduces the dark circles and tired look around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this brand for quite a long time--almost 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to be based on the principal that slight irritation increases blood flow, but so does a warm shower or wash cloth alternated with some icy water - and that doesn&#x27;t go on irritating for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I did not see any results and my eyes felt dry with application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super sensitive with skin stuff, but this is enough to be distracting and cause a bit of redness, while doing very little for puffiness or circles.</li>
            <li> I use just a tiny bit and still have a little to put on rougher skin on elbows as an intensive moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Only a little bit is needed.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li> This product does wonders on tired eyes and really reduces the puffiness.</li>
            <li> I read in other reviews that this product burns.</li>
            <li> past week the bottle was getting low</li>
            <li> I have been using other products of Alba Botanica and found myself in need of an eye cream.  </li>
            <li> My eyes are fine, just hurts really bad after using this eye gel.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my dark circles, though.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, it actually works and I have tried very expensive creams that did not do a thing.  </li>
            <li> My eyes look at least 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> I used to get dark circles under my eyes, and now my eyes look well rested.</li>
            <li> I does not make your skin feel tight and seems to be getting rid of my puffiness under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I checked again to see if I have little cuts or zits around my eye area, and maybe that&#x27;s why it felt like burning.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for few years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few eye creams/gels</li>
            <li> so I went through the trouble of looking up each one of them out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it here for almost half the price!</li>
            <li> No refund from her.&lt;br /&gt;Be very careful buying a product online that you use close to your eyes!!!</li>
            <li> My skin looked softer around my eyes and I looked less tired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to tea bags and cold spoons.</li>
            <li> but they looked as though I was still late twenties.</li>
            <li> I seriously wanted to buy an economy sized bottle and bathe in</li>
            <li> After trying very expensive creams and gels with little result, came across this little gem.</li>

            <li> Old product that burned the tissue by my eye.  I bought it from Lottawoman!-PocketZ in Los Angeles via Amazon.  No refund from her.&lt;br /&gt;Be very careful buying a product online that you use close to your eyes!!!</li>
            <li> This is an eye gel, I know.  I have used this product for years on my face instead and it&#x27;s absolutely great for people with sensitive, acne prone skin that want moisture that is not shiny.  The best advice I can give you is to mix one pump of this with your foundation and the application of your makeup will be flawless and beautiful.  I can&#x27;t live without this product!  Green tea is excellent for your skin so don&#x27;t just use this under your eyes!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product because my wife handed it to me and said, \\&quot;Try this.\\&quot; I&#x27;m 66 with sleep apnea, so I think I&#x27;m a good test subject for it&#x27;s effectiveness against some real world problems. I teach classes, so I&#x27;m constantly speaking in front of crowds. This product definitely works for me. It reduces puffiness and wrinkles and makes me look and feel younger. It&#x27;s not plastic surgery in a bottle, but for my purposes it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, soothing eye gel.  It is quite concentrated, so use sparingly.  I have used a few Alba products before and have always been pleased.  I think this is a good cosmetic, for a fair price.</li>
            <li> I love this product it does wonders for my skin!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years but  I struggle to find it at the store and when I find it is expensive! I bought it here for almost half the price!</li>
            <li> After trying very expensive creams and gels with little result, came across this little gem. For such a reasonable price, it immediately relaxs and rejuvenates the skin around the eye and is perfect for relaxing before bed. And a little goes a super long way. I use just a tiny bit and still have a little to put on rougher skin on elbows as an intensive moisturizer. The seller did a great job getting this out to me and I was very impressed by how well it works.</li>
            <li> refreshing, cooling and soothing. leaves a nice subtle sheen/glow around the eyes which is much needed at 46.  lovely, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love how it reduces the dark circles and tired look around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I always liked thicker eye creams but this gel is super hydrating. All you need is a drop so this bottle will last me forever. I also like that if I rub my eye or my eyes tear it doesn&#x27;t burn. A lot of creams would irritate my eyes hours after applying</li>
            <li> Have been using this for few years now. Natural and effective.</li>
            <li> It really works...the bags under my eyes are smaller.  This is a wonderful product and I am so glad I purchased it.  I&#x27;ll be getting more.</li>
            <li> This eye gel burned my eyes. I checked again to see if I have little cuts or zits around my eye area, and maybe that&#x27;s why it felt like burning. But hope. My eyes are fine, just hurts really bad after using this eye gel. Same happened with alba toner. So I&#x27;ll prolly won&#x27;t buy from alba all in all</li>
            <li> Good product. Much cheaper on Amazon than local stores.</li>
            <li> If allergy bothers your eyes, this is your gel because it does not irritate your eyes at ALL. Thank you..</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This stuff feels nice and cool under your eyes; you can feel yourself waking up after applying it. Green tea is also amazing and it&#x27;s not tested on animals!</li>
            <li> I read in other reviews that this product burns. I have had no problem with that. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks. I actually notice a difference. I use it all around my eye area, even on my eye lids.  My skinner has a firmer appearance. I will be using this product from now on.</li>
            <li> Great for under eye soothing!&lt;br /&gt;Smells good - non-irritating!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because its made with natural ingredients and says that is hypoallergenic  but it gave me a horrible allergic reaction... the next time I&#x27;m going to make my own eye cream or try one for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very Soothing Eye Gel.&lt;br /&gt;All Organic, Very good for you ingredients. Nothing to worry about on the food label. Nice, slippery texture. Leaves nice smooth finish. Would highly recommend. Good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks (3 maybe).  Just with a small amount (one drop for each eye) is more than enough.  Few days ago I opened the bottle and realized surprisingly that is less than half!!! How come?  I wonder if it&#x27;s possible with the amount I used,  to be like that. Have I received it complete?  It&#x27;s a shame I didn&#x27;t opened before.  So be aware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that,  the product itself is OK if you have sensitive skin eye area, &#x27;cause isn&#x27;t oily.  Also leaves a fresh feeling... I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my dark circles, though.  Maybe after finishing the rest of the supposed 1 oz that I received I&#x27;ll see some results.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. I was looking for something with good and natural ingredients for under my eyes. Perfect.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t irritate ,doesn&#x27;t work for eye bags .but this bottle could last a whole year because a little goes long .wont buy again</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is wonderful. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t break me out, which a lot of others do.</li>
            <li> the gel soaks into my skin and seemed to have a firming feeling, but I have not noticed any change in the appearance of my under eye area using this product.</li>
            <li> After trying many products I thought this would be a good one. It provided no results. I&#x27;m going back to tea bags and cold spoons.</li>
            <li> Nice cool feeling on eyes.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of the puffiness, seems to lift my eyelids. I&#x27;m hooked! I&#x27;m 54 years old, and thought all the super moisturizing products were the way to go, but this stuff is it for me. I can see my eyelids again! :)</li>
            <li> I love Alba products but this is so watery I don&#x27;t really feel like it is doing anything.  I prefer the cream based products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I like it as much as the other Alba products. However, an added bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t allow your makeup to settle into the fine lines. For this reason alone, I&#x27;d purchase it and it&#x27;s economical. A half a pump is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 4 years and love it. It really helps to tighten under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the puffiness under my eyes would decrease some. Did not happen. Did feel refreshed after I used it</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m picky due to my extremely sensitive skin. i even use it on my face but then maybe too tight :P it means it also tighten my eye area, right? that&#x27;s a good news though :) i seldom purchase the same item twice but this is the first product that i bought it again and again. one drawback is the pumping bottle design, should change to an opaque tube</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff for several weeks and mostly it just made the skin under my eyes all oily. I saw no change in puffiness and discontinued use after about 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The only nice thing I can say about this product is that it smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> I first bought this from Whole Foods but have found it&#x27;s CHEAPER on Amazon.  This product does wonders on tired eyes and really reduces the puffiness. Don&#x27;t pay more for other brands as I have tried tons and have found this is the one that REALLY works.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it actually works and I have tried very expensive creams that did not do a thing.  I even put this on over my makeup during the day about  twice a day and then at night again.  I does not make your skin feel tight and seems to be getting rid of my puffiness under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will stick to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few eye creams/gels and I don&#x27;t notice much difference with many. This one is light on the skin and seems to make the area under my eyes a little brighter and softer.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I didn&#x27;t give it much of a chance, but its ok..  nothing special</li>
            <li> Nice, light, a favor to your skin.</li>
            <li> didnt notice much of a difference. I felt like it just made my face shinny and sticky. Def still need the coffee.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this brand for quite a long time--almost 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used the Alba Eye gel, I would get small hives in the section where I had put the gel. I concluded that this was an allergic reaction to one or more of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband was still using without any trouble and an item he loved and wanted to always keep in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin around his eyes was really looking nice. Although I think (at times) that men age better than women, this gel was surely helping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past year I noticed I had a few more fine lines and wrinkles that I hoped would disappear. As a result, 6 months ago I began to test Alba Eye gel again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually waited to see if I would hive from it but that never happened. I&#x27;ve been using this and much to my amazement, this gel really works. It didn&#x27;t take long before the fine lines looked less harsh--noticeable from up close but they looked as though I was still late twenties. My skin looked softer around my eyes and I looked less tired. I seriously wanted to buy an economy sized bottle and bathe in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past week the bottle was getting low and I ordered again.&lt;br /&gt;I was preparing to write a glowing review and grabbed the glass Alba bottle so that could include the ingredients listing. I found that the ingredients were not listed there.&lt;br /&gt;I searched for them and found that they&#x27;re actually written on the cardboard box that you throw away after purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was after reading this list that I could *not* in good conscience keep what remained in the bottle or order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the ingredients were written with the Latin botanical name so I went through the trouble of looking up each one of them out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;　Water&lt;br /&gt;　Aloe&lt;br /&gt;　glycerin&lt;br /&gt;　tea leaf extract&lt;br /&gt;　cucumber&lt;br /&gt;　papaya&lt;br /&gt;　wild/German chamomile&lt;br /&gt;　golden brown kelp&lt;br /&gt;　spirulina&lt;br /&gt;　pinecone ginger&lt;br /&gt;　allantoin-a product of oxidation of uric acid. In addition, allantoin is present in botanical extracts of the comfrey plant.&lt;br /&gt;　 Hyaluronic Acid- found in organ meats, cod liver oil and non animal sources like guavas and acerola sweet cherries.&lt;br /&gt;　hydrolized soy protein&lt;br /&gt;　Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate--(vitamin c),&lt;br /&gt;　Panthenol (vitamin b5),&lt;br /&gt;　Riboflavin (vitamin b2),&lt;br /&gt;　 Sodium Carbomer : Synthetic chemical as a thickener, stabilizer, and emulsifier.&lt;br /&gt;　Ethylhexylglycerin: natural preservative derived from glycerin acts as skin conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last but not least (and certainly not benign)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;　Phenoxyethanol: a preservative.&lt;br /&gt;Safety Measures/Side Effects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studies have shown that Phenoxyethanol can be an extreme irritant to the eyes and skin, and can even cause blistering; it is hazardous in the case of ingestion and inhalation as well. The Cosmetic Database rates it as a moderate hazard and notes cancer, allergic reactions, skin, eye and lung irritation, organ and neurotoxicity as possible effects of using products containing Phenoxyethanol. It has shown effects on sensory organs ***even at low doses***, and brain and nervous systems at moderate doses in animals, and causes cell mutation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to research, the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) data sheets show ****&amp;#34;chromosomal changes and genetic mutation effects in testing as well as testicular atrophy and reproductive damage in mice.&amp;#34;****&lt;br /&gt;(Information about Phenoxyethanol was found on Wikipedia and www.truthinaging.com)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I just miss something?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; eye gel from a fabulous company like Alba and they use an ingredient that is a potential NEUROTOXIN?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ummm...nope. Will not be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rather have fine lines and wrinkles rather than suffer from genetic mutations and chromosomal changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel really does such a good job so I have to decide between giving this a 5 for making my eyes look lovely or a 1 for the dastardly ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since noticed that Phenoxyethanol is in a lot of Alba products so I get the sense that they rely on the ignorance of their consumers to notice the healthy ingredients that they can pronounce and ignore those they can&#x27;t pronounce with a blind trust that Alba won&#x27;t deceive them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot in good conscience give it more than a 1 star because *never* should a company put people at risk of injury for the sake of beauty. Never.ce the healthy ingredients that they can pronounce and ignore those they can&#x27;t pronounce with a blind trust that Alba won&#x27;t deceive them.  I cannot in good conscience give it more than a 1 star because *never* should a company put people at risk of injury for the sake of beauty. Never.</li>
            <li> This is my fifth or sixth eye serum and it works best of all.  Only a little bit is needed.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on easily and is not oily.  Would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I have bought many products from alba and have been satisfied. I did not see any results and my eyes felt dry with application.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I swear it really helps with lines around the eyes. It also is easy to use and lasts fairly long since you only use a little each day. Alba overall has great skin care products.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Very soothing to the eye area. I use morning &amp; night.</li>
            <li> Cooling and soothing. Helps the fine lines showing up around the corners of my eyes. Not oily. Relatively quick to dry and absorb. Was a great product for after those summer days I spent too much time out in the sun.</li>
            <li> My eyes look at least 10 years younger.  I am so happy!!!  I love ALBA.  Best products that I have tried.  Great for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff gave me a terrible allergic reaction! Use with caution. I developed a red rash around my eye. I love this brand and use many of their products, but this was not so great.</li>
            <li> Seems to be based on the principal that slight irritation increases blood flow, but so does a warm shower or wash cloth alternated with some icy water - and that doesn&#x27;t go on irritating for a few hours. I&#x27;m not super sensitive with skin stuff, but this is enough to be distracting and cause a bit of redness, while doing very little for puffiness or circles. Not horrible, sort of like Dr. Bronners, but it&#x27;s on your eye.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it. Goes a long way! :)</li>
            <li> While searching amazon for a good deal on my alba face lotion I came across this eye gel. Figured I would give it a shot. I really like it. Helps with puffiness! And doesn&#x27;t feel like it dries out the skin around my eyes. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this, but I love how it glides on and absorbs quickly.  I feel secure wearing it knowing it will sooth my under eyes.</li>
            <li> everything alba is amazing, perfect for deputing bags under eyes</li>
            <li> I have been using other products of Alba Botanica and found myself in need of an eye cream.  This arrived yesterday to my office and one of the girls wanted to try some.  She loved it so much that she ordered herself some.  I used it last night and again this morning.  I love the eye gel.  It is very soothing and helps hide my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Bought this in February, it is now June :) It looks like I have barely used it. I use it nightly and I am super happy that I gave this a try. I used to get dark circles under my eyes, and now my eyes look well rested. Will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Love this product and better priced on Amazon than cosmetic counters at the mall!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alba&#x27;s eye gel for some time.  It&#x27;s a clean product with good ingredients and goes on easily.  It works well and is easy to use.</li>
