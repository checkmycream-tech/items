            <li>and it is also very light and buoyant.</li>
            <li>I love  it.</li>
            <li>Best part is that my hair smells like a hippie mixed with so many herbal smells.</li>
            <li>I love this product bc</li>
            <li>It is my daughter&#x27;s favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair feels nice silky smooth.</li>
            <li>(they make 2 types, 1 in a tube which seems stronger/, 1 in a pump which is the one I use and love).</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase and love this brand.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves hair feel silky.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, is all natural &amp; gluten-free.  </li>
            <li>I color my hair with a healthy brand of hair color and my hair is very shiny and healthy and I&#x27;m over 50!</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii and hair does not survive here well without good, nourishing and hydrating shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I do love the ingredients and the fresh smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is relaxed and frizz free after my scalp has been conditioned with some hair oil and then finished off with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>it is gluten free and works well.  </li>
            <li>Feather light moisture.  </li>
            <li>It is rated clean on EWG.</li>
            <li>is still full, no one in the family will use it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have nice hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy, shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>But this condition is the only thing that works; reducess dryness  and static significantly.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried a LOT of conditioners and this is definitely one of my favorite, and probably the most expensive one that I happily pay the money for when I can.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner for my daughters curly hair (she is mixed race)</li>
            <li>I love that they have the big bottles.  </li>
            <li>I originally tried this because it&#x27;s completely plant based and has no chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have started doing my own scalp treatments with regular coconut hair oil or other Indian hair oils and the combination of that with this conditioner is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I like it and the results but feel I need to use too much to get the results.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product my girlfirend is still with me,</li>
            <li>I put in a separate container and then stir in the oils, maybe 1/4 cup at a time~ not the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much either.</li>
            <li>I like it very much, but I also add in my own essential oils which help my scalp to not be dry and flaky:  Peppermint, thyme and rosemary essential oils, a dropperful of each, to your liking.  </li>
            <li>I have normal hair and wash it about once a week because it&#x27;s thinning.</li>
            <li>Makes my very coarse, very curly hair very, very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive, itchy scalp, and now I don&#x27;t.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I originally tried this because it&#x27;s completely plant based and has no chemicals. I like it and the results but feel I need to use too much to get the results. I&#x27;ll stay with it because it does control my flaky scalp.</li>

            <li> Best conditioner without harmfull chemichals</li>
            <li> I recently discovered this conditioner on a trip when I ran out of my usual. I have a sensitive, itchy scalp, and now I don&#x27;t. I personally think the smell rocks, and have gotten numerous compliments regarding the smell when I pass someone. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love the styling gel this company makes, it is the absolute best ever! (they make 2 types, 1 in a tube which seems stronger/, 1 in a pump which is the one I use and love). So I decided to try their conditioner.  I like it very much, but I also add in my own essential oils which help my scalp to not be dry and flaky:  Peppermint, thyme and rosemary essential oils, a dropperful of each, to your liking.  I put in a separate container and then stir in the oils, maybe 1/4 cup at a time~ not the whole bottle.  That way you can make adjustments on the oils as needed.  Works for me.  I color my hair with a healthy brand of hair color and my hair is very shiny and healthy and I&#x27;m over 50!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for my daughters curly hair (she is mixed race) it&#x27;s very moisturizing and smells absolutely wonderful! We&#x27;ve tried a LOT of conditioners and this is definitely one of my favorite, and probably the most expensive one that I happily pay the money for when I can.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It smells great, is all natural &amp; gluten-free.  I try to maintain a toxin-free household &amp; sometimes find these products don&#x27;t work well.  Well, this shampoo works GREAT.  I will continue to purchase and love this brand.</li>
            <li> Feather light moisture.  Makes my very coarse, very curly hair very, very soft.  I add two or three drops of argan or jojoba oil when I need a little extra.  I combine this with the MGA shampoo.  Lovely.</li>
            <li> My hair looks &amp; feels great, texture is very soft color looks great and it is also very light and buoyant. This would have to best shampoo and conditioner I have ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of expensive ones</li>
            <li> I love that they have the big bottles.  This stuff is the best</li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves hair feel silky.  It doesn&#x27;t take much either. I have not notice it adding to the problem on my scalp it does help with the itch.  The only con is it stinks.</li>
