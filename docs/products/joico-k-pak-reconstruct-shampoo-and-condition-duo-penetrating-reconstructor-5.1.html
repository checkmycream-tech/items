            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This product sure helped it regain strength and look healthier!</li>
            <li>will be fine since I&#x27;ve used it before and loved it.</li>
            <li>my absolute favourite hair care products, the  Joico K-Pak range is incredible.</li>
            <li>I have almost used all of the conditioner for my very fine hair and shoulder lenth to feel it softening my hair</li>
            <li>And it arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>In general I&#x27;ve had a great experience with good deals on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for over a year now and love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure when I do it</li>
            <li>I love these two products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>Works magic on hair.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love this product</li>
            <li>This product should be more concentrated.</li>
            <li>already used this product to much time and my hair forever stay good</li>
            <li>The shampoo seems fine.</li>
            <li>The trick is go light on the conditioner</li>
            <li>Overall, once again, happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>and I have to use a handful of product just to make my hair tangle free.</li>
            <li>Beware the bottles of shampoo and conditioner are super large!!!</li>
            <li>I purchased a new bottle at a salon &amp; there was a huge difference (improvement!)</li>
            <li>Regardless, I don&#x27;t feel I got my money&#x27;s worth this time, even with the too-good-to-be-true price.</li>
            <li>HOPING THAT IT WOULD HELP HER DRY, BRITTLE, OVER-PROCESSED HAIR, AND IN 2 WEEKS WE NOTICED A HUGE DIFFERENCE!!</li>
            <li>The conditioner and Penetrating Reconstructor 5.1 aren&#x27;t as concentrated as what you get when you buy in a salon or beauty supply store - I have to use 1.5 to 2 times more to get the same results.</li>
            <li>Try to order during colder seasons, as the product may change consistency during hot summer shipping delivery dates.</li>
            <li>They are great for hair that is dry due to sun or blowdrying, etc.  </li>
            <li>This product was shipped in a timely manner and was packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>in my hair the very moment I used it, compared to a month with this stuff.</li>
            <li>my hair feels like silk, and my hair is so much stronger and my hair is so much thicker than what it used to be.</li>
            <li>This time however, sadly the deal was really to good to be true.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I have dry natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the other item purchased in the shipping was sealed so did not affect it.</li>
            <li>I want to order that shampoo &amp; conditioner again, it did help reduce hair breakage, but I didn&#x27;t really like the deep treatment</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable and the smell is a plus.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it was just old?</li>
            <li>So if you are going through dry brittle hair, no shine and friz...I would try this first before trying anything else.</li>
            <li>I have tried sooo many brands from cheap to very expensive hair products to get some shine in my hair.</li>
            <li>So far, this has been the only Shampoo and Conditioner with the Reconstruct Deep-Penetrating Cream that has helped my hair.</li>
            <li>When i am using the reconstructor i generally leave it on for approx 5-8 hours, after i have had a colour treatment done at my local salon.</li>

            <li> Also, the mask is very liquid not rich at all!</li>
            <li> Not sure the product you sent is really a Joico product.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised at how little I needed to use.</li>
            <li> The set came with clear heavy tape all over it. .</li>
            <li> I have tried this prior to purchasing from this seller and this time it seemed to be watered down.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, my daughters hair is very dry has lots of tangles, gets then out no problem.</li>
            <li> It arrived a big mess.  </li>
            <li> and I can use the working pump from my empty bottle as a replacement.</li>
            <li> Second it looks like the quantity is way less than it should!</li>
            <li> it was like the mask was old or outdated. .</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t weight down the curls.</li>
            <li> That wouldn&#x27;t be bad either if when removing the tape it didn&#x27;t leave a huge sticky mess all over my bottles that can&#x27;t be washed off.</li>
            <li> I received it in time only problem being that one of the pumps had broken during shipment.</li>
            <li> This product came taped all together in heavy mailing tape.</li>
            <li> a few weeks after from my colour treatment done, i change to 2 weekly treatments.</li>
            <li> cause my hair would stiff after I apply it .</li>
            <li> The small bottle of conditioner didn&#x27;t do anything , and was watery when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was even Joico.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, I expected the same product I&#x27;d been using, (which I purchased in the salon), but this product was extremely watered down in comparison!</li>
            <li> I did not receive what I ordered and when I posted my complaint regarding the mistake in my order, I received zero response.</li>
            <li> This product are fake is not a real Joico don&#x27;t use I lose my money</li>
            <li> First, the mask was unsealed, it consistency is sooo bad like the product is expired!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed... paid a lot of money for absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a stale smell to it</li>
            <li> never and ever get this product is fake</li>
            <li> However, the reconstructive mask is a totally disappointing!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed on how this came.</li>

            <li> Love this product, I have dry natural curly hair. This product makes my hair bouncy, shiny and manageable. The trick is go light on the conditioner so you don&#x27;t weight down the curls. this conditioner is so good you dont need a lot.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, my daughters hair is very dry has lots of tangles, gets then out no problem. Joico K Pak is great.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are perfection!! No complains on that at all!! However, the reconstructive mask is a totally disappointing!  First, the mask was unsealed, it consistency is sooo bad like the product is expired!!!!! Second it looks like the quantity is way less than it should! Also, the mask is very liquid not rich at all! I would not be purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> Awesome products! Speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for over a year now and love it. It has done wonders for my color-treated hair. I always bought it at the salon I go to but decided to get it on amazon this time since I have moved. It smells the same and has the same consistency as the stuff I had bought from the salon. I received it in time only problem being that one of the pumps had broken during shipment. I&#x27;m wasn&#x27;t too worried about this since nothing had spilled and I can use the working pump from my empty bottle as a replacement. Overall, once again, happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product. The conditioner has a stale smell to it and I have to use a handful of product just to make my hair tangle free. I would not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed on how this came. I have not used the product yet and I&#x27;m sure when I do it will be fine since I&#x27;ve used it before and loved it. This product came taped all together in heavy mailing tape. It doesn&#x27;t come in a box holding all three bottles together it&#x27;s just taped. That wouldn&#x27;t be bad either if when removing the tape it didn&#x27;t leave a huge sticky mess all over my bottles that can&#x27;t be washed off.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this company! I did not receive what I ordered and when I posted my complaint regarding the mistake in my order, I received zero response. I ordered a combo shampoo, conditioner &amp; a repair conditioner. I received 2 conditioners &amp; no shampoo. Worst of all, I expected the same product I&#x27;d been using, (which I purchased in the salon), but this product was extremely watered down in comparison! In general I&#x27;ve had a great experience with good deals on Amazon. This time however, sadly the deal was really to good to be true.</li>
            <li> I love these two products.  They are great for hair that is dry due to sun or blowdrying, etc.  I am very pleased with all my Joico K Pak products.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped in a timely manner and was packaged very well.  I used this and my hair is in amazing condition! I&#x27;m so happy that I chose to go with this :)</li>
            <li> This product are fake is not a real Joico don&#x27;t use I lose my money never and ever get this product is fake</li>
            <li> The package was opening / violated and the product leaked inside of the box, dirtying the others goods that I bought in the same order.</li>
            <li> The conditioner and Penetrating Reconstructor 5.1 aren&#x27;t as concentrated as what you get when you buy in a salon or beauty supply store - I have to use 1.5 to 2 times more to get the same results. The shampoo seems fine.</li>
            <li> I have bought the Joico duo package from my salon.  Ordered from Amazon to save $.  It arrived a big mess.  The bottles were taped together and leaked.  The conditioner bottle has a big gash in it and 1/4 of it was all over.  Fortunately, the other item purchased in the shipping was sealed so did not affect it.</li>
            <li> GREAT SHAMPOO/ CONDITIONER! MY DAUGHTERS HAIR NEEDED HELP, SO WE BOUGHT JOICO HOPING THAT IT WOULD HELP HER DRY, BRITTLE, OVER-PROCESSED HAIR, AND IN 2 WEEKS WE NOTICED A HUGE DIFFERENCE!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I recocommend it 💯%</li>
            <li> So far, this has been the only Shampoo and Conditioner with the Reconstruct Deep-Penetrating Cream that has helped my hair. I have tried sooo many brands from cheap to very expensive hair products to get some shine in my hair. So if you are going through dry brittle hair, no shine and friz...I would try this first before trying anything else. Just so you know...this is only my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s fantastic! Works magic on hair. My hair was thinning quite a bit after a childbirth. This product sure helped it regain strength and look healthier! Beware the bottles of shampoo and conditioner are super large!!! you might want to share with someone! Try to order during colder seasons, as the product may change consistency during hot summer shipping delivery dates.</li>
            <li> I want to order that shampoo &amp; conditioner again, it did help reduce hair breakage, but I didn&#x27;t really like the deep treatment cause my hair would stiff after I apply it .</li>
            <li> Not sure the product you sent is really a Joico product.  Maybe a knock off.  I still have some that purchased at a salon and what you sent acts differently and my hair responds to it differently.  Would you please check into this. I have used Joico products for over 20 years and I know that it is not the fault of Joico.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. My hair is soft and manageable and the smell is a plus. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> This product was different from the one at the salon.. it was like the mask was old or outdated. . The set came with clear heavy tape all over it. . Very disappointed... paid a lot of money for absolutely nothing.  I will never go back. Never.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> The small bottle of conditioner didn&#x27;t do anything , and was watery when it arrived. Seemed like it had been tampered with!</li>
            <li> already used this product to much time and my hair forever stay good&lt;br /&gt;i love this product&lt;br /&gt;the results are good</li>
            <li> I have tried this prior to purchasing from this seller and this time it seemed to be watered down. This product should be more concentrated. I have almost used all of the conditioner for my very fine hair and shoulder lenth to feel it softening my hair</li>
            <li> My hair was soft.  I am surprised at how little I needed to use.</li>
            <li> Works great! loved it!</li>
            <li> The penetrating conditioner was lumpy &amp; runny. Not sure if it was even Joico. I purchased a new bottle at a salon &amp; there was a huge difference (improvement!) in my hair the very moment I used it, compared to a month with this stuff. Maybe it was just old? Regardless, I don&#x27;t feel I got my money&#x27;s worth this time, even with the too-good-to-be-true price.</li>
            <li> my absolute favourite hair care products, the  Joico K-Pak range is incredible. When i am using the reconstructor i generally leave it on for approx 5-8 hours, after i have had a colour treatment done at my local salon. a few weeks after from my colour treatment done, i change to 2 weekly treatments. my hair feels like silk, and my hair is so much stronger and my hair is so much thicker than what it used to be. definitely reccomend this product to anyone with any hair type.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! And Amazing Price!! It&#x27;s normally double or triple this price! And it arrived very quickly! Very happy!</li>
