    <ol>
            <li>This one is perfect.</li>
            <li>Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I put the tip under a 16x loupe, it is ground to a perfect tip!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I bought these tweezers because I have a pair of Seki nail clippers which are the best nail clippers I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Pin-point precise/sharp with a great grip on even the finest hair.</li>
            <li>The grip is good and they work well on a splinter</li>
            <li>I would not suggest these to anyone looking for a good pair</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Based on the nail clippers, I figured their tweezers would be amazing too.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best tweezer I&#x27;ve every owned.</li>
            <li>What they are very light and very strong.</li>
            <li>Was able to grab splinter in my hand</li>
            <li>Recommended, for sure.</li>
            <li>Some people rated these just ok?????</li>
            <li>So if you are thinking about a set, have NO worries cause they are TOP notch tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I thought by paying more, I might get a better quality tweezer.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s operator error, but I can tweeze better with my $5 tweezers from the grocery store.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use and accurate.</li>
            <li>My wife loves these tweezers because she can easily pluck her eyebrows with it</li>
            <li>I do have several knives made there and again a great steel and workmanship.</li>
            <li>When I try to clean it with a tissue it snags the tissue paper.</li>
            <li>The quality of construction is fantastic, but my hair seems to glide right through the grip.  </li>
            <li>Besides the feel of the brushed stainless, I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of the steel to be able to remove the tiny slivers I get in my hand from time to time.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are just another great product from Seki-Edge, and the tweezers are very well-made from the same type of steel, that the Samurai Swords were made out of....</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace the same item I had purchased before which I really liked (but got damaged when it was dropped).</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend spending the money for this nice product.</li>
            <li>I have tried them as well, and it seems to be able to pluck an ingrown hair for example with more ease and less pain.  </li>
            <li>She stopped using her old tweezers right away that weren&#x27;t cheap either.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more expensive, but well worth the cost for a superior product.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>They are a pretty silver color.</li>
            <li>A good tweezer is hard to find.  </li>
            <li>High quality made in japan tweezers work very well.</li>
            <li>The tips are Thick, could get under a splinter or hair better if thinner.</li>
            <li>I have been on the search for good tweezers for years, sadly I am still searching.</li>
            <li>One side of the tip was actually longer than the other, not to mention the fit &amp; finish cheaper was looking on the inside than the outside, since they didn&#x27;t even bother to finish it completely in the inside.  </li>
            <li>I can barely pull my eyebrows with these things.</li>

            <li> Hello, This met my expectations. The tweezers get to the smallest hairs with out a problem. I have nothing else to say</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace the same item I had purchased before which I really liked (but got damaged when it was dropped). However this one does not have the same quality. There are rough burs on the tip from the machining. When I try to clean it with a tissue it snags the tissue paper.</li>
            <li> The tips are Thick, could get under a splinter or hair better if thinner. The grip is good and they work well on a splinter</li>
            <li> A good tweezer is hard to find.  This one is perfect. I ordered a second one for traveling.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are just another great product from Seki-Edge, and the tweezers are very well-made from the same type of steel, that the Samurai Swords were made out of....from this company out of Japan!!  I highly-recommend them!!!</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of these to try before buying some Rubis tweezers.  Well, that was a bad idea.  The quality on these was subpar to say the least.  One side of the tip was actually longer than the other, not to mention the fit &amp; finish cheaper was looking on the inside than the outside, since they didn&#x27;t even bother to finish it completely in the inside.  I then got a pair of Rubis tweezers and the quality was night and day compared to these.  They&#x27;re more expensive, but well worth the cost for a superior product.</li>
            <li> High quality made in japan tweezers work very well. Was able to grab splinter in my hand my other ones could not get.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best tweezer I&#x27;ve every owned. Pin-point precise/sharp with a great grip on even the finest hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for good tweezers for years, sadly I am still searching. These tweezers do not grab even course hairs. They are solidly made just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Not the quality tweezers I was looking for. On a scale of 10 I rate a 6. Don&#x27;t quite grip as well as expected.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as stated.  Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> All tweezers are not created equal.  My wife loves these tweezers because she can easily pluck her eyebrows with it (it grips the little hairs well).  She even lets me use them to remove splinters.</li>
            <li> Seki products seem to be so well-made. I can use these tweezers daily without harming my skin. Recommended, for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers for my wife, and she loves them.  She stopped using her old tweezers right away that weren&#x27;t cheap either.  I have tried them as well, and it seems to be able to pluck an ingrown hair for example with more ease and less pain.  Would definitely recommend spending the money for this nice product.</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t go wrong with Seki...</li>
            <li> Well Made. I do not use it but my wife likes it.  that is all I can say about it.</li>
            <li> Some people rated these just ok????? What they are very light and very strong. I put the tip under a 16x loupe, it is ground to a perfect tip!!!!!! So if you are thinking about a set, have NO worries cause they are TOP notch tweezers.  An no I do not work in Seki, Japan.  I do have several knives made there and again a great steel and workmanship.</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers because I have a pair of Seki nail clippers which are the best nail clippers I have ever used.  Based on the nail clippers, I figured their tweezers would be amazing too.  I was very wrong.  The edge on these is off or something.  They don&#x27;t grip hairs well.  It feels like you have the hair, you pull and the hair is still their, over and over again.</li>
            <li> Besides the feel of the brushed stainless, I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of the steel to be able to remove the tiny slivers I get in my hand from time to time.</li>
            <li> I thought by paying more, I might get a better quality tweezer.  The quality of construction is fantastic, but my hair seems to glide right through the grip.  Maybe it&#x27;s operator error, but I can tweeze better with my $5 tweezers from the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I can barely pull my eyebrows with these things. I would not suggest these to anyone looking for a good pair</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use and accurate. They do their job. They are a pretty silver color. They remove my stray eyebows which I have a phobia about.</li>
