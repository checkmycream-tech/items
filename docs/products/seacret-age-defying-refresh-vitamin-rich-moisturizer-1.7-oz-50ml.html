            <li>I love this product and bought it from the Seacret co directly for $119.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel fresh and hydrated and reduces the appearance of my wrinkles</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s supposed to b ok for sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>This product sinks into my skin and seems to plump it up a bit, feels good overnight, does not irritate me.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>; My sister said on one side of her face her wrinkles were very prominent, and the other side there practically were none.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer if you like a thick consistency that kind of sits on top not really soaking into the skin.  </li>
            <li>makes your skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about the moisturizing benefits; does not lay on the skin but absorbs and gives a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it was a different one..</li>
            <li>first of all let me tell you</li>
            <li>Be aware this product caused an allergic reaction even tho</li>
            <li>I first received it as a birthday gift in a set.  </li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t use this myself, but my wife swears by it and is constantly using my credit to buy it so it must be good.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a bit too strong for my personal preference.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely adore this cream.</li>
            <li>How can this be much cheaper?</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to reduce wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re waking up in the morning or unwinding after a long day its cool to refresh, take a deep breath in and feel the strength of this mineral rich moisturizer on your skin.</li>
            <li>my smile lines are so much smoother not as deep.</li>
            <li>Did not look new.  </li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this product works well.</li>
            <li>It is amazing , and you need  use only very little, I&#x27;m 77 years old and people say I look 60 :</li>
            <li>Glad I found same product for much less on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I understand that some people were buying it from the mall and paid a lot, but I purchased mine directly...</li>
            <li>Thank you Seacret, now I can look young again.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd time I ordered this same exact face cream.</li>
            <li>My eyes get crusty and dry and this product really moisturizes my eyes and my face.</li>
            <li>not heavy on the skin and leaves my skin totally hydrated without being greasy.  </li>

            <li> I have these dry skin bumps that even my Dermatologist could not fix.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy it after my sister told me about a lady who came into a store where she worked complaining that the Seacret sales people were pushy and annoying and put their wrinkle cream on her trying to push her into buying it, which is pretty true a lot of the time and it does turn me off trying their stuff.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m hydrating at a deeper level the bumps are less than half the size and not red anymore.  </li>
            <li> i have to be very careful about what i use.</li>
            <li> Cream itself looked and smelled as usual though.</li>
            <li> This would serve well as a protective cream but not under makeup - too thick.  </li>
            <li> but on the retail is ridiculously spendy.</li>
            <li> ; worse in my 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Unhappy experience</li>

            <li> This is the best face product ever. I will most definaty be buying it again. It was a gray deal</li>
            <li> I have been searching for moisture for my face for 20 years and I finally found it.  I have fair skin and dry since my 40&#x27;s; worse in my 50&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years.  The Retinal A, Hyaluronic Acid, Peptides are helpful but they do not hydrate.  I use this along with the facial serum and my skin is moisturized from the inside.  I&#x27;ve only been using these products 3 weeks and the condition of my skin has improved dramatically.  I have these dry skin bumps that even my Dermatologist could not fix.  Since I&#x27;m hydrating at a deeper level the bumps are less than half the size and not red anymore.  I am 61 and a smoker so I do have wrinkles.  However, they have softened and my skin has a more even tone; pores are tighter; skin somewhat tighter.  I wish I&#x27;d had this stuff in my 40&#x27;s!  I can&#x27;t say enough about the moisturizing benefits; does not lay on the skin but absorbs and gives a healthy glow.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer if you like a thick consistency that kind of sits on top not really soaking into the skin.  The fragrance is a bit too strong for my personal preference.  This would serve well as a protective cream but not under makeup - too thick.  I would not purchase this again.  They make a peeling gel that is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Tried a moisturizer @ mall.  I&#x27;m sure it was a different one.. But has caused me to try to do better with my skin....</li>
            <li> I have been using Seacret Age-defying Refresh for 5 years and was delighted when I found it on Amazon. Now I know I&#x27;ll never run it. It is amazing , and you need  use only very little, I&#x27;m 77 years old and people say I look 60 : +}</li>
            <li> Great product.  Very light scent,  not heavy on the skin and leaves my skin totally hydrated without being greasy.  will continue with this line.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling well hydrated but not greasy.  Pleasant smelling. Receiving comments on how well my skin looks!&lt;br /&gt;This was my second order and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I am going through the bottle too quickly as I love it and use it almost every day. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! first of all let me tell you i have very sensitive skin, so i have to be very careful about what i use. i have now been using this product for only five days and i am already seeing better texture on my skin, more even skin tone. my smile lines are so much smoother not as deep. I am very very happy with this moistureiser! it defenetly has refreshed my skin. will be buying again and again and again:-)</li>
            <li> I love this product and bought it from the Seacret co directly for $119. How can this be much cheaper? I understand that some people were buying it from the mall and paid a lot, but I purchased mine directly... Can anyone explain ths to me?</li>

            <li> awesome product for allergies. I am allergic to everything, dogs, cats, pollen you name it..My eyes get crusty and dry and this product really moisturizes my eyes and my face. The scent is refreshing and clean. I highly recommend this product to anyone&#x3D;) The best in the market and worth the price if you purchase here on Amazon versus the companies website.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I spend a lot of time in the sun and use this product every day. It makes my skin feel fresh and hydrated and reduces the appearance of my wrinkles</li>

            <li> Be aware this product caused an allergic reaction even tho it&#x27;s supposed to b ok for sensitive skin.. As the company won&#x27;t refund I lost my money had several days of discomfort .. Unhappy experience</li>
            <li> should have gotten more at better price- gone up $20. This brand helps moisturize my skin well but on the retail is ridiculously spendy. I do nt like how in Malls they pressure women or men to purchase. Glad I found same product for much less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughter because it is her favorite moisturizer!  This was a birthday present, just bought another one for Chrstmas!</li>

            <li> Great Product!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to reduce wrinkles.  This is a good price too!</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re waking up in the morning or unwinding after a long day its cool to refresh, take a deep breath in and feel the strength of this mineral rich moisturizer on your skin. The difference in discernible through the glow this moisturizer produces. At the same time this moisturizer is an age-defying cream with moisture beads that go a long way. I just quit smoking and it is now time to refresh my skin. Thank you Seacret, now I can look young again.</li>

The lady ranted on and asked my sister if it even made a difference. My sister was just like &amp;#34;Um.. honestly?&amp;#34; My sister said on one side of her face her wrinkles were very prominent, and the other side there practically were none. I decided to give it a crack since a lot of years of smoking has started to take its toll even though I quit 2 years ago and I&#x27;m only 27. Its really good, easily absorbs and makes your skin super soft and smooth. Great price on here too. I&#x27;m going to try the eye cream as well, hopefully it works just as good :)</li>
            <li> This product sinks into my skin and seems to plump it up a bit, feels good overnight, does not irritate me. I would recommend it to anyone over 50!</li>
            <li> love this stuff,  it works great, keeps my face soft and smooth. for being 44 it helps with the wrinkles</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time. I first received it as a birthday gift in a set.  I have since ordered it all the time.  I am very pleased with the moisture it provides..... not too much and never greasy!</li>
            <li> Love this product....I have very sensitive skin, and this product works well. Non-irritating. This is the 2nd time I ordered this same exact face cream.</li>
            <li> Came in time , but the box was not sealed in plastic and the container inside was all scratched up like if it was refilled and reused lots of times. Did not look new.  Cream itself looked and smelled as usual though.</li>
