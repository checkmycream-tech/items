            <li>I bought this 2 months ago after reading the great reviews, and it was definitely a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay moisturizer, but nothing too impressive.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too!</li>

            <li>I really liked this product!</li>

            <li>good product, smells great, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>but if you consider the benefits of good healthy ingredients and the impact on your skin, it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li>It is creamy and pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li>It has a vanilla smell to it which I find is pleasant.</li>
            <li>To my pleasant surprise, Bel essence outperformed the l&#x27;occitane night cream I had been using with a $100+ price tag.</li>
            <li>This cream was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>After using Bel Essence twice a day for a month I am happy to say my skin is 100% softer and the wrinkles have smoothed out a bit....enough to make me love this product!  </li>
            <li>I started with their oil and really loved how it felt on my skin.  </li>
            <li>so it lasts a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Feels great and makes your skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>It is good moisture for winter.</li>
            <li>favorite thing about this product aside from the results (which I promise you will see,) is the absolutely incredible smell.</li>
            <li>I rate it as fair.  </li>
            <li>Good for moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>--I haven&#x27;t found a good replacement--</li>
            <li>It feels like you&#x27;re putting something good on your skin.</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It feels like a good moisturizer and smells good.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a couple of weeks now, it feels good and smells good.</li>
            <li>It is a good cream..</li>
            <li>But, it is still a good cream..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say one way or another whether it&#x27;s had any effect on my wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve tried so many wrinkle products with and without chemicals that I&#x27;m happy just to have found one that feels good, smells good and makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t understand good reviews.</li>
            <li>What I like particullary is that my face feels as good in the morning than at night.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell all that good</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>and it smells good.</li>
            <li>&quot; my fair skin).</li>
            <li>I found out about this product from another Amazon review that has recommended it as a good cream after using the hyaluronic acid serum from Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li>This is a good all-natural cream that has helped my skin regain its suppleness.</li>
            <li>Feel like it is just as good as some of the store bought brands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s JUST as good as the \\&quot;hundreds of dollars\\&quot; brands.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes you just can&#x27;t tell how good a product is until you use it for awhile.  </li>
            <li>I works particularly good on the décolletage area.  </li>
            <li>I used this for about a month twice a day to give it a good chance, but my face still felt dry/tight after applying it, like it never fully soaked in.</li>
            <li>so I need a good product</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the good reviews here.</li>
            <li>If you have been looking for a good cream-</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs wonderfully.</li>
            <li>and I hoped this would be a good every day moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li>It feels good and never stings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall good product, which doesn&#x27;t cause any skin irritations.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after scouring the internet for hours trying to find a good face cream.  </li>
            <li>This product is definitely a good moisturizer, but I can&#x27;t say in regards to toning the skin and reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have received compliments as to how good my face looks after using.  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself feels great on the skin, but it smells kind of like olives.  </li>
            <li>I do expect to see improvements as that takes time and this product deserves a good try.</li>
            <li>It is good under my eyemakeup.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer...</li>
            <li>It reviews as good stuff.  </li>
            <li>For that amount of money, the product should smell good.</li>
            <li>and I have loved it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I am doing something good for my skin!</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want a more beautiful wife?</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>

            <li>This stuff is phenomenal - moisturizing, smells great, but doesn&#x27;t cause breakout.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great is that it doesn&#x27;t disappear the minute you put it on which made me feel as if it was most effective.  </li>

            <li>It makes my skin look bright and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It is an absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li>Smell is light and feel&#x27;s great on face.  </li>
            <li>or if they just all work well together, but I have been using all of them for 3 months and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a great texture, goes on smooth, and leaves skin feeling moist but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>Absorbs nicely despite the oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest to say I was leery in purchasing this product because of it&#x27;s size and cost.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice smell</li>
            <li>I wish I could say that I look as good as (or better than)</li>
            <li>and she totally liked this product</li>
            <li>Nice smell and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a bit and honestly......</li>
            <li>It does feel nice on your skin.</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>The texture is creamy, kind of reminds me of white-chocalate (the smell) and what can I say,</li>
            <li>Plus it smells nice.</li>
            <li>it has a nice feel to it</li>
            <li>Nice and mosturizing.  </li>
            <li>and it has a nice warm scent to it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again for an excellent product.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it has a nice fragrance however if I get it too close to my eyes it causes them to burn and water for a moment.  </li>
            <li>in addition it is kind of greasy like butter.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>-- kind of &#x27;nutty&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>and I really think it works wonderful and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice as well.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that I am noticing a difference already.</li>
            <li>I am a very happy customer and will be happy to do future business.  </li>
            <li>nice and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Nice cream.</li>
            <li>I am kind of on the fence about getting it again.</li>
            <li>But it is wonderful to use after a weekly peel as it is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>The absolute best effect is of course that it has caused zero breakouts.</li>
            <li>Most of the creams I have used may feel good when applying</li>
            <li>I like this cream for the most part, it feels good when I put it on</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell</li>
            <li>and my spouse has commented that my skin has a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice cream, i did not notice any changes as of yet in my skin</li>
            <li>but it feels very luxurious and wonderful to the skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Bel essence is formulated the way I would formulate a product of this kind.  </li>
            <li>I have heard so many good things about this product</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day or more often if I am home and just want my skin to feel good.</li>
            <li>nice, nourishing cream.</li>
            <li>(texture is kind of \\&quot;whipped\\&quot;), but not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>I used that for a while and liked the results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like putting smelly Vaseline on your face.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li>Nice and creamy.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles (I have been using this for over 3 months now), but is a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li>MY SKIN RESPONDS TO IT NICELY...</li>
            <li>But I really like it best for under my eyes.</li>
            <li>This cream has a really nice thickness to it-</li>
            <li>its nice i like it</li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>Fast and great seller!</li>
            <li>so this is nice as an all-over face lotion when I&#x27;m out of eye cream.</li>
            <li>It has a very, nice, light vanilla scent too.</li>
            <li>All natural, smells delicious (Not too strong, like a light vanilla/candy scent), great consistency, didn&#x27;t cause breakouts, great to use at night</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of early to announce it as a best cream.</li>
            <li>but it is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Smells great, greasy feeling dissolved quickly</li>
            <li>It has a light vanilla scent, which I find pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This product has excellent ingredients, your face feels very soft.</li>
            <li>My make up went over it very easily.  </li>
            <li>Bel Essence is very easy to apply and I have had no skin irritations/other problems since using it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m absolutely impressed by how soft and supple my face feels!</li>
            <li>The best part is that it is made of all natural ingredients!  </li>
            <li>I love, love loveeee the smell!</li>
            <li>This is the best one out of four that I tried so far!</li>
            <li>Good product,  the cream is very smooth and easy to apply on face,  I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>and so far i&#x27;m loving it alot!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the natural ingredients and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I got you this awesome eye wrinkle cream completely out of the blue!&amp;#34; and what she didn&#x27;t say was...</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait on giving my review until I have used it for a while, and I will say this is by far the best moisturizer I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li>The fabulous list of ingredients along with the smell can&#x27;t help but make me feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li>And it also came with a note that said something along the lines of &amp;#34;write a good review and get a free jar&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost5 weeks, I am 25 years old, but I am VERY happy about the result, I use it before bed.</li>
            <li>It is not as shiny as most *effective* moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>and my skin looks amazing, the wrinkles are almost gone and it looks more hydrated and fuller unerneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>This natural product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I am 53 years old and am so proud of my skin and no one believes that I could be in my 50&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 and this lotion is perfect for a 30 something year old&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>even Nivea is more effective than this (and a lot cheaper).  </li>
            <li>My skin FEELS great after using it and I had no problems using it right after the dermaroller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients and it smells great!  </li>
            <li>But definitely better than very strong anti aging chemical cream.</li>
            <li>Some of the best features of this product are: the smell (like vanilla cookies baking) and the texture (super smooth and soft and feels great going on).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just about finished my first jar of Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment, and am happy to write a review for this product.  </li>
            <li>It does feel great and makes your face supple &amp; hydrated with the first appplication.  </li>
            <li>Way to gauge your loyal customers....pathetic!!</li>
            <li>I am also very comfortable with the ingredients—you do not have to be a chemist to understand what the product contains.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a very smooth cream, not a bit oily, and seems to glide over my face.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth and looks brighter.</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>All Natural Anti Wrinkle cream is an amazing product!!</li>
            <li>My skin feels fantastic &amp; looks more radiant!  </li>
            <li>Oils from various sources are excellent and are full of Vit. E etc., great for mature skin, great for any skin.</li>
            <li>Very good product so far.</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old, have never smoked and have very good eating and exercise habits.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s huge!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite features of the cream is the ingredients used to make it.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying the quality of ingredients that they include with their products.  </li>
            <li>It has more nourishing oils in it than the Bel Essence Anti-Aging Oil.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my face.</li>
            <li>If the quality was better the price would not be an issue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that with continued use, my skin will get even better.</li>
            <li>I would like to try more products from this line.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and was so glad I read about it in a review for another product I like.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this formula.</li>
            <li>and now I feel like I am armed with the appropriate defense for winter.  </li>

            <li>and God knows how many types I tried.</li>

            <li>I need to continue to use it for sure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to get another one in order to see more long-term effects.</li>
            <li>I could not gush more about this cream and what it has done for me.</li>
            <li>Okay, I waited.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better already.</li>
            <li>I would be okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would be okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 3 days of using it i noticed a  bit of a change,my skin is hydrated.has made my pores smaller,&lt;br /&gt;and hoping too see some wrinkle magic!I would recommend this product,and look forward too seeing more results</li>
            <li>It feels softer and more touchable.  </li>
            <li>My skin seems to be smoother and more radiant.  </li>
            <li>I really love this</li>

            <li>Ok, so here&#x27;s the deal.</li>
            <li>I have tried many creams and serums for aging skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that with continued use, my skin will get even better.</li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d settle on a winning formula and stick with it.</li>

            <li>Now I just need to order more.</li>

            <li>telling my family and friends about this product.&lt;br /&gt;The best facial product yet.</li>

            <li>I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this and have to say that I absolutely love the way it makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li>Although many of the ingredients consist of some type of oil, it does not leave your skin feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li>and they love it.  </li>
            <li>Of course I know that any anti-aging effects will take a bit more time to manifest themselves</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love how it feels.</li>
            <li>I wish they came out with more stuff.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheaper than botox :)</li>
            <li>I have tried many many drugstore brands that worked &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; but never gave me a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin like this did.</li>
            <li>but I do love this and hope that they never change the formula as some companies do, even if it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li>softer brighter more evenly toned</li>
            <li>I love this treatment</li>
            <li>I REALLY love this cream....</li>
            <li>I use the Bel essence after shower and an hour or more after applying Retin A at night.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many moisturizers, anti-aging creams etc over the years.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great quality!&lt;br /&gt;Wayne&#x27;s Wife</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure to put lotion or cream on my face every night and each morning because I don&#x27;t WANT wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Lovely cream...</li>
            <li>I love it because my skin does look better.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the texture of the cream.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my skin feels better than the &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; product that I was using.  </li>
            <li>and so many people rave about what it&#x27;s done for their skin.</li>
            <li>I love how the Bel Essence smells as well as how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>Feels OK, still haven&#x27;t decided wheather it works.</li>
            <li>It seems like it&#x27;s making even more wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a ton of anti-aging creams and usually most of them do not work for me.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this cream and the oil.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a week twice a day my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>You will love this product:))</li>
            <li>I love the smell as well.  </li>
            <li>For that reason alone I will be buying more of this product, plus it seems to be helping my skin to be smoother and more even toned.</li>
            <li>I will keep using this product for sure,</li>
            <li>I can imagine over time it will have much better results by seeing others feedback.  </li>
            <li>If the product continues to impress, I will refer my friends to give you more business.    </li>
            <li>and they work ok but didn&#x27;t help wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I just love this</li>
            <li>but my skin does feel so much better using it.</li>
            <li>I have seen more results.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>Might be better for a drier skin type.</li>
            <li>After just one use, I can tell that I will LOve this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product bel essense....</li>
            <li>Wish Bel Essence made more products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Shauna</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with what it does do -- moisturize without toxins.</li>
            <li>It was recommended from another product review, and I was looking for a better moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>enjoying this cream as it is not oily and goes into the skin.</li>
            <li>having tried the product for a few weeks at my sister&#x27;s house and loving it, I decided to try a jar of my own, at the excellent price offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found most of the so-called &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; formulas were lacking.</li>
            <li>I am sure the feedback will be just as wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wish there were more products for me to try.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a great product.</li>
            <li>and I think my skin just feels much better since I started to use this cream.  </li>
            <li>Not 100% sure if it&#x27;s helping my wrinkles</li>
            <li>but I feel my skin has more moisture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather stick to better moisterizers.</li>
            <li>Skin does feel better after using it for a week.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is all-natural.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>and I have to say, the results have been phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>Ok day one my skin looked and felt nourished.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff--</li>
            <li>truthfully, I am ordering more and you will not regret buying this cream also.  </li>
            <li>After a bit more experience with it, I will post a review on these products.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin is tighter in texture and more moist.</li>
            <li>I was in Florida when started the regimen and was glad for that.</li>
            <li>It sure worked.  </li>
            <li>I got many compliments from friends and defifnitely recommended this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this skin cream.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just now thinking of ordering more.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>It works even better for me than the Olay products--plus the bonus is that the jar contains so much more than Olay.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So they could smell better, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for a fragrance; I was looking for a treatment.</li>
            <li>And found it : )</li>
            <li>The smell was ok, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so moist and smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this</li>
            <li>There are better moisturizers out there</li>
            <li>It was not too appealing and my husband called it &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>It got better with time</li>
            <li>I came across this product after reading another review and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I came across Bel Essence and now use it day and night after apply the Neutrogena product, and I swear that my skin looks better.  </li>
            <li>I feel as though this product has that richness without sitting on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this-</li>
            <li>She is a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I am a man and don&#x27;t want scent, but do want healthy skin.</li>
            <li>In my experience, most anti-aging products feel like they are burning the wrinkles off your face -- this one doesn&#x27;t feel that way.  </li>
            <li>I have tried plenty of different night/ anti-aging cremes and this is the very best!  </li>
            <li>It quickly absorbed into my skin and feels soooooooooooooo good.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE this formula.</li>
            <li>Already I am cognizant of an improvement in the texture, coloration, and clarity of my skin and am confident with continued use</li>
            <li>and my face feels so much better.  </li>
            <li>Love the Bel Essence Intensive Anti-Aging Treatment creme.  </li>
            <li>Like the healthy smell.  </li>
            <li>i just ordered one, great fast shipping!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love the feeling of this product on my skin.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Not my favorite and I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
            <li>I love the way that my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use to get more results.</li>
            <li>and then I started to cautiously use the Roc products again making sure I moisturized after with either bel essence oil or Bel Essence cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best facial product combination I&#x27;ve ever used in the 10 or so years that I&#x27;ve been giving my mom facials.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream and use it day and night after the oil treatment or another serum.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>of them seem to work for a while and then does not work any more after a while.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love how it feels.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily or shiny.  </li>
            <li>This cream is non-greasy which I love because I wear contact lenses.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews I thought I had found the magic potion.  </li>
            <li>I am constantly searching for the perfect products for my skin, which seems to be changing not just with the seasons, but over the years.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to friends and family who also love it.</li>
            <li>I have had one month to try it and from day one my skin is in love with this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>:) I plan to buy another jar once mines runs out.   </li>
            <li>I love the texture...</li>
            <li>in fact I think it made my wrinkles more prominent.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT....</li>
            <li>This product resulted in perfect eyes the next morning!</li>
            <li>I will update review with any improvements I see on face but for now I do love what it does for the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Just oil at the top of the jar and clumps of cream.  </li>
            <li>I have very much enjoyed this cream.</li>
            <li>My skin looks lovely and healthy when I wear it and it adds a lovely glow to my skin.</li>
            <li>Many of the lotions and creams break me out.</li>
            <li>So mostly I buy from nearest drug store, use it for 2 times if it breaks my skin</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Love it on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients, and my skin drinks it in every night.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I like this better than some of the much more pricey products that I have tried by skinceuticals.</li>
            <li>This item, to me, is just okay.  </li>
            <li>I bought it after reading a really convincing review.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that this item is any better than any others on the market.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I also love the Bel Essence Oil.  </li>
            <li>I use both - the oil is really healing for my skin and soaks in, but the lotion seems to stay longer, and is great for under makeup.</li>
            <li>This cream is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Love coconut oil</li>
            <li>Product looks good and texture seems right, time will tell if the product lives up to some of it&#x27;s hype.  </li>
            <li>Good quantity, pleasant vanilla scent, velvety feel, quick absorbing.</li>
            <li>This is a very rich cream.</li>
            <li>It is very rich and moisturizing without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>After reading tons of amazing reviews, I was really excited to try this.</li>
            <li>It is a relief to have found an all natural product that makes my skin feel so good!</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer, feel good factor because it has many natural ingredients, reduces fine fines&lt;br</li>
            <li>Congratulations, bel essence, you have a new happy customer. :)</li>
            <li>: I also put a tiny bit on my split-ends at night -- it doesn&#x27;t say it is for hair, but with all those awesome natural oils I figured it would be great for hair.)</li>
            <li>and I generally tend to go by, if so many people write shining reviews, the product must be really good?!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a face cream like this for so long and am very happy that I have found Bel Essence Cream.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the counter-Neutrogena Oil of Oaly, ederm, but most of them moisturize and do not reduce wrinkles, fine lines as they may promise.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to use moisturizers because my skin breaks out way too easily</li>
            <li>This is an excellent cream for dry to combo skin.  </li>
            <li>so while I still need something water based for hydration, this never breaks me out and perfectly moisturizers my dry areas.</li>
            <li>I played a lot of golf and it surely protected my skin from the strong elements of the sun and as well as the beach on days</li>
            <li>IT SEEMS TO ABSORB READILY INTO THE SKIN AND HAS A PLEASANT SCENT.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my skin is, and always has been, nice for my age (57).  </li>
            <li>I need more moisture now since I&#x27;m 50, but I still break out easy, so this stuff is a god-send.  </li>
            <li>It gives a great protective barrier, keeping skin feeling soft and moist most of the day.  </li>
            <li>I love this products as it makes my skin very supple and bright.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, this has been a joy to use twice a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and though it&#x27;s full of oils from various good sources, doesn&#x27;t clog pores or cause pimples.  </li>
            <li>Feels good, but smells really strong, if you accidentally touch your eyes with your fingers after using it, get ready for pain!</li>
            <li>may be my new favorite!!</li>
            <li>It reduced the appearance of the fine lines on my forehead the most from what I saw.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other ones just as good &amp; your wallet isn&#x27;t raped!!!</li>
            <li>I am 79 years old, have luckily inherited good genes, and have always taken good care of my skin.</li>
            <li>Having very fair skin, blond hair blue eyes, lots of sun exposure, I wanted something that had proven results from users.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the last 2 months and the cream is very good.</li>
            <li>Besides that, it makes my skin soft and has a very light, pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, and has smoothed away my smile lines, as well as the dreaded &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this product and it seemed like it would be great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural, which is great because I don&#x27;t want to use any cream with retinol in it.</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This product was pricey, but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I love how light this cream is and how my skin drinks it in.</li>
            <li>Since using this product my 40-something skin is noticeably more supple and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product :)</li>
            <li>I love the texture – not too greasy but not too light either.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>rarely leave feedback on products I buy from Amazon, but in the search for a really excellent facial cream that seems to diminish lines and even wrinkles, it seemed important to share my opinion of this product with everyone!</li>
            <li>It gives my skin the moisture it needs and makes my skin feel soft and look great.  </li>
            <li>After using this morning and night for 2 weeks I have already noticed some signs of improvement and my skin is feeling vastly more comfortable than it had been before.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an all-natural skin care product that would leave my skin feeling smooth and looking healthy.  </li>
            <li>so I expected better results - phttttttt!!!!!</li>
            <li>It was creamier and applied more smoothly.</li>
            <li>This cream is very rich and leaves my skin feeling smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li>It also has a very light, clean scent.</li>
            <li>It does not feel greasy like other products I have tried, very happy</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time and I absolutely LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I received this really quickly and so far so good!  </li>
            <li>I am happy to add this onto my regimen as I am sure it will further enhance the look of my skin.</li>
            <li>she easily looks like she&#x27;s 25.  </li>
            <li>Applies easily.</li>
            <li>I received my Bel Essence cream very quickly.</li>
            <li>Then it smoothed on my face so easily and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild vanilla scent to it.</li>
            <li>but it does absorb easily.  </li>
            <li>This cream is soft, smooth, and is working great on my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, it took me awhile to notice a difference, but my skin is now softened and overall more plump and glowing than before.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product and am starting to see great results.  </li>
            <li>would strongly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I guess it is pretty amazing since it is sold out.  </li>
            <li>Within a week, I was actually getting comments at work telling me how beautiful my skin is.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on, it does feel greasy, but soon it absorbs into your skin, making it feel nice and hydrated in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It has made no changes in my skin or even the finest of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have used this for less than a week, but already very happy with it.</li>
            <li>and I do believe it will help with the fine lines we are all destined to get.</li>
            <li>and I see an improvement in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines around my mouth are not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li>However, they were doing nothing for the fine vertical wrinkles on my neck.</li>
            <li>The fine lines are still there, but are decreasing after about 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>No change in wrinkles (fine lines)  </li>
            <li>I use it with my derma roller and my fine lines</li>
            <li>I have used it for 3 weeks and have noticed that my fine lines don&#x27;t look as pronounced.</li>
            <li>The texture is on the thicker side, which is fine for a night cream.</li>
            <li>but it is a fine.</li>
            <li>I am seeing healthier looking skin and diminishing of the fine lines and wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li>I will notice fine line disappearance.</li>
            <li>and I started to notice some fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>...smells fine...</li>
            <li>Wrinkles around my eyes are disappearing quickly!</li>
            <li>Even though it is super moisturizing, I am able to use it in the morning under my makeup.</li>
            <li>Seller provided quick delivery too!</li>
            <li>and my skin feels very soft and looks good -</li>
            <li>Perfect alone or under make-up, and sometimes I add a little foundation to it for a smoother appearance.  </li>
            <li>I must say that I was surprised that this creme is actually superior in moisturizing ability and seems to smooth fine lines on both my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could show pictures of the before and after, because it&#x27;s really a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I wish I could show pictures of the before and after, because it&#x27;s really a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in terms of wrinkles being gone.</li>
            <li>My skin felt greasy and I did not see a huge difference in my skin appearance.</li>
            <li>Has made a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>This product has made a huge difference in the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>Perfect for keeping hands young - People are aways commenting on how young my hands look at 45.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for a great experience.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth, toned, brightened.</li>
            <li>I like the light texture and it works well with the serum I use beforehand.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and makes my skin feel moist all over..</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li>What she didn&#x27;t know was that even if I lost, it was still a win for me because if I didn&#x27;t have to buy another facial product again</li>
            <li>What she didn&#x27;t know was that even if I lost, it was still a win for me because if I didn&#x27;t have to buy another facial product again</li>
            <li>Loved this product it leaves my skin so soft and smooth, great if you want to add back moisture.</li>
            <li>it leaves your face feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li>but this is just fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Others have been given a free jar for their reviews...</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I will update my review if response is different or if I get great results.</li>
            <li>I am on my second jar of Bel essence and I have noticed a great difference in my skin</li>
            <li>It is a bit heavy, but at night its perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 65+ and blessed with that great olive completion and Italian skin that belies age.</li>
            <li>the seller offered free product if I reviewed</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>I definitely feel this is a great product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to have an unscented option, since the vanilla scent can be a bit much.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>In addition to moisturizing, this mixture gives my skin a smooth glow.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, seems to be somewhat oily, but then soaks into my skin to lock in moisture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m enjoying this cream and think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice &amp; gentle</li>
            <li>The oil is great for giving instant relief from the redness.  </li>
            <li>Product goes on smoothly and blends without a trace.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t tell how smooth my face is in the morning when I wake up.</li>
            <li>I have used this primarily as a night cream, but I have used it on occasion as a day cream as well.  </li>
            <li>I like the consistency and light scent which disappears.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bizarre.</li>
            <li>would also like to add that I waited to write this review after using this product for 3 months, and therefore did not receive a free jar of cream that would make my review a biased one.</li>
            <li>My lips are smooth and free of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Then seller tried to charge me for shipping and it was listed as free shipping.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for an good moisturizer that will not cause my overly sensitive skin to breakout.</li>
            <li>Its all natural oils so its good for your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent price and fast shipping supplements actually got it shipped to me a day before it was supposed to arrive.</li>
            <li>So far so good ...</li>
            <li>Seems to turn back the clock a bit, always a good thing:)</li>
            <li>So far so good, but</li>
            <li>Too soon to see results, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>So many positive reviews are posted, I thought hey, give this one a try!  </li>
            <li>Soaks in beautifully (seems my skin was very ready for this!) &amp; leaves my skin instantly smoother &amp; &amp; softer looking</li>
            <li>This one actually works and I&#x27;m in love with it!!  </li>
            <li>I have only used this product about a week, but love it!!  </li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly and seems to be a rich cream, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.  </li>
            <li>Ok, this cream has a nice smell and leaves your skin feeling super soft.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. :)</li>
            <li>The seller this comes from, Fast Shipping Supplements, is also very easy to do business with.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many, and this one has left my skin so silky smooth, firmer, and more youthful than ever!</li>
            <li>I just skim 2 fingers over the top of the cream and very gently rub it into my face, dividing into four sections.</li>
            <li>It soothes wonderfully right after the treatment and hydrates beautifully in the following days.</li>
            <li>I really think it has been the best cream I have tried in a very long time.</li>
            <li>I had such great results with using it on my face at night that I quickly started using it on my neck and hands at night and in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy this again but will use what&#x27;s left as it does have a pleasant smell and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this only a week and got a compliment today that my skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li>This facial cream is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>but I will continue buying it because it&#x27;s such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure as I was using the first jar if this product works but now that I&#x27;ve finished it I realize that it did benefit my skin.</li>
            <li>It needs to be used sparingly, it is a really rich cream</li>
            <li>It stayed pretty greasy on top of my skin too.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about buying it and hoping it would work.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s quite a rich, decadent cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited t see how my skin will be this winter</li>
            <li>I tried this and at first thought it was ok, but just did not see a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>Excited to continue using this product</li>
            <li>At first, I thought this would make my skin more oily.  </li>
            <li>When I read the reviews for this product I was really excited.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and lightweight without being greasy.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful too-not to heavily scented though!</li>
            <li>sure your face is clean when you apply it and take a minute or so to gently rub it in and you will notice a difference within a week!</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say if it helped in the wrinkle department, but it feels great and has a pleasant scent, which makes it easier to use as directed.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a very good product and is reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s never been excited enough about the results, after researching I felt that this would be the best cream for her as it has natural ingredients</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great for really dry skin.</li>
            <li>I like this because it goes on smooth, smells nice and makes my skin soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky-sweet or too gourmand, nor is it too sterile and clean.</li>
            <li>This stuff is light yet super absorbant.</li>
            <li>It smells great and really made my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly  and smoothly.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s pretty nice!  </li>
            <li>If you look at the ingredients you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s all natural which is also nice (paraben free).  </li>
            <li>I also started using tea tree soap to clean my face and apple&lt;</li>
            <li>Night I clean my face, use Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair serum,</li>
            <li>Great results that turned my dry skin around in a matter of days.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on clean with no greasy after affect.</li>
            <li>Work&#x27;s great for dry skin...</li>
            <li>I have allergy problems with many products, but this is great for EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li>After looking around for a good anti-aging cream, I decided to purchased this product mainly because it contains many natural products: Avocado, Grapeseed, Sesame, Almond, Argan, Shea, Coconut, Meadowfoam Seed and Kukui oils.</li>
            <li>Funny thing, the first time I used it, it had an amazing softening effect on face.</li>
            <li>it is not at all oily, though has lots of oils in it but makes the skin super smooth and hydrated/</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think so many positive reviews could be trusted</li>
            <li>So far, after using this for about 3 weeks, I must say that I love it!  </li>
            <li>but so far I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and is very creamy, but soaks right into the skin.  </li>
            <li>The cream not only feels great on my skin but also after 4 weeks of using it I already noticed a positive difference!</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this product.</li>
            <li>Despite some rave reviews, this product is not anything special.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients in it and that its so pure.</li>
            <li>My skin gets very dry and this works great.  </li>
            <li>, that will be one very good indicator of it not being a high percentage of Phenoxyethanol, and I will come back and change my review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased that my fine lines have softened and my skin looks healthy enough not to wear powder or foundation.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing for extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>However, I was surprised at how nice it made my face feel.</li>
            <li>and yes my skin felt so nice and soft...</li>
            <li>I have tried so many moisturisers and none of them have really worked.</li>
            <li>It smells like vanilla extract to me, like so sweet</li>
            <li>and I have a full jar of stuff</li>
            <li>I know isn&#x27;t full of harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I could not gush more about how much my skin has improved in texture, elasticity, evenness of complexion, smoothness, softness, youthfulness...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been SO kind to my skin, making it soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I really recommend to give it a try you will love it.</li>
            <li>This product does a good job at hydrating the skin, especially in colder climates.</li>
            <li>Thanks much for such an AWESOME product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have full on wrinkles yet.  </li>
            <li>However, it also depends on how much you use the product to go over that 1% safe point.</li>
            <li>So I did what everyone else did: trying to find a nice, natural anti-aging cream that works on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to more results with longer usage, but really like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure...</li>
            <li>The product is good overall.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product and I will purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much</li>
            <li>It smells good enough to eat, and by that</li>
            <li>This face cream is a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s all natural, which I really liked.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Many thanks to the reviewer from Roc who mentioned thus product.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful I would love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used almost a full bottle and not a breakout at all</li>
            <li>It smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; smell, but a naturally sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I have not broken out even though this product contains so many oils.</li>
            <li>Love it so much I&#x27;ve purchased it for others to experience.</li>
            <li>I read all reviews of this product, I loved the thought of this being natural, the smell is a funny.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it has such a clean scent and beautiful silky</li>
            <li>My skin is feeling a lot smoother and right at the corners of my eyes, really smooth reducing the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I can easily recommend this to all my married guy friends.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The ingredients are all natural (no weird chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce), it keeps my face pretty hydrated, did not make my sensitive rosacea skin break out, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I will have to use this more and more to determine its full efficacy, but the product definitely helps my skin.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping for a rich, moisturizing, all-natural creme that would calm my skin.</li>
            <li>It also has a light and pleasant fragrance, unlike other moisturizers I have used  including the ones that claimed to be unscented.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The most important thing for me that it&#x27;s 100% Natural.</li>
            <li>Super emollient cream that improved the texture and hydration level of my skin....</li>
            <li>Once this amount is out I will update some more and come back to buy more.</li>
            <li>If I am incorrect after giving this an adequate amount of time, then I will, by all means update this post.</li>
            <li>but I plan to continue using this cream as I feel it has helped me tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I just received this order and quickly used the product.</li>
            <li>I have used many many different face creams.</li>
            <li>It dissipates quickly after application.</li>
            <li>I have always been reluctant to purchase creams with oil in them as I have oily skin, but even though this cream contains some oils, it absorbs quickly and does not leave my face feeling greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>I have always had a problem with my skin and breakouts if I did not use mild cleansers and Aveeno day creams.</li>
            <li>I have used bel essence intensive anti-aging treatment twice daily for six consecutive days and could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>It does absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this and love the fact that it&#x27;s made up of all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best, and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of the most expensive ones.</li>
            <li>It quickly soaks into my skin, not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream feels very light and absorbs quickly to leave my skin feeling very soft, but not greasy as I&#x27;d feared.  </li>
            <li>Bel Essence is the very first product to accomplish this miracle........</li>
            <li>The seller set me up with a promotional free bottle after my first bottle too.  </li>
            <li>So I am not into buying cream online for the very first time.</li>
            <li>It is now soft, smooth, and I am seeing a significant improvement in the fine lines around my eyes and across my forehead.</li>
            <li>, some were good, some OK, and others seemed like a total waste of money, but I am thrilled with this one.  </li>
            <li>I am really enjoying using this product, specially since it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a new intensive anti aging product after a longtime favorite of mine was discontinued.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream as it is so smooth and has a sweet fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It was absorbed into my skin so quickly and never felt greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>and it is absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought there was just some on the top, but it&#x27;s throughout the whole jar of lotion.</li>
            <li>Good for dry patches too.</li>
            <li>bel essence cream leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I was most interested in the organic ingredients especially since there are so many items on the market that have a laundry list of stuff in them that customers have no idea</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are natural &amp; make my skin feel refreshed!  </li>
            <li>and I swear my neck is super soft and looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for producing a natural and affordable alternative to surgery, you have gained a loyal customer!!</li>
            <li>So soft and makes the texture very smooth and even.  </li>
            <li>I have had no breakouts with this which is very important when using it on the sensitive eye area.  </li>
            <li>my skin is moisturized, feels very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It feels very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>and none have really improved any fine lines.</li>
            <li>Have seem  a difference in my fine lines and has made my neck much smoother.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t been using the product long (about a month), the first application went on smoothly and was glad it didn&#x27;t have a strong odor.</li>
            <li>In a month my skin has noticeably changed, my pores look smaller, skin tone is more even and the fine lines are not noticeable, and my skin feels smoother.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I noticed other reviewers complaining, while some say it is either odorless or has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I really like the smooth texture of the moisturizing lotion on my face.  </li>
            <li>Being made of all natural ingredients is a huge plus!  </li>
            <li>This seemed to calm my skin</li>
            <li>and I really needed to find a product that genuinely moisturizes the skin, as well as one that I can use during the day as well as before bed.</li>
            <li>This product amazingly makes my face clearer, smoother, and younger looking .  </li>
            <li>This treatment is goes on smooth and you dont need to put so much on your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been giving my mom (in her 70&#x27;s) facials for years, mostly for fun but also because I know she isn&#x27;t comfortable enough to go into a salon.  </li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.</li>
            <li>and I am very frugal (you could say cheap...)</li>
            <li>so I love the fact that this product is all natural.</li>
            <li>This product smells nice, and is nice and thick</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I feel and see a big difference in the level of moisture and softness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>This cream has a lot of natural oils, which helps to keep my skin moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy and I like the fresh scent of it.</li>
            <li>Its a worth a try.</li>
            <li>I like that it is natural and has many beneficial vitamins.</li>
            <li>I really liked that all the ingredients were natural and the price was reasonable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell of shea butter, but it does have a wonderful light and smooth texture and only the smallest of dabs is sufficient for my entire face.</li>
            <li>It is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>It is very \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, which makes it a good moisturizer, but I only use it at night for that reason.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product and the fact that it is all natural is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li>but this product offers so much more.</li>
            <li>One month is creamy, smooth, thick, smells great.</li>
            <li>I have not had time to determine whether it will work on wrinkles or age spots, but I can tell you it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have bought several jars of this and always loved it; however, in my most recent jar the cream is separated and has pools of oil in it.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews for a product</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth trying.  </li>
            <li>this cream and am happy to have found a natural product that not only seems</li>
            <li>Just received this jar on fast transaction.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was good but the cream was oozing out of the jar, so the cream was messy on top cover and</li>
            <li>I love that this is all natural</li>
            <li>I wanted to find something that could help combat so far I&#x27;m pleased with this product and plan to continue its use</li>
            <li>My wrinkles in my smile lines from my cheeks have reduced by about 70 percent</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural, and I can use it guilt and concern-free.  </li>
            <li>I am 75 yrs old and love the product.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels clear and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Wrinkles and acne aren&#x27;t fun at all.  </li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the earthy nutty smell, but it disappears in a matter of seconds.  </li>
            <li>It did take a few more days to get here than what I would have liked, but, I have had that wrinkle since 2006, so</li>
            <li>Worth trying another product made by this company.</li>
            <li>Every morning skin on my face looks fresh and glowing so I even stopped using serum.</li>
            <li>The creme lay on the skin and didn&#x27;t feel like it was absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and many products cause my skin to breakout</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>From now on, my toner is Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel, my serum is OZ Naturals Vitamin C 20% etc, my eye serum is Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair and my moisturizer is Bel Essence intensive anti-aging treatment, which works well as a day or night cream -- a total of $89.68, not $993, for instance.</li>
            <li>so I love the fact that this product is all natural.</li>
            <li>Again, I love the natural vitamins and antioxidants found in this cream.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural which is even better.</li>
            <li>I love that the cream is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel when I put it on, silky soft feeling.  </li>
            <li>good texture and overall a better product than regular creams.  </li>
            <li>This is not greasy (as others have mentioned).&lt;br /&gt;It is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Having a great experience with this cream so far and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li>I am pleased so far with the results</li>
            <li>It is natural and safe to use.</li>
            <li>I am trying to replace all my face products for more natural ones.</li>
            <li>It  smells terrific and is great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price that I paid ($33 or so).</li>
            <li>It was worth my money</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a shot to try for your skin issues.</li>
            <li>I think I can honestly appraise this cream since enough time has gone by.</li>
            <li>On top of all that, I got no response from the company when I tried to claim my free extra product.  </li>
            <li>I think it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>laugh lines have diminished as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love all the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I love the natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to make my own with the next listed ingredients, like avocado and coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>but my skin (face and neck) responds very positively to the composition.  </li>
            <li>when I wake up in the morning my skin looks very clean and clear.</li>
            <li>It does not stick but it kept my face very moisturized and fresh!  </li>
            <li>I ordered based on the good reviews of other people.  </li>
            <li>(I just can&#x27;t use retinol right now).</li>
            <li>My skin soaked this product right up.</li>
            <li>but then it soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>which is why I didn&#x27;t want to review the cream right away.  </li>
            <li>and it soaks right in to my skin.  </li>
            <li>It must be the right combo for me since now</li>
            <li>I am now using it on the right side</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Concealer does not lay right  on wrinkles....</li>
            <li>and then right before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>parabens became a hot topic, cosmetic industries scrambled to find an alternative, Phenoxyethanol became the quick-fix, but there are far better and safer preservatives out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 with oily skin and was concerned about breakouts after reading some of the other reviews, but so far so good!  </li>
            <li>It does have a very thick consistency and the smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering such a great, natural product!</li>
            <li>Goes on easily using an electric facial cleaner&#x27;s smooth attachment.  </li>
            <li>Based on others&#x27; reviews I wanted to love this cream, but after only a few days of use I experienced break outs galore.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin easily and has a light vanilla fragrance which comes from real, not imitation vanilla.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not young, so I can&#x27;t expect miracles but having smoother skin is always nice - at any age.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing, so I was putting on a different moisturizer on top of this one, which defeats the purpose!</li>
            <li>I use this before bed in a more heavy application and a very light application in the morning before applying my primer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 38 years old with fine smile lines and forehead lines.  </li>
            <li>The hydration properties are exactly what my skin needs right now.  </li>
            <li>I also have developed fine, vertical wrinkles right in front of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream has the texture of heavy whipping cream, and is an absolute joy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin really drinks this in, feels lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast too</li>
            <li>It is very soothing, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I hope to love it more everyday.  </li>
            <li>My next attempt at taking a few years off of my skin was L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect for mature skin Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair and also their Golden Balm Redensifying for face, neck &amp; chest.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad though and it fades pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Although it feels great and doesn&#x27;t absorb right away -- which for me is a positive -- I&#x27;m not sure if I can tell if there&#x27;s a difference.  </li>
            <li>I’m almost done with my first jar and I have been able to notice some big improvement with my crows feet and some of my laugh lines.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>The cream is easy to smooth on your face and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Skin Type:  Fair to Medium, normal to dry in places</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer indicated, you don&#x27;t need very much to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>and I definitely can confirm it is very important to include them in your anti aging regime.</li>
            <li>I use it every night before bed and I am noticing fine lines and wrinkles seem to be diminishing, It makes my face feel so soft too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to see if it will make a difference in the appearance of my fine wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>It is certainly a product worth giving a try.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s meant to be like a vanilla scent, but the vanilla mixes with something else that makes it smell a little like egg nog (not in a good way).</li>
            <li>Love the very mild smell it has (slightly vanilla-ish).  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the cream absorbs quicker on more mature skins (since moisture is lost as you get older)</li>
            <li>Mild forehead wrinkles, furrows (between eyebrows) are moderate, very mild crows feet.  </li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t see any huge improvements, my skin is soft.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for about a week but can already tell that my skin is more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something exactly like this.  </li>
            <li>Bel essence is a natural skin care, and nowadays it&#x27;s really important.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice per day, and really like the way my skin responds!</li>
            <li>I have purchased literally hundreds of products from Amazon over the years, and this is the first one that I have felt compelled to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the softest, gentlest, most inoffensive vanilla I&#x27;ve ever smelled, and I would wear it as a daily fragrance in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>But so does many creams carried in your local markets.</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep using this, and would love if there was a lighter day-time version.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to reapply once I put it on the first time.</li>
            <li>Somewhat of funny backstory...</li>
            <li>If this cream doesn&#x27;t work, I will always defer to you first in these matters and never make another purchase of this sort again.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really matter, where this is concerned, I just keep a smile on my face when using it</li>
            <li>In retrospect, I&#x27;m pretty sure she just pulled some inception like moves on me to make me wear the facial cream every day.........</li>
            <li>If this cream doesn&#x27;t work, I will always defer to you first in these matters and never make another purchase of this sort again.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really matter, where this is concerned, I just keep a smile on my face when using it</li>
            <li>In retrospect, I&#x27;m pretty sure she just pulled some inception like moves on me to make me wear the facial cream every day.........</li>
            <li>my first thought  was another cream that&#x27;s going</li>
            <li>Just received my first jar of bel essence.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li>My complexion is normally clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>There are many synthetics out there that are similar to this which are in a lot of cases anywhere from 2-5</li>
            <li>times as much as this cream in cost!</li>
            <li>in fact I seem to be seeing more daily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay for years, but recently felt like I needed a more intense cream for some wrinkles around my eyes and smile lines.  </li>
            <li>At this point, which I realize is a very short term trial, I wish I would have researched more before my purchase......</li>
            <li>I can tell a difference when I use this product regularly which makes it stand out from many creams I have used.</li>
            <li>I thought it was working pretty well --</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for one week but can already tell that my skin is more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I found that this is one of my favorite facial creams.</li>
            <li>soft and smooth, fine lines are less noticeable and my skin appears to have improved, it is brighter, more even toned, and it does not leave my skin oily at all.  </li>
            <li>I was interested to see if it would make a difference in the look of my aging hands.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying Bel Essence.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a moisturizer that would keep my skin soft and smooth without clogging my pores or being overly greasy.</li>
            <li>and my skin has never been so clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I also use my argon oil first.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is the first time I found something that I used until gone.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after using it for several more weeks.</li>
            <li>I just tried it for the first time today</li>
            <li>With this product, no breakouts and it has been more then a month using it daily one time before bed one time in the morning after a shower.  </li>
            <li>It is my current favorite</li>
            <li>It will keep your complexion hydrated and keep the texture soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and you can be sure that after I have used &amp;#34;Bel Essence&amp;#34; for about a month I will report back!</li>
            <li>It is light on the face, not heavy, greasy, or oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have both the serum as well as this cream and after one week of using them combined I really see a difference!</li>
            <li>I have only tried it for five nights, but I love the feel of my skin in the morning.  </li>
            <li>the top of it seems to be smaller...</li>
            <li>Hope the long term results are as great as the short term ones!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>This is the first review that I have ever written--though I am an avid “review-reader”.  </li>
            <li>It does look pretty on my shelf though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I finally found the cream that my skin loves!</li>
            <li>Nor did it feel soft and light like whipped cream.</li>
            <li>So, this cream has proved itself more beneficial to me than some well known products that cost several times the dollars.</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember my first jar having any odor issues, but this one does.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be put off when you first apply.  </li>
            <li>I definitely want a product that is more than a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; feeling--one that has some body to it.</li>
            <li>and it made my face so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have used almost the entire jar and I have seen no results, not even more hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you for providing this product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Although it feels a bit oily when you first put it on, fear not.  </li>
            <li>Cream was sitting on top to make the jar appear full but the bottom was empty.</li>
            <li>i will start checking out the one star reviews first..</li>
            <li>like I did the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>but the results really speak for themselves!</li>
            <li>Buyer be aware.</li>
            <li>It tingles at first (in my case still does)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen minor improvements in my smile lines, but my face is plump and has a healthy</li>
            <li>I cannot justify buying this again for this price when Aveeno Daily Moisturizer works just as well, or maybe even better.  </li>
            <li>Ordered my first jar of Bel Essence just a couple weeks ago.......</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, it works better than Clarin&#x27;s Double Serum.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I just need to use it more often daily for a longer period of time in order to tell.</li>
            <li>I feel it moisturizes pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It turns out the company offers a free jar for a review.</li>
            <li>My jar, once opened, has loads of oil on the top of it and clumps of white cream in the oil.</li>
            <li>I cannot truly vouch for its anti-wrinkle abilities as that is difficult to measure, but it is a wonderful moisturizer with ingredients I feel I can trust.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second jar and love it..</li>
            <li>Really help&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Lightly scented and all natural</li>
            <li>Rich formula of all natural goodies for your skin!  </li>
            <li>Smells pretty.  </li>
            <li>My skin definitely feels softer and looks plumper and more hydrated than before.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot, a little goes a very long way but the moisturizing benefits are impressive.  </li>
            <li>It is just starting to get warm where I live</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to putting it on because it goes on so smoothly and blends in quickly.  </li>
            <li>My wrinkles are less noticeable and my skin appears to be more smooth.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is great as a moisturizer especially for those of us with dry skin.</li>
            <li>, then you just look shiny (you will quickly find out how much is too much for you).</li>
            <li>It absorbed nicely and I can tell a slight difference in the way my neck looks.</li>
            <li>This is good moisturizer for semi dry skin and uses no perfumes at all you can tell it is made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I love the fact that this product is all natural.  </li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference right away.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, smooth and clear for the first time in ages and I love all the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>and/or is looking for something natural and rich to treat their face with at night.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this for a short time and am very happy with it -- looking forward to the long term results.</li>
            <li>I usually used it only at night on my face and sparingly or just on my wrinkles/dry spots in the morning since I have combination/oily skin, but most people could probably use it twice a day to good effect.</li>
            <li>The cream actually feels amazing going on and seems to have been carefully formulated for easy application and absorption.</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the dryness has just improved so much that I am able to use Sacylic Acid treatments along with this product without embarassing flaking.  </li>
            <li>It was a brief moment of sweet, sweet victory, even if she did that woman thing where she wouldn&#x27;t concede.</li>
            <li>It was a brief moment of sweet, sweet victory, even if she did that woman thing where she wouldn&#x27;t concede.</li>
            <li>I have used for 3 weeks and really  like it.&lt;br /&gt;It was a very fast deliver.</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle cream that really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>That said, there were a ton of positive reviews through amazon and some customers said they use it after rolling their skin with a dermaroller (I bought one too)</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing a jar of Bell Essence because of all the positive reviews there was.</li>
            <li>The seller also bribes customers to post a positive review in exchange of a jar of cream.</li>
            <li>Even my husband noticed the positive change.  </li>
            <li>Today I am going to begin using it in the AM also to see if I see any positive results.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the positive reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>, I decided that I was going to go balls to the wall and really apply it consistently, two times a day (sometimes three).</li>
            <li>, I decided that I was going to go balls to the wall and really apply it consistently, two times a day (sometimes three).</li>
            <li>I first used this  cream,seemed very oily to the face,</li>
            <li>First of all, i recieved this product much quicker than it said I would.</li>
            <li>The product arrived earlier than expected :) I am enjoying this night cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much odorless in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>However, since distilled water is it&#x27;s first ingredient, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have much body.  </li>
            <li>After a couple days dark marks are fading and one of the two lines on my neck is diminishing and the tone is clearing nicely.</li>
            <li>Its all natural and full of all the nutrients your skins need.  </li>
            <li>Wow it was true.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact it is all natural oils as well...using twice a day right now, but will probably only need once a day in a week or so.  </li>
            <li>This cream is very light and sinks in quickly, my skin feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>Upon opening the jar, I love the delicate, natural fragrance, but the really delight lies in the rich texture of the cream, which absorbs easily and leaves my skin feeling nourished.</li>
            <li>I think this product really works for what it claims: it is for real a natural anti-wrinkle cream !!</li>
            <li>but I guess if you have dry skin it will be okay</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product and recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Immediately after application my skin feels super soft.</li>
            <li>I use the oil at night and very quickly noticed my pores got much smaller</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, leaving the skin soft and non greasy during the day.</li>
            <li>I have Hashimoto disease and dry skin is just one of the many issues that comes with.</li>
            <li>my dermatologist doesn&#x27;t know - but quite a lot of creams and lotions react strongly with my hands which is why I&#x27;ll occasionally try face products on them, just to see if I have a reaction.  </li>
            <li>They immediately took action and fixed the issue, so refreshing in today&#x27;s world where no one seems to have decent customer support.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item a few months ago and at first I really liked it.</li>
            <li>my pores don&#x27;t look as large as they used to.</li>
            <li>really like this product since it&#x27;s been such a good moisturizer for sensitive skin, really making my skin look healthy, firm, and glowing without feeling greasy</li>
            <li>In addition, the appearance of large pores and smile/</li>
            <li>BUT I can really see positive results on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful combination of all natural ingredients that I have used individually on my skin in past years.</li>
            <li>After using for a few weeks as a night cream, I can truthfully say that this cream delivers!</li>
            <li>It works wonders in just a few hours, and moisturizes better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before, and isn&#x27;t oily at ALL!</li>
            <li>I typed in Eye wrinkle cream, sorted by average review, and this Bel Essence cream was right at the top.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer, especially if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Some of my fine line wrinkles on my forehead look smaller!  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month and can tell a big difference in the feel of my skin, how fine lines seemed to disappear, and my face looks fresher.</li>
            <li>and I have definitely noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Morning, clean my face, then use Bare Minerals Multi-Wrinkle Repair or Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer with sunscreen, then Bel Essence, and the rest of my makeup.</li>
            <li>read about it from a review of another product and the person recommended it  - for something natural, paraben free and silicone free for my dry, dehydrated and problematic skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is still too soon for me to tell if it will have this effect, but it does make my skin feel smooth and moisturized (and it&#x27;s currently winter, when I have more dry skin issues).  </li>
            <li>The ratings on this product were very high</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and this product seems to absorb better than any I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I was a little reluctant to try it because I had never used any kind of moisturizer on my face before.</li>
            <li>This is a sweet little cream- highly moisturizing but elegant.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t do much as far as reducing the fine lines near and under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Other great thing...as others have said, this cream goes a long way and has lasted me for months!</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews on here will same the same exact thing I just said, but THIS STUFF WORKS!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and many face cream products contain perfume or other irritants which make my skin burn or break out.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment because of so many other positive reviews and &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; claim.</li>
            <li>but I have a very oily T zone</li>
            <li>The absorption rate is fast too.</li>
            <li>because if I someone really wants an \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; cream they should use something with retinol in it</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t use to much am looking forward to the firming and tightening of  my skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s any chance I can sway the prematurely aged to give this cream a shot, I feel obligated. :)</li>
            <li>stars, absolutely heavenly smell, a treat that I look forward to applying at the end of my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>I decided that I should start using real face cream instead of all-purpose lotions.  </li>
            <li>I use it nightly and on weekends only as I need something lighter for my foundation to smooth over.  </li>
            <li>It was very greasy and did not absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li>This product took a couple of months before I really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face looks so much brighter now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t really care to know much about them.</li>
            <li>I really like how my skin feels after applying this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like the vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li>I really attribute this to using skin care products and hair care products that are &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and do not harm the environment nor animals.</li>
            <li>It feels great going on, and after only a few days my skin looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>It brightens up the skin and your complexion is much radiant.</li>
            <li>The bel essence arrived ahead of schedule and very well packed.</li>
            <li>All and all, a very satisfactory purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels just like shea butter going on, very soothing.  </li>
            <li>but i really didn&#x27;t buy into all the claims</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>it looks fresh, naturally soft, hydrated,</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in my skin</li>
            <li>Really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>It is very creamy--</li>
            <li>what really amazed me about this company was that my jar arrived with a cracked lid.</li>
            <li>I really notice the difference.  </li>
            <li>goes into your skin very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this face/neck lotion.</li>
            <li>I feel this cream is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how much I will use it during the day under makeup as it gets humid here.</li>
            <li>it really does do what it says.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a fantastic buy and will definitely re-order.</li>
            <li>This cream is very greasy, does not soak in.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing either.</li>
            <li>Very greasy.  </li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t really put it through a thorough test</li>
            <li>Not greasy- Soaked in very well.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>I buy a lot of skin care products and really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very greasy.</li>
            <li>I noticed ABSOLUTELY ZERO improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li>The cream has been absorbed.. it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores so clearly it has done its job.</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant putting oil on my skin</li>
            <li>it sooooo much</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t use the cream as much because of it.</li>
            <li>This cream contains too much oil for my skin.</li>
            <li>but I get very dry/tight in winter months.  </li>
            <li>I put it on at night and the next morning my face is still smooth.</li>
            <li>I would rather use my organic coconut oil (at night) at a much cheaper cost.  </li>
            <li>Real beauty cream that works.</li>
            <li>I had read some reviews that said this was very oily</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s greasy, and it just sat on top of my skin, never absorbing into my skin at all.</li>
            <li>This product is really greasy, no wonder it causes break out.</li>
            <li>I have to say my skin really didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like the smoothness of my skin after applying this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much softer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to wear it even just at night, but I was always waking up to a very oily face.</li>
            <li>I have to be very cautious about what I use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks and</li>
            <li>For example, Oil of Olay products don&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>does not cause acne, even though my skin is very acne prone.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve spent way too many summers in the sun</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with a product with so many 5 &amp; 4 star reviews, but it turns out the company offers a free jar for a review, and I&#x27;m thinking that colored many of the reviews quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want a free jar, in fact I&#x27;m throwing the one I have out and going back to neutrogena -</li>
            <li>but it works really well with my skin.</li>
            <li>and I really like</li>
            <li>My face seems to be much smoother and suppler than before.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, even suffering through it at night, I don&#x27;t feel it worked very well.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and enlarged pores in the T-zone area.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it once a day and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this.</li>
            <li>It was greasy and didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything for me.</li>
            <li>I did like how it was so gentle..</li>
            <li>I finished my shower and when I saw my face in the mirror my face had turned a nice cherry red, with spots of red all over my forehead.</li>
            <li>After only one week, my skin looks and feels remarkably healthy, soft, and nourished.</li>
            <li>i received this product a few days ago &amp; im already loving it.</li>
            <li>So far my face seems smoother and more younger looking.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a couple of weeks but love it so far.  </li>
            <li>It is similar in composition to the oil babies excrete to keep their skin healthy, so it is a natural alternative to baby oil.</li>
            <li>because it feels just like a nice, heavy, healing cream going on your face.</li>
            <li>It is very, super  greasy even for dry skin;it does not absorb at all, causes break outs, does not diminish fine lines, only leaves skin GREASY!!!.</li>
            <li>I was pretty sure it was just extremely dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how it would work for someone with oily skin, but it is the best product I have found for dry skin showing early signs of aging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is area on the right side of my face, on my cheek,  almost near my lips, a wrinkle that I feel is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>Out of my own curiosity I applied it to only the top of my left hand for a month in place of my other hand creams.</li>
            <li>I ran out pretty quickly and I only use two dabs every morning and night.</li>
            <li>I am always interested in trying a new anti aging product but this one I did not like.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it is natural, and the price was right to try it.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way (which is fantastic) and it smells really nice</li>
            <li>but now I love Bel Essence so much, I am using only my eye cream and Bel Essence, and no other serums or creams.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream, especially for people who are looking for more natural products.</li>
            <li>Not sure how I missed this for so many years!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I will give it a try and use it minimally as that is the safest route! :)</li>
            <li>Definitely think this is a NIGHT cream....too rich for under make-up.  </li>
            <li>and I just wanted my original face cream back.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any other product I have used,</li>
            <li>Price on Amazon is a little better than my first purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li>and I agree with other reviews - it feels super-soft and lovely.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have enough wrinkles (here in my middle 40&#x27;s) to know if they are magically disappearing, but my expectations of moisturizers are not stratospheric ;)</li>
            <li>I was originally using Ageless and then starting using Bel Essence.</li>
            <li>Just an absolutely lovely gentle soft smell that makes me think of falling into a feather pillow at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li>It is rare that you see natural, quality ingredients so high up on the list for a beauty product.</li>
            <li>I started by cautiously putting very little amount on my cheeks -- the driest area of my face and skipped the entire T-zone, which worked out great.</li>
            <li>Cream was applied onto a clean face, so it was the only thing to cause irritation.</li>
            <li>I had used African Shea butter in the past and was happy with it...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good and if I get it near the eye area it burns and causes excessive tearing</li>
            <li>I very much like the Bel Essence All Natural Anti Wrinkle Treatment and will&lt;br /&gt;order again.</li>
            <li>There is a slight vanilla fragrance that is very, very light.</li>
            <li>I am anxious to see how it does around my eyes, but even if the wrinkles don&#x27;t go away, it feels absolutely amazing on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only 23, but am an engineering student at the most prestigious public university in my country; I sleep maybe 30 hours a week and don&#x27;t have time to take care of myself, so my skin is an absolute nightmare.</li>
            <li>it was about two to three weeks of regularly using this product at night that I noticed a true difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>liked the texture of it; it was creamy enough and it did have a thin layer of oil on top of the cream when it arrived.</li>
            <li>The smell is not appalling.</li>
            <li>I have tried different moisturizers that just seem full of filler or cake on or smell.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product in the past and I liked it.</li>
            <li>This product has high quality ingredients that makes my naturally dry skin feel very hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use it from the top of my face all the way down my neck.</li>
            <li>It is a light gentle moisturizer, but if you have a very dry skin try something stronger.</li>
            <li>Also, the product was sent from 1/2 hour from where I live, but took over a week to get to me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a new face cream!</li>
            <li>I’ve used many eye creams in the past with mixed results, this is by far is a much better product than the others i have tried.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and am in my early 40&#x27;s, so am really starting to need good products.  </li>
            <li>little goes a long way- great investment and way better than the Alchemist cream, or plain &amp;#34;fashionable&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The cream has been able to balance out my combination skin like nothing else I have tried before, and my skin seems to be breaking out less.  </li>
            <li>and my skin seems to be more hydrated and wrinkles are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>My face isn&#x27;t any less oily but it also doesn&#x27;t seem to make it more oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on smoothly over it without any dry look, that can make you look older.</li>
            <li>I have finished the entire jar and now I am ready to give my 2 cents worth about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products and will look no further.</li>
            <li>The lines on my forehead were my main concern and are noticeably smoother.  </li>
            <li>Has a good consistency, thick but not greasy and the aroma is so natural.</li>
            <li>I was concerned it would have a greasy feel as I have acne prone skin, but it really just melts into your skin and leaves it feeling very soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for 100% natural skin cream that would also make a positive difference for my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing, although I am only a 41-year-old guy with a few lines on his forehead, I had been using oil of olay products ever since I was in my teens.</li>
            <li>It arrived when promised, and I am very pleased with its creaminess and the very small amount you have to use.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny bit (very rich).</li>
            <li>It is a great product that made me use it daily even if I feel lazy!</li>
            <li>But only the very  first time.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this again though because the price high for the quality.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what else this product does for me, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is now a product I will always keep in my nighttime drawer, and highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>About time a company didn&#x27;t make consumers pay high dollar for a namethe cost-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the seller</li>
            <li>Highly allergic to it and returned it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li>So I honestly thought that it would probably be a creme similar to other cremes that I have already used.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and after trying different products my skin was left extremely dry and this cured it within days.</li>
            <li>I speedily ordered the Bel Essence Cream and the oil because I started to get extreme redness and drying from Roc facial cleanser and night cream after three or four days of use on my own face.  </li>
            <li>It does not cause my make-up to cake or flake off like some other creams do.&lt;br /&gt;Being natural and unscented, it does not have a flowery fragrance like many creams but does not leave any lingering odor.  </li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and always looking for that miracle jar without the benefit of surgery and may have just found it!!</li>
            <li>I started using this in the winter when I have to admit that I put on a little thicker coat too just to make me feel better</li>
            <li>I bought this product mainly because my smile lines were starting to bother me.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is a little thick, but works perfectly - and the ingredients are natural</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it is made with all natural</li>
            <li>It almost doesn&#x27;t smell, not heavy and it absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>I just received this product and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>so all that richness from natural oils can soak in; really seems to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; your skin.</li>
            <li>I like this product, I really like the fact that it is made with all natural oils.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 30s and don&#x27;t have much in the way of wrinkles</li>
            <li>I am 70yrs old and have never used sunscreen so one can imagine how wrinkled my face is; now, it is much &amp;#34;smoother&amp;#34; (no, the wrinkles are not gone...)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long before I should see results, but, it goes on smooth and so far has not irritated my skin</li>
            <li>I like this cream, but it is very rich and I broke out from it a little.  </li>
            <li>but I really like this so far.</li>
            <li>So far I am ready to rid myself of all of them and move forward with this one.</li>
            <li>When you apply it it feels rather thick but amazingly by the morning</li>
            <li>My face feels firmer; pores are tightened; marionette lines are softened; light wrinkles are harder to see.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a moisturizing cream that was all natural and didn&#x27;t cost as much as the cream</li>
            <li>yet I had no negative effects.</li>
            <li>confirmed when a 22 year old assistant at my recent doctor appointment couldn&#x27;t get over how young I looked.</li>
            <li>Just about every anti-wrinkle cream review I read on here always linked back to Bel Essence (&amp;#34;xx worked, but it really started working after I paired it with Bel Essence&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>Although this product is a bit more expensive than what I can get at the store, I am glad for the natural ingredients and the moisturizing</li>
            <li>so normally when I use any face products I break out.  </li>
            <li>Normally I just purchase whatever is on sale, but I&#x27;m sticking with this cream.  </li>
            <li>, my skin is considered combination of normal and oily.  </li>
            <li>I guess I could wait a few more days.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it helps with wrinkles, but love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>First of all, the jar I received did not remotely smell of vanilla (as another reviewer commented).</li>
            <li>I have been missing this as a moisturizer and need to get more.  </li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and hope my initial success is built upon.</li>
            <li>No negative side effects (rash, breakout, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid product and for the price, it&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li>My first impression was that it was very rich, richer than even my Intensive Moisturzing Dermalogica lotion (much more expensive) but it was not oily at al despite having 9 different plant oils.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin super soft the next day.  </li>
            <li>left my skin super soft....</li>
            <li>have dry skin and tried many facial creams.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>I ordered this product due to the positive reviews, EXCELLENT face cream, will use it in the evening a little heavy for day wear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She was right, I was starting to get wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Only positive comment is that itmis odorless!</li>
            <li>This one really helps with dryness and filling in the fine lines on a daily basis, I don&#x27;t know land doubt if it will long term but will continue using.</li>
            <li>the more negative  reviews are posted more towards the last page of the reviews which are currently pages 51-53.</li>
            <li>I am only 24 years old, but thought it would be better to start early so that my skin could thank me later.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and really do not have any wrinkles just fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Love that its all natural but its a little to greasy for me (hair and face).</li>
            <li>I have been using Bel Essence for a little over a month now, and, wow, I love it.</li>
            <li>I. I live in the Northwest</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this new formula.</li>
            <li>My face was super dry every morning.  </li>
            <li>I had been searching for a night face cream that had natural ingredients and decent reviews.</li>
            <li>I am getting older and have a problem to find a natural cream for wrinkles that would work on my problematic skin (oily T-zone).</li>
            <li>Slightly greasy with a strong lanolin scent, I regret buying this product.</li>
            <li>and I consider that a small amount is sufficient, in my case it  feels a little greasy at the beginning, but absorbs fast, and when it is absorbed leaves my face with a nice complexion and glow.</li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations were too high based on reviews or maybe its really for older skin that needs extra moisture.</li>
            <li>Very nice product, little too heavy and reach for face.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>my skin feels hydrated and very soft.</li>
            <li>it makes my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This helps to moisture the skin and it makes my face very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a ginger and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After a Fraxel procedure, my skin became extremely sensitive and highly prone to acne.</li>
            <li>I do use it on my neck nightly and it makes the skin very soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this cream, makes my face feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>it made my skin very soft and supple, I even used it on my hands and decolletage.</li>
            <li>and it is a little more thick than most creams</li>
            <li>The texture takes a little getting used to; it is a bit thick out of the jar, but once you start to smooth it on, it spreads evenly and quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I mix in a little Oil of Olay for sensitive skin moisturizer, either SPF 15 or 30, to turn this into my own personal &amp;#34;BB&amp;#34; cream.</li>
            <li>The general motif which I&#x27;m trying to convey is Spartan, less is more.</li>
            <li>I pretty much woke up to a fairly dry skin every morning.</li>
            <li>My main concern is to target a few fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>My main target are a few fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I feel miraculously younger or noticeably less wrinkled after a few weeks of use, but I know that I look forward to gently rubbing this concoction onto my face and neck at night, and I feel it does a great job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Put it on my face without sniffing first and had to wash it back off immediately.</li>
            <li>The spa grade,  professional products I work with don&#x27;t even compare to this cream!</li>
            <li>can see my  wrinkles around my eyes faded so much that i can barely tell they&#x27;re there.</li>
            <li>and I know that she know&#x27;s who wears the pants where facial products are concerned ;).</li>
            <li>and I know that she know&#x27;s who wears the pants where facial products are concerned ;).</li>
            <li>I wake up surprised every morning!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Of course, the biggest attraction - was natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>Fine lines are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>An added plus is the fact the cream is made up of various oils  and the first ingredients listed are not words you cannot even pronounce</li>
            <li>First each side, then my forehead and chin and neck next.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase Bel Essence and I am truly surprised!</li>
            <li>and my skin is really soft!  </li>
            <li>all natural, no chemicals!</li>
            <li>But due to the several different oils in this product I can not wear it under my make up, it seems to work ok at first</li>
            <li>glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is small in size, but the quantity surely outweighs the quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps I should use it twice a day during the hot summer sun, but I&#x27;m going back to my faithful bioelement products.</li>
            <li>It melts into my skin and makes it so soft!</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers said, you do NOT need a lot of this product, I dab my one finger in it and make tiny dots on my face, focusing on the dryest areas, then rub the dots in.</li>
            <li>This Bel Essence is the first product I have tried in over two years that actually made a difference in these wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I use Bel Essence in conjunction with Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum and Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Daily Face Peel, Original Strength.</li>
            <li>The seller offered a full refund (not just the shipping fee) to make up for it, so the book is closed on that one.</li>
            <li>I tried put a little more on but still waking up to a pretty dry face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see the benefits of other reviewers, but living in  a dry climate, this is a very good moisturizer without the heavy feel of others I have tried and my sensitive skin has not been a problem.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li>I have tried many products in the past including the Neutrogena (new and old) \\&quot;wrinkle repair\\&quot; product line</li>
            <li>I have adult acne that I must manage carefully by not using products with certain chemicals in them.</li>
            <li>Some other brands market themselves as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but I learned later (after I wasted my $$$ on many creams that gave me the allergic reaction) that although the main ingredients were natural, the cheap preservatives used were not!!!!!So</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I tend to feel apprehensive about trying out new products on my face.  </li>
            <li>With my sensitive, acne-prone skin I am always hesitant to try a new product.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product for its all natural ingredients as well as its superb reviews, none of which have disappointed.  </li>
            <li>My face is softer and looks more firm in general.  </li>
            <li>I usually buy cheaper moisturizers, but wanted to try something that would work better and was all natural.</li>
            <li>There is a faint vanilla smell that is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I hate to come back and do this because the company I purchased through was wonderful and very professional, but as I continued to use it and (I did use to much at first because it wont spread)</li>
            <li>Most importantly: the product moisturizes like no other I have tired (and I have tried a lot!)</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was natural hoping that it wouldn&#x27;t break out my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I only need to use a small amount and it does the job, so I expect the jar to last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry in Arizona, but because it is very sensitive, I have to be careful with many anti-aging creams.</li>
            <li>I have had very dry skin and fine wrinkles since I was a teen.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after washing and patting my face dry.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night in combination with Retin-A micro, Vit C serum and AHA(not together) and it not only nourishes and soothes my super red &amp; sensitive skin-</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be sensitive to new products so love the fact that this product is all natural and hasn&#x27;t had a negative reaction to it.</li>
            <li>I will certainly re-order and definitely recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Opinion:  It goes on smoothly, but feels a little greasy.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I have a very wrinkled chin due to the damage by prescription retinol cream that I applied on my washed face and during last 7 years I could not get rid of the dryness and the feeling of dryness no matter how much cream I applied</li>
            <li>I am in my upper 30&#x27;s, way upper 30&#x27;s, I bought this cream to help with the fine lines I&#x27;m starting to see form.</li>
            <li>I had been using a moisturizer costing almost four times as much as bel essence with little success.  </li>
            <li>I love that this cream is 100% natural and organic, doesn&#x27;t have any toxic ingredients, and has hardly any smell at all.  </li>
            <li>It was hard trying to find a morning/night routine for my skin that was simple, yet effective.</li>
            <li>and I can see a clear difference in the crow&#x27;s feet at my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I only apply a minimal amount at bedtime and when I wake I find my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention it makes my face feel really soft once it all absorbs.</li>
            <li>I am 40, and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and my skin is soft and looks refreshed.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s natural and not perfumery.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I used it 1 night and woke up to soft supple skin literally over night.</li>
            <li>I am over 70 years old</li>
            <li>I had been looking for face and body products that were made with natural ingredients, and did not include parabens.</li>
            <li>The fact that is it 100% natural is a bonus as you can see and feel the effects of the nourishment.  </li>
            <li>After reading about the natural ingredients in Bel Essence, I decided to try it as a replacement for my nightly retinol.</li>
            <li>likely from being out in the sun too much during the summer, and using tanning salons.</li>
            <li>It really makes me look younger than I am.</li>
            <li>you would not expect in a 25 year old man&#x27;s apartment.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer actually has the whole package.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using natural skin care products for over a decade to combat the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and firmer.  </li>
            <li>I am 48 years old and feel my skin feels firmer and looks brighter.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the cream could be improved though, but I realize it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>this is already making my skin so soft &amp; hydrated without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Makes one wonder how so much &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; has happened following those review pages.</li>
            <li>my skin does not feel moisturized, I am not being negative, however, I am quite confident this &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; won&#x27;t do a dang thing.</li>
            <li>I like the natural, non-greasy finish</li>
            <li>It makes the skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>Adding this cream makes my face so soft</li>
            <li>I am 49 years old and have combination/oily skin, which is beginning to show signs of premature aging.  </li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive to oils or already oily, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for you.</li>
            <li>this cream might be all natural - but it does not have any &amp;#34;special powers&amp;#34; - wrinkles still look like wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Have just begun using this product, so don&#x27;t know the complete effects at this time.</li>
            <li>I will note that it doesn&#x27;t take but just a tiny bit on your fingertips, so do not use too much.</li>
            <li>I am 78 years old</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin normal/oily and I was looking for something natural to prevent wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>it feels soft, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li>I can tell it is natural</li>
            <li>I see a difference in my 40 year old skin too.  </li>
            <li>My bumps are gone completely.</li>
            <li>My&lt;br /&gt;face is so soft in the morning after using this at night.</li>
            <li>, she was unaware of anyone else having such a problem, and she was personally sending me a free replacement jar that afternoon.</li>
            <li>--I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like how it feels soft, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I found that after I exfoliate nightly (gently), then apply the RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream and wait an hour, then apply the Bel-Essence liberally</li>
            <li>but my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the fact that this moisturizer was made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I really look younger.  </li>
            <li>and I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>am in my early 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft after just one application.</li>
            <li>I find my face is lacking its natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I use this with their natural oil treatment at night.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and so soft.  </li>
            <li>This is truly an all natural product.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I had modest expectations of an \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; product, but could no longer reconcile spending the money to eat organically while slathering my body with chemicals.</li>
            <li>This resolved completely within two applications.</li>
            <li>It does have a vanilla fragrance, my 6 year old says it makes my face smell like ice cream.</li>
            <li>The skin feels extremely soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Since using bel essence on these spots, I have noticed considerable improvement.  </li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>so I cut back how much I was using.  </li>
            <li>old &amp; don&#x27;t have any wrinkles except under my eyes, now they&#x27;re practically gone.  </li>
            <li>I have acne-prone skin, am 30 years old, and once in a while suffer from adult and hormone-related acne.  </li>
            <li>I am 66 yrs old</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and looks radiant.  </li>
            <li>but I have noticed a marked improvement in the wrinkles about my eyes, and my neck skin.  </li>
            <li>In addition, it might be all natural</li>
            <li>I frequently go without foundation or powder and still get compliments on my &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; and complexion.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE $$ on this homemade voodoo</li>
            <li>Instead, my skin feels soft and it glows.</li>
            <li>Now here is the catch, in December I paid $33 and now it is marked to almost $50</li>
            <li>I can put it around my eyes, but so far I have not seen any results with my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I will keep using it around my eyes and watch for any improvements, but so far the cream did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I apply at night and my skin feels soft and supple in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it day and night so far.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel really soft and looks rested.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this cream is all natural.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my washed face before bedtime, and woke up to moisturized, soft and nourished skin.</li>
            <li>What I like about this product so far is the richness and aroma.</li>
            <li>I bought based on some reviews I read and that is all natural.  </li>
            <li>I truly appreciate the care taken in selecting natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly sensitive to fragrance</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, hydrated and no breakouts.</li>
            <li>Makes it feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Been using the cream for a month, my face feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I Purchased this cream because of its natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and hydrated....</li>
            <li>So far this is a keeper.</li>
            <li>have sensitive, oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Not all old and worn out.  </li>
            <li>But if you start early.</li>
            <li>and I do have sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 57 years old and my skin soaks Bel Essence up like it needs it.</li>
            <li>I like that it has natural ingredients that work for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like that this product was made from natural ingredients and intends to have an &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but so far no breakout whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I am 46 years old and it seems to help give my skin a natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of the natural ingredients and because it&#x27;s purpose is to nurture my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so well nourished with all of the natural ingredients</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and yet gives you a youthful natural glow that is baby soft to touch.</li>
            <li>I find the cream to be very moisturizing for my facial skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I can really see the difference on my skin next day, glowing!!!!</li>
            <li>Ready for my next purchase.</li>
            <li>I DO like how soft my skin feels after using this product, so</li>
            <li>I guess the natural does not always work.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone looking to use a product with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>We will stick with this product as long as it continues to be consistent and works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several days and really like it.</li>
            <li>it will make ur face soft but dont expect wrinkles to vanish...</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t really feel like it was doing anything &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; related.</li>
            <li>Complete</li>
            <li>After using this cream for only a few times, my face already feels softer, more supple, and my lines aren&#x27;t quite as visible as before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in a few week&#x27;s time, it has definitely made my face look and feel MUCH better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>If I put it on, the next day I start to have  few breakouts and more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this cream works very well for some people, but unfortunately, it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Its quiet thick and creamy and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>My face feels more moisturized than before, but I am not sure if it&#x27;s reducing the appearance of or preventing my face from forming new wrinkles, such as on my forehead, both sides adjacent to my nose as I smile/laugh, and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>The facial cream is rich, smooth and non irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li>I even use it during the summer and it sinks right in, not leaving residue or oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I have not seen any other improvements to my over 50 sundamaged skin, but the missing millia is amazing.</li>
            <li>For the reviews I read talking about the smell, it is very similar to other all-natural products I use--almost a light vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>but it was also half full.</li>
            <li>Definitely will be buying more of this little jewel!</li>
            <li>and I love that a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>So excited to see what my skin will look like in a few months after using it.  </li>
            <li>It feels rich but not too heavy.</li>
            <li>This is the first cosmetic that not only moisturize my skin but also smooths all over without breakouts and extensive shine.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ve used many different products on her over the years - usually what I happen to be using at the time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been almost 2 months that I have been using Bel Essence, and it&#x27;s been my main source of facial moisturizer for this winter.</li>
            <li>we learn more and more about the environment and what mother nature has given us, all of these natural oils combined and used regularly could never be a bad thing.</li>
            <li>(Highly doubting this will be necessary.)</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the approaching New England winter, frequent air travel, and chronic work stress have begun to take a toll on my face.</li>
            <li>, that is a major improvement!  </li>
            <li>I have been using it twice a day giving an extra little dab of product on the fine wrinkle lines around my eyes and mouth</li>
            <li>just so excited reading all the positive reviews and the stating of it being \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; - dumb me..</li>
            <li>JUST OK, NOT GOOD RESULTS.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used for a long time, but when it came to getting rid of lines, the sculpting treatment didn&#x27;t really cut it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it moisturizes so well and leaves you with a dewy complexion as long as you don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li>Bel Essence All-NATURAL cream nice product without all the chemicals you only need to use a small amount to go a long way.</li>
            <li>It will probably take another week before my face goes back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I have deep sunken undereye circles and sebacious filaments all over my nose and cheeks, but the sort of undereye wrinkles, laugh lines, facial sagging, and visible undereye veins (!!)</li>
            <li>I see after one month my lines above my lips are especially improved and the lines below are much better as I think my C-PAP chin guard is forcing my sagging skin up when sleeping as I wake up with folds that take a few hrs to dissipate.  </li>
            <li>Now  it&#x27;s back to normal.</li>
            <li>Bel Essence costs half as much!!</li>
            <li>I apply it alone and more than half the time  with the other creams I have.</li>
            <li>This has happened several times with other really great products- just not great for me.</li>
            <li>The new formula caused my skin to turn red and also caused a burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>But, I like to play around with new products, especially ones recommended by people I know.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle - no breakouts or other issues.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this product very long, but I can say that it has made my skin so much smoother and hydrated.</li>
            <li>This really helped my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>What I do like about it is that it is very hydrating as I tend to have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I wrote to the company and was ready to send photos of the lid, my biggest fear was that it would dry out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands of cream that ranges from $100+ - $15, and they all clog pores and cause serious breakouts on my poor face.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the current face lotion I was using was a bit too much for daily use.</li>
            <li>The product arrived a few days later, and it is completely free of any &amp;#34;grit.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really could tell that the wrinkles on that side of my face were getting smaller and smaller.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and stays soft and supple until the next morning.</li>
            <li>it is a bit thick but fairly easy to spread.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that turns red and blotchy after showering</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 20 years old, but after using any type of face wash, my skin immediately tightens and flakes (actively looking for the right face wash), but I&#x27;ve been using this every day/night for about 5 or 6 months now</li>
            <li>The cream is a little rich for my face for use daily.  </li>
            <li>Hubby pitched in and helped me explore a brand that shall be nameless except for its price: more than a hundred dollars (sometimes lots more) for a small jar/tube of just about anything.  </li>
            <li>However, I found myself using every last bit of it, which is something I usually do NOT do (I have graveyards of half-used skin and hair products...)  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve come across that is 100% natural without any hidden undesirable additives.</li>
            <li>Even though it was a smaller amount for the money, you will get so much more than you thought, because you use a very small amount.  </li>
            <li>I apply it before bed and although it&#x27;s very greasy, when I wake up my skin feels very dry.</li>
            <li>i found one of the ingredients sodium hydroxymethyglyconate to be an irritant to skin if used in high dosage and not a natural ingredient from my research.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and spreads smoothly.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, with a light vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be a little &#x27;grainy&#x27; but  this cream makes it feel smooth, even after i wash my face, and it provides a great base for powder.</li>
            <li>I just want others to know that I have no reason to give a positive review other than I like the product)</li>
            <li>It is somewhat greasy, so I generally avoid using it during the day.</li>
            <li>recently found a bentonite clay mask for the pore issue and had clear pores for about 4 weeks before trying this product.  </li>
            <li>It just left it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Last night I got this cream and applied at night and once this morning, the feeling of dryness was completely gone</li>
            <li>Definitely not a perfume-y smell as I am extremely sensitive to perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow, I&#x27;m using this wrinkle cream for a month and it barely works.</li>
            <li>and I especially like the idea that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>My 14 year old daughter constantly compliments my skin!  </li>
            <li>But considering the natural ingredients and the fact that it seems to be working well with my skin, it is definitely something I plan to keep using.</li>
            <li>I bought this product not really knowing much about it.</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old, and I recently had skin cancer surgery two places on my face.</li>
            <li>Even ones that claimed to only have natural oils have caused severe breakouts.</li>
            <li>This stuff barely comes out of the jar and when I applied it, my throat immediately started to swell up.</li>
            <li>Natural Anti-Wrinkle, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients is also a big +.  </li>
            <li>I have finally found an all natural product that feels so moisturizing and works works so well.</li>
            <li>I either received an old jar or the product is a different formula?</li>
            <li>My face feels SO soft throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li>It FEELS a bit oily going on but it absorbs immediately and my face feels so soft and supple without any greasy feeling or residue being left on it.  </li>
            <li>I use it before bedtime after I cleanse my face and also in the morning after cleansing and 30 minutes before I put my Bare Minerals makeup on.</li>
            <li>I have recently started using this product and so far like the way it feels.</li>
            <li>Feel like I have my youthful 20 yr old glow back.</li>
            <li>Finally decided to put my faith in market economics, viewed the top-rated skin creams on amazon with an eye for natural ingredients, and wound up here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 31 year old male.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive that after this window of time without breakouts, I am convinced this is my staple hoot daily face cream.</li>
            <li>All of the redness is gone &amp; my skin is soft &amp; actually has a dewey look.</li>
            <li>The main problem with this product is that it isn&#x27;t as good as others that are less expensive.</li>
            <li>I then slowly and cautiously applied it to my face by just lightly dipping my fingertip into the jar and the dab on my cheeks, under eye, eyelids, forehead.</li>
            <li>It lays on the surface for just a few minutes after I apply but then is fully absorbed.  </li>
            <li>I live in a desert and have very dry mature skin.</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way--and it moisturizes my dry skin better than the Loreal products I was using.</li>
            <li>but I can tell that my skin is brighter and more even tone and the little bit of wrinkles around the edge of my eyes are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I must admit I can actually tell a difference; my left hand looks a slight bit &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; than my right hand!</li>
            <li>Over the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has gained clarity and light, that the typical dryness I struggle with has disappeared, and that my skin simply feels like it is more supple.</li>
            <li>I am also pleasantly surprised to find out that some of the oils such as Almond oil contains high amounts of Vitamins E and D, magnesium, and calcium help with dark circles and baby soft skin!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those with dry or over-processed skin.</li>
            <li>I now live in the middle east and this product has stopped my skin being dried out like it was for the first year of my time here.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin, however, do see this working very well for you if your skin is dry, especially if your skin is damaged, also will work for you if you have oily skin,</li>
            <li>It leaves my face with the right amount of moisture with out the greasy heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li>My skin is also on the dry side in the winter and normal in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had the normal winter dry skin for weeks.  </li>
            <li>I had read from other reviews that Roc dries your skin and that bel essence cream and oil help with the redness and burning that takes place especially when you first use it.  </li>
            <li>I used some expensive brands before and it turned out that I developed an allergy to some preservatives used by many major brands in the U.S.  </li>
            <li>I still have a few more weeks left of the first jar so a little goes a long long way.</li>
            <li>It will probably be too rich for me once late spring and summer arrives.</li>
            <li>In other words I have very UN-sensitive skin--just a bit of info about my skin type.</li>
            <li>I noticed nothing other than really greasy,oily skin.</li>
            <li>Product is &#x27;thick and rich&#x27; if that is the type of cream you are looking for...I was.</li>
            <li>As opposed to other creams, I have had no trouble adjusting to this new product: no break outs, no oily residue, no redness or itching.</li>
            <li>If you have very dry skin, I HIGHLY recommend this line.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it based on positive customer reviews and it certainly is priced well considering some of the anti-aging treatments out there that are really too expensive for</li>
            <li>I live in the Southwest so the air is extremely dry.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant at first with this product because it felt so thick and rich to the touch</li>
            <li>For years, I&#x27;ve tried various skin care moisturizers, creams, serums, including natural oils individually, but none seem to work for me.  </li>
            <li>I can already tell after nearly one entire jar that my skin has vastly improved.</li>
            <li>My face is very soft and the small wrinkles I had and the fine lines are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>My face is dry and very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>At first it seems a little greasy</li>
            <li>At first it feels a little greasy, but after about 5 minutes, it starts to feel silky.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed a little oily</li>
            <li>The only suggestion I have to improve this moisturizer is to add  a broad spectrum sunscreen.</li>
            <li>use a couple of Neutrogena&#x27;s retinol-type products, but they&#x27;re pretty rough on dry skin like mine.  </li>
            <li>With Bel Essence my skin feels soft and fewer oily issues than other creams for mature skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using this for long time because its not harsh and no side effect at all.</li>
            <li>It seems shiny at first but the shinyness is gone after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>or I have a rash the first few days of trying it....</li>
            <li>I have to admit that, at first, I thought this was too heavy for my oil-prone but aging (and acne-prone)</li>
            <li>Turned off to this product line for good due to poor quality control!</li>
            <li>I live in a VERY dry climate, I moved to Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>I live in a desert and we get very dry skin, but not with this cream.  </li>
            <li>I am 34 years old and have normal to dry skin that is more dry than normal in the cold parched winters here in Chicago.</li>
            <li>I was searching for an all natural product, to help improve fine lines as the overall appearance of my skin was starting to look unhealthy.  </li>
            <li>I can usually tell if a product is going to irritate my finicky skin right away.</li>
            <li>I am a 53 years old and suffer from extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>As a retinol user, I frequently have dry patches of skin on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and have dry skin and wrinkles in my under eye area.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about how long it took after I initially started using the clay mask for my pores to clear</li>
            <li>The consistency of this cream is pretty thick, so the old adage &amp;#34;a</li>
            <li>it is thick but my skin absorbes it quickly.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and need the extra moisture that comes with a cream like this.</li>
            <li>(make sure i didn&#x27;t have any negative reaction..) and!!</li>
            <li>After a long search, I narrowed it down to two products and decided to give this one a try first.</li>
            <li>Paired with the grape, its subtle, and different, but clean.  </li>
            <li>However, too expensive for a moisturizer that is just as good as something else for half the price.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m 24, with pretty healthy skin, but after showering or being out in cold weather, my face gets very dry!</li>
            <li>Another month it&#x27;s less thick, more grainy, smells different.</li>
            <li>on my forehead when I smile, but after using the product they are hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge problem for me but be warned as they can be irritating for some.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> This cream is more like an emollient - wonderful as you treat your face and neck.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 months ago after reading the great reviews, and it was definitely a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay moisturizer, but nothing too impressive.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> I saw nice results in 2 days!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product!</li>
            <li> It is so nice to have these oils combined into one product to get all of the benefits!</li>
            <li> good product, smells great, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> but if you consider the benefits of good healthy ingredients and the impact on your skin, it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> It is creamy and pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> It has a vanilla smell to it which I find is pleasant.</li>
            <li> To my pleasant surprise, Bel essence outperformed the l&#x27;occitane night cream I had been using with a $100+ price tag.</li>
            <li> This cream was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> After using Bel Essence twice a day for a month I am happy to say my skin is 100% softer and the wrinkles have smoothed out a bit....enough to make me love this product!  </li>
            <li> I started with their oil and really loved how it felt on my skin.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Feels great and makes your skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> It is good moisture for winter.</li>
            <li> favorite thing about this product aside from the results (which I promise you will see,) is the absolutely incredible smell.</li>
            <li> I rate it as fair.  </li>
            <li> Good for moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> --I haven&#x27;t found a good replacement--</li>
            <li> It feels like you&#x27;re putting something good on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It feels like a good moisturizer and smells good.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of weeks now, it feels good and smells good.</li>
            <li> It is a good cream..</li>
            <li> But, it is still a good cream..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say one way or another whether it&#x27;s had any effect on my wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve tried so many wrinkle products with and without chemicals that I&#x27;m happy just to have found one that feels good, smells good and makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand good reviews.</li>
            <li> What I like particullary is that my face feels as good in the morning than at night.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell all that good</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it smells good.</li>
            <li> &quot; my fair skin).</li>
            <li> I found out about this product from another Amazon review that has recommended it as a good cream after using the hyaluronic acid serum from Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li> This is a good all-natural cream that has helped my skin regain its suppleness.</li>
            <li> Feel like it is just as good as some of the store bought brands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s JUST as good as the \\&quot;hundreds of dollars\\&quot; brands.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you just can&#x27;t tell how good a product is until you use it for awhile.  </li>
            <li> I works particularly good on the décolletage area.  </li>
            <li> I used this for about a month twice a day to give it a good chance, but my face still felt dry/tight after applying it, like it never fully soaked in.</li>
            <li> so I need a good product</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews here.</li>
            <li> If you have been looking for a good cream-</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and absorbs wonderfully.</li>
            <li> and I hoped this would be a good every day moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li> It feels good and never stings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall good product, which doesn&#x27;t cause any skin irritations.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after scouring the internet for hours trying to find a good face cream.  </li>
            <li> This product is definitely a good moisturizer, but I can&#x27;t say in regards to toning the skin and reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have received compliments as to how good my face looks after using.  </li>
            <li> The lotion itself feels great on the skin, but it smells kind of like olives.  </li>
            <li> I do expect to see improvements as that takes time and this product deserves a good try.</li>
            <li> It is good under my eyemakeup.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer...</li>
            <li> It reviews as good stuff.  </li>
            <li> For that amount of money, the product should smell good.</li>
            <li> and I have loved it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I am doing something good for my skin!</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want a more beautiful wife?</li>
            <li> They have excellent customer service and really seem to strive to make you happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> But after looking through the reviews I was confident it was actually a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very satisfied</li>
            <li> and I am so very glad I did.</li>

            <li> Very satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very light!</li>
            <li> This stuff is phenomenal - moisturizing, smells great, but doesn&#x27;t cause breakout.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great is that it doesn&#x27;t disappear the minute you put it on which made me feel as if it was most effective.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love it, and hope you guys try it and see how it orks for you!</li>

            <li> It makes my skin look bright and healthy.  </li>
            <li> It is an absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li> Smell is light and feel&#x27;s great on face.  </li>
            <li> or if they just all work well together, but I have been using all of them for 3 months and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> It has a great texture, goes on smooth, and leaves skin feeling moist but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Absorbs nicely despite the oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest to say I was leery in purchasing this product because of it&#x27;s size and cost.</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice smell</li>
            <li> I wish I could say that I look as good as (or better than)</li>
            <li> and she totally liked this product</li>
            <li> Nice smell and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a bit and honestly......</li>
            <li> It does feel nice on your skin.</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> The texture is creamy, kind of reminds me of white-chocalate (the smell) and what can I say,</li>
            <li> Plus it smells nice.</li>
            <li> it has a nice feel to it</li>
            <li> Nice and mosturizing.  </li>
            <li> and it has a nice warm scent to it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again for an excellent product.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it has a nice fragrance however if I get it too close to my eyes it causes them to burn and water for a moment.  </li>
            <li> in addition it is kind of greasy like butter.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> -- kind of &#x27;nutty&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> and I really think it works wonderful and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice as well.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that I am noticing a difference already.</li>
            <li> I am a very happy customer and will be happy to do future business.  </li>
            <li> nice and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Nice cream.</li>
            <li> I am kind of on the fence about getting it again.</li>
            <li> But it is wonderful to use after a weekly peel as it is very soothing.  </li>
            <li> The absolute best effect is of course that it has caused zero breakouts.</li>
            <li> Most of the creams I have used may feel good when applying</li>
            <li> I like this cream for the most part, it feels good when I put it on</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell</li>
            <li> and my spouse has commented that my skin has a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice cream, i did not notice any changes as of yet in my skin</li>
            <li> but it feels very luxurious and wonderful to the skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bel essence is formulated the way I would formulate a product of this kind.  </li>
            <li> I have heard so many good things about this product</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day or more often if I am home and just want my skin to feel good.</li>
            <li> nice, nourishing cream.</li>
            <li> (texture is kind of \\&quot;whipped\\&quot;), but not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> I used that for a while and liked the results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like putting smelly Vaseline on your face.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li> Nice and creamy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles (I have been using this for over 3 months now), but is a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> MY SKIN RESPONDS TO IT NICELY...</li>
            <li> But I really like it best for under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This cream has a really nice thickness to it-</li>
            <li> its nice i like it</li>
            <li> Nice.  </li>
            <li> Fast and great seller!</li>
            <li> so this is nice as an all-over face lotion when I&#x27;m out of eye cream.</li>
            <li> It has a very, nice, light vanilla scent too.</li>
            <li> All natural, smells delicious (Not too strong, like a light vanilla/candy scent), great consistency, didn&#x27;t cause breakouts, great to use at night</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of early to announce it as a best cream.</li>
            <li> but it is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Smells great, greasy feeling dissolved quickly</li>
            <li> It has a light vanilla scent, which I find pleasant.  </li>
            <li> This product has excellent ingredients, your face feels very soft.</li>
            <li> My make up went over it very easily.  </li>
            <li> Bel Essence is very easy to apply and I have had no skin irritations/other problems since using it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m absolutely impressed by how soft and supple my face feels!</li>
            <li> The best part is that it is made of all natural ingredients!  </li>
            <li> I love, love loveeee the smell!</li>
            <li> This is the best one out of four that I tried so far!</li>
            <li> Good product,  the cream is very smooth and easy to apply on face,  I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> and so far i&#x27;m loving it alot!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the natural ingredients and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I got you this awesome eye wrinkle cream completely out of the blue!&amp;#34; and what she didn&#x27;t say was...</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait on giving my review until I have used it for a while, and I will say this is by far the best moisturizer I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> The fabulous list of ingredients along with the smell can&#x27;t help but make me feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li> And it also came with a note that said something along the lines of &amp;#34;write a good review and get a free jar&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost5 weeks, I am 25 years old, but I am VERY happy about the result, I use it before bed.</li>
            <li> It is not as shiny as most *effective* moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> and my skin looks amazing, the wrinkles are almost gone and it looks more hydrated and fuller unerneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> This natural product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I am 53 years old and am so proud of my skin and no one believes that I could be in my 50&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 and this lotion is perfect for a 30 something year old&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> even Nivea is more effective than this (and a lot cheaper).  </li>
            <li> My skin FEELS great after using it and I had no problems using it right after the dermaroller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients and it smells great!  </li>
            <li> But definitely better than very strong anti aging chemical cream.</li>
            <li> Some of the best features of this product are: the smell (like vanilla cookies baking) and the texture (super smooth and soft and feels great going on).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just about finished my first jar of Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment, and am happy to write a review for this product.  </li>

            <li> and they love it.  </li>
            <li> Of course I know that any anti-aging effects will take a bit more time to manifest themselves</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love how it feels.</li>
            <li> I wish they came out with more stuff.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cheaper than botox :)</li>
            <li> I have tried many many drugstore brands that worked &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; but never gave me a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin like this did.</li>
            <li> but I do love this and hope that they never change the formula as some companies do, even if it&#x27;s working well.</li>

            <li> I love this treatment</li>

            <li> I have tried many moisturizers, anti-aging creams etc over the years.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great quality!&lt;br /&gt;Wayne&#x27;s Wife</li>
            <li> Love this cream.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure to put lotion or cream on my face every night and each morning because I don&#x27;t WANT wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Lovely cream...</li>
            <li> I love it because my skin does look better.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the texture of the cream.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my skin feels better than the &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; product that I was using.  </li>
            <li> and so many people rave about what it&#x27;s done for their skin.</li>
            <li> I love how the Bel Essence smells as well as how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> Feels OK, still haven&#x27;t decided wheather it works.</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s making even more wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of anti-aging creams and usually most of them do not work for me.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this cream and the oil.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a week twice a day my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> You will love this product:))</li>
            <li> I love the smell as well.  </li>
            <li> For that reason alone I will be buying more of this product, plus it seems to be helping my skin to be smoother and more even toned.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this product for sure,</li>
            <li> I can imagine over time it will have much better results by seeing others feedback.  </li>
            <li> If the product continues to impress, I will refer my friends to give you more business.    </li>
            <li> and they work ok but didn&#x27;t help wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I just love this</li>
            <li> but my skin does feel so much better using it.</li>
            <li> I have seen more results.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> Might be better for a drier skin type.</li>
            <li> After just one use, I can tell that I will LOve this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product bel essense....</li>
            <li> Wish Bel Essence made more products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Shauna</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with what it does do -- moisturize without toxins.</li>
            <li> It was recommended from another product review, and I was looking for a better moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> enjoying this cream as it is not oily and goes into the skin.</li>
            <li> having tried the product for a few weeks at my sister&#x27;s house and loving it, I decided to try a jar of my own, at the excellent price offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found most of the so-called &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; formulas were lacking.</li>
            <li> I am sure the feedback will be just as wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish there were more products for me to try.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a great product.</li>
            <li> and I think my skin just feels much better since I started to use this cream.  </li>
            <li> Not 100% sure if it&#x27;s helping my wrinkles</li>
            <li> but I feel my skin has more moisture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather stick to better moisterizers.</li>
            <li> Skin does feel better after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is all-natural.  </li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> and I have to say, the results have been phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> Ok day one my skin looked and felt nourished.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff--</li>
            <li> truthfully, I am ordering more and you will not regret buying this cream also.  </li>
            <li> After a bit more experience with it, I will post a review on these products.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin is tighter in texture and more moist.</li>
            <li> I was in Florida when started the regimen and was glad for that.</li>
            <li> It sure worked.  </li>
            <li> I got many compliments from friends and defifnitely recommended this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this skin cream.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just now thinking of ordering more.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> It works even better for me than the Olay products--plus the bonus is that the jar contains so much more than Olay.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> So they could smell better, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for a fragrance; I was looking for a treatment.</li>
            <li> And found it : )</li>
            <li> The smell was ok, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so moist and smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this</li>
            <li> There are better moisturizers out there</li>
            <li> It was not too appealing and my husband called it &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> It got better with time</li>
            <li> I came across this product after reading another review and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I came across Bel Essence and now use it day and night after apply the Neutrogena product, and I swear that my skin looks better.  </li>
            <li> I feel as though this product has that richness without sitting on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this-</li>
            <li> She is a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I am a man and don&#x27;t want scent, but do want healthy skin.</li>
            <li> In my experience, most anti-aging products feel like they are burning the wrinkles off your face -- this one doesn&#x27;t feel that way.  </li>
            <li> I have tried plenty of different night/ anti-aging cremes and this is the very best!  </li>
            <li> It quickly absorbed into my skin and feels soooooooooooooo good.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely LOVE this formula.</li>
            <li> Already I am cognizant of an improvement in the texture, coloration, and clarity of my skin and am confident with continued use</li>
            <li> and my face feels so much better.  </li>
            <li> Love the Bel Essence Intensive Anti-Aging Treatment creme.  </li>
            <li> Like the healthy smell.  </li>
            <li> i just ordered one, great fast shipping!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of this product on my skin.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Not my favorite and I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
            <li> I love the way that my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use to get more results.</li>
            <li> and then I started to cautiously use the Roc products again making sure I moisturized after with either bel essence oil or Bel Essence cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best facial product combination I&#x27;ve ever used in the 10 or so years that I&#x27;ve been giving my mom facials.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream and use it day and night after the oil treatment or another serum.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> of them seem to work for a while and then does not work any more after a while.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I love how it feels.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily or shiny.  </li>
            <li> This cream is non-greasy which I love because I wear contact lenses.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I thought I had found the magic potion.  </li>
            <li> I am constantly searching for the perfect products for my skin, which seems to be changing not just with the seasons, but over the years.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to friends and family who also love it.</li>
            <li> I have had one month to try it and from day one my skin is in love with this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> :) I plan to buy another jar once mines runs out.   </li>
            <li> I love the texture...</li>
            <li> in fact I think it made my wrinkles more prominent.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT....</li>
            <li> This product resulted in perfect eyes the next morning!</li>
            <li> I will update review with any improvements I see on face but for now I do love what it does for the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Just oil at the top of the jar and clumps of cream.  </li>
            <li> I have very much enjoyed this cream.</li>
            <li> My skin looks lovely and healthy when I wear it and it adds a lovely glow to my skin.</li>
            <li> Many of the lotions and creams break me out.</li>
            <li> So mostly I buy from nearest drug store, use it for 2 times if it breaks my skin</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Love it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients, and my skin drinks it in every night.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I like this better than some of the much more pricey products that I have tried by skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> This item, to me, is just okay.  </li>
            <li> I bought it after reading a really convincing review.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this item is any better than any others on the market.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I also love the Bel Essence Oil.  </li>
            <li> I use both - the oil is really healing for my skin and soaks in, but the lotion seems to stay longer, and is great for under makeup.</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Love coconut oil</li>
            <li> Product looks good and texture seems right, time will tell if the product lives up to some of it&#x27;s hype.  </li>
            <li> Good quantity, pleasant vanilla scent, velvety feel, quick absorbing.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich cream.</li>
            <li> It is very rich and moisturizing without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> After reading tons of amazing reviews, I was really excited to try this.</li>
            <li> It is a relief to have found an all natural product that makes my skin feel so good!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, feel good factor because it has many natural ingredients, reduces fine fines&lt;br</li>
            <li> Congratulations, bel essence, you have a new happy customer. :)</li>
            <li> : I also put a tiny bit on my split-ends at night -- it doesn&#x27;t say it is for hair, but with all those awesome natural oils I figured it would be great for hair.)</li>
            <li> and I generally tend to go by, if so many people write shining reviews, the product must be really good?!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a face cream like this for so long and am very happy that I have found Bel Essence Cream.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the counter-Neutrogena Oil of Oaly, ederm, but most of them moisturize and do not reduce wrinkles, fine lines as they may promise.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to use moisturizers because my skin breaks out way too easily</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cream for dry to combo skin.  </li>
            <li> so while I still need something water based for hydration, this never breaks me out and perfectly moisturizers my dry areas.</li>
            <li> I played a lot of golf and it surely protected my skin from the strong elements of the sun and as well as the beach on days</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS TO ABSORB READILY INTO THE SKIN AND HAS A PLEASANT SCENT.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my skin is, and always has been, nice for my age (57).  </li>
            <li> I need more moisture now since I&#x27;m 50, but I still break out easy, so this stuff is a god-send.  </li>
            <li> It gives a great protective barrier, keeping skin feeling soft and moist most of the day.  </li>
            <li> I love this products as it makes my skin very supple and bright.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, this has been a joy to use twice a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and though it&#x27;s full of oils from various good sources, doesn&#x27;t clog pores or cause pimples.  </li>
            <li> Feels good, but smells really strong, if you accidentally touch your eyes with your fingers after using it, get ready for pain!</li>
            <li> may be my new favorite!!</li>
            <li> It reduced the appearance of the fine lines on my forehead the most from what I saw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other ones just as good &amp; your wallet isn&#x27;t raped!!!</li>
            <li> I am 79 years old, have luckily inherited good genes, and have always taken good care of my skin.</li>
            <li> Having very fair skin, blond hair blue eyes, lots of sun exposure, I wanted something that had proven results from users.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the last 2 months and the cream is very good.</li>
            <li> Besides that, it makes my skin soft and has a very light, pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, and has smoothed away my smile lines, as well as the dreaded &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and it seemed like it would be great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural, which is great because I don&#x27;t want to use any cream with retinol in it.</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This product was pricey, but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I love how light this cream is and how my skin drinks it in.</li>
            <li> Since using this product my 40-something skin is noticeably more supple and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product :)</li>
            <li> I love the texture – not too greasy but not too light either.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> rarely leave feedback on products I buy from Amazon, but in the search for a really excellent facial cream that seems to diminish lines and even wrinkles, it seemed important to share my opinion of this product with everyone!</li>
            <li> It gives my skin the moisture it needs and makes my skin feel soft and look great.  </li>
            <li> After using this morning and night for 2 weeks I have already noticed some signs of improvement and my skin is feeling vastly more comfortable than it had been before.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all-natural skin care product that would leave my skin feeling smooth and looking healthy.  </li>
            <li> so I expected better results - phttttttt!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was creamier and applied more smoothly.</li>
            <li> This cream is very rich and leaves my skin feeling smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li> It also has a very light, clean scent.</li>
            <li> It does not feel greasy like other products I have tried, very happy</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time and I absolutely LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> I received this really quickly and so far so good!  </li>
            <li> I am happy to add this onto my regimen as I am sure it will further enhance the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> she easily looks like she&#x27;s 25.  </li>
            <li> Applies easily.</li>
            <li> I received my Bel Essence cream very quickly.</li>
            <li> Then it smoothed on my face so easily and not greasy.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild vanilla scent to it.</li>
            <li> but it does absorb easily.  </li>
            <li> This cream is soft, smooth, and is working great on my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, it took me awhile to notice a difference, but my skin is now softened and overall more plump and glowing than before.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product and am starting to see great results.  </li>
            <li> would strongly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I guess it is pretty amazing since it is sold out.  </li>
            <li> Within a week, I was actually getting comments at work telling me how beautiful my skin is.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on, it does feel greasy, but soon it absorbs into your skin, making it feel nice and hydrated in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It has made no changes in my skin or even the finest of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have used this for less than a week, but already very happy with it.</li>
            <li> and I do believe it will help with the fine lines we are all destined to get.</li>
            <li> and I see an improvement in the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The fine lines around my mouth are not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li> However, they were doing nothing for the fine vertical wrinkles on my neck.</li>
            <li> The fine lines are still there, but are decreasing after about 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> No change in wrinkles (fine lines)  </li>
            <li> I use it with my derma roller and my fine lines</li>
            <li> I have used it for 3 weeks and have noticed that my fine lines don&#x27;t look as pronounced.</li>
            <li> The texture is on the thicker side, which is fine for a night cream.</li>
            <li> but it is a fine.</li>
            <li> I am seeing healthier looking skin and diminishing of the fine lines and wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> I will notice fine line disappearance.</li>
            <li> and I started to notice some fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> ...smells fine...</li>
            <li> Wrinkles around my eyes are disappearing quickly!</li>
            <li> Even though it is super moisturizing, I am able to use it in the morning under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Seller provided quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> and my skin feels very soft and looks good -</li>
            <li> Perfect alone or under make-up, and sometimes I add a little foundation to it for a smoother appearance.  </li>
            <li> I must say that I was surprised that this creme is actually superior in moisturizing ability and seems to smooth fine lines on both my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could show pictures of the before and after, because it&#x27;s really a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I wish I could show pictures of the before and after, because it&#x27;s really a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in terms of wrinkles being gone.</li>
            <li> My skin felt greasy and I did not see a huge difference in my skin appearance.</li>
            <li> Has made a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference in the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping hands young - People are aways commenting on how young my hands look at 45.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for a great experience.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth, toned, brightened.</li>
            <li> I like the light texture and it works well with the serum I use beforehand.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and makes my skin feel moist all over..</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li> What she didn&#x27;t know was that even if I lost, it was still a win for me because if I didn&#x27;t have to buy another facial product again</li>
            <li> What she didn&#x27;t know was that even if I lost, it was still a win for me because if I didn&#x27;t have to buy another facial product again</li>
            <li> Loved this product it leaves my skin so soft and smooth, great if you want to add back moisture.</li>
            <li> it leaves your face feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li> but this is just fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Others have been given a free jar for their reviews...</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I will update my review if response is different or if I get great results.</li>
            <li> I am on my second jar of Bel essence and I have noticed a great difference in my skin</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy, but at night its perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65+ and blessed with that great olive completion and Italian skin that belies age.</li>
            <li> the seller offered free product if I reviewed</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> I definitely feel this is a great product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to have an unscented option, since the vanilla scent can be a bit much.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> In addition to moisturizing, this mixture gives my skin a smooth glow.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, seems to be somewhat oily, but then soaks into my skin to lock in moisture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m enjoying this cream and think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice &amp; gentle</li>
            <li> The oil is great for giving instant relief from the redness.  </li>
            <li> Product goes on smoothly and blends without a trace.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t tell how smooth my face is in the morning when I wake up.</li>
            <li> I have used this primarily as a night cream, but I have used it on occasion as a day cream as well.  </li>
            <li> I like the consistency and light scent which disappears.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bizarre.</li>
            <li> would also like to add that I waited to write this review after using this product for 3 months, and therefore did not receive a free jar of cream that would make my review a biased one.</li>
            <li> My lips are smooth and free of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Then seller tried to charge me for shipping and it was listed as free shipping.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for an good moisturizer that will not cause my overly sensitive skin to breakout.</li>
            <li> Its all natural oils so its good for your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent price and fast shipping supplements actually got it shipped to me a day before it was supposed to arrive.</li>
            <li> So far so good ...</li>
            <li> Seems to turn back the clock a bit, always a good thing:)</li>
            <li> So far so good, but</li>
            <li> Too soon to see results, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> So many positive reviews are posted, I thought hey, give this one a try!  </li>
            <li> Soaks in beautifully (seems my skin was very ready for this!) &amp; leaves my skin instantly smoother &amp; &amp; softer looking</li>
            <li> This one actually works and I&#x27;m in love with it!!  </li>
            <li> I have only used this product about a week, but love it!!  </li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and seems to be a rich cream, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.  </li>
            <li> Ok, this cream has a nice smell and leaves your skin feeling super soft.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. :)</li>
            <li> The seller this comes from, Fast Shipping Supplements, is also very easy to do business with.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many, and this one has left my skin so silky smooth, firmer, and more youthful than ever!</li>
            <li> I just skim 2 fingers over the top of the cream and very gently rub it into my face, dividing into four sections.</li>
            <li> It soothes wonderfully right after the treatment and hydrates beautifully in the following days.</li>
            <li> I really think it has been the best cream I have tried in a very long time.</li>
            <li> I had such great results with using it on my face at night that I quickly started using it on my neck and hands at night and in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this again but will use what&#x27;s left as it does have a pleasant smell and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this only a week and got a compliment today that my skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li> This facial cream is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> but I will continue buying it because it&#x27;s such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure as I was using the first jar if this product works but now that I&#x27;ve finished it I realize that it did benefit my skin.</li>
            <li> It needs to be used sparingly, it is a really rich cream</li>
            <li> It stayed pretty greasy on top of my skin too.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about buying it and hoping it would work.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s quite a rich, decadent cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited t see how my skin will be this winter</li>
            <li> I tried this and at first thought it was ok, but just did not see a significant difference.  </li>
            <li> Excited to continue using this product</li>
            <li> At first, I thought this would make my skin more oily.  </li>
            <li> When I read the reviews for this product I was really excited.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich and lightweight without being greasy.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful too-not to heavily scented though!</li>
            <li> sure your face is clean when you apply it and take a minute or so to gently rub it in and you will notice a difference within a week!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say if it helped in the wrinkle department, but it feels great and has a pleasant scent, which makes it easier to use as directed.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a very good product and is reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s never been excited enough about the results, after researching I felt that this would be the best cream for her as it has natural ingredients</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great for really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like this because it goes on smooth, smells nice and makes my skin soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky-sweet or too gourmand, nor is it too sterile and clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff is light yet super absorbant.</li>
            <li> It smells great and really made my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs so quickly  and smoothly.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s pretty nice!  </li>
            <li> If you look at the ingredients you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s all natural which is also nice (paraben free).  </li>
            <li> I also started using tea tree soap to clean my face and apple&lt;</li>
            <li> Night I clean my face, use Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair serum,</li>
            <li> Great results that turned my dry skin around in a matter of days.  </li>
            <li> This product goes on clean with no greasy after affect.</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s great for dry skin...</li>
            <li> I have allergy problems with many products, but this is great for EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> After looking around for a good anti-aging cream, I decided to purchased this product mainly because it contains many natural products: Avocado, Grapeseed, Sesame, Almond, Argan, Shea, Coconut, Meadowfoam Seed and Kukui oils.</li>
            <li> Funny thing, the first time I used it, it had an amazing softening effect on face.</li>
            <li> it is not at all oily, though has lots of oils in it but makes the skin super smooth and hydrated/</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think so many positive reviews could be trusted</li>
            <li> So far, after using this for about 3 weeks, I must say that I love it!  </li>
            <li> but so far I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and is very creamy, but soaks right into the skin.  </li>
            <li> The cream not only feels great on my skin but also after 4 weeks of using it I already noticed a positive difference!</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this product.</li>
            <li> Despite some rave reviews, this product is not anything special.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in it and that its so pure.</li>
            <li> My skin gets very dry and this works great.  </li>
            <li> , that will be one very good indicator of it not being a high percentage of Phenoxyethanol, and I will come back and change my review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased that my fine lines have softened and my skin looks healthy enough not to wear powder or foundation.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing for extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, I was surprised at how nice it made my face feel.</li>
            <li> and yes my skin felt so nice and soft...</li>
            <li> I have tried so many moisturisers and none of them have really worked.</li>
            <li> It smells like vanilla extract to me, like so sweet</li>
            <li> and I have a full jar of stuff</li>
            <li> I know isn&#x27;t full of harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I could not gush more about how much my skin has improved in texture, elasticity, evenness of complexion, smoothness, softness, youthfulness...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been SO kind to my skin, making it soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I really recommend to give it a try you will love it.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job at hydrating the skin, especially in colder climates.</li>
            <li> Thanks much for such an AWESOME product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have full on wrinkles yet.  </li>
            <li> However, it also depends on how much you use the product to go over that 1% safe point.</li>
            <li> So I did what everyone else did: trying to find a nice, natural anti-aging cream that works on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to more results with longer usage, but really like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure...</li>
            <li> The product is good overall.  </li>
            <li> It is a good product and I will purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much</li>
            <li> It smells good enough to eat, and by that</li>
            <li> This face cream is a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s all natural, which I really liked.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Many thanks to the reviewer from Roc who mentioned thus product.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful I would love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost a full bottle and not a breakout at all</li>
            <li> It smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; smell, but a naturally sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I have not broken out even though this product contains so many oils.</li>
            <li> Love it so much I&#x27;ve purchased it for others to experience.</li>
            <li> I read all reviews of this product, I loved the thought of this being natural, the smell is a funny.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it has such a clean scent and beautiful silky</li>
            <li> My skin is feeling a lot smoother and right at the corners of my eyes, really smooth reducing the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I can easily recommend this to all my married guy friends.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The ingredients are all natural (no weird chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce), it keeps my face pretty hydrated, did not make my sensitive rosacea skin break out, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I will have to use this more and more to determine its full efficacy, but the product definitely helps my skin.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping for a rich, moisturizing, all-natural creme that would calm my skin.</li>
            <li> It also has a light and pleasant fragrance, unlike other moisturizers I have used  including the ones that claimed to be unscented.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The most important thing for me that it&#x27;s 100% Natural.</li>
            <li> Super emollient cream that improved the texture and hydration level of my skin....</li>
            <li> Once this amount is out I will update some more and come back to buy more.</li>
            <li> If I am incorrect after giving this an adequate amount of time, then I will, by all means update this post.</li>
            <li> but I plan to continue using this cream as I feel it has helped me tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I just received this order and quickly used the product.</li>
            <li> I have used many many different face creams.</li>
            <li> It dissipates quickly after application.</li>
            <li> I have always been reluctant to purchase creams with oil in them as I have oily skin, but even though this cream contains some oils, it absorbs quickly and does not leave my face feeling greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with my skin and breakouts if I did not use mild cleansers and Aveeno day creams.</li>
            <li> I have used bel essence intensive anti-aging treatment twice daily for six consecutive days and could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> It does absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this and love the fact that it&#x27;s made up of all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best, and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of the most expensive ones.</li>
            <li> It quickly soaks into my skin, not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream feels very light and absorbs quickly to leave my skin feeling very soft, but not greasy as I&#x27;d feared.  </li>
            <li> Bel Essence is the very first product to accomplish this miracle........</li>
            <li> The seller set me up with a promotional free bottle after my first bottle too.  </li>
            <li> So I am not into buying cream online for the very first time.</li>
            <li> It is now soft, smooth, and I am seeing a significant improvement in the fine lines around my eyes and across my forehead.</li>
            <li> , some were good, some OK, and others seemed like a total waste of money, but I am thrilled with this one.  </li>
            <li> I am really enjoying using this product, specially since it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a new intensive anti aging product after a longtime favorite of mine was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream as it is so smooth and has a sweet fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It was absorbed into my skin so quickly and never felt greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> and it is absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought there was just some on the top, but it&#x27;s throughout the whole jar of lotion.</li>
            <li> Good for dry patches too.</li>
            <li> bel essence cream leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I was most interested in the organic ingredients especially since there are so many items on the market that have a laundry list of stuff in them that customers have no idea</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are natural &amp; make my skin feel refreshed!  </li>
            <li> and I swear my neck is super soft and looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for producing a natural and affordable alternative to surgery, you have gained a loyal customer!!</li>
            <li> So soft and makes the texture very smooth and even.  </li>
            <li> I have had no breakouts with this which is very important when using it on the sensitive eye area.  </li>
            <li> my skin is moisturized, feels very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It feels very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> and none have really improved any fine lines.</li>
            <li> Have seem  a difference in my fine lines and has made my neck much smoother.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t been using the product long (about a month), the first application went on smoothly and was glad it didn&#x27;t have a strong odor.</li>
            <li> In a month my skin has noticeably changed, my pores look smaller, skin tone is more even and the fine lines are not noticeable, and my skin feels smoother.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I noticed other reviewers complaining, while some say it is either odorless or has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I really like the smooth texture of the moisturizing lotion on my face.  </li>
            <li> Being made of all natural ingredients is a huge plus!  </li>
            <li> This seemed to calm my skin</li>
            <li> and I really needed to find a product that genuinely moisturizes the skin, as well as one that I can use during the day as well as before bed.</li>
            <li> This product amazingly makes my face clearer, smoother, and younger looking .  </li>
            <li> This treatment is goes on smooth and you dont need to put so much on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving my mom (in her 70&#x27;s) facials for years, mostly for fun but also because I know she isn&#x27;t comfortable enough to go into a salon.  </li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.</li>
            <li> and I am very frugal (you could say cheap...)</li>
            <li> so I love the fact that this product is all natural.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice, and is nice and thick</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I feel and see a big difference in the level of moisture and softness of my skin.  </li>
            <li> This cream has a lot of natural oils, which helps to keep my skin moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy and I like the fresh scent of it.</li>
            <li> Its a worth a try.</li>
            <li> I like that it is natural and has many beneficial vitamins.</li>
            <li> I really liked that all the ingredients were natural and the price was reasonable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell of shea butter, but it does have a wonderful light and smooth texture and only the smallest of dabs is sufficient for my entire face.</li>
            <li> It is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> It is very \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, which makes it a good moisturizer, but I only use it at night for that reason.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this product and the fact that it is all natural is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li> but this product offers so much more.</li>
            <li> One month is creamy, smooth, thick, smells great.</li>
            <li> I have not had time to determine whether it will work on wrinkles or age spots, but I can tell you it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have bought several jars of this and always loved it; however, in my most recent jar the cream is separated and has pools of oil in it.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews for a product</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth trying.  </li>
            <li> this cream and am happy to have found a natural product that not only seems</li>
            <li> Just received this jar on fast transaction.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was good but the cream was oozing out of the jar, so the cream was messy on top cover and</li>
            <li> I love that this is all natural</li>
            <li> I wanted to find something that could help combat so far I&#x27;m pleased with this product and plan to continue its use</li>
            <li> My wrinkles in my smile lines from my cheeks have reduced by about 70 percent</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural, and I can use it guilt and concern-free.  </li>
            <li> I am 75 yrs old and love the product.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels clear and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkles and acne aren&#x27;t fun at all.  </li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the earthy nutty smell, but it disappears in a matter of seconds.  </li>
            <li> It did take a few more days to get here than what I would have liked, but, I have had that wrinkle since 2006, so</li>
            <li> Worth trying another product made by this company.</li>
            <li> Every morning skin on my face looks fresh and glowing so I even stopped using serum.</li>
            <li> The creme lay on the skin and didn&#x27;t feel like it was absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and many products cause my skin to breakout</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> From now on, my toner is Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel, my serum is OZ Naturals Vitamin C 20% etc, my eye serum is Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair and my moisturizer is Bel Essence intensive anti-aging treatment, which works well as a day or night cream -- a total of $89.68, not $993, for instance.</li>
            <li> so I love the fact that this product is all natural.</li>
            <li> Again, I love the natural vitamins and antioxidants found in this cream.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural which is even better.</li>
            <li> I love that the cream is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel when I put it on, silky soft feeling.  </li>
            <li> good texture and overall a better product than regular creams.  </li>
            <li> This is not greasy (as others have mentioned).&lt;br /&gt;It is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Having a great experience with this cream so far and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I am pleased so far with the results</li>
            <li> It is natural and safe to use.</li>
            <li> I am trying to replace all my face products for more natural ones.</li>
            <li> It  smells terrific and is great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the price that I paid ($33 or so).</li>
            <li> It was worth my money</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a shot to try for your skin issues.</li>
            <li> I think I can honestly appraise this cream since enough time has gone by.</li>
            <li> On top of all that, I got no response from the company when I tried to claim my free extra product.  </li>
            <li> I think it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> laugh lines have diminished as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love all the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I love the natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to make my own with the next listed ingredients, like avocado and coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> but my skin (face and neck) responds very positively to the composition.  </li>
            <li> when I wake up in the morning my skin looks very clean and clear.</li>
            <li> It does not stick but it kept my face very moisturized and fresh!  </li>
            <li> I ordered based on the good reviews of other people.  </li>
            <li> (I just can&#x27;t use retinol right now).</li>
            <li> My skin soaked this product right up.</li>
            <li> but then it soaks right in.  </li>
            <li> which is why I didn&#x27;t want to review the cream right away.  </li>
            <li> and it soaks right in to my skin.  </li>
            <li> It must be the right combo for me since now</li>
            <li> I am now using it on the right side</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Concealer does not lay right  on wrinkles....</li>
            <li> and then right before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> parabens became a hot topic, cosmetic industries scrambled to find an alternative, Phenoxyethanol became the quick-fix, but there are far better and safer preservatives out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 with oily skin and was concerned about breakouts after reading some of the other reviews, but so far so good!  </li>
            <li> It does have a very thick consistency and the smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering such a great, natural product!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily using an electric facial cleaner&#x27;s smooth attachment.  </li>
            <li> Based on others&#x27; reviews I wanted to love this cream, but after only a few days of use I experienced break outs galore.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin easily and has a light vanilla fragrance which comes from real, not imitation vanilla.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not young, so I can&#x27;t expect miracles but having smoother skin is always nice - at any age.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing, so I was putting on a different moisturizer on top of this one, which defeats the purpose!</li>
            <li> I use this before bed in a more heavy application and a very light application in the morning before applying my primer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 years old with fine smile lines and forehead lines.  </li>
            <li> The hydration properties are exactly what my skin needs right now.  </li>
            <li> I also have developed fine, vertical wrinkles right in front of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream has the texture of heavy whipping cream, and is an absolute joy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin really drinks this in, feels lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast too</li>
            <li> It is very soothing, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I hope to love it more everyday.  </li>
            <li> My next attempt at taking a few years off of my skin was L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect for mature skin Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair and also their Golden Balm Redensifying for face, neck &amp; chest.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad though and it fades pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Although it feels great and doesn&#x27;t absorb right away -- which for me is a positive -- I&#x27;m not sure if I can tell if there&#x27;s a difference.  </li>
            <li> I’m almost done with my first jar and I have been able to notice some big improvement with my crows feet and some of my laugh lines.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> The cream is easy to smooth on your face and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Skin Type:  Fair to Medium, normal to dry in places</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer indicated, you don&#x27;t need very much to make a difference.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely can confirm it is very important to include them in your anti aging regime.</li>
            <li> I use it every night before bed and I am noticing fine lines and wrinkles seem to be diminishing, It makes my face feel so soft too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to see if it will make a difference in the appearance of my fine wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> It is certainly a product worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s meant to be like a vanilla scent, but the vanilla mixes with something else that makes it smell a little like egg nog (not in a good way).</li>
            <li> Love the very mild smell it has (slightly vanilla-ish).  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the cream absorbs quicker on more mature skins (since moisture is lost as you get older)</li>
            <li> Mild forehead wrinkles, furrows (between eyebrows) are moderate, very mild crows feet.  </li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t see any huge improvements, my skin is soft.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week but can already tell that my skin is more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something exactly like this.  </li>
            <li> Bel essence is a natural skin care, and nowadays it&#x27;s really important.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice per day, and really like the way my skin responds!</li>
            <li> I have purchased literally hundreds of products from Amazon over the years, and this is the first one that I have felt compelled to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the softest, gentlest, most inoffensive vanilla I&#x27;ve ever smelled, and I would wear it as a daily fragrance in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> But so does many creams carried in your local markets.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using this, and would love if there was a lighter day-time version.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to reapply once I put it on the first time.</li>
            <li> Somewhat of funny backstory...</li>
            <li> If this cream doesn&#x27;t work, I will always defer to you first in these matters and never make another purchase of this sort again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really matter, where this is concerned, I just keep a smile on my face when using it</li>
            <li> In retrospect, I&#x27;m pretty sure she just pulled some inception like moves on me to make me wear the facial cream every day.........</li>
            <li> If this cream doesn&#x27;t work, I will always defer to you first in these matters and never make another purchase of this sort again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really matter, where this is concerned, I just keep a smile on my face when using it</li>
            <li> In retrospect, I&#x27;m pretty sure she just pulled some inception like moves on me to make me wear the facial cream every day.........</li>
            <li> my first thought  was another cream that&#x27;s going</li>
            <li> Just received my first jar of bel essence.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li> My complexion is normally clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> There are many synthetics out there that are similar to this which are in a lot of cases anywhere from 2-5</li>
            <li> times as much as this cream in cost!</li>
            <li> in fact I seem to be seeing more daily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay for years, but recently felt like I needed a more intense cream for some wrinkles around my eyes and smile lines.  </li>
            <li> At this point, which I realize is a very short term trial, I wish I would have researched more before my purchase......</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference when I use this product regularly which makes it stand out from many creams I have used.</li>
            <li> I thought it was working pretty well --</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for one week but can already tell that my skin is more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I found that this is one of my favorite facial creams.</li>
            <li> soft and smooth, fine lines are less noticeable and my skin appears to have improved, it is brighter, more even toned, and it does not leave my skin oily at all.  </li>
            <li> I was interested to see if it would make a difference in the look of my aging hands.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Bel Essence.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a moisturizer that would keep my skin soft and smooth without clogging my pores or being overly greasy.</li>
            <li> and my skin has never been so clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I also use my argon oil first.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the first time I found something that I used until gone.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after using it for several more weeks.</li>
            <li> I just tried it for the first time today</li>
            <li> With this product, no breakouts and it has been more then a month using it daily one time before bed one time in the morning after a shower.  </li>
            <li> It is my current favorite</li>
            <li> It will keep your complexion hydrated and keep the texture soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and you can be sure that after I have used &amp;#34;Bel Essence&amp;#34; for about a month I will report back!</li>
            <li> It is light on the face, not heavy, greasy, or oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have both the serum as well as this cream and after one week of using them combined I really see a difference!</li>
            <li> I have only tried it for five nights, but I love the feel of my skin in the morning.  </li>
            <li> the top of it seems to be smaller...</li>
            <li> Hope the long term results are as great as the short term ones!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This is the first review that I have ever written--though I am an avid “review-reader”.  </li>
            <li> It does look pretty on my shelf though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I finally found the cream that my skin loves!</li>
            <li> Nor did it feel soft and light like whipped cream.</li>
            <li> So, this cream has proved itself more beneficial to me than some well known products that cost several times the dollars.</li>
            <li> I most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember my first jar having any odor issues, but this one does.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off when you first apply.  </li>
            <li> I definitely want a product that is more than a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; feeling--one that has some body to it.</li>
            <li> and it made my face so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have used almost the entire jar and I have seen no results, not even more hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing this product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Although it feels a bit oily when you first put it on, fear not.  </li>
            <li> Cream was sitting on top to make the jar appear full but the bottom was empty.</li>
            <li> i will start checking out the one star reviews first..</li>
            <li> like I did the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> but the results really speak for themselves!</li>
            <li> Buyer be aware.</li>
            <li> It tingles at first (in my case still does)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen minor improvements in my smile lines, but my face is plump and has a healthy</li>
            <li> I cannot justify buying this again for this price when Aveeno Daily Moisturizer works just as well, or maybe even better.  </li>
            <li> Ordered my first jar of Bel Essence just a couple weeks ago.......</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, it works better than Clarin&#x27;s Double Serum.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I just need to use it more often daily for a longer period of time in order to tell.</li>
            <li> I feel it moisturizes pretty well.  </li>
            <li> It turns out the company offers a free jar for a review.</li>
            <li> My jar, once opened, has loads of oil on the top of it and clumps of white cream in the oil.</li>
            <li> I cannot truly vouch for its anti-wrinkle abilities as that is difficult to measure, but it is a wonderful moisturizer with ingredients I feel I can trust.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar and love it..</li>
            <li> Really help&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Lightly scented and all natural</li>
            <li> Rich formula of all natural goodies for your skin!  </li>
            <li> Smells pretty.  </li>
            <li> My skin definitely feels softer and looks plumper and more hydrated than before.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, a little goes a very long way but the moisturizing benefits are impressive.  </li>
            <li> It is just starting to get warm where I live</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to putting it on because it goes on so smoothly and blends in quickly.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles are less noticeable and my skin appears to be more smooth.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is great as a moisturizer especially for those of us with dry skin.</li>
            <li> , then you just look shiny (you will quickly find out how much is too much for you).</li>
            <li> It absorbed nicely and I can tell a slight difference in the way my neck looks.</li>
            <li> This is good moisturizer for semi dry skin and uses no perfumes at all you can tell it is made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I love the fact that this product is all natural.  </li>
            <li> and I can really tell a difference right away.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, smooth and clear for the first time in ages and I love all the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> and/or is looking for something natural and rich to treat their face with at night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a short time and am very happy with it -- looking forward to the long term results.</li>
            <li> I usually used it only at night on my face and sparingly or just on my wrinkles/dry spots in the morning since I have combination/oily skin, but most people could probably use it twice a day to good effect.</li>
            <li> The cream actually feels amazing going on and seems to have been carefully formulated for easy application and absorption.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the dryness has just improved so much that I am able to use Sacylic Acid treatments along with this product without embarassing flaking.  </li>
            <li> It was a brief moment of sweet, sweet victory, even if she did that woman thing where she wouldn&#x27;t concede.</li>
            <li> It was a brief moment of sweet, sweet victory, even if she did that woman thing where she wouldn&#x27;t concede.</li>
            <li> I have used for 3 weeks and really  like it.&lt;br /&gt;It was a very fast deliver.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle cream that really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> That said, there were a ton of positive reviews through amazon and some customers said they use it after rolling their skin with a dermaroller (I bought one too)</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing a jar of Bell Essence because of all the positive reviews there was.</li>
            <li> The seller also bribes customers to post a positive review in exchange of a jar of cream.</li>
            <li> Even my husband noticed the positive change.  </li>
            <li> Today I am going to begin using it in the AM also to see if I see any positive results.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the positive reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> , I decided that I was going to go balls to the wall and really apply it consistently, two times a day (sometimes three).</li>
            <li> , I decided that I was going to go balls to the wall and really apply it consistently, two times a day (sometimes three).</li>
            <li> I first used this  cream,seemed very oily to the face,</li>
            <li> First of all, i recieved this product much quicker than it said I would.</li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier than expected :) I am enjoying this night cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much odorless in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> However, since distilled water is it&#x27;s first ingredient, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have much body.  </li>
            <li> After a couple days dark marks are fading and one of the two lines on my neck is diminishing and the tone is clearing nicely.</li>
            <li> Its all natural and full of all the nutrients your skins need.  </li>
            <li> Wow it was true.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact it is all natural oils as well...using twice a day right now, but will probably only need once a day in a week or so.  </li>
            <li> This cream is very light and sinks in quickly, my skin feels very soft.  </li>
            <li> Upon opening the jar, I love the delicate, natural fragrance, but the really delight lies in the rich texture of the cream, which absorbs easily and leaves my skin feeling nourished.</li>
            <li> I think this product really works for what it claims: it is for real a natural anti-wrinkle cream !!</li>
            <li> but I guess if you have dry skin it will be okay</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product and recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Immediately after application my skin feels super soft.</li>
            <li> I use the oil at night and very quickly noticed my pores got much smaller</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, leaving the skin soft and non greasy during the day.</li>
            <li> I have Hashimoto disease and dry skin is just one of the many issues that comes with.</li>
            <li> my dermatologist doesn&#x27;t know - but quite a lot of creams and lotions react strongly with my hands which is why I&#x27;ll occasionally try face products on them, just to see if I have a reaction.  </li>
            <li> They immediately took action and fixed the issue, so refreshing in today&#x27;s world where no one seems to have decent customer support.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a few months ago and at first I really liked it.</li>
            <li> my pores don&#x27;t look as large as they used to.</li>
            <li> really like this product since it&#x27;s been such a good moisturizer for sensitive skin, really making my skin look healthy, firm, and glowing without feeling greasy</li>
            <li> In addition, the appearance of large pores and smile/</li>
            <li> BUT I can really see positive results on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful combination of all natural ingredients that I have used individually on my skin in past years.</li>
            <li> After using for a few weeks as a night cream, I can truthfully say that this cream delivers!</li>
            <li> It works wonders in just a few hours, and moisturizes better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before, and isn&#x27;t oily at ALL!</li>
            <li> I typed in Eye wrinkle cream, sorted by average review, and this Bel Essence cream was right at the top.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, especially if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Some of my fine line wrinkles on my forehead look smaller!  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and can tell a big difference in the feel of my skin, how fine lines seemed to disappear, and my face looks fresher.</li>
            <li> and I have definitely noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Morning, clean my face, then use Bare Minerals Multi-Wrinkle Repair or Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer with sunscreen, then Bel Essence, and the rest of my makeup.</li>
            <li> read about it from a review of another product and the person recommended it  - for something natural, paraben free and silicone free for my dry, dehydrated and problematic skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is still too soon for me to tell if it will have this effect, but it does make my skin feel smooth and moisturized (and it&#x27;s currently winter, when I have more dry skin issues).  </li>
            <li> The ratings on this product were very high</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and this product seems to absorb better than any I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to try it because I had never used any kind of moisturizer on my face before.</li>
            <li> This is a sweet little cream- highly moisturizing but elegant.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t do much as far as reducing the fine lines near and under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Other great thing...as others have said, this cream goes a long way and has lasted me for months!</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews on here will same the same exact thing I just said, but THIS STUFF WORKS!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and many face cream products contain perfume or other irritants which make my skin burn or break out.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment because of so many other positive reviews and &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; claim.</li>
            <li> but I have a very oily T zone</li>
            <li> The absorption rate is fast too.</li>
            <li> because if I someone really wants an \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; cream they should use something with retinol in it</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t use to much am looking forward to the firming and tightening of  my skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s any chance I can sway the prematurely aged to give this cream a shot, I feel obligated. :)</li>
            <li> stars, absolutely heavenly smell, a treat that I look forward to applying at the end of my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I decided that I should start using real face cream instead of all-purpose lotions.  </li>
            <li> I use it nightly and on weekends only as I need something lighter for my foundation to smooth over.  </li>
            <li> It was very greasy and did not absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> This product took a couple of months before I really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face looks so much brighter now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t really care to know much about them.</li>
            <li> I really like how my skin feels after applying this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like the vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li> I really attribute this to using skin care products and hair care products that are &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and do not harm the environment nor animals.</li>
            <li> It feels great going on, and after only a few days my skin looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> It brightens up the skin and your complexion is much radiant.</li>
            <li> The bel essence arrived ahead of schedule and very well packed.</li>
            <li> All and all, a very satisfactory purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels just like shea butter going on, very soothing.  </li>
            <li> but i really didn&#x27;t buy into all the claims</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> it looks fresh, naturally soft, hydrated,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Really like the smell.  </li>
            <li> It is very creamy--</li>
            <li> what really amazed me about this company was that my jar arrived with a cracked lid.</li>
            <li> I really notice the difference.  </li>
            <li> goes into your skin very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this face/neck lotion.</li>
            <li> I feel this cream is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how much I will use it during the day under makeup as it gets humid here.</li>
            <li> it really does do what it says.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a fantastic buy and will definitely re-order.</li>
            <li> This cream is very greasy, does not soak in.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing either.</li>
            <li> Very greasy.  </li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t really put it through a thorough test</li>
            <li> Not greasy- Soaked in very well.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of skin care products and really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy.</li>
            <li> I noticed ABSOLUTELY ZERO improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li> The cream has been absorbed.. it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores so clearly it has done its job.</li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant putting oil on my skin</li>
            <li> it sooooo much</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t use the cream as much because of it.</li>
            <li> This cream contains too much oil for my skin.</li>
            <li> but I get very dry/tight in winter months.  </li>
            <li> I put it on at night and the next morning my face is still smooth.</li>
            <li> I would rather use my organic coconut oil (at night) at a much cheaper cost.  </li>
            <li> Real beauty cream that works.</li>
            <li> I had read some reviews that said this was very oily</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s greasy, and it just sat on top of my skin, never absorbing into my skin at all.</li>
            <li> This product is really greasy, no wonder it causes break out.</li>
            <li> I have to say my skin really didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like the smoothness of my skin after applying this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much softer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear it even just at night, but I was always waking up to a very oily face.</li>
            <li> I have to be very cautious about what I use.  </li>
            <li> Thanks and</li>
            <li> For example, Oil of Olay products don&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> does not cause acne, even though my skin is very acne prone.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve spent way too many summers in the sun</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with a product with so many 5 &amp; 4 star reviews, but it turns out the company offers a free jar for a review, and I&#x27;m thinking that colored many of the reviews quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want a free jar, in fact I&#x27;m throwing the one I have out and going back to neutrogena -</li>
            <li> but it works really well with my skin.</li>
            <li> and I really like</li>
            <li> My face seems to be much smoother and suppler than before.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, even suffering through it at night, I don&#x27;t feel it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and enlarged pores in the T-zone area.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it once a day and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this.</li>
            <li> It was greasy and didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I did like how it was so gentle..</li>
            <li> I finished my shower and when I saw my face in the mirror my face had turned a nice cherry red, with spots of red all over my forehead.</li>
            <li> After only one week, my skin looks and feels remarkably healthy, soft, and nourished.</li>
            <li> i received this product a few days ago &amp; im already loving it.</li>
            <li> So far my face seems smoother and more younger looking.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a couple of weeks but love it so far.  </li>
            <li> It is similar in composition to the oil babies excrete to keep their skin healthy, so it is a natural alternative to baby oil.</li>
            <li> because it feels just like a nice, heavy, healing cream going on your face.</li>
            <li> It is very, super  greasy even for dry skin;it does not absorb at all, causes break outs, does not diminish fine lines, only leaves skin GREASY!!!.</li>
            <li> I was pretty sure it was just extremely dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how it would work for someone with oily skin, but it is the best product I have found for dry skin showing early signs of aging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is area on the right side of my face, on my cheek,  almost near my lips, a wrinkle that I feel is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> Out of my own curiosity I applied it to only the top of my left hand for a month in place of my other hand creams.</li>
            <li> I ran out pretty quickly and I only use two dabs every morning and night.</li>
            <li> I am always interested in trying a new anti aging product but this one I did not like.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is natural, and the price was right to try it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way (which is fantastic) and it smells really nice</li>
            <li> but now I love Bel Essence so much, I am using only my eye cream and Bel Essence, and no other serums or creams.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream, especially for people who are looking for more natural products.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I missed this for so many years!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I will give it a try and use it minimally as that is the safest route! :)</li>
            <li> Definitely think this is a NIGHT cream....too rich for under make-up.  </li>
            <li> and I just wanted my original face cream back.  </li>
            <li> It works better than any other product I have used,</li>
            <li> Price on Amazon is a little better than my first purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li> and I agree with other reviews - it feels super-soft and lovely.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have enough wrinkles (here in my middle 40&#x27;s) to know if they are magically disappearing, but my expectations of moisturizers are not stratospheric ;)</li>
            <li> I was originally using Ageless and then starting using Bel Essence.</li>
            <li> Just an absolutely lovely gentle soft smell that makes me think of falling into a feather pillow at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> It is rare that you see natural, quality ingredients so high up on the list for a beauty product.</li>
            <li> I started by cautiously putting very little amount on my cheeks -- the driest area of my face and skipped the entire T-zone, which worked out great.</li>
            <li> Cream was applied onto a clean face, so it was the only thing to cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I had used African Shea butter in the past and was happy with it...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good and if I get it near the eye area it burns and causes excessive tearing</li>
            <li> I very much like the Bel Essence All Natural Anti Wrinkle Treatment and will&lt;br /&gt;order again.</li>
            <li> There is a slight vanilla fragrance that is very, very light.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see how it does around my eyes, but even if the wrinkles don&#x27;t go away, it feels absolutely amazing on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only 23, but am an engineering student at the most prestigious public university in my country; I sleep maybe 30 hours a week and don&#x27;t have time to take care of myself, so my skin is an absolute nightmare.</li>
            <li> it was about two to three weeks of regularly using this product at night that I noticed a true difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> liked the texture of it; it was creamy enough and it did have a thin layer of oil on top of the cream when it arrived.</li>
            <li> The smell is not appalling.</li>
            <li> I have tried different moisturizers that just seem full of filler or cake on or smell.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product in the past and I liked it.</li>
            <li> This product has high quality ingredients that makes my naturally dry skin feel very hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it from the top of my face all the way down my neck.</li>
            <li> It is a light gentle moisturizer, but if you have a very dry skin try something stronger.</li>
            <li> Also, the product was sent from 1/2 hour from where I live, but took over a week to get to me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a new face cream!</li>
            <li> I’ve used many eye creams in the past with mixed results, this is by far is a much better product than the others i have tried.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and am in my early 40&#x27;s, so am really starting to need good products.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way- great investment and way better than the Alchemist cream, or plain &amp;#34;fashionable&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The cream has been able to balance out my combination skin like nothing else I have tried before, and my skin seems to be breaking out less.  </li>
            <li> and my skin seems to be more hydrated and wrinkles are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t any less oily but it also doesn&#x27;t seem to make it more oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on smoothly over it without any dry look, that can make you look older.</li>
            <li> I have finished the entire jar and now I am ready to give my 2 cents worth about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products and will look no further.</li>
            <li> The lines on my forehead were my main concern and are noticeably smoother.  </li>
            <li> Has a good consistency, thick but not greasy and the aroma is so natural.</li>
            <li> I was concerned it would have a greasy feel as I have acne prone skin, but it really just melts into your skin and leaves it feeling very soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for 100% natural skin cream that would also make a positive difference for my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing, although I am only a 41-year-old guy with a few lines on his forehead, I had been using oil of olay products ever since I was in my teens.</li>
            <li> It arrived when promised, and I am very pleased with its creaminess and the very small amount you have to use.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit (very rich).</li>
            <li> It is a great product that made me use it daily even if I feel lazy!</li>
            <li> But only the very  first time.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this again though because the price high for the quality.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what else this product does for me, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is now a product I will always keep in my nighttime drawer, and highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> About time a company didn&#x27;t make consumers pay high dollar for a namethe cost-</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and the seller</li>
            <li> Highly allergic to it and returned it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li> So I honestly thought that it would probably be a creme similar to other cremes that I have already used.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and after trying different products my skin was left extremely dry and this cured it within days.</li>
            <li> I speedily ordered the Bel Essence Cream and the oil because I started to get extreme redness and drying from Roc facial cleanser and night cream after three or four days of use on my own face.  </li>
            <li> It does not cause my make-up to cake or flake off like some other creams do.&lt;br /&gt;Being natural and unscented, it does not have a flowery fragrance like many creams but does not leave any lingering odor.  </li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and always looking for that miracle jar without the benefit of surgery and may have just found it!!</li>
            <li> I started using this in the winter when I have to admit that I put on a little thicker coat too just to make me feel better</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly because my smile lines were starting to bother me.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a little thick, but works perfectly - and the ingredients are natural</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it is made with all natural</li>
            <li> It almost doesn&#x27;t smell, not heavy and it absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> so all that richness from natural oils can soak in; really seems to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; your skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I really like the fact that it is made with all natural oils.  </li>
            <li> So far I really like it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 30s and don&#x27;t have much in the way of wrinkles</li>
            <li> I am 70yrs old and have never used sunscreen so one can imagine how wrinkled my face is; now, it is much &amp;#34;smoother&amp;#34; (no, the wrinkles are not gone...)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long before I should see results, but, it goes on smooth and so far has not irritated my skin</li>
            <li> I like this cream, but it is very rich and I broke out from it a little.  </li>
            <li> but I really like this so far.</li>
            <li> So far I am ready to rid myself of all of them and move forward with this one.</li>
            <li> When you apply it it feels rather thick but amazingly by the morning</li>
            <li> My face feels firmer; pores are tightened; marionette lines are softened; light wrinkles are harder to see.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizing cream that was all natural and didn&#x27;t cost as much as the cream</li>
            <li> yet I had no negative effects.</li>
            <li> confirmed when a 22 year old assistant at my recent doctor appointment couldn&#x27;t get over how young I looked.</li>
            <li> Just about every anti-wrinkle cream review I read on here always linked back to Bel Essence (&amp;#34;xx worked, but it really started working after I paired it with Bel Essence&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> Although this product is a bit more expensive than what I can get at the store, I am glad for the natural ingredients and the moisturizing</li>
            <li> so normally when I use any face products I break out.  </li>
            <li> Normally I just purchase whatever is on sale, but I&#x27;m sticking with this cream.  </li>
            <li> , my skin is considered combination of normal and oily.  </li>
            <li> I guess I could wait a few more days.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it helps with wrinkles, but love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> First of all, the jar I received did not remotely smell of vanilla (as another reviewer commented).</li>
            <li> I have been missing this as a moisturizer and need to get more.  </li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and hope my initial success is built upon.</li>
            <li> No negative side effects (rash, breakout, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid product and for the price, it&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li> My first impression was that it was very rich, richer than even my Intensive Moisturzing Dermalogica lotion (much more expensive) but it was not oily at al despite having 9 different plant oils.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin super soft the next day.  </li>
            <li> left my skin super soft....</li>
            <li> have dry skin and tried many facial creams.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> I ordered this product due to the positive reviews, EXCELLENT face cream, will use it in the evening a little heavy for day wear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She was right, I was starting to get wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Only positive comment is that itmis odorless!</li>
            <li> This one really helps with dryness and filling in the fine lines on a daily basis, I don&#x27;t know land doubt if it will long term but will continue using.</li>
            <li> the more negative  reviews are posted more towards the last page of the reviews which are currently pages 51-53.</li>
            <li> I am only 24 years old, but thought it would be better to start early so that my skin could thank me later.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and really do not have any wrinkles just fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Love that its all natural but its a little to greasy for me (hair and face).</li>
            <li> I have been using Bel Essence for a little over a month now, and, wow, I love it.</li>
            <li> I. I live in the Northwest</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this new formula.</li>
            <li> My face was super dry every morning.  </li>
            <li> I had been searching for a night face cream that had natural ingredients and decent reviews.</li>
            <li> I am getting older and have a problem to find a natural cream for wrinkles that would work on my problematic skin (oily T-zone).</li>
            <li> Slightly greasy with a strong lanolin scent, I regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> and I consider that a small amount is sufficient, in my case it  feels a little greasy at the beginning, but absorbs fast, and when it is absorbed leaves my face with a nice complexion and glow.</li>
            <li> Maybe my expectations were too high based on reviews or maybe its really for older skin that needs extra moisture.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, little too heavy and reach for face.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> my skin feels hydrated and very soft.</li>
            <li> it makes my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This helps to moisture the skin and it makes my face very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a ginger and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After a Fraxel procedure, my skin became extremely sensitive and highly prone to acne.</li>
            <li> I do use it on my neck nightly and it makes the skin very soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this cream, makes my face feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> it made my skin very soft and supple, I even used it on my hands and decolletage.</li>
            <li> and it is a little more thick than most creams</li>
            <li> The texture takes a little getting used to; it is a bit thick out of the jar, but once you start to smooth it on, it spreads evenly and quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I mix in a little Oil of Olay for sensitive skin moisturizer, either SPF 15 or 30, to turn this into my own personal &amp;#34;BB&amp;#34; cream.</li>
            <li> The general motif which I&#x27;m trying to convey is Spartan, less is more.</li>
            <li> I pretty much woke up to a fairly dry skin every morning.</li>
            <li> My main concern is to target a few fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> My main target are a few fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I feel miraculously younger or noticeably less wrinkled after a few weeks of use, but I know that I look forward to gently rubbing this concoction onto my face and neck at night, and I feel it does a great job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Put it on my face without sniffing first and had to wash it back off immediately.</li>
            <li> The spa grade,  professional products I work with don&#x27;t even compare to this cream!</li>
            <li> can see my  wrinkles around my eyes faded so much that i can barely tell they&#x27;re there.</li>
            <li> and I know that she know&#x27;s who wears the pants where facial products are concerned ;).</li>
            <li> and I know that she know&#x27;s who wears the pants where facial products are concerned ;).</li>
            <li> I wake up surprised every morning!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Of course, the biggest attraction - was natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> Fine lines are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> An added plus is the fact the cream is made up of various oils  and the first ingredients listed are not words you cannot even pronounce</li>
            <li> First each side, then my forehead and chin and neck next.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase Bel Essence and I am truly surprised!</li>
            <li> and my skin is really soft!  </li>
            <li> all natural, no chemicals!</li>
            <li> But due to the several different oils in this product I can not wear it under my make up, it seems to work ok at first</li>
            <li> glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is small in size, but the quantity surely outweighs the quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps I should use it twice a day during the hot summer sun, but I&#x27;m going back to my faithful bioelement products.</li>
            <li> It melts into my skin and makes it so soft!</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers said, you do NOT need a lot of this product, I dab my one finger in it and make tiny dots on my face, focusing on the dryest areas, then rub the dots in.</li>
            <li> This Bel Essence is the first product I have tried in over two years that actually made a difference in these wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I use Bel Essence in conjunction with Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum and Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Daily Face Peel, Original Strength.</li>
            <li> The seller offered a full refund (not just the shipping fee) to make up for it, so the book is closed on that one.</li>
            <li> I tried put a little more on but still waking up to a pretty dry face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the benefits of other reviewers, but living in  a dry climate, this is a very good moisturizer without the heavy feel of others I have tried and my sensitive skin has not been a problem.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> I have tried many products in the past including the Neutrogena (new and old) \\&quot;wrinkle repair\\&quot; product line</li>
            <li> I have adult acne that I must manage carefully by not using products with certain chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> Some other brands market themselves as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but I learned later (after I wasted my $$$ on many creams that gave me the allergic reaction) that although the main ingredients were natural, the cheap preservatives used were not!!!!!So</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I tend to feel apprehensive about trying out new products on my face.  </li>
            <li> With my sensitive, acne-prone skin I am always hesitant to try a new product.  </li>
            <li> I chose this product for its all natural ingredients as well as its superb reviews, none of which have disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My face is softer and looks more firm in general.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy cheaper moisturizers, but wanted to try something that would work better and was all natural.</li>
            <li> There is a faint vanilla smell that is pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I hate to come back and do this because the company I purchased through was wonderful and very professional, but as I continued to use it and (I did use to much at first because it wont spread)</li>
            <li> Most importantly: the product moisturizes like no other I have tired (and I have tried a lot!)</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was natural hoping that it wouldn&#x27;t break out my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I only need to use a small amount and it does the job, so I expect the jar to last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry in Arizona, but because it is very sensitive, I have to be careful with many anti-aging creams.</li>
            <li> I have had very dry skin and fine wrinkles since I was a teen.</li>
            <li> I put it on right after washing and patting my face dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night in combination with Retin-A micro, Vit C serum and AHA(not together) and it not only nourishes and soothes my super red &amp; sensitive skin-</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be sensitive to new products so love the fact that this product is all natural and hasn&#x27;t had a negative reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I will certainly re-order and definitely recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Opinion:  It goes on smoothly, but feels a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I have a very wrinkled chin due to the damage by prescription retinol cream that I applied on my washed face and during last 7 years I could not get rid of the dryness and the feeling of dryness no matter how much cream I applied</li>
            <li> I am in my upper 30&#x27;s, way upper 30&#x27;s, I bought this cream to help with the fine lines I&#x27;m starting to see form.</li>
            <li> I had been using a moisturizer costing almost four times as much as bel essence with little success.  </li>
            <li> I love that this cream is 100% natural and organic, doesn&#x27;t have any toxic ingredients, and has hardly any smell at all.  </li>
            <li> It was hard trying to find a morning/night routine for my skin that was simple, yet effective.</li>
            <li> and I can see a clear difference in the crow&#x27;s feet at my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I only apply a minimal amount at bedtime and when I wake I find my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention it makes my face feel really soft once it all absorbs.</li>
            <li> I am 40, and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and my skin is soft and looks refreshed.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s natural and not perfumery.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I used it 1 night and woke up to soft supple skin literally over night.</li>
            <li> I am over 70 years old</li>
            <li> I had been looking for face and body products that were made with natural ingredients, and did not include parabens.</li>
            <li> The fact that is it 100% natural is a bonus as you can see and feel the effects of the nourishment.  </li>
            <li> After reading about the natural ingredients in Bel Essence, I decided to try it as a replacement for my nightly retinol.</li>
            <li> likely from being out in the sun too much during the summer, and using tanning salons.</li>
            <li> It really makes me look younger than I am.</li>
            <li> you would not expect in a 25 year old man&#x27;s apartment.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer actually has the whole package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural skin care products for over a decade to combat the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and firmer.  </li>
            <li> I am 48 years old and feel my skin feels firmer and looks brighter.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the cream could be improved though, but I realize it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> this is already making my skin so soft &amp; hydrated without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Makes one wonder how so much &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; has happened following those review pages.</li>
            <li> my skin does not feel moisturized, I am not being negative, however, I am quite confident this &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; won&#x27;t do a dang thing.</li>
            <li> I like the natural, non-greasy finish</li>
            <li> It makes the skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Adding this cream makes my face so soft</li>
            <li> I am 49 years old and have combination/oily skin, which is beginning to show signs of premature aging.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive to oils or already oily, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for you.</li>
            <li> this cream might be all natural - but it does not have any &amp;#34;special powers&amp;#34; - wrinkles still look like wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Have just begun using this product, so don&#x27;t know the complete effects at this time.</li>
            <li> I will note that it doesn&#x27;t take but just a tiny bit on your fingertips, so do not use too much.</li>
            <li> I am 78 years old</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin normal/oily and I was looking for something natural to prevent wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> it feels soft, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> I can tell it is natural</li>
            <li> I see a difference in my 40 year old skin too.  </li>
            <li> My bumps are gone completely.</li>
            <li> My&lt;br /&gt;face is so soft in the morning after using this at night.</li>
            <li> , she was unaware of anyone else having such a problem, and she was personally sending me a free replacement jar that afternoon.</li>
            <li> --I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like how it feels soft, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I found that after I exfoliate nightly (gently), then apply the RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream and wait an hour, then apply the Bel-Essence liberally</li>
            <li> but my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that this moisturizer was made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I really look younger.  </li>
            <li> and I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> am in my early 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft after just one application.</li>
            <li> I find my face is lacking its natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I use this with their natural oil treatment at night.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and so soft.  </li>
            <li> This is truly an all natural product.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I had modest expectations of an \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; product, but could no longer reconcile spending the money to eat organically while slathering my body with chemicals.</li>
            <li> This resolved completely within two applications.</li>
            <li> It does have a vanilla fragrance, my 6 year old says it makes my face smell like ice cream.</li>
            <li> The skin feels extremely soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Since using bel essence on these spots, I have noticed considerable improvement.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> so I cut back how much I was using.  </li>
            <li> old &amp; don&#x27;t have any wrinkles except under my eyes, now they&#x27;re practically gone.  </li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin, am 30 years old, and once in a while suffer from adult and hormone-related acne.  </li>
            <li> I am 66 yrs old</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and looks radiant.  </li>
            <li> but I have noticed a marked improvement in the wrinkles about my eyes, and my neck skin.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it might be all natural</li>
            <li> I frequently go without foundation or powder and still get compliments on my &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; and complexion.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE $$ on this homemade voodoo</li>
            <li> Instead, my skin feels soft and it glows.</li>
            <li> Now here is the catch, in December I paid $33 and now it is marked to almost $50</li>
            <li> I can put it around my eyes, but so far I have not seen any results with my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it around my eyes and watch for any improvements, but so far the cream did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I apply at night and my skin feels soft and supple in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it day and night so far.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel really soft and looks rested.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this cream is all natural.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my washed face before bedtime, and woke up to moisturized, soft and nourished skin.</li>
            <li> What I like about this product so far is the richness and aroma.</li>
            <li> I bought based on some reviews I read and that is all natural.  </li>
            <li> I truly appreciate the care taken in selecting natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly sensitive to fragrance</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, hydrated and no breakouts.</li>
            <li> Makes it feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Been using the cream for a month, my face feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I Purchased this cream because of its natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and hydrated....</li>
            <li> So far this is a keeper.</li>
            <li> have sensitive, oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Not all old and worn out.  </li>
            <li> But if you start early.</li>
            <li> and I do have sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old and my skin soaks Bel Essence up like it needs it.</li>
            <li> I like that it has natural ingredients that work for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like that this product was made from natural ingredients and intends to have an &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but so far no breakout whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and it seems to help give my skin a natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the natural ingredients and because it&#x27;s purpose is to nurture my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so well nourished with all of the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and yet gives you a youthful natural glow that is baby soft to touch.</li>
            <li> I find the cream to be very moisturizing for my facial skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I can really see the difference on my skin next day, glowing!!!!</li>
            <li> Ready for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> I DO like how soft my skin feels after using this product, so</li>
            <li> I guess the natural does not always work.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone looking to use a product with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> We will stick with this product as long as it continues to be consistent and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several days and really like it.</li>
            <li> it will make ur face soft but dont expect wrinkles to vanish...</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t really feel like it was doing anything &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; related.</li>
            <li> Complete</li>
            <li> After using this cream for only a few times, my face already feels softer, more supple, and my lines aren&#x27;t quite as visible as before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in a few week&#x27;s time, it has definitely made my face look and feel MUCH better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> If I put it on, the next day I start to have  few breakouts and more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this cream works very well for some people, but unfortunately, it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Its quiet thick and creamy and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> My face feels more moisturized than before, but I am not sure if it&#x27;s reducing the appearance of or preventing my face from forming new wrinkles, such as on my forehead, both sides adjacent to my nose as I smile/laugh, and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The facial cream is rich, smooth and non irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> I even use it during the summer and it sinks right in, not leaving residue or oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen any other improvements to my over 50 sundamaged skin, but the missing millia is amazing.</li>
            <li> For the reviews I read talking about the smell, it is very similar to other all-natural products I use--almost a light vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li> but it was also half full.</li>
            <li> Definitely will be buying more of this little jewel!</li>
            <li> and I love that a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> So excited to see what my skin will look like in a few months after using it.  </li>
            <li> It feels rich but not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This is the first cosmetic that not only moisturize my skin but also smooths all over without breakouts and extensive shine.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve used many different products on her over the years - usually what I happen to be using at the time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 2 months that I have been using Bel Essence, and it&#x27;s been my main source of facial moisturizer for this winter.</li>
            <li> we learn more and more about the environment and what mother nature has given us, all of these natural oils combined and used regularly could never be a bad thing.</li>
            <li> (Highly doubting this will be necessary.)</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the approaching New England winter, frequent air travel, and chronic work stress have begun to take a toll on my face.</li>
            <li> , that is a major improvement!  </li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day giving an extra little dab of product on the fine wrinkle lines around my eyes and mouth</li>
            <li> just so excited reading all the positive reviews and the stating of it being \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; - dumb me..</li>
            <li> JUST OK, NOT GOOD RESULTS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for a long time, but when it came to getting rid of lines, the sculpting treatment didn&#x27;t really cut it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it moisturizes so well and leaves you with a dewy complexion as long as you don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> Bel Essence All-NATURAL cream nice product without all the chemicals you only need to use a small amount to go a long way.</li>
            <li> It will probably take another week before my face goes back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Not only do I have deep sunken undereye circles and sebacious filaments all over my nose and cheeks, but the sort of undereye wrinkles, laugh lines, facial sagging, and visible undereye veins (!!)</li>
            <li> I see after one month my lines above my lips are especially improved and the lines below are much better as I think my C-PAP chin guard is forcing my sagging skin up when sleeping as I wake up with folds that take a few hrs to dissipate.  </li>
            <li> Now  it&#x27;s back to normal.</li>
            <li> Bel Essence costs half as much!!</li>
            <li> I apply it alone and more than half the time  with the other creams I have.</li>
            <li> This has happened several times with other really great products- just not great for me.</li>
            <li> The new formula caused my skin to turn red and also caused a burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> But, I like to play around with new products, especially ones recommended by people I know.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle - no breakouts or other issues.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product very long, but I can say that it has made my skin so much smoother and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This really helped my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> What I do like about it is that it is very hydrating as I tend to have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I wrote to the company and was ready to send photos of the lid, my biggest fear was that it would dry out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands of cream that ranges from $100+ - $15, and they all clog pores and cause serious breakouts on my poor face.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the current face lotion I was using was a bit too much for daily use.</li>
            <li> The product arrived a few days later, and it is completely free of any &amp;#34;grit.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really could tell that the wrinkles on that side of my face were getting smaller and smaller.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and stays soft and supple until the next morning.</li>
            <li> it is a bit thick but fairly easy to spread.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that turns red and blotchy after showering</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 20 years old, but after using any type of face wash, my skin immediately tightens and flakes (actively looking for the right face wash), but I&#x27;ve been using this every day/night for about 5 or 6 months now</li>
            <li> The cream is a little rich for my face for use daily.  </li>
            <li> Hubby pitched in and helped me explore a brand that shall be nameless except for its price: more than a hundred dollars (sometimes lots more) for a small jar/tube of just about anything.  </li>
            <li> However, I found myself using every last bit of it, which is something I usually do NOT do (I have graveyards of half-used skin and hair products...)  </li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve come across that is 100% natural without any hidden undesirable additives.</li>
            <li> Even though it was a smaller amount for the money, you will get so much more than you thought, because you use a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> I apply it before bed and although it&#x27;s very greasy, when I wake up my skin feels very dry.</li>
            <li> i found one of the ingredients sodium hydroxymethyglyconate to be an irritant to skin if used in high dosage and not a natural ingredient from my research.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and spreads smoothly.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, with a light vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be a little &#x27;grainy&#x27; but  this cream makes it feel smooth, even after i wash my face, and it provides a great base for powder.</li>
            <li> I just want others to know that I have no reason to give a positive review other than I like the product)</li>
            <li> It is somewhat greasy, so I generally avoid using it during the day.</li>
            <li> recently found a bentonite clay mask for the pore issue and had clear pores for about 4 weeks before trying this product.  </li>
            <li> It just left it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Last night I got this cream and applied at night and once this morning, the feeling of dryness was completely gone</li>
            <li> Definitely not a perfume-y smell as I am extremely sensitive to perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Anyhow, I&#x27;m using this wrinkle cream for a month and it barely works.</li>
            <li> and I especially like the idea that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter constantly compliments my skin!  </li>
            <li> But considering the natural ingredients and the fact that it seems to be working well with my skin, it is definitely something I plan to keep using.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not really knowing much about it.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old, and I recently had skin cancer surgery two places on my face.</li>
            <li> Even ones that claimed to only have natural oils have caused severe breakouts.</li>
            <li> This stuff barely comes out of the jar and when I applied it, my throat immediately started to swell up.</li>
            <li> Natural Anti-Wrinkle, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients is also a big +.  </li>
            <li> I have finally found an all natural product that feels so moisturizing and works works so well.</li>
            <li> I either received an old jar or the product is a different formula?</li>
            <li> My face feels SO soft throughout the entire day.</li>
            <li> It FEELS a bit oily going on but it absorbs immediately and my face feels so soft and supple without any greasy feeling or residue being left on it.  </li>
            <li> I use it before bedtime after I cleanse my face and also in the morning after cleansing and 30 minutes before I put my Bare Minerals makeup on.</li>
            <li> I have recently started using this product and so far like the way it feels.</li>
            <li> Feel like I have my youthful 20 yr old glow back.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to put my faith in market economics, viewed the top-rated skin creams on amazon with an eye for natural ingredients, and wound up here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 31 year old male.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive that after this window of time without breakouts, I am convinced this is my staple hoot daily face cream.</li>
            <li> All of the redness is gone &amp; my skin is soft &amp; actually has a dewey look.</li>
            <li> The main problem with this product is that it isn&#x27;t as good as others that are less expensive.</li>
            <li> I then slowly and cautiously applied it to my face by just lightly dipping my fingertip into the jar and the dab on my cheeks, under eye, eyelids, forehead.</li>
            <li> It lays on the surface for just a few minutes after I apply but then is fully absorbed.  </li>
            <li> I live in a desert and have very dry mature skin.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way--and it moisturizes my dry skin better than the Loreal products I was using.</li>
            <li> but I can tell that my skin is brighter and more even tone and the little bit of wrinkles around the edge of my eyes are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I must admit I can actually tell a difference; my left hand looks a slight bit &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; than my right hand!</li>
            <li> Over the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has gained clarity and light, that the typical dryness I struggle with has disappeared, and that my skin simply feels like it is more supple.</li>
            <li> I am also pleasantly surprised to find out that some of the oils such as Almond oil contains high amounts of Vitamins E and D, magnesium, and calcium help with dark circles and baby soft skin!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those with dry or over-processed skin.</li>
            <li> I now live in the middle east and this product has stopped my skin being dried out like it was for the first year of my time here.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin, however, do see this working very well for you if your skin is dry, especially if your skin is damaged, also will work for you if you have oily skin,</li>
            <li> It leaves my face with the right amount of moisture with out the greasy heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li> My skin is also on the dry side in the winter and normal in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had the normal winter dry skin for weeks.  </li>
            <li> I had read from other reviews that Roc dries your skin and that bel essence cream and oil help with the redness and burning that takes place especially when you first use it.  </li>
            <li> I used some expensive brands before and it turned out that I developed an allergy to some preservatives used by many major brands in the U.S.  </li>
            <li> I still have a few more weeks left of the first jar so a little goes a long long way.</li>
            <li> It will probably be too rich for me once late spring and summer arrives.</li>
            <li> In other words I have very UN-sensitive skin--just a bit of info about my skin type.</li>
            <li> I noticed nothing other than really greasy,oily skin.</li>
            <li> Product is &#x27;thick and rich&#x27; if that is the type of cream you are looking for...I was.</li>
            <li> As opposed to other creams, I have had no trouble adjusting to this new product: no break outs, no oily residue, no redness or itching.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin, I HIGHLY recommend this line.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it based on positive customer reviews and it certainly is priced well considering some of the anti-aging treatments out there that are really too expensive for</li>
            <li> I live in the Southwest so the air is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first with this product because it felt so thick and rich to the touch</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve tried various skin care moisturizers, creams, serums, including natural oils individually, but none seem to work for me.  </li>
            <li> I can already tell after nearly one entire jar that my skin has vastly improved.</li>
            <li> My face is very soft and the small wrinkles I had and the fine lines are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> My face is dry and very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> At first it seems a little greasy</li>
            <li> At first it feels a little greasy, but after about 5 minutes, it starts to feel silky.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed a little oily</li>
            <li> The only suggestion I have to improve this moisturizer is to add  a broad spectrum sunscreen.</li>
            <li> use a couple of Neutrogena&#x27;s retinol-type products, but they&#x27;re pretty rough on dry skin like mine.  </li>
            <li> With Bel Essence my skin feels soft and fewer oily issues than other creams for mature skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this for long time because its not harsh and no side effect at all.</li>
            <li> It seems shiny at first but the shinyness is gone after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> or I have a rash the first few days of trying it....</li>
            <li> I have to admit that, at first, I thought this was too heavy for my oil-prone but aging (and acne-prone)</li>
            <li> Turned off to this product line for good due to poor quality control!</li>
            <li> I live in a VERY dry climate, I moved to Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> I live in a desert and we get very dry skin, but not with this cream.  </li>
            <li> I am 34 years old and have normal to dry skin that is more dry than normal in the cold parched winters here in Chicago.</li>
            <li> I was searching for an all natural product, to help improve fine lines as the overall appearance of my skin was starting to look unhealthy.  </li>
            <li> I can usually tell if a product is going to irritate my finicky skin right away.</li>
            <li> I am a 53 years old and suffer from extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> As a retinol user, I frequently have dry patches of skin on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and have dry skin and wrinkles in my under eye area.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about how long it took after I initially started using the clay mask for my pores to clear</li>
            <li> The consistency of this cream is pretty thick, so the old adage &amp;#34;a</li>
            <li> it is thick but my skin absorbes it quickly.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and need the extra moisture that comes with a cream like this.</li>
            <li> (make sure i didn&#x27;t have any negative reaction..) and!!</li>
            <li> After a long search, I narrowed it down to two products and decided to give this one a try first.</li>
            <li> Paired with the grape, its subtle, and different, but clean.  </li>
            <li> However, too expensive for a moisturizer that is just as good as something else for half the price.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m 24, with pretty healthy skin, but after showering or being out in cold weather, my face gets very dry!</li>
            <li> Another month it&#x27;s less thick, more grainy, smells different.</li>
            <li> on my forehead when I smile, but after using the product they are hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a huge problem for me but be warned as they can be irritating for some.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> As much as I had hoped that I&#x27;d avoid the wrinkles that &amp;#34;other women&amp;#34; get as they get older (how naive!)</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am quite young but have dry and sun damaged skin, caused from long term use of acne medications, which was starting to show age marks before its time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that a raised mole that I had on the right side of my face is slowly disappearing after only a week of using this product!</li>
            <li> I tried other more expensive products, but I was actually surprised at how well this cream works for my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the product contains Phenoxyethanol, which can be very irritating to the skin and is proven toxic if the content is more than 1% of the product.</li>
            <li> It definitely feels better and applying make-up is a much smoother process too - no more expensive primers for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s almost 40 and can easily still pass for late 20&#x27;s-30 year old and often do!</li>
            <li> little goes a long way, and my skin already feels so much softer.  </li>
            <li> and I’d give my recommendation to any other guys who want their face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Due to the natural and quality of ingredients in this product and the Bel Essence oil, I plan to use both of these products on an indefinite basis.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t even look at the thing, she pretty much just tells me I know nothing about these things (fact), and that it&#x27;s probably made in china next to an irradiated land fill (that&#x27;s false people!).</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the pores on my nose are much less enlarged, I have less breakouts and the large wrinkles on my forehead are not as deep and some are barely visible now.</li>
            <li> I clean my face, then put a thin layer of this on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> At first sight the product is thick and smells like vanilla, you only need a dab to cover your face and the cream spreads and melts like butter.</li>
            <li> This little baby kicked up my results to all new level that I didn&#x27;t even think was possible.</li>
            <li> I normally wear just the two creams and a little blush</li>
            <li> First of all, my skin is oily and it is really hard to find something that wouldn&#x27;t cause it to breakout.</li>
            <li> Just a small dot will massage over your whole face.</li>
            <li> That gave me a negative tilt towards the product when I first received it.</li>
            <li> I started trying all natural products and was still having no success.</li>
            <li> I have not yet used it consistently on my whole face, partly because the jar is small and I don&#x27;t want to save it for crisis spots.</li>
            <li> It really last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was strange when a moderately priced face cream did not come in a box, it came in a bubble wrap .Although</li>
            <li> At that moment, I realized I needed to try and prolong my youthful appearance for as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> I have so very many other face products, varying from drugstore types to very expensive department store and online only purchases.</li>
            <li> Especially being that it&#x27;s winter time, my skin has been extremely dry</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything and was convinced I was doomed to have extremely dry, red skin forever.</li>
            <li> Glowy, soft, lines are much less noticeable....</li>
            <li> I am working on my 58 and a half year old face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth product I have tried this winter to control the dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> and I have totally dry skin which I could never get moist enough.......</li>
            <li> In winter months my face gets dry and I need extra moisture at night.  </li>
            <li> I only used this for ONE day.. and have EXTREMELY dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I am now curious to see how my skin continues to improve over the next several weeks as I have begun to use it both in the morning and in the evening.</li>
            <li> I am seeing slow but positive changes to my wrinkles and texture.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for me, not easy to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and pale completion</li>
            <li> my skin is flawed and i have seen some fine lines (im 28)</li>
            <li> I had tried other products which left me with a red, itchy rash.</li>
            <li> and I certainly haven&#x27;t had any type of negative reaction which is why I&#x27;m giving this five stars.  </li>
            <li> My skin was very dry, actually flaking on my cheeks, at the time I started using the Bel Essence.</li>
            <li> she has very dry, very red skin.</li>
            <li> What has made me more frustrated was the fact that the container was not full of the product, so much so that I took a photo of it and may send it to the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> I just dab a little from the lid on my fingertips and I rub it on my face before bed and wake up with soft hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> However, because a small amount goes a l-o-n-g way, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> her skin is especially dry and crepey above her eyes and she regularly applies five moisturizing products a day, but they do not keep her moisturized long term.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s normally wonderful, but when I opened this jar, wow, a crazy bad smell.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products, cheap and expensive.</li>
            <li> - I may have been more cynical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never too early to start using an anti-aging cream (especially an all-natural one!), plus I stay out of the sun usually to avoid tanning.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how it will work in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combo middle aged skin that still breaks out</li>
            <li> There are preservatives in there that are not natural at all.</li>
            <li> I will plan on using it every night and am looking forward to seeing what long term use will do for my skin.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been using it too long.  </li>
            <li> I can tell I will be a LONG time customer of this product.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t rate long term yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 2 months now &amp; noticed that my skin is visibly healthier &amp; softer than I can remember it being in a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different from other commercial creams, which are way more expensive!</li>
            <li> This cream moisturizes my skin all night long, and since the temperatures are dropping.</li>
            <li> It provides moisture all day long.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this product, so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin did have to get use to the change but it did not take long.</li>
            <li> If you apply too much, it would get so greasy and thick.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer since using the product and wrinkles are slowly fading.  </li>
            <li> The good reviews are fake, and the negative reviews get aggressively thumbed down as &amp;#34;not helpful&amp;#34;  by the seller with multiple accounts.</li>
            <li> I also think it did help with my slight laugh lines, but they were hardly noticeable to begin with, I just looked closely with a flashlight</li>
            <li> I mean that it smells of natural oils and butters and essential oils, which is such a change from the nice-smelling-but-clearly</li>
            <li> ; my skin has not broken out (within two days of using a new skin product without fail my face breaks out - 5 days and clearer skin).</li>
            <li> For dry skin it may be good, but for skin that is slightly oily, this can be a bad thing and cause breaks out.</li>
            <li> Some people think the cost is high but you only need a tiny amount and my jar lasted for approximately four months.</li>
            <li> (a little earthy)it is subtle and dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was finally persuaded after some research + due to the ratings and comments given.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this cream is different from any other face cream I  applied before.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to long the term benefits!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 59 and am presently (since I&#x27;ve run out) using other products that don&#x27;t keep my skin hydrated until the morning.</li>
            <li> This cream actually feels like it is moisturizing your skin, sinking in compared to all other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> I just wish it has a size bigger other than that it does what it says.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been using any of my other night treatments because this works as my only night cream now.</li>
            <li> Due to the smell, I would never wear it in public.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long</li>
            <li> Will be using this product for a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who has dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels dry after applying, and I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Even with plenty of moisturizer at night, I always woke up with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and I like this fact.  </li>
            <li> I had some dry spots which it has indeed eliminated.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone suffering from age-related dry skin.</li>
            <li> I happen to have dry knuckles</li>
            <li> My skin became so dry this winter.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and am in my 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate, doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or dry it out.</li>
            <li> , that was making my skin dry &amp; flaky.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, this stuff makes my skin moist again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results to my dark circles</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and thus bring back some shine to skin that is extra dry in my case, and absolutely no problems with blemishes or redness</li>
            <li> I would never live without using this product as it helps improve my confidence.  </li>
            <li> I put it on his face after a long day in the sun and his redness went way down by the next morning.</li>
            <li> At first it feels very thick</li>
            <li> Another benefit is there is no leftover residue on my pillow, and the biggest bonus of them all is that I can pronounce every single ingredient listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can not wait to use these products every single day.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and after using this, I still had dry skin but with acne!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my skin usually breaks out when i use products with oils in them.</li>
            <li> I even think the dark spots are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> artificial scents of most other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will use in summer months as I think it will be too oily with my natural skin type,</li>
            <li> After using it, my dark spot was gone but I was left with four wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Hard to say if it&#x27;s because of the Neutrogena product I have on underneath, or if my skin has just become accustomed to the new moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not a highly qualified cream</li>
            <li> I was advised on Amazon to use this with ROC night repair and can&#x27;t wait to use it to prevent the dry skin that occurs with ROC!</li>
            <li> After 2 months, I have about half the bottle left</li>
            <li> I like to use clay masks and african black soap from time to time - after any of those treatments I put this on.</li>
            <li> I always read reviews prior to buying skin-care products but oddly, all of the reviews were on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Because my skin is finally balanced after all these years, I even have less breakouts.</li>
            <li> Well, I am only half way through my jar and have been using this product for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, heavy and leaves skin super oily.</li>
            <li> If you might be a person with very dry skin I can see this product being used as a day cream as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dry,</li>
            <li> Prior to trying this product, I was seriously considering eyelid/undereye surgery after graduation so that I could enjoy at least a few years of youthful beauty before my 30s.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and was looking for a high-quality and affordable lotion for my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels moist and seeing how I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> and I have very very dry skin under eyes.</li>
            <li> They all left a tight feeling on my face until now.</li>
            <li> For the first time in 7 yrs, my skin has made a dramatic transformation.</li>
            <li> so I was super skeptical to use it but hasn&#x27;t broken my skin out once and leaves me feeling very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I feel that shooting poison (Botox) into your face for anything other than medical purposes will be damaging down the road.  </li>
            <li> and you only need a little.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> but you use so little it does last.  </li>
            <li> Only a little is required.</li>
            <li> so you only need a little bit.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a little.</li>
            <li> The texture of the cream is a little different from what I am used to</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and only a little is all you need.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little moistness left on my face and that allows the lotion to soak in immediately.  </li>
            <li> I only have to use a little</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, too, as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I use this every morning and every other night (alternating with Renova) and my skin has lost that dry, scaly appearance that Renova can produce.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding anything that works for my sensitive skin and this has been a winner.  </li>
            <li> As a scientist I get frustrated by the large number of products that are compositionally the same but simply branded differently.</li>
            <li> I found that complaint completely invalid.  </li>
            <li> however when I got in the shower and got my skin wet</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days and already notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> But be careful for the volume you use.</li>
            <li> A few days later, I thought the wrinkles were going away.</li>
            <li> A few days later, I thought the wrinkles were going away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, so time will tell.  </li>
            <li> (I felt my skin just looked very dehydrated &amp; tired looking).</li>
            <li> I was told a few yrs back that i have rosacea</li>
            <li> My skin was not absorbing the products.</li>
            <li> so after a few months of trying different creams I decided to try Bel Essence...</li>
            <li> am a gardener, and am rough on my hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to see if there&#x27;s an option that has an spf rating or that contains zinc or something similar that isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li> Of course, I expected miracles but there is no way anything could help my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> so I am careful about that.</li>
            <li> I spent about an hour doing research, trying to find an aging treatment with natural ingredients, but finding natural products was difficult.</li>
            <li> This cream visibly reduces uneven tones, makes pores look smaller and lets you wake up to baby-soft skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and moisturizing when I applied it to my face, but it seemed to only stay moisturized for few hours.</li>
            <li> Breaks my face out even with minimal application.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days</li>
            <li> have been using it for over 2 weeks with absolutely no side effects or reactions .</li>
            <li> It might be too heavy for summer use, but I&#x27;m going to try it anyway, maybe will need to use it only once</li>
            <li> Such a waste of my time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already noticed the difference in my skin after only using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks now, but my skin already feels softer and looks brighter.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for an everyday lotion that I like for years, and I have definitely found that lotion.</li>
            <li> I will keep this up until the jars are empty (perhaps another 3 weeks) and reassess the results.</li>
            <li> this has made such a difference in a few short days, we are anxious to see what the long term results are!</li>
            <li> This is pretty expensive, but a little bit goes a long way, so I am waiting to see how long this lasts.  </li>
            <li> I only had to use a very small amount each time to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty pricey, but given how long this little container lasts, it probably evens out to be a similar value to less expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from dry, dull skin, with a little bit of breakouts here and there and this cream fixed all of that</li>
            <li> To provide some other helpful background information, I&#x27;ve had to work harder to prevent clogged pores in my 30&#x27;s than ever before.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my mom, she&#x27;s tried different creams for the past few years</li>
            <li> so I was a little surprised by the small size when it arrived but other</li>
            <li> I was planning on playing the long game here, but I was genuinely surprised.</li>
            <li> I was planning on playing the long game here, but I was genuinely surprised.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely less dry now that I use this cream.</li>
            <li> Not oily and only takes a little each night!</li>
            <li> At first, the cream seems a little oily for about 5-10mins, but then your skin seriously drinks this stuff up!</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> it is not greasy and a little goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw</li>
            <li> I use it every night (and a little goes a long way).  </li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and  a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thicker than what some might be used to, but a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the pricey side but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, you really only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Only use a very very little as it is oily.</li>
            <li> After using regularly for a month I see no difference in wrinkle appearance and very little improvement in skin dryness.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, tired, aging skin at 60 years old</li>
            <li> maybe a few lines are less, but the big benefit is</li>
            <li> And it was from a guy who never really notices things like that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used maybe 3/8&amp;#34; in the past two months.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had one other product, a Neutrogena face wash.</li>
            <li> Shampoo, conditioner, body wash for different days and scenarios, different facial scrubs (some using mud) and all sorts of completely random stuff</li>
            <li> Over the past several years, I have used a variety of creams, everything from CeraVe, recommended by my dermatologist, to La Mer, recommended to me at Neiman Marcus.</li>
            <li> Is like any other face cream in the market.</li>
            <li> I use it with other creams and have not tried the Neutrogena yet.  </li>
            <li> I came upon this product through researching other products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I REALLLY didn&#x27;t want to like it because of the cost, especially once I got it and realized what a small jar it is, but...holy moly.</li>
            <li> I researched a lot of products and based on some other reviews I found my way to this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Together with the other two products, my skin is being helped by Bel Essence.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in my skin, and just checked to see what other products you offer, and I will be ordering the serum as soon as I finish this note.</li>
            <li> Read other reviews and decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> Using it every other day it has lasted me over a year.  </li>
            <li> I like what other customers had to say.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using Bel Essence for a few days, and already I like it!</li>
            <li> Now I use it to moisturize my hair so its not a complete waste.</li>
            <li> Since I could no longer obtain my face moisturizer, I had to try other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Encouraged, I searched Amazon and the comments for other substitutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan and will be trying some other Bel Essence products.</li>
            <li> It is not like other &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; products in its category . . .</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been an endless battle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband says he doesn&#x27;t notice any difference in terms of my facial skin in the past 2 years, so</li>
            <li> I look forward to looking at other skin care products in this line.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference when I applied it to my skin except that it was extremely oily.  </li>
            <li> Tried this product due to someone else&#x27;s review of it.</li>
            <li> I used Ageless again the other day, and it felt like I was rubbing perfumed water on my face compared to the Bel Essence cream.</li>
            <li> I even bought the other one suggested in the review to go along with this one.  </li>
            <li> I could use it around my eyes and not have any irritation... other, stronger lotions sting my eyes sometimes if not made for eyes...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a moisturizer, like any other.  </li>
            <li> I have high hopes that I&#x27;ve finally found a product that will stop the clock from ticking -- or at least slow it down!</li>
            <li> I also use a little on my hair after blow drying and it helps with dry ends.</li>
            <li> and I have never experienced the kinds of reactions some women do when trying new products.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a thicker cream I do have to wait longer until I apply my makeup, as I usually use a mineral based foundation (i.e. Bare Essentials) and it can make my makeup feel heavy.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid it would irritate my 42 year old sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> we noticed that the crepey look reduced almost immediately upon application, and over several days, the overall redness has significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> I am tired of purchasing facial care products only to find instead of improvement</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now &amp; my skin is no longer dry &amp; flaky.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, i purchased this because of all the good reviews that influenced my purchase once again, only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d ever get the dry, red, nasty looking spots to go away!  </li>
            <li> Although this product is a little pricey, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I was initially worried that my face would break out due to the oils in the cream and how thick it is (it&#x27;s almost like a body cream)</li>
            <li> Since I have very dry, sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve used quite a few products that were irritating and others that didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize at all</li>
            <li> I used it day and night for 3 weeks and could not notice any improvement in the wrinkles or dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Definitely NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and nourishes the skin, helps your skin retain or restore its glow, and lightens dark circles under the eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and nourishes the skin, helps your skin retain or restore its glow, and lightens dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> also using a few other things other customers suggested, but I like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a fan, as my initial review above shows, but the second jar I ordered had a weird smell to it when I got it, and it&#x27;s only gotten worse.</li>
            <li> The dark circles below my eyes disappeared.</li>
            <li> Nonsmoker.&lt;br /&gt;Duration of Use: One month on an average of once per day (sometimes twice)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for almost a month and the product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was given a Mary Kay product to try to get rid of a dark spot on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I have bought PLENTY of other creams, some name brand, others not, and they have done nothing!  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have to use it much, just a very thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> for these reasons I find the very small product you receive totally overpriced</li>
            <li> A waste of my money because I could have gotten any other cream and probably save money.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry but my face has very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> You can get a cream like this at the store for half the price.</li>
            <li> So my wrinkles are less noticeable and my skin appears to be smoother.</li>
            <li> Anyway I received my product less than a week ago and have been using it since.</li>
            <li> let my skin rest and then tried again with much less but still the problem occurred.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never know if it really does tighten and firm, so sad am</li>
            <li> and I have to say my skin is softer and wrinkles less pronounced than they were.  </li>
            <li> and I must say, my face is a lot smoother and less flakey.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re still there but are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> This cream seems to soften those lines and make them less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;actually am having less break outs than before.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing lasts all day, without wearing off halfway through the day like with my previous moisturizers.</li>
            <li> They appear to be slightly faded already</li>
            <li> what it means, much less if it is safe.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews, and noticed that it leaves my face glowing, while erasing previous acne scars.  </li>
            <li> The lines were less visible.  </li>
            <li> They appear to be slightly faded already.</li>
            <li> I was previously using</li>
            <li> /&gt;The less you use (since the instructions say it lasts 3 months alone)</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t go by reviews, but I had to check this out.</li>
            <li> I feel a slight tightness to my skin as if I didn&#x27;t moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not fair to write a review after a very short time</li>
            <li> Bel Essence website says it takes at least a month to see long term results because your skin regenerates every 28 days.</li>
            <li> It is a little thicker and heavier than what I was previously using</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and especially with living in New England where it is very cold, this felt so soothing on my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight anymore</li>
            <li> I also apply whenever I feel that my skin is tight.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but surprisingly long -lasting</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how small the jar is.</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s been a few months, it feels slightly less moisturizing...</li>
            <li> It is a little heavier but hasn&#x27;t made me breakout.</li>
            <li> I thought to myself, well 30 dollars is a lot of shekels to pay for a little thing of eye cream.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers in the past with so-so results.  </li>
            <li> I like the scent (not perfumy, a little earthy).</li>
            <li> I did a little search in Amazon and came across this product.  </li>
            <li> I started using this cream a little over a week ago</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a little while before writing a review</li>
            <li> That being said, I get a lot of redness and little bumps with a lot of products.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is due to this&lt;br /&gt;product or not.</li>
            <li> but I cannot definitively say whether it has had any impact on my little forehead lines.  </li>
            <li> However, it is a little bit oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how it is doing after I have used it a little longer.</li>
            <li> Yes, a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> Also, itmells a little like olives, however you want to take that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 6 hours since I used it, and face still feels silky and has a little glow.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars if it was a little lighter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  had the product for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> I also found the smell a little off putting -</li>
            <li> Let me tell you a little bit about myself.</li>
            <li> So I tried a little bit at a time.  </li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d known about the little bribe before I&#x27;d purchased this</li>
            <li> When I saw the piece of paper with that little bribe on it</li>
            <li> I had been using a Alba Botanica product that must have been a little pore clogging but this cleared it up.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little if it gets in eye</li>
            <li> It is especially helpful to use it during the winter since I live in a cold climate which can be hard on the skin and indoors the heat can be drying.</li>
            <li> Finally got this, very late because of a mixup on the Postal Service&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li> I used to be afraid of cameras to the point that I wouldn&#x27;t use face-unlock on my phone because seeing the enormous pores and deep shadows on my face was too depressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it left me with painful, cyst-like breakouts, something I have not seen the likes of for nearly two decades.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be greasy because the consistency is not runny but firm.</li>
            <li> I backed off for a few days</li>
            <li> For me, the one-two punch of retinol and Bel Essence is the secret sauce to managing facial skin aging.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old have tried expensive and inexpensive products.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago and have been using it nightly since.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days now</li>
            <li> I now see that the product is not available, which is just as well since I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It is a thicker cream, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face like some others do.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this face cream for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> Flakey skin appears everyday in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> I do have a few on my forehead from raising my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well under make up after waiting a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Also it does not feel heavy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have just received my Bel Essence sadly to discover that it is not all natural.</li>
            <li> Give it a few minutes to fully soak in...</li>
            <li> I just started using this product a few days ago and can already see increased brightness and suppleness in my skin.  </li>
            <li> My jar of &amp;#34;bel essence&amp;#34; arrived before scheduled and an email to the seller with a few questions was answered almost as soon as I had written it.</li>
            <li> Nevada a few months ago</li>
            <li> Since entering my 30&#x27;s my skin has started to show some unfortunate signs of the mistreatment I inflicted on it during my teens and early 20&#x27;s (repeated sunburns in attempts to \\&quot;tan\\</li>
            <li> I apply it at night, and I wake up with moisturized, firm skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading the reviews and have used it nightly for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned by the thicker consistency since I do not like a heavy feeling on my face, ever.  </li>
            <li> This is not greasy or heavy feeling at all.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles are vanishing even after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> It is heavy and greasy on my skin.</li>
            <li> not seeing improvement and using it everyday</li>
            <li> I think it was too heavy, which made me break out.</li>
            <li> I just received this product a few days ago and immediately i could feel a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s been a few months now</li>
            <li> and I find that my skin tends to be dried out now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly light in texture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I seem to have trouble finding a face cream for my skin type.  </li>
            <li> I suspected I might be in trouble.</li>
            <li> Waste of my $$</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> After a week of using this I&#x27;ve noticed there are less creases!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those hidden gems that you find on amazon!</li>
            <li> Since it is all natural, you are not going to be getting the artificial ingredients other moisturizers use to achieve their scents.</li>
            <li> It has a vanilla scent to it which I don&#x27;t mind, the bottle usually lasts me a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> All the other creams I used would burn my skin and cause bad reactions, red and dry, burning skin.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and want to slow it down.</li>
            <li> The combination of all the oils seem to &#x60;slow down&#x27; the aging effects.</li>
            <li> I live in a cold climate and always have skin problems during the winter.</li>
            <li> Little complaint about the smell.  </li>
            <li> I also appreciate that the cream has very little fragrance which is not at all noticeable once applied.  </li>
            <li> You need very little.  </li>
            <li> dont waste your money!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a week and see results already, however small.</li>
            <li> So my advice is just use a small amount each time, you would see the results.</li>
            <li> It may seem like a small jar</li>
            <li> i have combo skin with puffy under eyes &amp; small wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it does anything to my skin or not.</li>
            <li> (the jar is REALLY small, I&#x27;m not kidding, and I do apply it both morning and night and to my neck and chest as well)</li>
            <li> This cream makes my skin crazy soft.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see if it will help with some of my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what causes it -</li>
            <li> and caused those 2 faint horizontal lines to become deep creases!</li>
            <li> I usually use Astara, but I&#x27;m gonna give this a chance.</li>
            <li> A small pea-size amount twice a day is all that&#x27;s needed for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is helping with the wrinkles</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing and the small lines under my eyes are gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bel Essence All-natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment for past 6 months as a night cream.</li>
            <li> The small lines around my mouth seem to be not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> After a few days you could already see a difference!</li>
            <li> With a small amount applied it absorbs into my skin in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened..maybe the summer sun.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use Bel Essence to properly moisturize, my skin is not happy!</li>
            <li> Not sure any renovation takes place</li>
            <li> No more Dr. Hauskca for me.</li>
            <li> Usually when I change products, my skin breaks out a lot.</li>
            <li> No more crows feet around my eyes and</li>
            <li> I use it when I am feeling too lazy to do my usual hyaluronic serum and Aragon oil routine, and it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using it everyday this winter!</li>
            <li> Not sure I would purchase it again,</li>
            <li> Something is wrong with the 2nd bottle of this cream.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the very few creams that does not make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> Very messy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I was all excited to get this product and after using it I started getting ugly (and I mean ugly) white heads.  </li>
            <li> I use the oil and lotion at least once a day, usually twice.</li>
            <li> You will not want to waste your money ever again on expensive products that have hidden additives and chemicals.</li>
            <li> The serum can be a bit hard on the skin and applying the Bel Essence cream afterwards has a calming and soothing effect.</li>
            <li> It is hard to determine what percentage that is used in this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin was getting dull, but this has put the reverse button on dull skin.</li>
            <li> I know hard to believe...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s &amp; started to notice that my under eye wrinkles were getting noticeably deeper.</li>
            <li> that I see in people in their late 30s.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I used it at least once a day and sometimes twice.</li>
            <li> I have used allot of different products and this was by far the worst.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s  thick</li>
            <li> It goes on thick</li>
            <li> Shipping was slow as well.</li>
            <li> It also has a smell of an avocado, and it&#x27;s thick and oily.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the cream is a bit thick</li>
            <li> but once you massage it on your face your skin will absorb it and it doesn&#x27;t feel thick at all</li>
            <li> use this cream at night and it is extremely thick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick.  </li>
            <li> It felt a bit thick going on but it melts into your skin....</li>
            <li> The pictures are misleading as they show a thick cream.</li>
            <li> so unhappy in the past because of its blemishes, dull looking, rough, with</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without it now that I&#x27;ve tried it for the past month!</li>
            <li> you know what I mean-</li>
            <li> I used a very small amount of this stuff at night for two days</li>
            <li> , I decided it was time for the works before serious signs of aging set in.</li>
            <li> This is some serious cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those hidden gems that you find on amazon!land fill (that&#x27;s false people!).</li>
            <li> I am 31 &amp; started seeing dramatic changes in my skin over the past 7 yrs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little expensive</li>
            <li> Living in a such a bad environment, we need something like that for our skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like the deep lines on my face weren&#x27;t really bad, but as I could see in time .I  </li>
            <li> It might be painful to shell out $35 on a jar to last a month</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed because I will have to continue my search for a facial moisturizer that works for me.  </li>
            <li> You should definitely try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick and greasy cream that doesnt seem to sink into the skin.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, I see absolutely no improvement in wrinkle appearance and mine aren&#x27;t even all that bad or noticeable.  </li>
            <li> and this is non irritating.</li>
            <li> the game afoot, and the smug look on her face</li>
            <li> the game afoot, and the smug look on her face</li>
            <li> I wait about 15/20 minutes for it to absorb, then apply another thin layer of coconut oil and hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> I apply a thin film morning and evening.</li>
            <li> Also the jar came with a broken lid</li>
            <li> powder makes them look worse.</li>
            <li> In the morning if they are swollen or worse I will not use it again.</li>
            <li> typically don&#x27;t have bad reactions to lotions except on my hands.  </li>
            <li> So as they say stick with what works and for years for me it&#x27;s been Clinique Dramatic Difference</li>
            <li> pricey and as worthless as all the myriad other anti aging stuff out there.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed and after a few days of use it dried my skin out terribly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or what, but mine smelled like kitchen oil that was past its prime.</li>
            <li> I will try to find a picture of how my skin used to look (might be difficult, I avoided cameras out of humiliation) and upload progress pictures.</li>
            <li> That was a sad moment of truth, when you start to realize that your body isn&#x27;t that bastion of youth anymore.</li>
            <li> While I am a fan of microderm treatments, I hate how they make my face flaky for a few days afterward.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, within 2 hours on a Saturday afternoon (non-business hours, I assumed), a representative of the company emailed me to say she was sorry</li>
            <li> and I swear my eye wrinkles are getting worse!</li>
            <li> &quot; I was like WTF?  </li>
            <li> This all-natural silky skin treatment has just a faint vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> I was also not impressed with the jar.</li>
            <li> So to me this was a totally useless product.</li>
            <li> Although expensive, it works well</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do any of that.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> It arrived with a broken lid, I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to spoil.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find that not only does the product stink so bad</li>
            <li> I was not happy, all disappointed me</li>
            <li> My skin feels hydrated in the cold Fall weather.</li>
            <li> you will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> and then my pores started clogging up again worse than before!!  </li>
            <li> but it smells unpleasantly like liquid plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, not for me.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; IMHO borders on unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I have had some unpleasant reactions to even high-end moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> It just feel very weird on my face.</li>
            <li> It is not fragrant, but does not smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> scent isn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t give me any bad breakout.</li>
            <li> It really is a bad product.</li>
            <li> I thought I received a bad jar.</li>
            <li> It was actually painful.</li>
            <li> Still feel like I&#x27;m going to be sick.</li>
            <li> Its too bad I can&#x27;t use it :(    </li>
            <li> The lines and wrinkles are still there:(  won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t have to change my rating :{</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Sorry Amazon, this doesn&#x27;t qualify for Prime and there is a terrible mark up by the seller.</li>
            <li> you WILL NOT be disappointed in your purchase of Bel Essence Intensive Anti-Aging Treatment.  </li>
            <li> :(((</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> , it get very cold here in MN</li>
            <li> In the morning I wait about 30 minutes before applying primer and makeup base.</li>
            <li> I did not return this product because I don&#x27;t hate it.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so annoying to put on my face and have to wipe off.</li>
            <li> I know my chin is damaged because I eliminated all the natrural oil by using that awful cream</li>
            <li> people complain about the scent, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s not the worst.</li>
            <li> Roc retinol night cream was the worst.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> and it was horrible!</li>
            <li> The smell is awful.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible and I have to throw it away.  </li>

            <li> Goes on easily using an electric facial cleaner&#x27;s smooth attachment.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Provides great moisture. Feels nice on my skin. I don&#x27; have wrinkles but I have a very oily T zone so I don&#x27;t us it there, but use it on my neck and cheeks every night.</li>
            <li> My wife actually has this cream and she put some of it on me. I was a little reluctant to try it because I had never used any kind of moisturizer on my face before. However, I was surprised at how nice it made my face feel. It wasn’t too greasy and didn’t make my face feel oily. It just left it feeling soft. My wife told me that I should keep using it because it will help with my wrinkles. Her face looks beautiful so maybe I should keep using this. Seems like a great product and I’d give my recommendation to any other guys who want their face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using the bel cream for a while now and I am really happy with how well this treatment has worked for me. One of my favorite features of the cream is the ingredients used to make it. It smells great and it easy to apply. The absorption rate is fast too. I’m almost done with my first jar and I have been able to notice some big improvement with my crows feet and some of my laugh lines. Not to mention it makes my face feel really soft once it all absorbs. I’m planning on buying another jar when I run out and I know I will keep seeing improvements with continued use.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and it seemed like it would be great for my sensitive skin. So I put it on before bed, woke the next morning and yes my skin felt so nice and soft...however when I got in the shower and got my skin wet it tingled. I finished my shower and when I saw my face in the mirror my face had turned a nice cherry red, with spots of red all over my forehead. So as they say stick with what works and for years for me it&#x27;s been Clinique Dramatic Difference</li>
            <li> I have been using Bel Essence products for several months now.  I am really enjoying the quality of ingredients that they include with their products.  I started with their oil and really loved how it felt on my skin.  I decided to try their Intensive Facial Lift Cream - as it is a cream.  It has more nourishing oils in it than the Bel Essence Anti-Aging Oil.  It goes on smoothly.  I have definitely noticed a reduction in the appearance of lives around my eyes and on my forehead.  Due to the natural and quality of ingredients in this product and the Bel Essence oil, I plan to use both of these products on an indefinite basis.</li>
            <li> Smells divine and it isn&#x27;t too greasy. LOVE IT! My skin feels hydrated in the cold Fall weather.</li>
            <li> Really amazing cream. The trick is to use it every day and give it the 3 weeks of cellular turnover. My skin is so smooth, toned, brightened. I don&#x27;t know how, but this is the deal. I hope they never stop making it! I can&#x27;t stop touching my face. It feels like velvet!</li>
            <li> The main problem with this product is that it isn&#x27;t as good as others that are less expensive. It does have a vanilla smell when inside the bottle once you apply it on the skin though it smells like wax. It is a bit on the greasy side but I guess if you have dry skin it will be okay I guess. I didn&#x27;t experience any breakouts. I would not buy this again though because the price high for the quality. If the quality was better the price would not be an issue. You can get a cream like this at the store for half the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the benefits of other reviewers, but living in  a dry climate, this is a very good moisturizer without the heavy feel of others I have tried and my sensitive skin has not been a problem. Recommended as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this only a week and got a compliment today that my skin looks amazing! And it was from a guy who never really notices things like that! I would definitely be buying this again! I&#x27;m turning 40 this year so every bit helps. lol</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so I love the fact that this product is all natural. I have only been using this product for about a week but can already tell that my skin is more hydrated. So my wrinkles are less noticeable and my skin appears to be smoother.I&#x27;m sure that with continued use, my skin will get even better.I would like to try more products from this line.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and was so glad I read about it in a review for another product I like.  It is a little heavier but hasn&#x27;t made me breakout.</li>
            <li> Have only used this for 3 weeks but I see no difference in my skin. The lines and wrinkles are still there:(  won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing!  My husband bought this for me yesterday for Christmas (per my request) and after only 2 uses I have actually noticed a difference in the lines around my eyes.  I have bought PLENTY of other creams, some name brand, others not, and they have done nothing!  I will never ever buy another product again.  This one actually works and I&#x27;m in love with it!!  Buy it...you will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> Too heavy for me, not easy to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed and after a few days of use it dried my skin out terribly.I gave it to a friend and it did the same thing to her..I would not reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice, and is nice and thick so it&#x27;s great for really dry skin. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs fairly quickly. The ingredients are all natural, which is great because I don&#x27;t want to use any cream with retinol in it. I give it a four because if I someone really wants an \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; cream they should use something with retinol in it (I just can&#x27;t use retinol right now). However, I could see this product being used in conjunction with a retinol cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Bel Essence product every night for 2 weeks now and am impressed. I like the light texture and it works well with the serum I use beforehand. The serum can be a bit hard on the skin and applying the Bel Essence cream afterwards has a calming and soothing effect. Absorbs nicely despite the oils.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this formula. I&#x27;ve been using the Bel Essence Anti-aging cream for about 3 weeks now and I see a big difference. I use it every night before bed and I am noticing fine lines and wrinkles seem to be diminishing, It makes my face feel so soft too. I really like the fact that it is made with all natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest to say I was leery in purchasing this product because of it&#x27;s size and cost. I was finally persuaded after some research + due to the ratings and comments given. Anyway I received my product less than a week ago and have been using it since. At first sight the product is thick and smells like vanilla, you only need a dab to cover your face and the cream spreads and melts like butter. I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s &amp; started to notice that my under eye wrinkles were getting noticeably deeper. After a week of using this I&#x27;ve noticed there are less creases! I&#x27;ve also noticed that a raised mole that I had on the right side of my face is slowly disappearing after only a week of using this product! I can&#x27;t wait to see what else this product does for me, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> doesnt work - dont waste your money!  used this for a month with no difference.  all i buy now is Wrinkle Rewind and Oxi Genius - i can SEE my wrinkles disappearing!</li>
            <li> Assuming my product (which I just got today) has gone rancid because it smells like month-old milk. Put it on my face without sniffing first and had to wash it back off immediately. Still feel like I&#x27;m going to be sick. Turned off to this product line for good due to poor quality control!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product due to the positive reviews, EXCELLENT face cream, will use it in the evening a little heavy for day wear. When used as a night cream come morning my skin feels hydrated and very soft. If you might be a person with very dry skin I can see this product being used as a day cream as well.  I even use some on the tops of my hands prior to bed . Bel Essence All-NATURAL cream nice product without all the chemicals you only need to use a small amount to go a long way.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;bel essence&#x27; anti-aging treatment is AWESOME.  I live in a desert and have very dry mature skin. This formula is very effective for my needs. I have been looking for something exactly like this.  Goes on smooth and makes my skin feel moist all over..and IT IS moist and supple. It absorbs nicely. I use it day and night. And a little goes a long way. I use it from the top of my face all the way down my neck. even the decolletage area. I have only been using it for a few days and already notice a difference in my skin. The ingredients are a big seller for me as well.  Thank you. I am so happy that I found something that works...FINELY. I will be telling my friends and family about your product...can&#x27;t thank you enough.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many moisturisers and none of them have really worked. They all left a tight feeling on my face until now. This moisturiser is perfect. Nice smell and you only need a little. I don&#x27;t find it to be greasy because the consistency is not runny but firm. I use this day and night. It does not make my foundation slip. Haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkles leaving but my face feels great so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin after using entire jar. Would not buy again</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream for about 2 weeks now and I can honestly say I feel and see a big difference in the level of moisture and softness of my skin.  Especially being that it&#x27;s winter time, my skin has been extremely dry and now I feel like I am armed with the appropriate defense for winter.  Happy I decided to go with this purchase... definitely recommend it for others.</li>
            <li> The most important thing for me that it&#x27;s 100% Natural. Bel essence is a natural skin care, and nowadays it&#x27;s really important. Living in a such a bad environment, we need something like that for our skin. My friend suggested it to me because i had some problems with my skin, and i tried it once and now i keep using all the time. This cream has a lot of natural oils, which helps to keep my skin moisturized and healthy. I love it, and hope you guys try it and see how it orks for you!</li>
            <li> I wish I could say that I look as good as (or better than) I did when I was 20.....but....I do like how this works.  I&#x27;ve noticed diminished wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.  I doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy and I like the fresh scent of it.</li>
            <li> This product has excellent ingredients, your face feels very soft. Keep in mind it&#x27;s  thick so don&#x27;t use to much am looking forward to the firming and tightening of  my skin.  Fingers crossed :}  I hate to come back and do this because the company I purchased through was wonderful and very professional, but as I continued to use it and (I did use to much at first because it wont spread) my face started breaking out with pimples.  I backed off for a few days let my skin rest and then tried again with much less but still the problem occurred. I&#x27;ll never know if it really does tighten and firm, so sad am I. I live in the Northwest It&#x27;s very dry, So now I use as a hand cream .  Wish I didn&#x27;t have to change my rating :{</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I found it by chance looking to place an order for my habitual face cream. I am 40, and I have sensitive skin and I apply on my face only non hypoallegernic products. After I read the reviews for Bel essence and checking its ingredients I decided to give it a try....an voila!!! it has been a month and I think this cream is amazing. The consistency of this cream is different from any other face cream I  applied before. I am applying Bel Essence twice a day and I consider that a small amount is sufficient, in my case it  feels a little greasy at the beginning, but absorbs fast, and when it is absorbed leaves my face with a nice complexion and glow. I think this product really works for what it claims: it is for real a natural anti-wrinkle cream !! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use moisturizers because my skin breaks out way too easily but this one is different. My skin looks great and no break-outs. thank you!</li>
            <li> i have just started using this and so far i&#x27;m loving it alot!!! it makes my face feel very soft.I love the smell and knowing that it contains no harsh or artificial chemicals. I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream only twice. I know it&#x27;s not fair to write a review after a very short time but my experience was amazing. First of all, I have a very wrinkled chin due to the damage by prescription retinol cream that I applied on my washed face and during last 7 years I could not get rid of the dryness and the feeling of dryness no matter how much cream I applied and God knows how many types I tried. Last night I got this cream and applied at night and once this morning, the feeling of dryness was completely gone and I can really tell a difference right away. It seems shiny at first but the shinyness is gone after a few minutes. I know my chin is damaged because I eliminated all the natrural oil by using that awful cream and I&#x27;m hoping by using this cream, I can give back everything that my skin has lost. The problem with lifting creams are that they all have that pulling effect and makes my chin even dryer, so whatever wrinkle cream you are using, use Bel Essence as supplement to moisturize your skin. Nothing works like this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months and I see very good results.  I had minimal wrinkles on my forehead which are completely gone now.  My skin feels tighter especially on my cheeks, and the overall texture is improved now.  My skin tends to be a little &#x27;grainy&#x27; but  this cream makes it feel smooth, even after i wash my face, and it provides a great base for powder. A little goes a long way. I will keep using it.  It is not fragrant, but does not smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the current face lotion I was using was a bit too much for daily use. I wanted something lighter which would still provide excellent moisture. This lotion fits the bill. I&#x27;m deducting one star because I have only used the product for about a month now, so I don&#x27;t know how it will work in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain about the scent, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s not the worst. It smells like vanilla extract to me, like so sweet it turns the nose. It&#x27;s not bad though and it fades pretty fast.</li>
            <li> This product not only lives up to but exceeds the reviews I read when making my skin care selection. Since I have very dry, sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve used quite a few products that were irritating and others that didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize at all and none have really improved any fine lines. So I honestly thought that it would probably be a creme similar to other cremes that I have already used.  I must say that I was surprised that this creme is actually superior in moisturizing ability and seems to smooth fine lines on both my face and neck.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice per day, and really like the way my skin responds! So soft and makes the texture very smooth and even.  I am using it twice per day and keep seeing improvements to my skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way.  This product feels really lovely on the skin and makes it feel softer.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the natural ingredients and I am very happy with it.  My skin looks amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and my skin is soft and looks refreshed.  My routine is washing at night then applying this all over my face, eyes, and neck. it is a bit thick but fairly easy to spread.  After 2 months, I have about half the bottle left so it lasts a good amount of time.  I don&#x27;t think everyone will like the consistency but if you consider the benefits of good healthy ingredients and the impact on your skin, it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> My wife is using this product from last one week and she totally liked this product and she said its really working for her in the great way. She recommends it . Its a worth a try.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a little thick, but works perfectly - and the ingredients are natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a week and see results already, however small. I need to continue to use it for sure.  Nice smell and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Super emollient cream that improved the texture and hydration level of my skin....AND my skin is oily and still prone to clogging at the age of 41.  I have not had any issues, and I&#x27;ve been using it morning and evening for a month. I&#x27;m so pleased that my fine lines have softened and my skin looks healthy enough not to wear powder or foundation. I&#x27;ve been an aesthetician for 15 years. The spa grade,  professional products I work with don&#x27;t even compare to this cream! Will definitely purchase again. I&#x27;m wishing they also made a cleanser</li>
            <li> I think this is a wonderful product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I really like it. First of all, my skin is oily and it is really hard to find something that wouldn&#x27;t cause it to breakout. This is a hit. It didn&#x27;t make me breakout and I am thinking it is working. My skin became smoother, brighter I would say. I can feel that it is refresh in the morning. It almost doesn&#x27;t smell, not heavy and it absorbs very well. Overall I like how it feels on my skin and I will be using it in the future.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has done the trick in helping me fight winter dryness of my skin. It gives a great protective barrier, keeping skin feeling soft and moist most of the day.  The surface of my skin has definitely improved, softening the lines and wrinkles. It will probably be too rich for me once late spring and summer arrives.</li>
            <li> I received this product yesterday and couldn&#x27;t believe how wonderful it felt on my face.  I have dry skin and especially with living in New England where it is very cold, this felt so soothing on my face.  It was absorbed into my skin so quickly and never felt greasy at all.  I am anxious to see how it does around my eyes, but even if the wrinkles don&#x27;t go away, it feels absolutely amazing on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this product.  Please give it a try, it&#x27;s natural and not perfumery. I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Smells good and after trying different products my skin was left extremely dry and this cured it within days. I have only used it for about a week and so far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and so far I really like it. I use it in the morning after washing my face. It goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t greasy. You only need a little bit. Feels great and makes your skin feel nice. I am trying to find products to help with the aging process. I am in my 40&#x27;s and want to slow it down. I like that it is natural and has many beneficial vitamins.</li>
            <li> I will have to use this more and more to determine its full efficacy, but the product definitely helps my skin. I would recommend this to anyone looking into moisture. I&#x27;m going to get another one in order to see more long-term effects.</li>
            <li> I like this because it goes on smooth, smells nice and makes my skin soft to the touch. I have sensitive skin and this is non irritating.</li>
            <li> I really like the smooth texture of the moisturizing lotion on my face.  I started using it in the evening and in the morning.  It&#x27;s too early to see if it will make a difference in the appearance of my fine wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> All of these obviously phony reviews are making me change my mind on ordering it.</li>
            <li> I use this at night, and like it</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the formula of my regular moisturizer changed.  The new formula caused my skin to turn red and also caused a burning sensation.  I have sensitive skin, so I tend to feel apprehensive about trying out new products on my face.  To provide some other helpful background information, I&#x27;ve had to work harder to prevent clogged pores in my 30&#x27;s than ever before.  Whatever the reason, it&#x27;s an issue.  My skin is also on the dry side in the winter and normal in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;I recently found a bentonite clay mask for the pore issue and had clear pores for about 4 weeks before trying this product.  I used a very small amount of this stuff at night for two days and then my pores started clogging up again worse than before!!  Prior to the time I was using the clay mask, my pores were clogged only in the T zone.  After using this cream it was all over my face.  I was hoping that this stuff would work for me, but I can&#x27;t use it.  It will probably take another week before my face goes back to normal.  That&#x27;s about how long it took after I initially started using the clay mask for my pores to clear up.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed because I will have to continue my search for a facial moisturizer that works for me.  Also, I looked at the seller&#x27;s website and I can&#x27;t return this stuff because it&#x27;s been opened.  I have essentially thrown money away just to have my face ruined for about a week and I have a full jar of stuff I can&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product if clogged pores are an issue for you.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a wonderful product to use that I know isn&#x27;t full of harmful chemicals.  I love that this is all-natural!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I had the normal winter dry skin for weeks.  I used it 1 night and woke up to soft supple skin literally over night.</li>
            <li> All natural, smells delicious (Not too strong, like a light vanilla/candy scent), great consistency, didn&#x27;t cause breakouts, great to use at night so all that richness from natural oils can soak in; really seems to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; your skin.</li>
            <li> I like it with no fragrance. It is good moisture for winter. But be careful for the volume you use. If you apply too much, it would get so greasy and thick. So my advice is just use a small amount each time, you would see the results.</li>
            <li> I have purchased literally hundreds of products from Amazon over the years, and this is the first one that I have felt compelled to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this product aside from the results (which I promise you will see,) is the absolutely incredible smell. It&#x27;s the softest, gentlest, most inoffensive vanilla I&#x27;ve ever smelled, and I would wear it as a daily fragrance in a heartbeat. It&#x27;s not sticky-sweet or too gourmand, nor is it too sterile and clean. Just an absolutely lovely gentle soft smell that makes me think of falling into a feather pillow at the end of a long day. The cream has the texture of heavy whipping cream, and is an absolute joy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased it 2 weeks ago, and have since been using it every day to follow AHA/vitamin C serum in the AM and retinol in the PM. I could not gush more about how much my skin has improved in texture, elasticity, evenness of complexion, smoothness, softness, youthfulness...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only 23, but am an engineering student at the most prestigious public university in my country; I sleep maybe 30 hours a week and don&#x27;t have time to take care of myself, so my skin is an absolute nightmare. Not only do I have deep sunken undereye circles and sebacious filaments all over my nose and cheeks, but the sort of undereye wrinkles, laugh lines, facial sagging, and visible undereye veins (!!) that I see in people in their late 30s. Prior to trying this product, I was seriously considering eyelid/undereye surgery after graduation so that I could enjoy at least a few years of youthful beauty before my 30s. I used to be afraid of cameras to the point that I wouldn&#x27;t use face-unlock on my phone because seeing the enormous pores and deep shadows on my face was too depressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have been a poster child for a cautionary tale of what happens to neglected skin in a high-stress lifestyle, but even over just two weeks I have hope that I won&#x27;t have to resort to surgery any longer. I could not gush more about this cream and what it has done for me. I will try to find a picture of how my skin used to look (might be difficult, I avoided cameras out of humiliation) and upload progress pictures. If there&#x27;s any chance I can sway the prematurely aged to give this cream a shot, I feel obligated. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars, absolutely heavenly smell, a treat that I look forward to applying at the end of my skincare routine. Not greasy under makeup, which is excellent if you (like me) prefer liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li> This using this product I can see visible improvement in my face.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for only two nights and can already feel a difference in the dryness and wrinkles in my skin.  This is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for two weeks and I have to say my skin is softer and wrinkles less pronounced than they were.  I am over 70 years old and I have no expectation of looking 30 again, or even 50.  But, I like to play around with new products, especially ones recommended by people I know.  And it can never hurt to look your best.  As they say, &amp;#34;Be all that you can be.&amp;#34;  Oh wait, that&#x27;s the army.&lt;br /&gt;I use this at night and a Neutrogena anti wrinkle product during the day.  This is pretty expensive, but a little bit goes a long way, so I am waiting to see how long this lasts.  Overall, I would recommend this if you can afford it.&lt;br /&gt;Who knows, after a month I may have to come back and change it to a five star rating.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for face and body products that were made with natural ingredients, and did not include parabens. When I saw this product on Amazon and read its ingredients and the reviews, I decided to try it.  It arrived when promised, and I am very pleased with its creaminess and the very small amount you have to use. Just a small dot will massage over your whole face. Since I am a &amp;#34;senior citizen&amp;#34;, I have been using it both morning and night, and believe it is going to be one of my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> I am going to be happy with this. Read another great comment here, so I purchased, and look forward to continued use.</li>
            <li> Ok, this cream has a nice smell and leaves your skin feeling super soft.  I used it day and night for 3 weeks and could not notice any improvement in the wrinkles or dark circles.  The only difference was my skin was softer...</li>
            <li> Okay, I waited. I&#x27;ve been using this for a bit and honestly...... NO. It has made no changes in my skin or even the finest of fine lines. NONE. Definitely NOT worth the money. It does feel nice on your skin. But so does many creams carried in your local markets. Save your money.</li>
            <li> As I am approaching the end of my 40s I decided that I should start using real face cream instead of all-purpose lotions.  I love that this cream is 100% natural and organic, doesn&#x27;t have any toxic ingredients, and has hardly any smell at all.  Definitely not a perfume-y smell as I am extremely sensitive to perfumes.  I have had no breakouts with this which is very important when using it on the sensitive eye area.  I use it nightly and on weekends only as I need something lighter for my foundation to smooth over.  It may seem like a small jar but you use so little it does last.  I&#x27;ve only used maybe 3/8&amp;#34; in the past two months.  I will definitely keep using this, and would love if there was a lighter day-time version.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now.. and I wanted to wait to post a review. (make sure i didn&#x27;t have any negative reaction..) and!! It&#x27;s been SO kind to my skin, making it soft and supple. My skin really drinks this in, feels lightweight and absorbs quickly. A little goes a long way! My mother has also begun using this product and she loves it. I like to use clay masks and african black soap from time to time - after any of those treatments I put this on. Always at night. I also use it on my neck. Has a nice scent. Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and was looking for a high-quality and affordable lotion for my face.  The ratings on this product were very high but it was a no-name-brand and I wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth trying.  I really liked that all the ingredients were natural and the price was reasonable so I ordered it.  My first impression was that it was very rich, richer than even my Intensive Moisturzing Dermalogica lotion (much more expensive) but it was not oily at al despite having 9 different plant oils. it was about two to three weeks of regularly using this product at night that I noticed a true difference in my skin.  Besides being softer and smoother, any break outs seem to be much smaller and go away faster.  Overall, the dryness has just improved so much that I am able to use Sacylic Acid treatments along with this product without embarassing flaking.  I would recommend this product for anyone who has dry skin and/or is looking for something natural and rich to treat their face with at night.  The fact that is it 100% natural is a bonus as you can see and feel the effects of the nourishment.  This is now a product I will always keep in my nighttime drawer, and highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I’ve used many eye creams in the past with mixed results, this is by far is a much better product than the others i have tried. After using this for several weeks, I felt like I did when I was 30&#x27;s. I feel like the deep lines on my face weren&#x27;t really bad, but as I could see in time .I  can see my  wrinkles around my eyes faded so much that i can barely tell they&#x27;re there. I have also seen added benefits using it as a moisturizer keeps my skin looking flawless.It is certainly a product worth giving a try. Once this amount is out I will update some more and come back to buy more.</li>
            <li> I am always interested in trying a new anti aging product but this one I did not like. It was very greasy and did not absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> For months, I applied retinol cream every day and night, which caused some skin irritation. After reading about the natural ingredients in Bel Essence, I decided to try it as a replacement for my nightly retinol. After only one week, my skin looks and feels remarkably healthy, soft, and nourished. For me, the one-two punch of retinol and Bel Essence is the secret sauce to managing facial skin aging.</li>
            <li> This cream actually does what it says. Excellent moisturizer. I am 62 years old have tried expensive and inexpensive products. This one works. Will order it again.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve come across that is 100% natural without any hidden undesirable additives. I love this products as it makes my skin very supple and bright. I&#x27;ve acne prone skin and was concerned when I used it since it is oil based but to my surprise it does not break me out. This is a keeper!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago and have been using it nightly since.  I actually look forward to putting it on because it goes on so smoothly and blends in quickly.  It does make me feel pampered.  My skin is looking better already.</li>
            <li> This really helped my dry skin.  It doesn&#x27;t go on oily and I don&#x27;t need to reapply once I put it on the first time.</li>
            <li> This product took a couple of months before I really noticed a difference. The skin on my face looks so much brighter now.&lt;br /&gt;Above my lip, the skin looks as if it&#x27;s wrinkled to me--this product diminished the look of wrinkles within a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is area on the right side of my face, on my cheek,  almost near my lips, a wrinkle that I feel is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Most likely from being out in the sun too much during the summer, and using tanning salons. I haven&#x27;t found the product working&lt;br /&gt;on this one area as of yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brightness of my skin on my face alone would make me purchase this product. It really makes me look younger than I am.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews for amazon, but for this cream I had to. Somewhat of funny backstory...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend handles all facial/body products that come through my apartment, whereas I&#x27;m the family Amazonian. Before we dated, I had a shampoo that was also a body wash. I had one other product, a Neutrogena face wash. The general motif which I&#x27;m trying to convey is Spartan, less is more. When she came through, things just started appearing everywhere. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash for different days and scenarios, different facial scrubs (some using mud) and all sorts of completely random stuff you would not expect in a 25 year old man&#x27;s apartment. She also gave to me a wrinkle cream for around my eyes. She was like &amp;#34;surprise! I got you this awesome eye wrinkle cream completely out of the blue!&amp;#34; and what she didn&#x27;t say was... hint, hint, you&#x27;re starting to get wrinkles around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was right, I was starting to get wrinkles around my eyes. That was a sad moment of truth, when you start to realize that your body isn&#x27;t that bastion of youth anymore. Anyhow, I&#x27;m using this wrinkle cream for a month and it barely works. Not only that, but it was giving me acne around my eyes. So I decided to use my amazon skills to figure out what to buy. I didn&#x27;t know anything about these companies because I had never used them and quite frankly, I didn&#x27;t really care to know much about them. I typed in Eye wrinkle cream, sorted by average review, and this Bel Essence cream was right at the top. I thought to myself, well 30 dollars is a lot of shekels to pay for a little thing of eye cream..... But after looking through the reviews I was confident it was actually a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So several days later it arrives. I bring it upstairs and my girlfriend immediately scoffs at me. She doesn&#x27;t even look at the thing, she pretty much just tells me I know nothing about these things (fact), and that it&#x27;s probably made in china next to an irradiated land fill (that&#x27;s false people!). I decided in that moment that a gentleman&#x27;s agreement between us would settle it. If this cream doesn&#x27;t work, I will always defer to you first in these matters and never make another purchase of this sort again. What she didn&#x27;t know was that even if I lost, it was still a win for me because if I didn&#x27;t have to buy another facial product again I would be okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the game afoot, and the smug look on her face, I decided that I was going to go balls to the wall and really apply it consistently, two times a day (sometimes three). I was planning on playing the long game here, but I was genuinely surprised. A few days later, I thought the wrinkles were going away. It couldn&#x27;t be, I thought, I just started using this stuff... A week goes by and there&#x27;s definite reduction in wrinkle around my eyes. I&#x27;m currently at a month of using it and the wrinkles around my eyes are all but gone. I wish I could show pictures of the before and after, because it&#x27;s really a huge difference. The girlfriend even made comments about it. It was a brief moment of sweet, sweet victory, even if she did that woman thing where she wouldn&#x27;t concede. Doesn&#x27;t really matter, where this is concerned, I just keep a smile on my face when using it and I know that she know&#x27;s who wears the pants where facial products are concerned ;). In retrospect, I&#x27;m pretty sure she just pulled some inception like moves on me to make me wear the facial cream every day......... &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that aside, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s one of those hidden gems that you find on amazon!land fill (that&#x27;s false people!). I decided in that moment that a gentleman&#x27;s agreement between us would settle it. If this cream doesn&#x27;t work, I will always defer to you first in these matters and never make another purchase of this sort again. What she didn&#x27;t know was that even if I lost, it was still a win for me because if I didn&#x27;t have to buy another facial product again I would be okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the game afoot, and the smug look on her face, I decided that I was going to go balls to the wall and really apply it consistently, two times a day (sometimes three).

It&#x27;s one of those hidden gems that you find on amazon!</li>
            <li> This product was pricey, but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, so time will tell.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell of shea butter, but it does have a wonderful light and smooth texture and only the smallest of dabs is sufficient for my entire face.</li>
            <li> I have used this for less than a week, but already very happy with it. Soaks in beautifully (seems my skin was very ready for this!) &amp; leaves my skin instantly smoother &amp; &amp; softer looking (I felt my skin just looked very dehydrated &amp; tired looking). The result was instant. I am looking forward to long the term benefits! In addition, I did NOT have any breakouts so the richness of the cream is not a concern...only a blessing.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the product and opening it ,the product  seemed too have  separated,is this normal?&lt;br /&gt;when I first used this  cream,seemed very oily to the face,my first thought  was another cream that&#x27;s going&lt;br /&gt;too break my face out.After 3 days of using it i noticed a  bit of a change,my skin is hydrated.has made my pores smaller,&lt;br /&gt;and hoping too see some wrinkle magic!I would recommend this product,and look forward too seeing more results&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Christine Steging</li>
            <li> Reading all the reviews I was looking forward to buying this product because I was desperate for some kind of moisturizer to do the trick for my redness. My skin isn&#x27;t the best and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products, cheap and expensive. This moisturizer actually has the whole package. It is pricey but worth it. The texture is creamy, kind of reminds me of white-chocalate (the smell) and what can I say, I hope they don&#x27;t run out of this!</li>
            <li> While I am a fan of microderm treatments, I hate how they make my face flaky for a few days afterward. I bought this product hoping it would help. IT DOES! It soothes wonderfully right after the treatment and hydrates beautifully in the following days. I have been using it twice a day giving an extra little dab of product on the fine wrinkle lines around my eyes and mouth and I have noticed a big difference. Plus it smells nice. I use it on my neck and chest also. My skin loves me again.&lt;br /&gt;(Tip: I also put a tiny bit on my split-ends at night -- it doesn&#x27;t say it is for hair, but with all those awesome natural oils I figured it would be great for hair.)</li>
            <li> Over the past several years, I have used a variety of creams, everything from CeraVe, recommended by my dermatologist, to La Mer, recommended to me at Neiman Marcus. This cream is simply a cut above everything I&#x27;ve tried. Upon opening the jar, I love the delicate, natural fragrance, but the really delight lies in the rich texture of the cream, which absorbs easily and leaves my skin feeling nourished. Over the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has gained clarity and light, that the typical dryness I struggle with has disappeared, and that my skin simply feels like it is more supple. My friends have also noticed and commented that my skin looks great. As opposed to other creams, I have had no trouble adjusting to this new product: no break outs, no oily residue, no redness or itching. The cream actually feels amazing going on and seems to have been carefully formulated for easy application and absorption. I am now curious to see how my skin continues to improve over the next several weeks as I have begun to use it both in the morning and in the evening. Thank you Bel Essence!</li>
            <li> Just received my first jar of bel essence.  It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and smells wonderful. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it and I especially like the idea that it&#x27;s all natural.  I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers in the past with so-so results.  This product has wonderful reviews so that leads me to believe that I can count on it doing what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I received this product on Saturday (9/28) and have used it every day since then. I love how light this cream is and how my skin drinks it in. I look forward to ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li> I really like how my skin feels after applying this product.  It feels softer and more touchable.  I really like the vanilla smell.  Paired with the grape, its subtle, and different, but clean.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous!!  Smells delicious.  My skin ADORES this stuff</li>
            <li> Shipped and arrived as promised, and packaged protectively.  I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about 2 weeks, but I like it.  It&#x27;s very gentle - no breakouts or other issues.  It is very \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, which makes it a good moisturizer, but I only use it at night for that reason.  My skin seems to be smoother and more radiant.  I will have to use the product longer to see if I notice any difference in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling oily. It works well as an over-night cream. Only a little is required.</li>
            <li> received this just before Christmas and have been using it for about one month.  You don&#x27;t need to put a lot one.  I am almost sixty and always looked younger then my age, but I can tell that my skin is brighter and more even tone and the little bit of wrinkles around the edge of my eyes are less noticeable.  Will order again  and the price is good and with it being 1.5 oz is great for travel.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference on my skin since I started using this product. Is like any other face cream in the market.</li>
            <li> This product causes my face to bubble up with acne and redness. My complexion is normally clear and smooth. Cream was applied onto a clean face, so it was the only thing to cause irritation. Yes my face itches too. Please take caution when purchasing this product.  Avoid it.</li>
            <li> Loved this product it leaves my skin so soft and smooth, great if you want to add back moisture. It&#x27;s for any type of skin. I really recommend to give it a try you will love it. Great product. Love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural skin care products for over a decade to combat the signs of aging. I am in my late 30&#x27;s almost 40 and can easily still pass for late 20&#x27;s-30 year old and often do! I really attribute this to using skin care products and hair care products that are &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and do not harm the environment nor animals. I saw all the reviews and I generally tend to go by, if so many people write shining reviews, the product must be really good?! In this case the reviews are there for a reason, the product is A++. There are many synthetics out there that are similar to this which are in a lot of cases anywhere from 2-5 times as much as this cream in cost! Look at the contents of the product there is nothing harmful in this jar. I am happy to add this onto my regimen as I am sure it will further enhance the look of my skin. I have combination skin, however, do see this working very well for you if your skin is dry, especially if your skin is damaged, also will work for you if you have oily skin, (even oily skin still needs the proper type of fats/oils). Purchase this with product knowing that you are choosing something that is good for you and good all around, also the price point is very attractive!!!</li>
            <li> OH BOY, I tried this product a month ago and WOWEE.  JUST WENT TO reorder and it is out of stock.  I guess it is pretty amazing since it is sold out.  I really love this and it is a little more thick than most creams but it does spread very nicely.  I see after one month my lines above my lips are especially improved and the lines below are much better as I think my C-PAP chin guard is forcing my sagging skin up when sleeping as I wake up with folds that take a few hrs to dissipate.  Can&#x27;t wait til it is back in stock.  I use it with other creams and have not tried the Neutrogena yet.  I apply it alone and more than half the time  with the other creams I have.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich cream. I like to use it once a day - at night. My skin is definitely less dry now that I use this cream.</li>
            <li> I rate it as fair.  it has a nice feel to it but I don&#x27;t see that that it&#x27;s improved my face in any way or eradicated any of my wrinkles.  in fact I seem to be seeing more daily</li>
            <li> I read all reviews of this product, I loved the thought of this being natural, the smell is a funny. But it is too greasy to wear under makeup. So again I can only wear at night. I have not seen any difference in my skin. Not worth the money</li>
            <li> I really love this cream! Wrinkles around my eyes are disappearing quickly! I have acne prone skin and it does not cause break outs.</li>
            <li> I LOVE  this cream!  I&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay for years, but recently felt like I needed a more intense cream for some wrinkles around my eyes and smile lines.  It feels great going on, and after only a few days my skin looks much healthier. I am definitely switching to this cream as my night time cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife and waited about a week to give your company feedback.  I wanted to see if I could help my wife improve her beauty regiment.  After doing loads of research, I finally gave in and purchased this.  I realized within a week&#x27;s time this item DRASTICALLY improves the look of my wife&#x27;s skin. Her face has never been softer and she has never looked better.  For a woman her in thirties she easily looks like she&#x27;s 25.  I can easily recommend this to all my married guy friends.  Who doesn&#x27;t want a more beautiful wife?</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cream for dry to combo skin.  It is very rich and moisturizing without being greasy.  Since using this product my 40-something skin is noticeably more supple and smooth.  Being made of all natural ingredients is a huge plus!  I&#x27;ve only used this for a short time and am very happy with it -- looking forward to the long term results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this product and the fact that it is all natural is an added bonus.  Works great as a moisturizer and makes my skin feel wonderful!  I&#x27;ve noticed great results in the way my skin feels and looks too.  This product is a keeper.</li>
            <li> This stuff is light yet super absorbant. I have combo middle aged skin that still breaks out so while I still need something water based for hydration, this never breaks me out and perfectly moisturizers my dry areas.</li>
            <li> Nice and mosturizing.  Nothing but oil based moisturizers, though.  No noticible difference in wrinkles.  Good for moisturizing.  No breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for an good moisturizer that will not cause my overly sensitive skin to breakout. This cream is more like an emollient - wonderful as you treat your face and neck. You only need a tiny bit (very rich). I have been using this for a few days now and I can already see the difference in my skin!!! Most importantly: the product moisturizes like no other I have tired (and I have tried a lot!); my skin has not broken out (within two days of using a new skin product without fail my face breaks out - 5 days and clearer skin). My skin is glowing!</li>
            <li> Starting to see several wrinkles on my face. Did some online research and found this product. I had used African Shea butter in the past and was happy with it...but this product offers so much more. Love the way it dissolves into my skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It smells great and really made my skin soft.  I have very sensitive skin yet I had no negative effects. It goes on thick so you only need a little bit.  What&#x27;s great is that it doesn&#x27;t disappear the minute you put it on which made me feel as if it was most effective.  It stayed on without a sticky feeling.  My skin felt soft and firmer.  My make up went over it very easily.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and it is definitely a part of my routine.  I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning and at night.  I love it  I am 48 years old and feel my skin feels firmer and looks brighter.  No side effects (breaking out).  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product does a good job at hydrating the skin, especially in colder climates. I recommend only using it at night. My skin feels softer in the mornings. The smell of the cream could be improved though, but I realize it&#x27;s all natural. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.  Smells great.  I feel like I have just left the spa after I use it.  My skin feels more supple after 3 weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait on giving my review until I have used it for a while, and I will say this is by far the best moisturizer I have ever purchased! I have tried so many, and this one has left my skin so silky smooth, firmer, and more youthful than ever! Not oily and only takes a little each night! Love love love</li>
            <li> i received this product a few days ago &amp; im already loving it. i have combo skin with puffy under eyes &amp; small wrinkles. this is already making my skin so soft &amp; hydrated without feeling greasy. even my husband said my face looks brighter &amp; rejuvenated. im going to get some for my husband.</li>
            <li> I have just started using the product but it does make my skin feel smoother.  I have dry skin, especially in the winter.  This product helps a lot.  And it contains no parabens.</li>
            <li> Ok, so here&#x27;s the deal. I have tried many creams and serums for aging skin. I came upon this product through researching other products on Amazon. So many positive reviews are posted, I thought hey, give this one a try!  At this point, which I realize is a very short term trial, I wish I would have researched more before my purchase...... Be it what it may........ the more negative  reviews are posted more towards the last page of the reviews which are currently pages 51-53. Makes one wonder how so much &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; has happened following those review pages. No insinuations or accusations being made. Just pointing out a currently obvious fact. What I can tell you from my one day of use.....my skin does not feel moisturized, I am not being negative, however, I am quite confident this &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; won&#x27;t do a dang thing. My skin feels dry after applying, and I have oily skin. If I am incorrect after giving this an adequate amount of time, then I will, by all means update this post. (Highly doubting this will be necessary.)</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels on my face, but it showed up in gross condition. See photo. Shipping was slow as well.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference when I use this product regularly which makes it stand out from many creams I have used.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after the Olay night cream I&#x27;d been using changed formula and started wrecking my skin. I thought it was working pretty well -- confirmed when a 22 year old assistant at my recent doctor appointment couldn&#x27;t get over how young I looked. (I&#x27;m in my mid thirties.) Congratulations, bel essence, you have a new happy customer. :)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I love the fact that this product is all natural.  I have only been using this product for one week but can already tell that my skin is more hydrated.  My wrinkles are less noticeable and my skin appears to be more smooth.  I&#x27;m sure that with continued use, my skin will get even better.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely-feeling face cream that makes a visible difference in my skin after I&#x27;ve used it. It only takes a little. I like the scent (not perfumy, a little earthy). The texture takes a little getting used to; it is a bit thick out of the jar, but once you start to smooth it on, it spreads evenly and quite nicely. I&#x27;ll be ordering this one again.  UPDATE: I&#x27;ve replaced this 3 or 4 times now, and every time it is completely different! One month is creamy, smooth, thick, smells great. Another month it&#x27;s less thick, more grainy, smells different. I still like it enough to keep buying it--I haven&#x27;t found a good replacement--but it&#x27;s like a crap-shoot wondering what you&#x27;re going to get each month. I wish they&#x27;d settle on a winning formula and stick with it.</li>
            <li> Smell is OKAY - not my fav. Product is nice, my skin looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> I waited until I finished the jar to write this review. I found that this is one of my favorite facial creams. People compliment my facial skin and tone when I wear it and ask, &amp;#34;what do you use on your face&amp;#34;? I like the natural, non-greasy finish it gives my skin and I do believe it has made a difference using it daily as a wrinkle treatment. Now I just need to order more.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this and it has a nice warm scent to it.  It feels like you&#x27;re putting something good on your skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of a chemical burn to my face that happened with another product!  I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d ever get the dry, red, nasty looking spots to go away!  I will never go without this again.  Not sure how I missed this for so many years!</li>
            <li> I gave this product a five star.  It makes the skin feel soft. Applies easily. Isn&#x27;t sticky or oily. I have used for 3 weeks and really  like it.&lt;br /&gt;It was a very fast deliver. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> this is the best face cream. it leaves your face feeling so smooth. i really love it and i will be buying more. try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and it is amazing. So far my face seems smoother and more younger looking. that&#x27;s always a plus!!!&lt;br /&gt; The smell is like vanilla cookies!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling my family and friends about this product.&lt;br /&gt;The best facial product yet.</li>
            <li> My face was super dry every morning.  Even with plenty of moisturizer at night, I always woke up with dry skin.  I was in search for a moisturizer that would keep my face moisturized even in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did a little search in Amazon and came across this product.  With the excellent review and testimonies, I decided to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is just amazing.  It does not stick but it kept my face very moisturized and fresh!  I wake up surprised every morning! I would definitely recommend this product to my friend and family!</li>
            <li> Bel Essence is awesome beyond words. It brightens up the skin and your complexion is much radiant. The skin looks younger and healthier. I noticed a difference it days of using it. My skin tone is even and plumper.  I also use abrasive roller which is outstanding on its on merits.  Amazon has the best products and I&#x27;m hooked on buying great products from Amazon. You will not be disappointed with the purchase. I cannot imagine anyone being dissatisfied with Bel Essence! I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00BD822BI Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment - Intensive Anti Aging, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this product.  I have been using it over a week. my skin feels great already.  I have sensitive skin and my skin usually breaks out when i use products with oils in them. but this is just fantastic.  can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in 6 months.</li>
            <li> I needed a moisturizer to help hydrate my skin after facial masks and I&#x27;m absolutely impressed by how soft and supple my face feels! It absorbs so quickly  and smoothly. If you have dry skin like I do then this is perfect. I&#x27;ll be using it every night this winter!</li>
            <li> I just started using this and have to say that I absolutely love the way it makes my face feel.  My skin feels moist and seeing how I have very dry skin, that is a major improvement!  Definitely will be buying more of this little jewel!</li>
            <li> The bel essence arrived ahead of schedule and very well packed. The product itself was wrapped in bubble wrap and then placed in a bubble wrap-lined envelope. I decided to try it based on positive customer reviews and it certainly is priced well considering some of the anti-aging treatments out there that are really too expensive for me.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say if it helped in the wrinkle department, but it feels great and has a pleasant scent, which makes it easier to use as directed. All and all, a very satisfactory purchase.&lt;br /&gt;L. E. Ward</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on November 13 after reading some excellent reviews.The product was packaged in a manner that protected it from breaking, so it arrived in excellent condition. I have never used this product before, but after using it just one time I realize I will be ordering more! Although many of the ingredients consist of some type of oil, it does not leave your skin feeling greasy at all. I have used it in immediately after treating my face with a microderm abrasion product. This product has high quality ingredients that makes my naturally dry skin feel very hydrated and smooth. I have not had time to determine whether it will work on wrinkles or age spots, but I can tell you it is worth every penny. Thanks again for an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Did not see any noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I really like the fact that it is made with all natural oils.  My client use it twice a day and they love it.  I would definitely recommend to anyone giving this product a try.</li>
            <li> I love this Cream! Its all natural oils so its good for your skin. I&#x27;m 58 and I use it as my nighty routine. I clean my face, then put a thin layer of this on my face and neck. I wait about 15/20 minutes for it to absorb, then apply another thin layer of coconut oil and hyaluronic acid. Adding this cream makes my face so soft and I do believe it will help with the fine lines we are all destined to get. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s pretty nice!  I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks.  It feels just like shea butter going on, very soothing.  As a moisturizer it can&#x27;t be beat.  Of course I know that any anti-aging effects will take a bit more time to manifest themselves so I can&#x27;t speak to that --yet.  I have high hopes that I&#x27;ve finally found a product that will stop the clock from ticking -- or at least slow it down!</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer.  It&#x27;s not the miracle cream that they claim it is but i really didn&#x27;t buy into all the claims anyway.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s not really all natural either.  There are preservatives in there that are not natural at all. This isn&#x27;t a huge problem for me but be warned as they can be irritating for some.&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t too bad but I can smell the preservatives along with some vanilla.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve tried various skin care moisturizers, creams, serums, including natural oils individually, but none seem to work for me.  I am 49 years old and have combination/oily skin, which is beginning to show signs of premature aging.  I was searching for an all natural product, to help improve fine lines as the overall appearance of my skin was starting to look unhealthy.  I had never heard of Bel Essence before, but based on reviews, thought to give it a try in hopes of it working for me.  After using for a few weeks as a night cream, I can truthfully say that this cream delivers! It leaves my skin soft and smooth, fine lines are less noticeable and my skin appears to have improved, it is brighter, more even toned, and it does not leave my skin oily at all.  My 14 year old daughter constantly compliments my skin!  The best part is that it is made of all natural ingredients!  This cream is remarkable!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure as I was using the first jar if this product works but now that I&#x27;ve finished it I realize that it did benefit my skin. I used it at night and it did an excellent job moisturizing and lasted throughout the night. I&#x27;m 59 and am presently (since I&#x27;ve run out) using other products that don&#x27;t keep my skin hydrated until the morning. Some people think the cost is high but you only need a tiny amount and my jar lasted for approximately four months. My only issue is there was a hair entwined in the packaging or within the lid when I received it. That gave me a negative tilt towards the product when I first received it. Others have been given a free jar for their reviews...I have not (I don&#x27;t want one. I just want others to know that I have no reason to give a positive review other than I like the product)</li>
            <li> Love it.  I have combination skin and I love how it feels.</li>
            <li> question?!! i never bought this, but before i buy it....can this cream be used in day time?? does it contain spf???? what about sun damage...if im wearing in the day time??? Anyone can answer me??</li>
            <li> I was all excited to get this product and after using it I started getting ugly (and I mean ugly) white heads.  Once I stopped this product, that went away.  I think it was just too oily for me or something.  Its too bad I can&#x27;t use it :(    If your skin is sensitive to oils or already oily, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month. In my opinion it has a nice fragrance however if I get it too close to my eyes it causes them to burn and water for a moment.  After cleaning my face at night I apply it to my face and neck. It absorbed nicely and I can tell a slight difference in the way my neck looks. I was interested to see if it would make a difference in the look of my aging hands. Out of my own curiosity I applied it to only the top of my left hand for a month in place of my other hand creams. I must admit I can actually tell a difference; my left hand looks a slight bit &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; than my right hand! I plan to keep using the product on my face and neck, as well as both hands now.</li>
            <li> I have bought several jars of this and always loved it; however, in my most recent jar the cream is separated and has pools of oil in it.  It&#x27;s almost the consistency of cottage cheese.  I&#x27;ve stirred it up several times, but it still separates and is just gross in the jar and on my skin.  I now see that the product is not available, which is just as well since I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am 31 &amp; started seeing dramatic changes in my skin over the past 7 yrs. I have tried everything and was convinced I was doomed to have extremely dry, red skin forever. It was actually painful. I was told a few yrs back that i have rosacea and I wasn&#x27;t convinced. I was pretty sure it was just extremely dry, sensitive skin. I started trying all natural products and was still having no success. My skin was not absorbing the products. It got to the point where I was slathering Vitamin E oil that I purchased at the health food store all over my face 2x a day, just trying to relieve the pain of the dryness. After reading hundreds of reviews for numerous products I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot and I am so very glad I did. I noticed a difference immediately! My skin soaked this product right up. For the first time in 7 yrs, my skin has made a dramatic transformation. Within a week, I was actually getting comments at work telling me how beautiful my skin is. My pores have shrunk and the redness of my skin is now a glow rather than an irritation. I have never reviewed a product but I just can&#x27;t say enough about this brand. I wish they came out with more stuff. I use the oil and lotion at least once a day, usually twice. If you have very dry skin, I HIGHLY recommend this line. Definitely my forever products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  When you first put it on, it does feel greasy, but soon it absorbs into your skin, making it feel nice and hydrated in the morning.  It lasts a long time, too, as a little goes a long way.  I can&#x27;t go to sleep without it.</li>
            <li> I received this product about 2 weeks ago.  I use it every morning and every night and I can already see a difference in my skin!!  Some of my fine line wrinkles on my forehead look smaller!  So excited to see what my skin will look like in a few months after using it.  Will totally keep buying this product!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it does anything to my skin or not. I really can&#x27;t tell. It also has a smell of an avocado, and it&#x27;s thick and oily.  It just feel very weird on my face.</li>
            <li> Just about every anti-wrinkle cream review I read on here always linked back to Bel Essence (&amp;#34;xx worked, but it really started working after I paired it with Bel Essence&amp;#34;) so after a few months of trying different creams I decided to try Bel Essence...I REALLLY didn&#x27;t want to like it because of the cost, especially once I got it and realized what a small jar it is, but...holy moly. Just about 2 weeks into using it and my skin is totally different. Glowy, soft, lines are much less noticeable....it is amazing. It might be painful to shell out $35 on a jar to last a month (the jar is REALLY small, I&#x27;m not kidding, and I do apply it both morning and night and to my neck and chest as well) but it&#x27;s cheaper than botox :)</li>
            <li> this cream might be all natural - but it does not have any &amp;#34;special powers&amp;#34; - wrinkles still look like wrinkles. in addition it is kind of greasy like butter. will not buy again.</li>
            <li> So far, after using this for about 3 weeks, I must say that I love it!  My skin seems brighter, tighter and just healthier.  I use it every nite after cleansing my face and I noticed a difference immediately.  I am going to order  a jar for my daughter and my mom as I want to see if they have great results as well.  I have tried many many drugstore brands that worked &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; but never gave me a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin like this did. I rarely write reviews for a product but I do love this and hope that they never change the formula as some companies do, even if it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few creams that does not make my skin break out. It is creamy and pleasant smelling. I am almost finished my jar and I am ordering another one. My skin is soft, smooth and clear for the first time in ages and I love all the natural ingredients. Oils from various sources are excellent and are full of Vit. E etc., great for mature skin, great for any skin.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and many face cream products contain perfume or other irritants which make my skin burn or break out.  Bel Essence is very easy to apply and I have had no skin irritations/other problems since using it.  I am also very comfortable with the ingredients—you do not have to be a chemist to understand what the product contains.  Overall, this is a very good product and is reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> I received my Bel Essence cream very quickly. I am 62 and spend a lot of time in the sun. Have just begun using this product, so don&#x27;t know the complete effects at this time. I will note that it doesn&#x27;t take but just a tiny bit on your fingertips, so do not use too much. It feels a bit greasy when applied, but that seems to lessen as your skin absorbs it. Leaves skin feeling smooth. Have also used it for the backs of my hands(I am a gardener, and am rough on my hands.LOL!) Thanx for the great service! A+</li>
            <li> I purchased this product 3 weeks ago and I just want to say I love it!  I bought Bel Essence from the recommendation of another review. I have very dry skin, and this product seems to absorb better than any I have tried.  Also, I like that it is compatible with any foundation I use.  I have 2-3 different brands of foundations and Bel Essence works with any of them. I can see a difference in my skin. It plumps up the wrinkles so they are not so visible and gives my skin a youthful look. I do not want to run out of Bel Essence........Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am in my upper 30&#x27;s, way upper 30&#x27;s, I bought this cream to help with the fine lines I&#x27;m starting to see form. I researched a lot of products and based on some other reviews I found my way to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a month. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in terms of wrinkles being gone. Why the 5 star review? Because my skin feels and looks great. This cream makes my skin crazy soft. Again I don&#x27;t notice wrinkle reduction, but I do notice softer brighter more evenly toned skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it at night, when I can remember and in the morning. Because it&#x27;s a thicker cream I do have to wait longer until I apply my makeup, as I usually use a mineral based foundation (i.e. Bare Essentials) and it can make my makeup feel heavy. I have started using a tinted sunscreen, bb cream, beauty balm whatever you want to call it and that feels great with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they had an eye cream, I use a separate eye cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 months ago after reading the great reviews, and it was definitely a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are all natural (no weird chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce), it keeps my face pretty hydrated, did not make my sensitive rosacea skin break out, and smells wonderful. Was it as totally life changing as some of the reviews made it out to be? Well, no. But considering the natural ingredients and the fact that it seems to be working well with my skin, it is definitely something I plan to keep using.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it.  The lines around my mouth seem to be lighterI I am 78 years old so this is quite remarkable!  I am complimented often on my complexion.  I normally wear just the two creams and a little blush and I look very nice lol. Expensive but surprisingly long -lasting</li>
            <li> This helps to moisture the skin and it makes my face very soft. Only use a very very little as it is oily.</li>
            <li> Product looks good and texture seems right, time will tell if the product lives up to some of it&#x27;s hype.  What has made me more frustrated was the fact that the container was not full of the product, so much so that I took a photo of it and may send it to the manufacturer.  I will update my review if response is different or if I get great results.</li>
            <li> I use this after my Indian Healing Clay mask and it makes my skin look and feel great!! I have been told I look like I am in my mid 20&#x27;s - I am over 40!!!</li>
            <li> I use to wear Olay anti wrinkle creams but it would irritate my skin around my cheeks.  I am in my late 20&#x27;s I have sensitive skin normal/oily and I was looking for something natural to prevent wrinkles.  I am on my second jar of Bel essence and I have noticed a great difference in my skin it looks fresh, naturally soft, hydrated, no signs of wrinkles, and my pores don&#x27;t look as large as they used to. The texture of the cream is a bit thick but once you massage it on your face your skin will absorb it and it doesn&#x27;t feel thick at all it feels soft, not greasy.  It has a vanilla scent to it which I don&#x27;t mind, the bottle usually lasts me a little over a month.  I recently bought a jar for my mom for Mother&#x27;s day and after a week of using it I have noticed her skin looks smoother.  I love this treatment it&#x27;s the only cream I use for my face, neck, and around my eyes.  They have always arrived by the date indicated from seller.</li>
            <li> I started using this cream a little over a week ago and I already can see my skin looking smoother with a bit of a glow. Also, the verticle lines between my brows seem softened.  I am using it every night before bed, and the smell is quite soothing.  It is a thicker cream, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face like some others do.  I will plan on using it every night and am looking forward to seeing what long term use will do for my skin.  The fabulous list of ingredients along with the smell can&#x27;t help but make me feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  I now live in the middle east and this product has stopped my skin being dried out like it was for the first year of my time here.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I do not have a lot of experience with these types of products so I was a little surprised by the small size when it arrived but other than that it seems like a quality product.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in my skin but I haven&#x27;t been using it too long.  It feels like a good moisturizer and smells good.</li>
            <li> I REALLY love this cream....it is helping already and only used 3 days!!!&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, and my skin already feels so much softer.  I can tell I will be a LONG time customer of this product.  I love the fact it is all natural oils as well...using twice a day right now, but will probably only need once a day in a week or so.  Thanks much for such an AWESOME product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this face cream for a few weeks now.  I have noticed that my skin is already brighter.  I am anxious to see if it will help with some of my wrinkles.  The texture of the cream is a little different from what I am used to but I wouldn&#x27;t not call that a problem.  I like how it hydrates my skin.  At first it seems a little greasy but then it soaks right in.  So far I am very pleased with this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and I must say, my face is a lot smoother and less flakey. I am a Retin A user. Flakey skin appears everyday in the afternoon.  Since using this, I don&#x27;t have the dryness. I also took the advice of another review and started to use Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Lotion.  I use the Bel essence after shower and an hour or more after applying Retin A at night.  I must say, I am seeing results.  I am 52 and if my aunts faces are any indication of what mine will look like (picture railroad track crossing all over face) then this is a miracle product. I feel that shooting poison (Botox) into your face for anything other than medical purposes will be damaging down the road.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers, anti-aging creams etc over the years. This is the best I&#x27;ve ever found. I use it every day and I can see a clear difference in the crow&#x27;s feet at my eyes.  They&#x27;re still there but are much less noticeable.  The cream is easy to smooth on your face and goes a long way.  Really like the smell.  I wear it under my make-up and there is no issue with greasiness. I just wish I had found your product twenty years ago. Thanks for the great quality!&lt;br /&gt;Wayne&#x27;s Wife</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Not heavy and sticky. Nice smell. Have seem  a difference in my fine lines and has made my neck much smoother. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Bel Essence. I can tell it is natural and it actually has a fragrent that reminds me of avacado. it is thick but my skin absorbes it quickly.  I like and would get it again.</li>
            <li> This Bel Essence cream smells great and glides on smoothly.  I have only used it for a couple of weeks but love it so far.  It has not caused any breakouts.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a night cream that would surely show results and this product is great. I would recommend it to anyone and the seller is great to deal with.</li>
            <li> I always read reviews prior to buying skin-care products but oddly, all of the reviews were on amazon.  I cannot find &#x27;bel essence&#x27; in stores and the label looks a bit home-made.  That said, there were a ton of positive reviews through amazon and some customers said they use it after rolling their skin with a dermaroller (I bought one too) so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 30s and don&#x27;t have much in the way of wrinkles but I&#x27;m sure to put lotion or cream on my face every night and each morning because I don&#x27;t WANT wrinkles.  I do have a few on my forehead from raising my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this cream at night and it is extremely thick.  A little goes a long way (which is fantastic) and it smells really nice -- kind of &#x27;nutty&#x27;.  If you look at the ingredients you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s all natural which is also nice (paraben free).  I wanted to wait a little while before writing a review and I never know if some results are psychosomatic which is why I didn&#x27;t want to review the cream right away.  Although it feels great and doesn&#x27;t absorb right away -- which for me is a positive -- I&#x27;m not sure if I can tell if there&#x27;s a difference.  My husband says my skin looks great and I certainly haven&#x27;t had any type of negative reaction which is why I&#x27;m giving this five stars.  My skin FEELS great after using it and I had no problems using it right after the dermaroller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically don&#x27;t have bad reactions to lotions except on my hands.  I&#x27;m not sure what causes it - my dermatologist doesn&#x27;t know - but quite a lot of creams and lotions react strongly with my hands which is why I&#x27;ll occasionally try face products on them, just to see if I have a reaction.  Believe it or not, my hands can tolerate Bel Essence so I&#x27;ll even use it on my knuckles and on the back of my hands before bed since I can trust it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little expensive but it&#x27;s worth trying.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it and if I do notice any change, I&#x27;ll update my review.  I&#x27;m wearing it now.  I smell great.  :)I smell great.  :)</li>
            <li> I am 34 years old and have normal to dry skin that is more dry than normal in the cold parched winters here in Chicago. I have been looking for a moisturizer that would keep my skin soft and smooth without clogging my pores or being overly greasy. I was a little hesitant at first with this product because it felt so thick and rich to the touch but it&#x27;s not greasy and it soaks right in to my skin.  I had such great results with using it on my face at night that I quickly started using it on my neck and hands at night and in the morning.  I have been using this cream for a couple of months now and my skin has never been so clear and smooth. Although this product is a little pricey, a little goes a long way.  I will continue using it and see how the summer goes.  I&#x27;ll have to see if there&#x27;s an option that has an spf rating or that contains zinc or something similar that isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li> Of course, I expected miracles but there is no way anything could help my wrinkles.  After using Bel Essence twice a day for a month I am happy to say my skin is 100% softer and the wrinkles have smoothed out a bit....enough to make me love this product!  I am 70yrs old and have never used sunscreen so one can imagine how wrinkled my face is; now, it is much &amp;#34;smoother&amp;#34; (no, the wrinkles are not gone...) but I plan to continue using this cream as I feel it has helped me tremendously.  I only wish I had this 50yrs ago!!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your face is clean when you apply it and take a minute or so to gently rub it in and you will notice a difference within a week!</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few months I have to say I really do like it.  I find the consistency to be moisturizing but not too greasy although it is on the oily side since it does have avocado oil as the second ingredient.  My skin is dry and I like this fact.  I see a difference in my 40 year old skin too.  I&#x27;ve been using it with the ROC wrinkle cream like some suggested and I see an improvement in the fine lines around my eyes.  I would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Lovely cream...I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for face and neck. A little goes a long way and spreads smoothly. Have been using for about a month morning and night and I can notice an improvement in skin softness. I also use a little on my hair after blow drying and it helps with dry ends.</li>
            <li> No miracles in this jar. It&#x27;s thick and so I&#x27;m guessing it clogged by pores and caused an acne outbreak. I had to discontinue use. It doesn&#x27;t smell good and if I get it near the eye area it burns and causes excessive tearing</li>
            <li> I bought this product last November and I have just now ran out. I used it at least once a day and sometimes twice. It really last a long time.  I have dry, tired, aging skin at 60 years old and I really think it works wonderful and is not greasy. It works well under make up after waiting a few minutes. I also use my argon oil first. I love it because my skin does look better.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the first time I found something that I used until gone. I&#x27;m a ginger and have very sensitive skin. That being said, I get a lot of redness and little bumps with a lot of products. This seemed to calm my skin and I never broke out. My bumps are gone completely. Other great thing...as others have said, this cream goes a long way and has lasted me for months!</li>
            <li> I have started using this product just about two weeks and I like it. This is the only anti aging cream that didn&#x27;t break me out. It&#x27;s kind of early to announce it as a best cream. But I definitely like it.</li>
            <li> JUST OK, NOT GOOD RESULTS.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I have been using for a month and can see the difference.  The fine lines around my mouth are not as noticeable.  Will definitely continue using product.</li>
            <li> I am working on my 58 and a half year old face and neck. My skin is dry but my face has very few wrinkles. My neck, however, has 2 horizontal creases which have been there all my life without being unsightly, but when I hit my 50s, my extra weight also accumulated in my neck (oh joy!) and caused those 2 faint horizontal lines to become deep creases! I also have developed fine, vertical wrinkles right in front of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I discovered that a combo of StriVectin neck firming and tightening cream and ReFine Therapeutic Skin Serum have been working together to decrease the depth of the 2 horizontal creases. However, they were doing nothing for the fine vertical wrinkles on my neck. After research, I discovered Bel Essence Anti-wrinkle Treatment and I love that it is ALL-NATURAL! It is very creamy--a little goes a long way--and it moisturizes my dry skin better than the Loreal products I was using. The fine lines are still there, but are decreasing after about 8 weeks. Although this product is a bit more expensive than what I can get at the store, I am glad for the natural ingredients and the moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together with the other two products, my skin is being helped by Bel Essence. This moisturizer is now my go-to moisturizer. I am pleased with this product and recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using your product since I received it a week ago, and must tell you how impressed I am with it. I am 64 years old and always looking for that miracle jar without the benefit of surgery and may have just found it!! I have noticed a difference in my skin, and just checked to see what other products you offer, and I will be ordering the serum as soon as I finish this note. Thank you for producing a natural and affordable alternative to surgery, you have gained a loyal customer!!</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and really do not have any wrinkles just fine lines under my eyes.  This cream seems to soften those lines and make them less noticeable.  I love the smell and the texture of the cream.  A little goes a long way.  It is nutrition for your skin!  I would buy this cream again.</li>
            <li> This cream feels very light and absorbs quickly to leave my skin feeling very soft, but not greasy as I&#x27;d feared.  In fact, my skin feels better than the &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; product that I was using.  I use this every morning and every other night (alternating with Renova) and my skin has lost that dry, scaly appearance that Renova can produce.  I also appreciate that the cream has very little fragrance which is not at all noticeable once applied.  I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my mom, she&#x27;s tried different creams for the past few years but she&#x27;s never been excited enough about the results, after researching I felt that this would be the best cream for her as it has natural ingredients and so many people rave about what it&#x27;s done for their skin. It&#x27;s an excellent price and fast shipping supplements actually got it shipped to me a day before it was supposed to arrive. They have excellent customer service and really seem to strive to make you happy. I will definitely be ordering from them again</li>
            <li> I very much like the Bel Essence All Natural Anti Wrinkle Treatment and will&lt;br /&gt;order again. I have been using it for about a month nightly and daily under&lt;br /&gt;makeup. I have very sensitive skin and this has not irritated it at all. I&lt;br /&gt;actually am having less break outs than before. Not sure if that is due to this&lt;br /&gt;product or not. I also started using tea tree soap to clean my face and apple&lt;br /&gt;cider vinegar to tone. This combination has worked well for my aging / problem&lt;br /&gt;skin. I love how the Bel Essence smells as well as how it feels on my face. My&lt;br /&gt;face is so soft in the morning after using this at night. Overall, I am pleased&lt;br /&gt;with this cream and am happy to have found a natural product that not only seems&lt;br /&gt;to work, but doesn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> Read other reviews and decided to try this.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth product I have tried this winter to control the dry skin on my face. This is the only one that worked! My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight anymore and it smells so good! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> I like this but I cannot definitively say whether it has had any impact on my little forehead lines.  I don&#x27;t have full on wrinkles yet.  What I do like about it is that it is very hydrating as I tend to have dry skin.  It isn&#x27;t greasy at all and it is absorbed quickly.  The scent is nice as well.</li>
            <li> Following suggestions of Amazon commentators, I did email the Bel Essence company and explain how my 2nd jar had &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; in it. To my surprise, within 2 hours on a Saturday afternoon (non-business hours, I assumed), a representative of the company emailed me to say she was sorry I had such an experience, she was unaware of anyone else having such a problem, and she was personally sending me a free replacement jar that afternoon. (She also said not to return the jar I had at home.).  The product arrived a few days later, and it is completely free of any &amp;#34;grit.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product since it&#x27;s been such a good moisturizer for sensitive skin, really making my skin look healthy, firm, and glowing without feeling greasy (something I get with Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Wrinkle cream.).. It doesn&#x27;t take away wrinkles, but it does soften the look.&lt;br /&gt;I have to give the company a lot of credit for standing by their product, for believing me, and for acting so promptly. I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Just received this jar on fast transaction.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was good but the cream was oozing out of the jar, so the cream was messy on top cover and the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Have not try it .</li>
            <li> Feels OK, still haven&#x27;t decided wheather it works.</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s making even more wrinkles. I used it twice daily for 2 months and I swear my eye wrinkles are getting worse!</li>
            <li> My skin felt greasy and I did not see a huge difference in my skin appearance. I wood recommend for night cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long before I should see results, but, it goes on smooth and so far has not irritated my skin--I have sensitive skin. So, that&#x27;s a PLUS.  However, when my eyes tear, the product stings my eyes if it gets in them so I am careful about that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of anti-aging creams and usually most of them do not work for me. I waited to use this product for two weeks before giving it a review. I like it. I live in a very dry climate and need the extra moisture that comes with a cream like this. It is a bit heavy, but at night its perfect. I usually use Astara, but I&#x27;m gonna give this a chance. It seems to be working here and there. My eye lids seem to be firmer. I bought this because it is natural, and the price was right to try it. I&#x27;ll repost after the jar is gone. So far so good ...</li>
            <li> Very good product , my girlfriend use it before she go to bed , she is happy , I am happy ,thank you for the good product !</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  I use this during the day &amp; the oil at night.  My skin feels fantastic &amp; looks more radiant!  I love that this is all natural so I don&#x27;t have to worry about harmful chemicals.  I will be buying more of this cream and the oil.  I also use this on my neck/ décolletage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 and my skin gets a lot of weather and sun exposure I wanted to find something that could help combat so far I&#x27;m pleased with this product and plan to continue its use</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of weeks now, it feels good and smells good. I like how it feels soft, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> From day 1 you can tell the product is working, not visually but I felt my skin appreciate it! After using it for a week twice a day my skin looks much better. I&#x27;ll be using this for long time because its not harsh and no side effect at all. I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> This product is great:) Even thought I have oily skin and am prone to breakouts this product doesn&#x27;t cause any, although it has oils in it. It must be the right combo for me since now I am 36, still break out and have started to develop wrinkles, I put it on at night and it seems to be clearing the breakouts and smoothing the wrinkles too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I knew about this product years ago but am happy to have found it! :) It takes a couple of weeks to see the results so be patient. I found that after I exfoliate nightly (gently), then apply the RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream and wait an hour, then apply the Bel-Essence liberally it made such a difference! My wrinkles in my smile lines from my cheeks have reduced by about 70 percent and I&#x27;m on week 3. Fantastic product :)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, with a light vanilla scent. My makeup goes on smoothly over it without any dry look, that can make you look older. The moisturizing lasts all day, without wearing off halfway through the day like with my previous moisturizers. Seems to turn back the clock a bit, always a good thing:)</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!, great for this winter!! However, it is a little bit oily. So, use only once before going to bed. You will love this product:))</li>
            <li> It is a good cream.. No miracle in a jar.. No change in wrinkles (fine lines)  But, it is still a good cream..</li>
            <li> Creamy texture and goes on skin beautifully! I love this product! and I THINK it&#x27;s improving my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. I have been using it for about a month and can tell a big difference in the feel of my skin, how fine lines seemed to disappear, and my face looks fresher. Will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just about finished my first jar of Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment, and am happy to write a review for this product.  I am very happy with it, and here&#x27;s why.  I use it as my day-cream.  I love the texture – not too greasy but not too light either.  I love the smell as well.  Perfect alone or under make-up, and sometimes I add a little foundation to it for a smoother appearance.  I love that it&#x27;s all natural, and I can use it guilt and concern-free.  The jar has lasted almost 5 months, so it&#x27;s also a great value.  I can&#x27;t say one way or another whether it&#x27;s had any effect on my wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve tried so many wrinkle products with and without chemicals that I&#x27;m happy just to have found one that feels good, smells good and makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li> So far so good, but what really amazed me about this company was that my jar arrived with a cracked lid. I wrote to the company and was ready to send photos of the lid, my biggest fear was that it would dry out. They immediately took action and fixed the issue, so refreshing in today&#x27;s world where no one seems to have decent customer support. For that reason alone I will be buying more of this product, plus it seems to be helping my skin to be smoother and more even toned.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product! Happy with a natural/organic product.Good quantity, pleasant vanilla scent, velvety feel, quick absorbing. Will let you know how it&#x27;s anti aging properties work in 5 or 10 years!</li>
            <li> I love this face cream!! the ingredients all make sence, the product works, my skin looks and feels great! I use it with my derma roller and my fine lines are gone. I will keep using this product for sure,</li>
            <li> I received the cream about a week or so ago and I have definitely noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes.  I believe that the Bel Essence is fantastic!!  My face is very soft and the small wrinkles I had and the fine lines are much less noticeable.  I LOVE IT!!  Will definitely be keeping this stocked for my beauty routine!</li>
            <li> Love the very mild smell it has (slightly vanilla-ish).  Leaves my skin super soft the next day.  Just as a warning, it is a bit on the oily side, but since I&#x27;m wearing it at night I don&#x27;t mind at all.  Using it every other day it has lasted me over a year.  On my second jar now.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not really knowing much about it. I have been using it since December 20 and I can honestly say that I am noticing a difference already. My skin is feeling a lot smoother and right at the corners of my eyes, really smooth reducing the appearance of wrinkles. I am really enjoying using this product, specially since it&#x27;s all natural.  I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for three weeks but my skin is soft. I really notice the difference.  It is not greasy and only a little is all you need.  I am 75 yrs old and love the product.  I even think the dark spots are starting to fade. Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after using it for several more weeks. Very good product so far.</li>
            <li> Day 1, 12/17/14 - I just wanted to say thank you for the excellent product!  I just tried it for the first time today and I want to say it smells very good.  Also it does not feel heavy on the skin.  After applying I can already see a difference and this is the 1st day.  I can imagine over time it will have much better results by seeing others feedback.  The shipping was super fast too I am a very happy customer and will be happy to do future business.  If the product continues to impress, I will refer my friends to give you more business.    Here is an update 1/23/14.  I have been using the product for over a month now and it is excellent.  I have very sensitive skin and pale completion so normally when I use any face products I break out.  With this product, no breakouts and it has been more then a month using it daily one time before bed one time in the morning after a shower.  I have wrinkles around my eye area and  on my forehead when I smile, but after using the product they are hardly noticeable.  I have tried many products in the past including the Neutrogena (new and old) \\&quot;wrinkle repair\\&quot; product line and they work ok but didn&#x27;t help wrinkles.  I was at work one day and some cougar was like \\&quot;you have perfect skin\\&quot; I was like WTF?  I have never had a customer compliment my skin in my life and she was going on about it I was embarrassed.  I use this product after washing my face with [...] and A+ great results.  Thank you for  a good quality product!</li>
            <li> goes into your skin very well.  nice and creamy.  maybe a few lines are less, but the big benefit is&lt;br /&gt;how it makes your face feel.</li>
            <li> I really like this face/neck lotion. It is my current favorite</li>
            <li> I like this cream. It has a vanilla smell to it which I find is pleasant. I am a Retin A user which causes my skin to get drier (especially during the colder weather months). I feel this cream is very moisturizing. It is just starting to get warm where I live so I don&#x27;t know how much I will use it during the day under makeup as it gets humid here. I may have to hold back and use it when it is cooler or just at night. It works well with my Retin A. I have had no adverse effects from it. I am happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> it really does do what it says. my skin is flawed and i have seen some fine lines (im 28) but since using this I am a believer. It is a quality product. it is not greasy and a little goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw if i may suggest doing an activated charcoal face mask to draw out impurities and follow up with this cream, your face will thank you for it. Or a honey and egg mask.....  Oooooo you have no idea what that will do for your lovely face! Try it! Thank me later.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t been using the product long (about a month), the first application went on smoothly and was glad it didn&#x27;t have a strong odor. I appreciate the fact that this moisturizer was made with all natural ingredients. I spent about an hour doing research, trying to find an aging treatment with natural ingredients, but finding natural products was difficult. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. :)</li>
            <li> This all-natural silky skin treatment has just a faint vanilla scent. My skin feels like velvet when I use it!</li>
            <li> Wow! First of all, i recieved this product much quicker than it said I would. When I opened the jar, it smelled great! Like vanilla extract! Then it smoothed on my face so easily and not greasy. It feels like my face is just sucking up the moisture!! It&#x27;s winter now, so I need all the moisture I can get! This is a very gentle cream that really moisturizes.Great product, must try!!</li>
            <li> Nice cream. Works as well as any cream that is $150.+ Well worth the inexpensive price. About time a company didn&#x27;t make consumers pay high dollar for a namethe cost- but don&#x27;t let the  $150</li>
            <li> It works. I&#x27;m 65+ and blessed with that great olive completion and Italian skin that belies age. This cream visibly reduces uneven tones, makes pores look smaller and lets you wake up to baby-soft skin. I think it&#x27;s a fantastic buy and will definitely re-order.</li>
            <li> I just love this I don&#x27;t know if it is preventing wrinkles, but I like it as my final moisturizing cream in the evening. I like the smell of it also, it smells like vanilla to me</li>
            <li> I have just received my Bel Essence sadly to discover that it is not all natural. I should have read the ingredients. I was just so excited reading all the positive reviews and the stating of it being \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; - dumb me..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the product contains Phenoxyethanol, which can be very irritating to the skin and is proven toxic if the content is more than 1% of the product. It is hard to determine what percentage that is used in this product. Ingredients are listed in descending order and it is listed as the second to last ingredient. However, it also depends on how much you use the product to go over that 1% safe point. It&#x27;s scary because Phenoxyethanol has been banned in the use of cosmetics in many countries because of its risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When parabens became a hot topic, cosmetic industries scrambled to find an alternative, Phenoxyethanol became the quick-fix, but there are far better and safer preservatives out there. This product also uses Caprylyl Glycol as a preservative which has no toxicity level, which is GREAT! However, I wish this formula would be changed to utilize Potassium Sorbate w/citric acid combined with the Caprylyl Glycol, or by using Naticide or Leucidal as the only preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will give it a try and use it minimally as that is the safest route! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I find that it works and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation or dryness, that will be one very good indicator of it not being a high percentage of Phenoxyethanol, and I will come back and change my review.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old, and I recently had skin cancer surgery two places on my face. I ordered bel essence while my face was healing.  I began using the cream on the left non-surgery side as the scars healed at nighttime.  I really could tell that the wrinkles on that side of my face were getting smaller and smaller.  I am now using it on the right side and I really look younger.  It makes my face feel hydrated.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand good reviews. This cream is very greasy, does not soak in. I personally cannot use it, end up washing face after use.</li>
            <li> I was concerned it would have a greasy feel as I have acne prone skin, but it really just melts into your skin and leaves it feeling very soft and supple.  I use it every night (and a little goes a long way).  I have been using the same jar for several months now.  I sometimes use it during the daytime too without any issues with it being too greasy.  It has a very, nice, light vanilla scent too.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream!!  Normally I just purchase whatever is on sale, but I&#x27;m sticking with this cream.  The cream has been able to balance out my combination skin like nothing else I have tried before, and my skin seems to be breaking out less.  I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Not as thought! I went back to my basic routine with my Philosophy face wash and night and day moisture cream.</li>
            <li> After a Fraxel procedure, my skin became extremely sensitive and highly prone to acne. I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands of cream that ranges from $100+ - $15, and they all clog pores and cause serious breakouts on my poor face. So I did what everyone else did: trying to find a nice, natural anti-aging cream that works on Amazon. I ended up purchasing a jar of Bell Essence because of all the positive reviews there was. I have finished the entire jar and now I am ready to give my 2 cents worth about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the texture of it; it was creamy enough and it did have a thin layer of oil on top of the cream when it arrived. I started by cautiously putting very little amount on my cheeks -- the driest area of my face and skipped the entire T-zone, which worked out great. I didn&#x27;t wake up with shiny/oily face and no breakouts! I then slowly and cautiously applied it to my face by just lightly dipping my fingertip into the jar and the dab on my cheeks, under eye, eyelids, forehead. I skipped my nose and chin area throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: It didn&#x27;t clog my pore or cause any breakout. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing either. It&#x27;s creamy and moisturizing when I applied it to my face, but it seemed to only stay moisturized for few hours. I pretty much woke up to a fairly dry skin every morning. I tried put a little more on but still waking up to a pretty dry face. It also didn&#x27;t do much as far as reducing the fine lines near and under my eyes. I am kind of on the fence about getting it again. It does give that immediate moisturizing/hydration to my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t last overnight. Its biggest plus is that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores at all and it doesn&#x27;t give me any bad breakout.</li>
            <li> With treatment cream, I always feels it takes awhile to see results. So, I&#x27;m still in that process.  It does feel great and makes your face supple &amp; hydrated with the first appplication.  It has a very mild vanilla scent to it. What I like particullary is that my face feels as good in the morning than at night.  Of course, the biggest attraction - was natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product... not greasy at all and I have extremely sensitive skin. I break out with everything so I was super skeptical to use it but hasn&#x27;t broken my skin out once and leaves me feeling very moisturized. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results to my dark circles but my skin does feel so much better using it.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product are beautiful.  It is rare that you see natural, quality ingredients so high up on the list for a beauty product. The cream is a little rich for my face for use daily.  But it is wonderful to use after a weekly peel as it is very soothing.  I do use it on my neck nightly and it makes the skin very soft and supple.  I highly recommend this product for those with dry or over-processed skin.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing for extremely sensitive skin. I have adult acne that I must manage carefully by not using products with certain chemicals in them. Even ones that claimed to only have natural oils have caused severe breakouts. This moisturizer is unlike any I&#x27;ve every used. It&#x27;s incredibly soothing and absorbs without any oily residue. A small pea-size amount twice a day is all that&#x27;s needed for me. I can already tell after nearly one entire jar that my skin has vastly improved. Throughout the day I no longer get get a sheen of oil on my forehead as my skin is getting the proper moisture it needs. The absolute best effect is of course that it has caused zero breakouts. Because my skin is finally balanced after all these years, I even have less breakouts. I will be buying this product for the rest of my life. If it ever gets discontinued... well, I don&#x27;t even want to think about that. After 25 years of trying different moisturizers, this is finally the one. Anti-wrinkle is just a bonus.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful! I use it along with Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair and the two together are doing wonders! I had just used the Neutrogena and ever since I started using this with it I have seen more results. Love it!</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick.  Doesn&#x27;t smell all that good but it does make my face feel great.  I like it.  Don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> I like this cream, but it is very rich and I broke out from it a little.  Might be better for a drier skin type.</li>
            <li> After just one use, I can tell that I will LOve this product.  It felt a bit thick going on but it melts into your skin....left my skin super soft....I have fairly deep lines on my upper lip that bother me and even Renova has not diminished...  after close inspection this morning, there was an obvious \\&quot;plumping\\&quot;....I can&#x27;t wait to see what results are possible with continued use.  Definitely think this is a NIGHT cream....too rich for under make-up.  Thanks for a great product bel essense....may be my new favorite!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long but so far I absolutely love it! It leaves my skin hydrated, refreshed and flawless. Give it a few minutes to fully soak in...you won&#x27;t be disappoonted!!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product a few days ago and can already see increased brightness and suppleness in my skin.  My main concern is to target a few fine lines around my eyes.  They appear to be slightly faded already but I am looking forward to seeing the results after a month!  I am also pleasantly surprised to find out that some of the oils such as Almond oil contains high amounts of Vitamins E and D, magnesium, and calcium help with dark circles and baby soft skin!  All of these nutrients are beneficial. It is similar in composition to the oil babies excrete to keep their skin healthy, so it is a natural alternative to baby oil. It moisturizes and nourishes the skin, helps your skin retain or restore its glow, and lightens dark circles under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt; I am going to use this in combination with the anti-aging treatment oil as well to see if I can obtain faster results!  Wish Bel Essence made more products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Shauna</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a skin care product that would not only provide an anti-wrinkle treatment but would also not pollute my skin with toxic ingredients. After a long search, I narrowed it down to two products and decided to give this one a try first. The first night I used it, I woke with softer, moister skin than usual. I have used it every night since. It&#x27;s a winner in my book -- and I write books!  I don&#x27;t know whether it does indeed remove wrinkles, but then I&#x27;ve never found any product that actually removed them anyway. I&#x27;m satisfied with what it does do -- moisturize without toxins.</li>
            <li> I just received and starting using Bel Essence.  It was recommended from another product review, and I was looking for a better moisturizer.  The minute I used it, my skin felt smoother and softer.  Like another reviewer indicated, you don&#x27;t need very much to make a difference.  I am looking forward to more results with longer usage, but really like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be sensitive to new products so love the fact that this product is all natural and hasn&#x27;t had a negative reaction to it. My skin feels softer and smoother.  Thank you for the lovely product!</li>
            <li> After using this cream for only a few times, my face already feels softer, more supple, and my lines aren&#x27;t quite as visible as before.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very smooth cream, not a bit oily, and seems to glide over my face. I only had to use a very small amount each time to cover my entire face. Hopefully, I&#x27;ll continue to see improvements.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin.  I&#x27;ll see how it is doing after I have used it a little longer.</li>
            <li> Very greasy.  You can&#x27;t wear this stuff during the day unless you want to walk around with a shiny face.</li>
            <li> enjoying this cream as it is not oily and goes into the skin. I can wear it during the day and not have oil issues. Very nice product</li>
            <li> Full disclosure...the seller offered free product if I reviewed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timely shipping.  Product is &#x27;thick and rich&#x27; if that is the type of cream you are looking for...I was.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this cream, makes my face feel so soft.  A little goes a long way, you really only need a small amount. It will keep your complexion hydrated and keep the texture soft and smooth.  I feel like I have become younger looking in just a short time of using the product.  It does not feel greasy like other products I have tried, very happy I purchased this cream.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with both the product and the seller! My jar of &amp;#34;bel essence&amp;#34; arrived before scheduled and an email to the seller with a few questions was answered almost as soon as I had written it. Excellent service and having tried the product for a few weeks at my sister&#x27;s house and loving it, I decided to try a jar of my own, at the excellent price offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 50&#x27;s and I have used countless facial creams over the years,  I found most of the so-called &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; formulas were lacking. I have very sensitive skin, this has been a joy to use twice a day. I live in a VERY dry climate, I moved to Las Vegas. Nevada a few months ago and I really needed to find a product that genuinely moisturizes the skin, as well as one that I can use during the day as well as before bed. Bel Essence has been that product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even in a few week&#x27;s time, it has definitely made my face look and feel MUCH better than it has in years. I highly recommend this product and the seller and you can be sure that after I have used &amp;#34;Bel Essence&amp;#34; for about a month I will report back! I am sure the feedback will be just as wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely leave feedback on products I buy from Amazon, but in the search for a really excellent facial cream that seems to diminish lines and even wrinkles, it seemed important to share my opinion of this product with everyone!</li>
            <li> I just received this order and quickly used the product. My skin is so soft after just one application. I was advised on Amazon to use this with ROC night repair and can&#x27;t wait to use it to prevent the dry skin that occurs with ROC!</li>
            <li> I have been using Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment for several months now.  Never have been one to use facial creams or even make up.  Now that I&#x27;m 66 I find my face is lacking its natural oils.  I use this product each morning.  You need very little.  It is light on the face, not heavy, greasy, or oily feeling.  My skin looks and feels clear and healthy.  Fine lines are less noticeable.  I use this with their natural oil treatment at night.  Has made a HUGE difference.  Yes, a little pricey.  However, because a small amount goes a l-o-n-g way, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff barely comes out of the jar and when I applied it, my throat immediately started to swell up. Highly allergic to it and returned it.</li>
            <li> I Love This! I am using with the bel-essence oil treatment and they make my skin feel amazing.  I have used them for about 2 weeks and they have not made my skin breakout.  I wish there were more products for me to try.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 months and am very pleased.  It is definitely a thicker type cream than alternate products I have tried but it does absorb easily.  I was most interested in the organic ingredients especially since there are so many items on the market that have a laundry list of stuff in them that customers have no idea what it means, much less if it is safe.&lt;br /&gt;At 62, my skin is considered combination of normal and oily.  Most of the creams I have used may feel good when applying but after a couple of days, I break out.  Wrinkles and acne aren&#x27;t fun at all.  With Bel Essence my skin feels soft and fewer oily issues than other creams for mature skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was also concerned about reducing noticeable pores in the T zone area of my face.  I have definitely seen an improvement.  I will use this product again.</li>
            <li> I like this cream for the most part, it feels good when I put it on and it smells good. I&#x27;m not sure if it is helping with the wrinkles but I will keep using it</li>
            <li> I received this item just a couple of days ago so I haven&#x27;t really put it through a thorough test but I really like this so far.I have used many many different face creams. So far I am ready to rid myself of all of them and move forward with this one. It smells awesome. It goes on so smooth. I have been using it at night. When I wake up in the morning I just rinse my face. I can feel the difference in the way my skin feels. My skin feels smoother and so soft.  Wait until you read the ingredients in this. This is truly an all natural product. My hats off to Bell Essence. Thanks for making a great product.</li>
            <li> I am a 53 years old and suffer from extremely dry skin. This cream is very rich and leaves my skin feeling smooth and radiant. I have used it for 3 weeks and have noticed that my fine lines don&#x27;t look as pronounced. I definitely feel this is a great product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and after using this, I still had dry skin but with acne! Acne went away when I stopped using it. Also, itmells a little like olives, however you want to take that.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is not appalling. The texture is on the thicker side, which is fine for a night cream. I have used it during the day, but had to mix it with some jojoba oil. It&#x27;s an okay moisturizer, but nothing too impressive.</li>
            <li> Since entering my 30&#x27;s my skin has started to show some unfortunate signs of the mistreatment I inflicted on it during my teens and early 20&#x27;s (repeated sunburns in attempts to \\&quot;tan\\&quot; my fair skin). I have tried many different products and will look no further. You won&#x27;t find me without this cream. I have to admit, I had modest expectations of an \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; product, but could no longer reconcile spending the money to eat organically while slathering my body with chemicals. To my pleasant surprise, Bel essence outperformed the l&#x27;occitane night cream I had been using with a $100+ price tag. I live in a cold climate and always have skin problems during the winter. My skin was very dry, actually flaking on my cheeks, at the time I started using the Bel Essence. This resolved completely within two applications. Since then, the texture has continued to improve. It is now soft, smooth, and I am seeing a significant improvement in the fine lines around my eyes and across my forehead. It is very soothing, and absorbs quickly. It does have a vanilla fragrance, my 6 year old says it makes my face smell like ice cream. It dissipates quickly after application. I am not sure how it would work for someone with oily skin, but it is the best product I have found for dry skin showing early signs of aging.</li>
            <li> The product is good overall.  Very creamy and smells nice.  Coats face well.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any change in wrinkles though.</li>
            <li> I was ordering something and someone else mentioned in their review that that product works well with this treatment cream so I thought &amp;#34;what the heck.  Why not get it.&amp;#34;  So I did.  I really like this cream as it is so smooth and has a sweet fragrance.  I only use it in the evenings and I do believe that it makes my skin nicer-looking.  I&#x27;ve never been a buyer of lots of products; if I like one I tend to stay with it.  I will definitely stay with this.  I&#x27;m also not young, so I can&#x27;t expect miracles but having smoother skin is always nice - at any age.</li>
            <li> Skin felt great after using this. Not greasy- Soaked in very well. It moisturizes and nourishes the skin, helps your skin retain or restore its glow, and lightens dark circles under the eyes. Will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product from another Amazon review that has recommended it as a good cream after using the hyaluronic acid serum from Oz Naturals. I have both the serum as well as this cream and after one week of using them combined I really see a difference! My skin is glowing and the small lines under my eyes are gone. The skin feels extremely soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product for five days so I can&#x27;t rate long term yet, I will come back in two months.  I have only tried it for five nights, but I love the feel of my skin in the morning.  It does not feel sticky when applied, it absorbs well.  I had some dry spots which it has indeed eliminated.  Can&#x27;t yet attest to the sags and wrinkles (I am 73) and I think my skin just feels much better since I started to use this cream.  I am not crazy about the earthy nutty smell, but it disappears in a matter of seconds.  At this point, I would purchase again.  A little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 2 months now &amp; noticed that my skin is visibly healthier &amp; softer than I can remember it being in a long time. I love that the ingredients are natural &amp; make my skin feel refreshed!  Not 100% sure if it&#x27;s helping my wrinkles but I feel my skin has more moisture so it&#x27;s doing something!! Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of skin care products and really wanted to like this.There was nothing impressive about this cream. Maybe my expectations were too high based on reviews or maybe its really for older skin that needs extra moisture. I was also not impressed with the jar. Dipping your fingers in the pot just begs for contamination AND degrading of the product. A pump might have changed my rating. Not for me.</li>
            <li> Only used for two nights, I think it is what I have been looking for.  That one wrinkle, on my upper lip...the top of it seems to be smaller...also using a few other things other customers suggested, but I like this stuff.  I like what other customers had to say.  It did take a few more days to get here than what I would have liked, but, I have had that wrinkle since 2006, so I guess I could wait a few more days.  The smell dosent seem like vanilla to me...but it is a fine.</li>
            <li> After reading tons of amazing reviews, I was really excited to try this. While I will say it does moisturize, it&#x27;s definitely a night-time-only cream, unless you want to walk out in public looking like you slathered Crisco on your face. It&#x27;s very greasy. I noticed ABSOLUTELY ZERO improvement in my skin. And it also came with a note that said something along the lines of &amp;#34;write a good review and get a free jar&amp;#34;. So I&#x27;m guessing that a number of these raving reviews are fabricated. Still searching for a miracle cream...</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the cream.  Some people have stated it is too greasy but I do not find that to be so.  Perhaps the cream absorbs quicker on more mature skins (since moisture is lost as you get older) vs. on a younger woman&#x27;s skin.  My skin feels softer and  a little goes a long way.  An added plus is the fact the cream is made up of various oils  and the first ingredients listed are not words you cannot even pronounce let alone know what they are!  Worth trying another product made by this company.</li>
            <li> It is initially oily, but absorbs into the skin within minutes. It has a nice smell and I would purchase this oil again.</li>
            <li> No difference, save your money.</li>
            <li> Tried this for about 5 weeks. It&#x27;s a very thick and greasy cream that doesnt seem to sink into the skin. I couldnt tell a difference after 5 weeks. This seems to be just a moisterizer but because it&#x27;s so greasy I&#x27;d rather stick to better moisterizers. So to me this was a totally useless product. 1 star.</li>
            <li> DID NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  PUT ON AT NIGHT AND KEPT SCRATHING MY FACE ALL NITE.  HAD A RED PATCHY MARK ON SKIN...WAIST OF MONEY</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 5 weeks now. I apply it at night, and I wake up with moisturized, firm skin. It is somewhat greasy, so I generally avoid using it during the day. It feels rich but not too heavy. It would be nice to have an unscented option, since the vanilla scent can be a bit much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily. Not a big fan. It moisturizers, but if you rub you face at all it kinda peels off.</li>
            <li> This is a good all-natural cream that has helped my skin regain its suppleness. When you apply it it feels rather thick but amazingly by the morning when you wake up, it&#x27;s not anymore. The cream has been absorbed.. it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores so clearly it has done its job. Skin does feel better after using it for a week. It&#x27;s different from other commercial creams, which are way more expensive! Will continue and recommend using this product!</li>
            <li> Yuck!  Not a big fan.</li>
            <li> I received the intensive anti-aging treatment about three weeks ago and have been using it morning and night.  I have tried numerous skin-car products since I turned 60, some were good, some OK, and others seemed like a total waste of money, but I am thrilled with this one.  My skin feels like velvet and looks like the peaches and cream complexion that I had years ago.  Would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Christine Ives</li>
            <li> As a retinol user, I frequently have dry patches of skin on my forehead.  Since using bel essence on these spots, I have noticed considerable improvement.  I have not yet used it consistently on my whole face, partly because the jar is small and I don&#x27;t want to save it for crisis spots. I would recommend it to anyone suffering from age-related dry skin. Although expensive, it works well and you can use selectively.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the oil treatment.  Been using for over a week and my spouse has commented that my skin has a nice glow.  Love the fact that it is all-natural.  Feel like it is just as good as some of the store bought brands.  Not greasy and not caused any breakouts.  Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading the reviews and have used it nightly for a few weeks now.  I am very happy I got it.  I am seeing healthier looking skin and diminishing of the fine lines and wrinkles on my face. My face is softer and looks more firm in general.  I was concerned by the thicker consistency since I do not like a heavy feeling on my face, ever.  This is not greasy or heavy feeling at all.  I only need to use a small amount and it does the job, so I expect the jar to last a good amount of time. I find this to be an excellent product at a good price and would recommend folks try it out.</li>
            <li> I am only 24 years old, but thought it would be better to start early so that my skin could thank me later. I haven&#x27;t had this product very long, but I can say that it has made my skin so much smoother and hydrated. It was hard trying to find a morning/night routine for my skin that was simple, yet effective. I&#x27;ve done over 10 hours over research, and this product stood up to the affordability and quality.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product. I have been using it for over a month and I, as well as others have noticed a difference in my skin.  Even though it is super moisturizing, I am able to use it in the morning under my makeup. Immediately after application my skin feels super soft. It does have a fragrance but it is light and pleasant. I also like the fact that it has all natural ingredients. Great product.</li>
            <li> Received this cream about a week ago and already notice improvement in my skin&#x27;s hydration.  I have always been reluctant to purchase creams with oil in them as I have oily skin, but even though this cream contains some oils, it absorbs quickly and does not leave my face feeling greasy or oily.  It also helps my makeup go on smoother! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it helps with wrinkles, but love the way it makes my skin feel so I will continue to purchase it as a moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have only been using Bel Essence for a few days, and already I like it! At first it feels a little greasy, but after about 5 minutes, it starts to feel silky. It&#x27;s been 6 hours since I used it, and face still feels silky and has a little glow. I bet this will be great as a foundation primer. Hope the long term results are as great as the short term ones!</li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference in the way my skin feels. My wrinkles are vanishing even after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cream. I just love it. It makes my skin so smooth and moist. I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for myself and broke out but then again everything makes me breakout. So I gave it to my mom who&#x27;s in her 70&#x27;s and she loves it so I ordered it for her again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now and I have to say, the results have been phenomenal.  It needs to be used sparingly, it is a really rich cream and it started to make my face break out a bit so I cut back how much I was using.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, a little goes a very long way but the moisturizing benefits are impressive.  I have a hard time finding anything that works for my sensitive skin and this has been a winner.  I recommend!</li>
            <li> I saw nice results in 2 days! I ordered another as a back up...lol &amp; also a jar for my Mom. I&#x27;m 47 yrs. old &amp; don&#x27;t have any wrinkles except under my eyes, now they&#x27;re practically gone.  Update....price increased from $33 to $53, so I won&#x27;t buy it again. I&#x27;m sure there are other ones just as good &amp; your wallet isn&#x27;t raped!!! Way to gauge your loyal customers....pathetic!!</li>
            <li> 5 Star is not enough!!! Ok day one my skin looked and felt nourished. After a couple days dark marks are fading and one of the two lines on my neck is diminishing and the tone is clearing nicely. I bought the Nutrogena (tone,wrinkles) products, but this product is used as a regiment, dont sleep on it!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer and brightener.  I have tried many products over the counter-Neutrogena Oil of Oaly, ederm, but most of them moisturize and do not reduce wrinkles, fine lines as they may promise.  This one really helps with dryness and filling in the fine lines on a daily basis, I don&#x27;t know land doubt if it will long term but will continue using.</li>
            <li> This is the first review that I have ever written--though I am an avid “review-reader”.  This facial cream is AMAZING!  I have acne-prone skin, am 30 years old, and once in a while suffer from adult and hormone-related acne.  I purchased this based on the reviews, and noticed that it leaves my face glowing, while erasing previous acne scars.  It reduces redness from current breakouts, and overall changes my skin texture.  I use retin-A for anti-aging purposes, and use this cream to keep my skin moisturized.  I even use it during the summer and it sinks right in, not leaving residue or oily skin.  (I have dry/combo skin).  I had to write a review for this because of the difference that I’ve seen in my skin.  Once winter rolls around, I will purchase the oil as well.  LOVE this stuff--will purchase over and over again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping hands young - People are aways commenting on how young my hands look at 45. I haven&#x27;t seen any signs of effect on the lines on my face, though.</li>
            <li> Breaks my face out even with minimal application. Now I use it to moisturize my hair so its not a complete waste. Love that its all natural but its a little to greasy for me (hair and face).</li>
            <li> Since I could no longer obtain my face moisturizer, I had to try other moisturizers. I was not happy, all disappointed me and I just wanted my original face cream back.  I am 65 and my dermatologist was so impressed with my skin condition he wanted to know the name and ingredients of my moisturizer, and even the one he recommended I didn&#x27;t like.  After doing some research on face creams I decided to give Bel Essence a try. Even though it was a smaller amount for the money, you will get so much more than you thought, because you use a very small amount.  I just skim 2 fingers over the top of the cream and very gently rub it into my face, dividing into four sections. First each side, then my forehead and chin and neck next.  What I thought was a greasy feel in all reality was a dewy feel on the skin.  AWESOME....truthfully, I am ordering more and you will not regret buying this cream also.  I am very proud to give this product a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I am 66 yrs old and I have totally dry skin which I could never get moist enough.......Bel Essence is the very first product to accomplish this miracle........I have only used it for a week but my makeup just glides over my face and there are no flakes on my skin like I always had before......I think I look 10 yrs younger.....Bel Essence will be on my counter forever........</li>
            <li> This cream is very light and sinks in quickly, my skin feels very soft.  Just received and am happy with purchase.  I hope to love it more everyday.  We&#x27;ll see.  Thanks so much for a great experience.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost5 weeks, I am 25 years old, but I am VERY happy about the result, I use it before bed. when I wake up in the morning my skin looks very clean and clear. It is a great product that made me use it daily even if I feel lazy!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days but I can already feel and see a difference.  My skin feels soft and looks radiant.  I hope this product continues to deliver.</li>
            <li> The best cream I have ever used ! I am 63 and tried every cream possible and this is the one !!!!</li>
            <li> As an RN who has worked for several plastic surgeons I have access to many expensive face creams. I decided to purchase Bel Essence and I am truly surprised! This cream moisturizes my skin all night long, and since the temperatures are dropping. It provides moisture all day long.I highly recommend this product, it has such a clean scent and beautiful silky texture.[[ASIN:B00FSBQ1PO Bel Essence Anti Aging Treatment - Intensive All Natural Anti-Wrinkle, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was hoping for improved skin.  I tried this for about a month and didn&#x27;t notice any difference. But  everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so while it didn&#x27;t work for me, maybe it would work for you.  My next attempt at taking a few years off of my skin was L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect for mature skin Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair and also their Golden Balm Redensifying for face, neck &amp; chest.  It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks but I have noticed a marked improvement in the wrinkles about my eyes, and my neck skin.  After a bit more experience with it, I will post a review on these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bel Essence All-natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment for past 6 months as a night cream. Every morning skin on my face looks fresh and glowing so I even stopped using serum. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> pricey and as worthless as all the myriad other anti aging stuff out there.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that turns red and blotchy after showering and I was hoping for a rich, moisturizing, all-natural creme that would calm my skin. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do any of that. The creme lay on the skin and didn&#x27;t feel like it was absorbed by the skin. It ran into the eyes, making me red-eyed all day. In addition, it might be all natural but it smells unpleasantly like liquid plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, not for me.</li>
            <li> Having combined skin and being over 30 I was looking for anti wrinkle cream that won&#x27;t cause breakouts.  This is the first cosmetic that not only moisturize my skin but also smooths all over without breakouts and extensive shine. Natural ingredients is also a big +.  I will definitely re-order.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bel Essence for a little over a month now, and, wow, I love it. It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time. I have sensitive skin, and many products cause my skin to breakout or I have a rash the first few days of trying it.... not with Bel Essence! I&#x27;m very impressed. Thanks for offering such a great, natural product!</li>
            <li> I started using the product and n about 2 weeks I noticed that my skin is tighter in texture and more moist. The lines were less visible.  I was in Florida when started the regimen and was glad for that. I played a lot of golf and it surely protected my skin from the strong elements of the sun and as well as the beach on days I wasn&#x27;t  playing golf. Definitely worth the money. Glad I am doing something good for my skin!</li>
            <li> Having done minimum skin care all my life, I decided it was time for the works before serious signs of aging set in. Hubby pitched in and helped me explore a brand that shall be nameless except for its price: more than a hundred dollars (sometimes lots more) for a small jar/tube of just about anything.  It sure worked.  Overnight I saw a difference.  A week later my skin looked noticeably younger.  I obtained a night cream, a day cream, an eye cream, a toner, a serum, hunting for online bargains--thinking they ought to last a lifetime even at the reduced prices I found.  Then I discovered Bel Essence.  Guess what?  It&#x27;s JUST as good as the \\&quot;hundreds of dollars\\&quot; brands.  Encouraged, I searched Amazon and the comments for other substitutes.  From now on, my toner is Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel, my serum is OZ Naturals Vitamin C 20% etc, my eye serum is Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair and my moisturizer is Bel Essence intensive anti-aging treatment, which works well as a day or night cream -- a total of $89.68, not $993, for instance.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m rubbing vanilla icing on my face.  I&#x27;m not convinced it works.  It does look pretty on my shelf though.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream, i did not notice any changes as of yet in my skin</li>
            <li> Sometimes you just can&#x27;t tell how good a product is until you use it for awhile.  In this case, I waited until I was almost finished with the jar before posting this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning.  At first it seemed a little oily and I was concerned it would make me break out.  As it turned out this is one of my &#x27;go to&#x27; products now.  I works particularly good on the décolletage area.  I like that I have finally found an all natural product that feels so moisturizing and works works so well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as my night cream, as directed. I mix in a little Oil of Olay for sensitive skin moisturizer, either SPF 15 or 30, to turn this into my own personal &amp;#34;BB&amp;#34; cream. In addition to moisturizing, this mixture gives my skin a smooth glow. I frequently go without foundation or powder and still get compliments on my &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; and complexion.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE $$ on this homemade voodoo moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the raving reviews on this treatment and was convinced it HAD to be a winner.  Do not be fooled by reviews like I was.  This product offers absolutely no anti-aging anti-wrinkle effects.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the company bribes you with 50% off your next purchase simply by writing a review!  HEED WARNING!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and I&#x27;m very happy and satisfied of its great result. My face which  Im so unhappy in the past because of its blemishes, dull looking, rough, with pigmentations became completely different.  This product amazingly makes my face clearer, smoother, and younger looking .  I got many compliments from friends and defifnitely recommended this product.  I would never live without using this product as it helps improve my confidence.  Foremost, I&#x27;m very happy that lines in my face diminishes in shorter time.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel very smooth.  It is a good product and I will purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> The 5 stars is for the product only .. read on and you&#x27;ll find out why. I love this skin cream. I was very hesitant putting oil on my skin but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Instead, my skin feels soft and it glows. I&#x27;m 41 and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin was getting dull, but this has put the reverse button on dull skin. I bought this in the beginning of December and it is now the end of March and I&#x27;m just now thinking of ordering more. I still have a few more weeks left of the first jar so a little goes a long long way. I started using this in the winter when I have to admit that I put on a little thicker coat too just to make me feel better but I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t need it. I could see that using this sparingly it could last up to 6 months. Now here is the catch, in December I paid $33 and now it is marked to almost $50 plus S&amp;H. I love this stuff so much I did a web search and just happened to go to the bel essence website and it is $33 and if you do standard shipping there is no fee for S&amp;H. Score! Sorry Amazon, this doesn&#x27;t qualify for Prime and there is a terrible mark up by the seller.</li>
            <li> Bel Essence lived up to the hype! It works even better for me than the Olay products--plus the bonus is that the jar contains so much more than Olay. I use it morning and night.  It goes on smoothly, seems to be somewhat oily, but then soaks into my skin to lock in moisture. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it now that I&#x27;ve tried it for the past month!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so I love the fact that this product is all natural. Lovs it sooooo much</li>
            <li> I used some expensive brands before and it turned out that I developed an allergy to some preservatives used by many major brands in the U.S.  Some other brands market themselves as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but I learned later (after I wasted my $$$ on many creams that gave me the allergic reaction) that although the main ingredients were natural, the cheap preservatives used were not!!!!!So I was looking for 100% natural skin cream that would also make a positive difference for my skin. I decided to try Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment because of so many other positive reviews and &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; claim. The cream not only feels great on my skin but also after 4 weeks of using it I already noticed a positive difference! I&#x27;m so glad that I finally found the cream that my skin loves!</li>
            <li> Really great cream. Love it. Although I&#x27;m not a highly qualified cream reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;First one arrived with a broken cap, and the seller sent me a replacement hassle free.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new intensive anti aging product after a longtime favorite of mine was discontinued. I am 79 years old, have luckily inherited good genes, and have always taken good care of my skin. Still, the years do take their toll. This cream was a pleasant surprise. First of all, the jar I received did not remotely smell of vanilla (as another reviewer commented). Nor did it feel soft and light like whipped cream. The &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; IMHO borders on unpleasant. It feels like a face cream, not lighter or silkier than a drugstore brand. BUT I can really see positive results on my skin. My face feels firmer; pores are tightened; marionette lines are softened; light wrinkles are harder to see. So, this cream has proved itself more beneficial to me than some well known products that cost several times the dollars. I&#x27;m a fan and will be trying some other Bel Essence products. So they could smell better, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for a fragrance; I was looking for a treatment. And found it : )</li>
            <li> I really liked this product! it made my skin very soft and supple, I even used it on my hands and decolletage. The smell was ok, nothing to write home about. My only complaint is how small the jar is. I ran out pretty quickly and I only use two dabs every morning and night. But I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I love it. This cream is soft, smooth, and is working great on my wrinkles. I have been using Bel Essence morning and night. Morning, clean my face, then use Bare Minerals Multi-Wrinkle Repair or Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer with sunscreen, then Bel Essence, and the rest of my makeup. Night I clean my face, use Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair serum, then Bel Essence. I have truly seen a difference with the wrinkles softening. I am very pleased with my appearance. I most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so moist and smooth!</li>
            <li> I used this for about a month twice a day to give it a good chance, but my face still felt dry/tight after applying it, like it never fully soaked in. It stayed pretty greasy on top of my skin too.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, it took me awhile to notice a difference, but my skin is now softened and overall more plump and glowing than before. Will buy again, and plan on trying their oil as well.  Followup: I used to be a fan, as my initial review above shows, but the second jar I ordered had a weird smell to it when I got it, and it&#x27;s only gotten worse. So I didn&#x27;t use the cream as much because of it. I either received an old jar or the product is a different formula? I noticed other reviewers complaining, while some say it is either odorless or has a pleasant smell. I don&#x27;t remember my first jar having any odor issues, but this one does. Pew.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that, at first, I thought this was too heavy for my oil-prone but aging (and acne-prone) skin (I&#x27;m in my 30s, for reference, &amp; damaged my skin a lot from sun exposure).  However, I found myself using every last bit of it, which is something I usually do NOT do (I have graveyards of half-used skin and hair products...)  I think that speaks for itself, given that I am picky.  I have been missing this as a moisturizer and need to get more.  It is not as shiny as most *effective* moisturizers.  And it did not even make me break out.  It didn&#x27;t make my wrinkles just disappear, but it did seem to have some anti-aging properties.  I usually used it only at night on my face and sparingly or just on my wrinkles/dry spots in the morning since I have combination/oily skin, but most people could probably use it twice a day to good effect.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m 24, with pretty healthy skin, but after showering or being out in cold weather, my face gets very dry! I had been searching for a night face cream that had natural ingredients and decent reviews. When I came across Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle treatment cream, I read the reviews and product details and I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I started applying this cream on my face every night after showering or before bedtime. At first, the cream seems a little oily for about 5-10mins, but then your skin seriously drinks this stuff up! I&#x27;m on day 9 using this cream and I LOVE IT! My face feels SO soft throughout the entire day. Again, I love the natural vitamins and antioxidants found in this cream. I will continue using this as my one and only face cream and cant wait to see future results.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD buy!</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and seems to be a rich cream, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I have tried over 50 products for my under eye wrinkles and I have very very dry skin under eyes. I had lost all hope until I read about this online and decided to try it. I have only used this twice and my skin looks amazing, the wrinkles are almost gone and it looks more hydrated and fuller unerneath my eyes. I look younger already and am going to now purchase that bel essence oil on amazon. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this and it&#x27;s all natural which is even better. All the other creams I used would burn my skin and cause bad reactions, red and dry, burning skin.&lt;br /&gt;The Roc retinol night cream was the worst. I will now use this bel essence cream twice a day. it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes but does nothing for wrinkles.  There are better moisturizers out there</li>
            <li> I love that the cream is 100% natural. I was so excited about buying it and hoping it would work. I have always had a problem with my skin and breakouts if I did not use mild cleansers and Aveeno day creams. Even Aveeno wrinkle cream causes my skin to breakout. I am getting older and have a problem to find a natural cream for wrinkles that would work on my problematic skin (oily T-zone). This cream contains too much oil for my skin. I can not put it on my face or neck. After I put it there I breakout on my forehead, cheeks and under my jaw line. If I stop using it, my skin improves. If I put it on, the next day I start to have  few breakouts and more every day I use it. I can put it around my eyes, but so far I have not seen any results with my wrinkles. I am using it for about a month. Also, the initial smell when I opened the jar reminded me hospital smell. It was not too appealing and my husband called it &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; smell. It got better with time or I just got used to the smell. I will keep using it around my eyes and watch for any improvements, but so far the cream did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I came across this product after reading another review and I love it.  I am using this product in conjunction with name brand retinol products.  My skin gets very dry and this works great.  Its quiet thick and creamy and smells nice.  It lays on the surface for just a few minutes after I apply but then is fully absorbed.  Don&#x27;t be put off when you first apply.  I apply at night and my skin feels soft and supple in the morning.  I also apply whenever I feel that my skin is tight.  Its all natural and full of all the nutrients your skins need.  I have used this for about 10 days now and my skin is brighter and my wrinkles don&#x27;t appear to be as deep.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was going to wait a couple weeks before doing a review, but after 1 week I&#x27;m already seeing results!  The lines on my forehead were my main concern and are noticeably smoother.  I&#x27;m 35 with oily skin and was concerned about breakouts after reading some of the other reviews, but so far so good!  It has a nice smell and is very creamy, but soaks right into the skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it day and night so far. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a face cream like this for so long and am very happy that I have found Bel Essence Cream. It makes my face feel really soft and looks rested. This cream actually feels like it is moisturizing your skin, sinking in compared to all other creams I have tried. The small lines around my mouth seem to be not as noticeable. Just happy to be putting &amp;#34;all good&amp;#34; on my skin. Just started using this week and looking forward to seeing results in a months time.</li>
            <li> As much as I had hoped that I&#x27;d avoid the wrinkles that &amp;#34;other women&amp;#34; get as they get older (how naive!), that is regrettably not the case and I recently decided to &amp;#34;get serious&amp;#34; about my skincare regime - who would have thought I&#x27;d need one some day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a couple of Neutrogena&#x27;s retinol-type products, but they&#x27;re pretty rough on dry skin like mine.  I came across Bel Essence and now use it day and night after apply the Neutrogena product, and I swear that my skin looks better.  It definitely feels better and applying make-up is a much smoother process too - no more expensive primers for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it&#x27;s quite a rich, decadent cream.  It smells good enough to eat, and by that I mean that it smells of natural oils and butters and essential oils, which is such a change from the nice-smelling-but-clearly artificial scents of most other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m enjoying this cream and think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product about a week, but love it!!  I will update later.  I&#x27;m excited t see how my skin will be this winter, it get very cold here in MN</li>
            <li> Thank you for this wonderful product. I like the fact that this cream is all natural. I applied it to my washed face before bedtime, and woke up to moisturized, soft and nourished skin. I&#x27;m using it twice a day in the morning and at the bed time, and noticing wonderful results: my skin is moisturized, feels very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Bel Essence Anti-Wrinkle treatment for over 2 weeks and definitely like it. I am 60 yrs of age with generally very good skin and I have never experienced the kinds of reactions some women do when trying new products. In other words I have very UN-sensitive skin--just a bit of info about my skin type. What I like about this product so far is the richness and aroma. I definitely want a product that is more than a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; feeling--one that has some body to it. I feel as though this product has that richness without sitting on top of the skin. I would definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, especially if you have dry skin.  I have combination to oily but I get very dry/tight in winter months.  I love the way it makes my skin feel when I put it on, silky soft feeling.  I already see a brightness, glowiness to my skin tone.  I bought based on some reviews I read and that is all natural.  Not sure if I will use in summer months as I think it will be too oily with my natural skin type, but we will see.</li>
            <li> This is a sweet little cream- highly moisturizing but elegant. Does not leave a greasy residue. I will continue to use it on all body parts, except for my face (it&#x27;s intended target). Unfortunately, it left me with painful, cyst-like breakouts, something I have not seen the likes of for nearly two decades. However, that may be an individual reaction, so I would still recommend others try the cream. I truly appreciate the care taken in selecting natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This treatment is goes on smooth and you dont need to put so much on your face. I put it on at night and the next morning my face is still smooth. I just wish it has a size bigger other than that it does what it says.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference in my skin by using this product. It is heavy and greasy on my skin. I would rather use my organic coconut oil (at night) at a much cheaper cost.  Also, the product was sent from 1/2 hour from where I live, but took over a week to get to me!</li>
            <li> The thing I like best about this moisturizer is the fact that it is all-natural. It is a little thicker and heavier than what I was previously using (Philosphy Hope in a Jar) and I was afraid it would irritate my 42 year old sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 weeks and have not had any break outs yet and my skin is really soft!  For the reviews I read talking about the smell, it is very similar to other all-natural products I use--almost a light vanilla scent.  Since it is all natural, you are not going to be getting the artificial ingredients other moisturizers use to achieve their scents. I would have given this product 5 stars if it was a little lighter.  I notice I do have to wait about 5 minutes before I put on my make up for it to sort of &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; on my face.  All in all, I think I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> good texture and overall a better product than regular creams.  i will continue to us this  product. i approve of this message</li>
            <li> Bel Essence is a creamy and the vanilla fragrance is delicious. I recommend this to anyone who needs&lt;br /&gt;a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I decided to give this moisturizer a try.  So glad I did!  Great results that turned my dry skin around in a matter of days.  I had been using a moisturizer costing almost four times as much as bel essence with little success.  I would highly recommend this product.  The only suggestion I have to improve this moisturizer is to add  a broad spectrum sunscreen.</li>
            <li> bel essence cream leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth! The fragrance is pleasing and it is now my nighttime ritual.</li>
            <li> I WISH I HAD  I went by reviews and when I put a bit on, my face broke out.&lt;br /&gt;Then I got out my magnifying glass and saw it had several unpronounceable ingredients which I looked up and found  &#x3D;  TOXIC.&lt;br /&gt;Sending it back.</li>
            <li> Love this and my face looked great after using for 2 weeks-used with Neutrogena wrinkle repair every night and it made my face so smooth and soft. Real beauty cream that works.</li>
            <li> I had read some reviews that said this was very oily so I was concerned about using it during the day.  I found that complaint completely invalid.  It FEELS a bit oily going on but it absorbs immediately and my face feels so soft and supple without any greasy feeling or residue being left on it.  I use the oil at night and very quickly noticed my pores got much smaller and my skin feels very soft and looks good - I&#x27;m 58 so I need a good product and I do like this.  I put it on right after washing and patting my face dry.  There&#x27;s a little moistness left on my face and that allows the lotion to soak in immediately.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Based on others&#x27; reviews I wanted to love this cream, but after only a few days of use I experienced break outs galore. Once I stopped using it my face cleared. If I could give 0 stars, I would! I&#x27;m sending it back for a refund!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews here. This face cream is a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s all natural, which I really liked. It smells like vanilla frosting and it feels very good going on to my skin. However, it&#x27;s greasy, and it just sat on top of my skin, never absorbing into my skin at all. I have used almost the entire jar and I have seen no results, not even more hydrated skin. I&#x27;m sure this cream works very well for some people, but unfortunately, it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this- I use it at night in combination with Retin-A micro, Vit C serum and AHA(not together) and it not only nourishes and soothes my super red &amp; sensitive skin- but it feels very luxurious and wonderful to the skin!&lt;br /&gt;I read about it from a review of another product and the person recommended it  - for something natural, paraben free and silicone free for my dry, dehydrated and problematic skin.&lt;br /&gt;I looked it up  and found it here- and am SO happy I ordered it:)&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for over 2 weeks with absolutely no side effects or reactions . It&#x27;s so nice &amp; gentle I can apply it even close to my eye area!&lt;br /&gt;Lovely texture and great nourishing cream!&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way- great investment and way better than the Alchemist cream, or plain &amp;#34;fashionable&amp;#34; oils... If you have been looking for a good cream- you know what I mean- argan or coconut oil- just don&#x27;t cut it for me...</li>
            <li> I have used some of the product and am very pleased with the results. It is a wonderful combination of all natural ingredients that I have used individually on my skin in past years. It is so nice to have these oils combined into one product to get all of the benefits! I have used it at night for 2 weeks and I love that a little goes a long way and it is not greasy on my skin. My skin feels tighter and smoother in the morning.</li>
            <li> The hydration properties are exactly what my skin needs right now.  I am 58 years old, have never smoked and have very good eating and exercise habits. Nevertheless, the approaching New England winter, frequent air travel, and chronic work stress have begun to take a toll on my face. It does have an oily feel but my skin (face and neck) responds very positively to the composition.  I apply a thin film morning and evening. In the morning I wait about 30 minutes before applying primer and makeup base. The fragrance is subtle and dissipates quickly. I&#x27;m highly sensitive to fragrance so this is a plus for me.  I&#x27;ve  had the product for a little over two weeks so it&#x27;s too soon to evaluate longer term benefits. As a scientist I get frustrated by the large number of products that are compositionally the same but simply branded differently. Bel essence is formulated the way I would formulate a product of this kind.  4 stars rather than 5 pending longer term performance.</li>
            <li> The facial cream is rich, smooth and non irritating to the skin. I have tried many products and this is a keeper!! It absorbs quickly, leaving the skin soft and non greasy during the day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a friend.  She felt that she could no longer wear makeup, because the makeup caked in her wrinkles. After reading a review about Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair that mentioned this cream, I ordered both products for her.  After a month of usage of both products, my friend thought that her wrinkles were not as deep.  After two months of usage, she likes how her skin looks and is wearing her makeup.  She has ordered both products again.  She is a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many good things about this product so I decided to try it out. After a few days you could already see a difference! I know hard to believe...but it&#x27;s true. It reduced the appearance of the fine lines on my forehead the most from what I saw. Also, it is great as a moisturizer especially for those of us with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Many thanks to the reviewer from Roc who mentioned thus product. This is amazing! It goes on smooth and absorbs wonderfully. This is not greasy (as others have mentioned).&lt;br /&gt;It is worth every cent. My skin has already improved in a short time. I happen to have dry knuckles and I rub this on them and now I have baby like skin. I bought this for use of my face and neck but what a bonus for my hands. I am so impressed and So very pleased !&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment.</li>
            <li> I have used allot of different products and this was by far the worst. I noticed nothing other than really greasy,oily skin. It really is a bad product. Never using Bel Essence products again.</li>
            <li> I love this cream!!! Seller provided quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> This is some serious cream. I will buy it again. I am outdoors a lot and do wear sunblock, but wind and winter bring on the need to have some great moisturizer.  I have tried different moisturizers that just seem full of filler or cake on or smell. I am a man and don&#x27;t want scent, but do want healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Some of the best features of this product are: the smell (like vanilla cookies baking) and the texture (super smooth and soft and feels great going on).  It is not like other &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; products in its category . . . in my opinion . . . because it feels just like a nice, heavy, healing cream going on your face. In my experience, most anti-aging products feel like they are burning the wrinkles off your face -- this one doesn&#x27;t feel that way.  I can&#x27;t say that I feel miraculously younger or noticeably less wrinkled after a few weeks of use, but I know that I look forward to gently rubbing this concoction onto my face and neck at night, and I feel it does a great job of moisturizing.  I live in a very dry climate and am in my early 40&#x27;s, so am really starting to need good products.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have tried plenty of different night/ anti-aging cremes and this is the very best!  I have been using Bel Essence for 3 weeks now and my skin seems to be more hydrated and wrinkles are less noticeable.  It quickly absorbed into my skin and feels soooooooooooooo good.  I use it twice a day or more often if I am home and just want my skin to feel good. Give it a try......you WILL NOT be disappointed in your purchase of Bel Essence Intensive Anti-Aging Treatment.  LOVE IT !!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It does what it says. I have had very dry skin and fine wrinkles since I was a teen. After only weeks using it my skin is brighter and softer. The dark circles below my eyes disappeared. Very, very, very effective.</li>
            <li> not seeing improvement and using it everyday</li>
            <li> I just started using this product a 10days ago and I absolutely LOVE this formula. I can see increased suppleness in my skin. My main target are a few fine lines around my eyes. They appear to be slightly faded already. The combination of all the oils seem to &#x60;slow down&#x27; the aging effects. Using this once or twice regularly has improved the overall look of my face and hydrated my skin. I like the scent (a little earthy)it is subtle and dissipates quickly.  Having a great experience with this cream so far and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I have used bel essence intensive anti-aging treatment twice daily for six consecutive days and could not be more pleased.  It is excellent for nightly skin nutrition and for day time hydration under makeup.  I chose this product for its all natural ingredients as well as its superb reviews, none of which have disappointed.  Already I am cognizant of an improvement in the texture, coloration, and clarity of my skin and am confident with continued use I will notice fine line disappearance. I will certainly re-order and definitely recommend this product.  Thank you for providing this product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> i found one of the ingredients sodium hydroxymethyglyconate to be an irritant to skin if used in high dosage and not a natural ingredient from my research.  I had bought this and the Anti-wrinkle Treatment from a 5 star review that was suppose to reduce the burning sensation I got from the Roc products but as it turned out, it did nothing to relieve it. In face this ingredient probably added to the burning.</li>
            <li> In winter months my face gets dry and I need extra moisture at night.  This natural product is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and my face feels so much better.  I use it on my lips, too.  Although it feels a bit oily when you first put it on, fear not.  Your face will absorb it while you sleep.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> nice, nourishing cream. a little goes a long way. keep away from eyes though.</li>
            <li> This product is really greasy, no wonder it causes break out. I have oily skin and won&#x27;t be using this. Also the jar came with a broken lid and i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal but it was also half full. Cream was sitting on top to make the jar appear full but the bottom was empty. For 35$ bucks im returning it. I didn&#x27;t expect this cream to be that greasy either. It&#x27;s very thick, heavy and leaves skin super oily. For dry skin it may be good, but for skin that is slightly oily, this can be a bad thing and cause breaks out. Unfortunately, i purchased this because of all the good reviews that influenced my purchase once again, only to be disappointed. I think from now on i will start checking out the one star reviews first..</li>
            <li> Love the Bel Essence Intensive Anti-Aging Treatment creme.  Like the healthy smell.  My skin is so much softer since using the product and wrinkles are slowly fading.  I use as overnight creme.  Will be on my shelf from here on.  Thank You Amazon for carrying this wonderful creme.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry in Arizona, but because it is very sensitive, I have to be careful with many anti-aging creams. Bel Essence has addressed both issues beautifully. My skin is soft, hydrated and no breakouts. I will have to continue to see if wrinkles disappear, but the hydration itself has helped with the appearance of my skin. I think it is a winner.</li>
            <li> my friend gave me some to try and I loved it! i just ordered one, great fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;this product is fantastic! all natural, no chemicals! and you can feel and see the difference right away!&lt;br /&gt;i really love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of this product on my skin. Makes it feel soft and hydrated. It only takes a small amount so don&#x27;t over do it like I did the first time I used it. With a small amount applied it absorbs into my skin in about 30 minutes. I use it before bedtime after I cleanse my face and also in the morning after cleansing and 30 minutes before I put my Bare Minerals makeup on. Too soon to tell if it really does do anything for my wrinkles since I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days. I was looking for a moisturizing cream that was all natural and didn&#x27;t cost as much as the cream I was previously using and I think I&#x27;ve found it!!  Bel Essence costs half as much!!</li>
            <li> Been using the cream for a month, my face feels so soft.  I only have to use a little and I haven&#x27;t been using any of my other night treatments because this works as my only night cream now.</li>
            <li> Been using for 4 nights now, and love it!!  Does not irritate my skin, and can even put around eyes.  I have also put it on my hands every night before bed.  Feels great!!  Too soon to see results, but so far so good.  Little complaint about the smell.  It smells like olives, but my husband loves olives so all is good!!  :)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I hoped this would be a good every day moisturizer for me. I have to say my skin really didn&#x27;t like this product. I think it was too heavy, which made me break out. I also found the smell a little off putting - I think it&#x27;s meant to be like a vanilla scent, but the vanilla mixes with something else that makes it smell a little like egg nog (not in a good way). Not my favorite and I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
            <li> It really works!  I didn&#x27;t think so many positive reviews could be trusted but the results really speak for themselves!</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic!!  I use it twice a day; my skin has never felt better!  I had a friend tell my my face looked hydrated and healthy-and this was in the middle of winter!  It&#x27;s a bit thicker than what some might be used to, but a little bit goes a long way.  It might be too heavy for summer use, but I&#x27;m going to try it anyway, maybe will need to use it only once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> My skin became so dry this winter. I had tried other products which left me with a red, itchy rash. I bought this product because it was natural hoping that it wouldn&#x27;t break out my very sensitive skin. I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and my itchy rash is gone and my skin feels great. I use it in the morning under my make up, and lather it on at night before bed. I love the way that my skin feels. It also has a very light, clean scent. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Good product,  the cream is very smooth and easy to apply on face,  I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I just starting using a week ago and I have already seen results. Great product! I will continue to use to get more results. It works better than any other product I have used,</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing the great reviews. It is very, super  greasy even for dry skin;it does not absorb at all, causes break outs, does not diminish fine lines, only leaves skin GREASY!!!. The good reviews are fake, and the negative reviews get aggressively thumbed down as &amp;#34;not helpful&amp;#34;  by the seller with multiple accounts. The seller also bribes customers to post a positive review in exchange of a jar of cream. This is a terrible product. Buyer be aware.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to share my experience with your product.  First of all, it smells wonderful!  I&#x27;ve been giving my mom (in her 70&#x27;s) facials for years, mostly for fun but also because I know she isn&#x27;t comfortable enough to go into a salon.  Anyway, I&#x27;ve used many different products on her over the years - usually what I happen to be using at the time.  I speedily ordered the Bel Essence Cream and the oil because I started to get extreme redness and drying from Roc facial cleanser and night cream after three or four days of use on my own face.  (I&#x27;m 49.)  I had read from other reviews that Roc dries your skin and that bel essence cream and oil help with the redness and burning that takes place especially when you first use it.  Wow it was true.  The oil is great for giving instant relief from the redness.  I stopped using Roc for about a week and just used Dove soap and then the bel essence oil and/or cream.  My face recovered beautifully and then I started to cautiously use the Roc products again making sure I moisturized after with either bel essence oil or Bel Essence cream.  For the dryer spots, I used the oil and for the majority of my face I used the cream.  Then I tried the cream on my mom when I gave her a facial and she loved it and the wonderful smell.  For my mom I only use the Roc face cleanser (not the night cream) and then the Bel essence face cream.  It&#x27;s the best facial product combination I&#x27;ve ever used in the 10 or so years that I&#x27;ve been giving my mom facials.  I&#x27;m running out of it because I&#x27;m using it on my daughters who are in the twenties too!  I can&#x27;t wait to get some more!</li>
            <li> I have used this treatment for three months and I plan to keep using it.  I have dry skin and am in my 50&#x27;s.  It gives my skin the moisture it needs and makes my skin feel soft and look great.  I use it night and day (under make-up).  I also use it after micro-rolling my face as it contains the building blocks of collagen.  It feels good and never stings.</li>
            <li> I Purchased this cream because of its natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Good moisturizer, feel good factor because it has many natural ingredients, reduces fine fines&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Might be a bit greasy for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product, which doesn&#x27;t cause any skin irritations.</li>
            <li> I thought it was strange when a moderately priced face cream did not come in a box, it came in a bubble wrap .Although it was safety sealed it was totally used. it had crud all around the seal of the jar. I am totally turned off and returning it. Such a waste of my time.</li>
            <li> only had this for a couple of days, I have separately used products with these ingredients and I definitely can confirm it is very important to include them in your anti aging regime. But due to the several different oils in this product I can not wear it under my make up, it seems to work ok at first but then it seems to aid in oxidizing (which changes your make up color, this of course is to be considered depending on your make up )&lt;br /&gt;I would use it as night moisturizer, but already am using a retional product and some argan oil&lt;br /&gt;so for these reasons I find the very small product you receive totally overpriced</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly because my smile lines were starting to bother me. I&#x27;ve used over the counter anti-aging moisturizers before, (Olay, L&#x27;oreal etc.) Olay I&#x27;ve used for a long time, but when it came to getting rid of lines, the sculpting treatment didn&#x27;t really cut it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leading me to purchase Bel Essence.  I&#x27;ve always wanted to go organic, and this is the only product I found to be truly organic. I just recieved this, and have been using it as a day cream and night cream.  It tingles at first (in my case still does) and I&#x27;ve seen minor improvements in my smile lines, but my face is plump and has a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is small in size, but the quantity surely outweighs the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The less you use (since the instructions say it lasts 3 months alone) It melts like butter on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence the 4 stars, I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall (in the 3 days I&#x27;ve had it)  I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> just started using it</li>
            <li> Too goopy for my tastes.</li>
            <li> I have recently started using this product and so far like the way it feels.This product goes on clean with no greasy after affect.</li>
            <li> Totally broke out in acne.  My skin did not like this product.  So hoped it would.  Smells great, greasy feeling dissolved quickly and my skin felt nourished.</li>
            <li> I tried this and at first thought it was ok, but just did not see a significant difference.  It was not among my favorites.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am quite young but have dry and sun damaged skin, caused from long term use of acne medications, which was starting to show age marks before its time. After using this morning and night for 2 weeks I have already noticed some signs of improvement and my skin is feeling vastly more comfortable than it had been before. I will continue to use this product and hope my initial success is built upon.</li>
            <li> I received this really quickly and so far so good!  I love the natural ingredients and it smells great!  Too soon to tell if it&#x27;s making a difference in my wrinkles but my skin has been ultra moisturized since using. Bel Essence website says it takes at least a month to see long term results because your skin regenerates every 28 days.</li>
            <li> I really like the smoothness of my skin after applying this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Product goes on smoothly and blends without a trace. My skin feel moisturized.  I am pleased so far with the results</li>
            <li> It is a light gentle moisturizer, but if you have a very dry skin try something stronger. This is good moisturizer for semi dry skin and uses no perfumes at all you can tell it is made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Skin Type:  Fair to Medium, normal to dry in places (T-zone dryness)&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles:  Mild forehead wrinkles, furrows (between eyebrows) are moderate, very mild crows feet.  None anywhere else. Nonsmoker.&lt;br /&gt;Duration of Use: One month on an average of once per day (sometimes twice)  No negative side effects (rash, breakout, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opinion:  It goes on smoothly, but feels a little greasy.  A little goes a long way.  There is a faint vanilla smell that is pleasant.  It does absorb quickly.  After using regularly for a month I see no difference in wrinkle appearance and very little improvement in skin dryness.  I cannot justify buying this again for this price when Aveeno Daily Moisturizer works just as well, or maybe even better.  I&#x27;m not saying its &#x27;junk&#x27; because it appears to be of some quality.  However, too expensive for a moisturizer that is just as good as something else for half the price.  As mentioned, I see absolutely no improvement in wrinkle appearance and mine aren&#x27;t even all that bad or noticeable.  I won&#x27;t buy this again but will use what&#x27;s left as it does have a pleasant smell and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product in the past and I liked it. I sent an email to the company because this product was below standard and they never contacted me. Felt like there are bits of sand and dirt in the product and it was horrible!</li>
            <li> I love this cream and use it day and night after the oil treatment or another serum. It doesn&#x27;t irritate, doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or dry it out. It is natural and safe to use. I&#x27;d recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> Ordered my first jar of Bel Essence just a couple weeks ago.......AMAZING! Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am 40 years old and have dry skin and wrinkles in my under eye area. These wrinkles are something that has effected me every day for the last year....especially when I do my makeup. Concealer does not lay right  on wrinkles....powder makes them look worse. It&#x27;s been an endless battle.&lt;br /&gt;So now onto my miracle Bel Essence....I use this before bed in a more heavy application and a very light application in the morning before applying my primer. My skin is so soft and hydrated....Im in love! And the miracle is my under eye dryness and wrinkles disapearing before my eyes...literally! NO JOKE!</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks the oils separated and even after stirring they would not coagulate again. Very messy and greasy. Contacted customer service and they said to stir it. :(((</li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier than expected :) I am enjoying this night cream. I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel. I am trying to replace all my face products for more natural ones. So far this is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream to replace another moisturizer that had been discontinued.  With my sensitive, acne-prone skin I am always hesitant to try a new product.  I have used this cream for several weeks without any problems.  My skin feels much softer.  I have already purhcased another jar!</li>
            <li> I just received this product a few days ago and immediately i could feel a difference in my skin. It is very smooth and looks brighter. Even my husband noticed the positive change.  Excited to continue using this product</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a few months ago and at first I really liked it. Although when I reviewed it, I had only been using it for about 2 weeks. Well, it&#x27;s been a few months now and I find that my skin tends to be dried out now. Not sure what happened..maybe the summer sun. I used it only at night before going to bed. Perhaps I should use it twice a day during the hot summer sun, but I&#x27;m going back to my faithful bioelement products.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t go by reviews, but I had to check this out. I&#x27;ve had this for about a week and I can already notice the difference in my skin. Many of the reviews on here will same the same exact thing I just said, but THIS STUFF WORKS!! I&#x27;ve been suffering from dry, dull skin, with a little bit of breakouts here and there and this cream fixed all of that and then some. This little baby kicked up my results to all new level that I didn&#x27;t even think was possible. Feel like I have my youthful 20 yr old glow back. Will be using this product for a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this and love the fact that it&#x27;s made up of all natural ingredients.  Have already recommended to friends.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and tried many facial creams.&lt;br /&gt;Some of them seem to work for a while and then does not work any more after a while.&lt;br /&gt;This one is not oily but somehow keeps my face moist and never dries it out.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to use it much, just a very thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd jar and after 3 months of being without it I decided I needed to start using Bel Essence again.  Price on Amazon is a little better than my first purchase of this product.  I only apply a minimal amount at bedtime and when I wake I find my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  I have no wrinkles and I credit to Bel Essence to helping me maintain that &amp;#34;no wrinkle&amp;#34; appearance.  Also like the fact that it is &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this as a nighttime moisturizer and I agree with other reviews - it feels super-soft and lovely.  It&#x27;s not exactly light in texture (texture is kind of \\&quot;whipped\\&quot;), but not at all greasy.  I love how it feels.  I don&#x27;t have enough wrinkles (here in my middle 40&#x27;s) to know if they are magically disappearing, but my expectations of moisturizers are not stratospheric ;)</li>
            <li> Finally got this, very late because of a mixup on the Postal Service&#x27;s part. The seller offered a full refund (not just the shipping fee) to make up for it, so the book is closed on that one. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream- it&#x27;s the best, and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of the most expensive ones. Before this, I always went store-bought. Finally decided to put my faith in market economics, viewed the top-rated skin creams on amazon with an eye for natural ingredients, and wound up here. It works wonders in just a few hours, and moisturizes better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before, and isn&#x27;t oily at ALL! Really amazing. I think I&#x27;ve found my life long-skin product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom -- she has very dry, very red skin. her skin is especially dry and crepey above her eyes and she regularly applies five moisturizing products a day, but they do not keep her moisturized long term. we noticed that the crepey look reduced almost immediately upon application, and over several days, the overall redness has significantly decreased. she especially loves that she only needs to apply this one product twice a day, am and pm, and no longer feels the need to layer products, which was ineffective anyway. this has made such a difference in a few short days, we are anxious to see what the long term results are! definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time and I absolutely LOVE IT!  It leaves my face with the right amount of moisture with out the greasy heavy feeling.  I&#x27;ve already noticed the difference in my skin after only using it for a few weeks.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 31 year old male.  One Sunday at church, my friend was laughing and I noticed lines around his eyes.  He&#x27;s 29.  At that moment, I realized I needed to try and prolong my youthful appearance for as long as possible.  I bought some Clarin&#x27;s Double Serum.  It&#x27;s expensive.  I used that for a while and liked the results.  I used about a bottle of that a month for around five months.  Again, it&#x27;s expensive.  Decided to try this out because of the reviews and the cost.  Best decision I&#x27;ve made in a while.  The seller set me up with a promotional free bottle after my first bottle too.  No hoops to jump through, just solid customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive, oily skin.  Teenage acne scars.  I&#x27;m hesitant to put moisturizing products on my face because of my oily skin.  I don&#x27;t want acne either.  At first, I thought this would make my skin more oily.  So I tried a little bit at a time.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily or shiny.  I don&#x27;t know how, but it doesn&#x27;t.  It absorbs the oil and shine on my face somehow.  I use it in the morning before work, sometimes after work when I wash my face and then right before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it works better than Clarin&#x27;s Double Serum.  It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell.  It&#x27;s pretty much odorless in my opinion.  It makes my skin look bright and healthy.  Not all old and worn out.  Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily at all.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I can definitely notice a difference in the way my skin feels.  It feels very smooth and soft.  It&#x27;s a solid product and for the price, it&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  If you buy it from the same seller I bought it from, all the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t write reviews too often, so I hope this review helps you with your purchase.  If you suffer from acne, look into pantothenic acid.</li>
            <li> Despite some rave reviews, this product is not anything special. Slightly greasy with a strong lanolin scent, I regret buying this product. I&#x27;ll stick with Murad, Lancome or Clinque. It may or may not have been the cause of recent breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother buying this. A case of skewed reviews.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing, although I am only a 41-year-old guy with a few lines on his forehead, I had been using oil of olay products ever since I was in my teens. Having very fair skin, blond hair blue eyes, lots of sun exposure, I wanted something that had proven results from users. I&#x27;m not can I say I look 31 by using this stuff but I can&#x27;t tell how smooth my face is in the morning when I wake up. Another benefit is there is no leftover residue on my pillow, and the biggest bonus of them all is that I can pronounce every single ingredient listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we learn more and more about the environment and what mother nature has given us, all of these natural oils combined and used regularly could never be a bad thing. No, it&#x27;s not Botox. But if you start early. Use regularly. A little goes a long way and thus bring back some shine to skin that is extra dry in my case, and absolutely no problems with blemishes or redness and I do have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish this didn&#x27;t have as SPF protectant but since I use it at night, it doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;ll use my Neutrogena during the sunny days. Some people want to know so I will give you an estimate that you will probably get two months out of this jar using it generously one time, maybe one month using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I usually buy cheaper moisturizers, but wanted to try something that would work better and was all natural. This seemed like a great find. I used the entire jar with no noticeable difference. It wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing, so I was putting on a different moisturizer on top of this one, which defeats the purpose! I contacted the company for a refund and was ignored. Won&#x27;t make this mistake again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about six months.  Although I don&#x27;t see any huge improvements, my skin is soft.  This cream is non-greasy which I love because I wear contact lenses.  I have used this primarily as a night cream, but I have used it on occasion as a day cream as well.  I bought a second jar.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old and my skin soaks Bel Essence up like it needs it. It is especially helpful to use it during the winter since I live in a cold climate which can be hard on the skin and indoors the heat can be drying. If I don&#x27;t use Bel Essence to properly moisturize, my skin is not happy! I am allergic to a lot of products, so I like that it has natural ingredients that work for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after scouring the internet for hours trying to find a good face cream.  After reading all the reviews I thought I had found the magic potion.  I was very disappointed to find that not only does the product stink so bad I don&#x27;t like to wear it even just at night, but I was always waking up to a very oily face. It&#x27;s kind of like putting smelly Vaseline on your face.</li>
            <li> Have had this Feb 2014 and its now 3-4 months and I have to say this is as good as it gets! My skin is so sensitive that after this window of time without breakouts, I am convinced this is my staple hoot daily face cream.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all-natural skin care product that would leave my skin feeling smooth and looking healthy.  I feel like I found it with this product.  I have only been using it for a few weeks now, but my skin already feels softer and looks brighter.  I am hopeful that in the coming weeks I can also add that it has reduced wrinkles.  I am very satisfied with this product and will continue to use it.  It is a relief to have found an all natural product that makes my skin feel so good!</li>
            <li> I have so very many other face products, varying from drugstore types to very expensive department store and online only purchases. I am constantly searching for the perfect products for my skin, which seems to be changing not just with the seasons, but over the years. Prior to using Bel Essence, I was using a two types of serums, and then a moisturizer during the day, and then a serum and night cream at night, but now I love Bel Essence so much, I am using only my eye cream and Bel Essence, and no other serums or creams. It melts into my skin and makes it so soft! I love the ingredients in it and that its so pure. It didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout, which I am prone to. I have recommended it to friends and family who also love it. You should definitely try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like that this product was made from natural ingredients and intends to have an &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; effect.  It is still too soon for me to tell if it will have this effect, but it does make my skin feel smooth and moisturized (and it&#x27;s currently winter, when I have more dry skin issues).  I was initially worried that my face would break out due to the oils in the cream and how thick it is (it&#x27;s almost like a body cream) but so far no breakout whatsoever.  I look forward to seeing the results with continued use.</li>
            <li> I would like to say I&#x27;ve been using Bel Essence All-natural anti-wrinkle treatment for a couple of weeks and my skin feels smoother and moisturized. I live in the Southwest so the air is extremely dry. I am 46 years old and it seems to help give my skin a natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Angela</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the natural ingredients and because it&#x27;s purpose is to nurture my skin.  I use it twice a day.  It works great as a moisturizer under make-up making my skin softer but not leaving it oily or greasy.  It does not cause my make-up to cake or flake off like some other creams do.&lt;br /&gt;Being natural and unscented, it does not have a flowery fragrance like many creams but does not leave any lingering odor.  I want some more!</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful I would love this product.  I have been using it for about 10 days, only at night.  Today I am going to begin using it in the AM also to see if I see any positive results.  My face is dry and very sensitive.  I have to be very cautious about what I use.  I have had some unpleasant reactions to even high-end moisturizers.  Thank heaven, no reactions. I like the consistency and light scent which disappears.  However, I don&#x27;t see any improvement in my face.  If anything, it feels drier.  I did not return this product because I don&#x27;t hate it.  I will keep trying it in the AM and PM to see if it just takes time.  I am tired of purchasing facial care products only to find instead of improvement I see/feel no improvement or drier skin.  I have tried numerous brands at all prices.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Bel Essence Cream. It is an absolutely amazing product. I have had one month to try it and from day one my skin is in love with this cream. My skin is so well nourished with all of the natural ingredients and I have such a glow. I am 53 years old and am so proud of my skin and no one believes that I could be in my 50&#x27;s! I use it on my face morning and night...and on my neck and chest area. It is not greasy and yet gives you a youthful natural glow that is baby soft to touch. This cream has replaced everything else in my cabinet.  I also use the Bel Essence Organic Oil....OMG! I can not wait to use these products every single day. I would recommend to anyone who searches for products for their skin to try these two products. You will not want to waste your money ever again on expensive products that have hidden additives and chemicals. Thanks and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.</li>
            <li> I actually wanted to wait a while to see how the product is before I send this message. It&#x27;s been almost 2 months that I have been using Bel Essence, and it&#x27;s been my main source of facial moisturizer for this winter. I find the cream to be very moisturizing for my facial skin. My face feels more moisturized than before, but I am not sure if it&#x27;s reducing the appearance of or preventing my face from forming new wrinkles, such as on my forehead, both sides adjacent to my nose as I smile/laugh, and around my eyes. My husband says he doesn&#x27;t notice any difference in terms of my facial skin in the past 2 years, so I don&#x27;t know. This product is definitely a good moisturizer, but I can&#x27;t say in regards to toning the skin and reducing wrinkles. It&#x27;s only been 2 months since I used it, so that could also make a difference. Perhaps I just need to use it more often daily for a longer period of time in order to tell.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  It  smells terrific and is great for my sensitive skin.  Leaves skin soft and moisturized.  No negatives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for almost a month and the product is not worth the money. I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles so I expected better results - phttttttt!!!!!</li>
            <li> I seem to have trouble finding a face cream for my skin type.  For example, Oil of Olay products don&#x27;t do much for me. I purchased this on the strength of the reviews.  I really like it.  It looks, in the jar, as though it would be greasy, but it is not on the face.  It absorbs beautifully.  I&#x27;ve found a new face cream! It is worth the price that I paid ($33 or so). It arrived sooner than promised.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It makes my skin feel softer and helps reduce my wrinkles.  I have received compliments as to how good my face looks after using.  I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobbye Semryck</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews for this product I was really excited.  The lotion itself feels great on the skin, but it smells kind of like olives.  In the reviews I read people were describing it as toasted almond or vanilla.  Mine does not smell like that at all.  I checked for expiration dates but did not see any.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 20 years old, but after using any type of face wash, my skin immediately tightens and flakes (actively looking for the right face wash), but I&#x27;ve been using this every day/night for about 5 or 6 months now and I am just starting to see the bottom of the jar. Like many other reviewers said, you do NOT need a lot of this product, I dab my one finger in it and make tiny dots on my face, focusing on the dryest areas, then rub the dots in. It&#x27;s light but it moisturizes so well and leaves you with a dewy complexion as long as you don&#x27;t use too much, then you just look shiny (you will quickly find out how much is too much for you). It&#x27;s never too early to start using an anti-aging cream (especially an all-natural one!), plus I stay out of the sun usually to avoid tanning. I also think it did help with my slight laugh lines, but they were hardly noticeable to begin with, I just looked closely with a flashlight and they seem to have disappeared. I&#x27;d say give it a try! It was worth my money and I am very frugal (you could say cheap...) :) I plan to buy another jar once mines runs out.   EDIT: I guess they changed the ingredients or how it was made, I&#x27;m on my 4th jar and now they have these grainy sand-like particles in it, it&#x27;s so annoying to put on my face and have to wipe off. At first I thought there was just some on the top, but it&#x27;s throughout the whole jar of lotion. I thought I found a product I&#x27;d use forever. I don&#x27;t like this new formula. :( I&#x27;m definitely not gonna buy this anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a month now and I LOVE it! I have been using a well known anti aging cream for the last 12 or so years and I started to notice some fine lines on my face. I wanted to get away from all the chemicals in the big name cosmetics. In a month my skin has noticeably changed, my pores look smaller, skin tone is more even and the fine lines are not noticeable, and my skin feels smoother.  I highly recommend this cream, especially for people who are looking for more natural products.</li>
            <li> Nice and creamy. Not sure any renovation takes place</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for wrinkles (I have been using this for over 3 months now), but is a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> good product, smells great, not greasy.  does not cause acne, even though my skin is very acne prone.  Happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive dry skin &amp; I&#x27;d just started an over the counter retnoid product, that was making my skin dry &amp; flaky. I saw an online review for bel essence &amp; thought I would try it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now &amp; my skin is no longer dry &amp; flaky. All of the redness is gone &amp; my skin is soft &amp; actually has a dewey look. Considering I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s &amp; I&#x27;ve spent way too many summers in the sun, that&#x27;s huge! You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this product, so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the reviews are great and let me tell you that I am so happy that I ordered. Bel Essence All Natural Anti Wrinkle cream is an amazing product!! No more Dr. Hauskca for me. Has a good consistency, thick but not greasy and the aroma is so natural. I can really see the difference on my skin next day, glowing!!!! Ready for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an everyday lotion that I like for years, and I have definitely found that lotion. I&#x27;m 32 and this lotion is perfect for a 30 something year old&#x27;s skin. It&#x27;s rich and lightweight without being greasy. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a review I read on Neutrogena&#x27;s antiwrinkle cream.  I love the texture...it&#x27;s creamy and smooth.  It has a light vanilla scent, which I find pleasant.  I feel it moisturizes pretty well.  When I initially used it, I could tell my skin soaked it up.  Now that it&#x27;s been a few months, it feels slightly less moisturizing...I feel a slight tightness to my skin as if I didn&#x27;t moisturize.  Hard to say if it&#x27;s because of the Neutrogena product I have on underneath, or if my skin has just become accustomed to the new moisturizer.  In terms of wrinkle treatment, nothing has changed.  I&#x27;m 38 years old with fine smile lines and forehead lines.  I took pictures before I started using the product, and I can say there has been no improvement in that realm.  I DO like how soft my skin feels after using this product, so it&#x27;s likely I&#x27;d purchase this again just for that fact alone.</li>
            <li> Until I hit my 50s I never even noticed my neck!  All of a sudden it&#x27;s all I can see. I have tried several times through the years to use a moisturizer on my neck, however, it would always break out. After reading all the reviews I thought I would try Bel Essence. I am SO happy that I did!  I&#x27;ve used almost a full bottle and not a breakout at all and I swear my neck is super soft and looks better than ever.  The fragrance is just a plus - it&#x27;s wonderful!  And let&#x27;s not forget my face.  I wear it under make-up to work and my face glows.  On the weekend, Bel is the only thing on my face.  I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing at all to help my skin - in fact I think it made my wrinkles more prominent.  I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with a product with so many 5 &amp; 4 star reviews, but it turns out the company offers a free jar for a review, and I&#x27;m thinking that colored many of the reviews quite a bit.  I don&#x27;t want a free jar, in fact I&#x27;m throwing the one I have out and going back to neutrogena - even Nivea is more effective than this (and a lot cheaper).  Maybe it actually did work well for some people, but it didn&#x27;t for me.  I wish I&#x27;d known about the little bribe before I&#x27;d purchased this - I may have been more cynical.</li>
            <li> It feels like I rubbed grease on my face. It doesn&#x27;t absorb. I apply it before bed and although it&#x27;s very greasy, when I wake up my skin feels very dry. It&#x27;s bizarre. I ordered this because it has so many great reviews, but I feel like I was tricked. It turns out the company offers a free jar for a review. When I saw the piece of paper with that little bribe on it I suspected I might be in trouble. I regret giving this company my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a month and not only have I seen no results...but it made me break out. I guess the natural does not always work.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product and am starting to see great results.  I look forward to looking at other skin care products in this line. Definitely worth a shot to try for your skin issues.</li>
            <li> I only used this for ONE day.. and have EXTREMELY dry skin.  After one application before bed and another before makeup this morning I can tell a difference already!  MUST HAVE product for youthful skin!</li>
            <li> I have used this cream now for 3 weeks...together with a vitamin C/hyaluronic acid serum and another matrixyl 3000 serum (mornings) and another fresh application in the late afternoon of just Bel Essence. At night I use a retinol cream, Bel Essence and Maracuja oil. I am seeing slow but positive changes to my wrinkles and texture. I will keep this up until the jars are empty (perhaps another 3 weeks) and reassess the results. I am 65 and these wrinkles didn&#x27;t get here overnight, and I don&#x27;t expect them to go away in 45 days. However, I do expect improvement...and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m seeing now.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed by this product. It does have a very thick consistency and the smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant but it works really well with my skin. I have combination dry/oily skin. Usually when I change products, my skin breaks out a lot. My skin did have to get use to the change but it did not take long. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way. I just dab a little from the lid on my fingertips and I rub it on my face before bed and wake up with soft hydrated skin. It even helped my BF after he had gotten a sunburn on his face. I put it on his face after a long day in the sun and his redness went way down by the next morning.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT....MY SKIN RESPONDS TO IT NICELY...IT SEEMS TO ABSORB READILY INTO THE SKIN AND HAS A PLEASANT SCENT.</li>
            <li> Well, I am only half way through my jar and have been using this product for 3 weeks. I think I can honestly appraise this cream since enough time has gone by. I can usually tell if a product is going to irritate my finicky skin right away. The litmus test for me is using a skin care product under my eyes. I apply it at night around eyes. In the morning if they are swollen or worse I will not use it again. This product resulted in perfect eyes the next morning! AND not only that,  but the millia I had disappeared after a couple weeks of using this under my eyes! I had been using a Alba Botanica product that must have been a little pore clogging but this cleared it up. I do like this cream on my face as well. But I really like it best for under my eyes. It does sting a little if it gets in eye but that&#x27;s not Bel&#x27;s fault! This cream has a really nice thickness to it- just right. The smell of it can make me hungry! It smells good enough to eat! I really think it has been the best cream I have tried in a very long time. It does not make me break out or get hive bumps. This has happened several times with other really great products- just not great for me. So this product is a keeper. I have not seen any other improvements to my over 50 sundamaged skin, but the missing millia is amazing. I do expect to see improvements as that takes time and this product deserves a good try. I will update review with any improvements I see on face but for now I do love what it does for the skin around my eyes. It is good under my eyemakeup. Though it is thicker it does not cause my eyeliner or mascara to wander as my last product did. It is an enjoyable product to use!</li>
            <li> I have just started using Bel Essence and already I see a noticeable change in the texture of my skin.  My face seems to be much smoother and suppler than before.  It also has a light and pleasant fragrance, unlike other moisturizers I have used  including the ones that claimed to be unscented.  I would recommend this for anyone looking to use a product with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I do not like this as its not a cream. I thought I received a bad jar. My jar, once opened, has loads of oil on the top of it and clumps of white cream in the oil. I kept stirring it thinking that it had settled during shipping, no it remains that way in the jar.  I did not notice any difference when I applied it to my skin except that it was extremely oily.  The pictures are misleading as they show a thick cream. NONE of which I received in my jar. Just oil at the top of the jar and clumps of cream.  Waste of my $$</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the positive reviews for this product.  It literally feels (and smells!) like rubbing your face with ham grease.  Due to the smell, I would never wear it in public.  Furthermore, even suffering through it at night, I don&#x27;t feel it worked very well. On top of all that, I got no response from the company when I tried to claim my free extra product.  Three strikes in my book.</li>
            <li> I have very much enjoyed this cream. I cannot truly vouch for its anti-wrinkle abilities as that is difficult to measure, but it is a wonderful moisturizer with ingredients I feel I can trust. It absorbs into my skin easily and has a light vanilla fragrance which comes from real, not imitation vanilla. I definitely will continue to buy this product just for its ingredient list and moisturizing effect. Hopefully fewer wrinkles may be a side benefit as well. The seller this comes from, Fast Shipping Supplements, is also very easy to do business with.</li>
            <li> Feels good, but smells really strong, if you accidentally touch your eyes with your fingers after using it, get ready for pain!</li>
            <li> Tried this product due to someone else&#x27;s review of it. I just ordered my third jar this week. Started noticing visible results during the use of my second jar. I have very oily skin and enlarged pores in the T-zone area. My face isn&#x27;t any less oily but it also doesn&#x27;t seem to make it more oily throughout the day. However I am using two products to help control the oil, but I was already doing that before I began using Bel Essence. One oil control product is applied under my BB cream and one is in the BB cream. I do not use any additional liquid foundation. I also use a pressed powder for oily skin. I have noticed that the pores on my nose are much less enlarged, I have less breakouts and the large wrinkles on my forehead are not as deep and some are barely visible now. I was given a Mary Kay product to try to get rid of a dark spot on my forehead. I never had wrinkles until I tried the Mary Kay product. After using it, my dark spot was gone but I was left with four wrinkles on my forehead. I do not have wrinkles anywhere else on my face.  This Bel Essence is the first product I have tried in over two years that actually made a difference in these wrinkles. The only thing I have noticed about this product is that the consistency was different in each jar. I&#x27;m hoping that this third jar will be like my second jar. It was creamier and applied more smoothly. My husband uses it once a day and absolutely loves it. He has psoriasis and eczema. We will stick with this product as long as it continues to be consistent and works well. I use it twice a day. The jar lasts about two months for the both of us.</li>
            <li> I use this as an under eye cream, and it works wonders. I love, love loveeee the smell! It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; smell, but a naturally sweet smell.The consistency of this cream is pretty thick, so the old adage &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34; applies..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty pricey, but given how long this little container lasts, it probably evens out to be a similar value to less expensive creams. I just wish they made it in a bigger container/pump bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar and love it..Smell is light and feel&#x27;s great on face.  Work&#x27;s great for dry skin...Really help&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cream for the money but I wouldn&#x27;t say it works miracles. My skin looks lovely and healthy when I wear it and it adds a lovely glow to my skin. Lightly scented and all natural I think it was well worth the money. As an added bonus, I happened to us it on my eczema which it has healed.</li>
            <li> This moisurizer feels very nice on my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for several days and really like it. I have not broken out even though this product contains so many oils. It quickly soaks into my skin, not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this is that I cannot apply the cream close to my eyes, as they have a tendency to tear up when it gets on my lashes. They don&#x27;t redden or itch, but I don&#x27;t like watery eyes, so it is not applied on my lids. Besides that, it makes my skin soft and has a very light, pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone else mentioned, it&#x27;s not a miracle cure. However, I like what it has done for my skin and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> its nice i like it...smells fine...its a mosturiser not a miracle...it will make ur face soft but dont expect wrinkles to vanish...for that u need retin A and acid treatments...then use this cream for moisture...</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and though it&#x27;s full of oils from various good sources, doesn&#x27;t clog pores or cause pimples.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but I will continue buying it because it&#x27;s such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Rich formula of all natural goodies for your skin!  I have been using this since March of 2014 and am getting great results!  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with acne prone skin. Many of the lotions and creams break me out. So mostly I buy from nearest drug store, use it for 2 times if it breaks my skin I return the item. So I am not into buying cream online for the very first time. Seeing the reviews I thought it might work so I got it. I have been using it for the last 2 months and the cream is very good. Good moisturizer... No breakouts from using this cream. And about anti aging properties I think it might take some time to comment about it. But definitely better than very strong anti aging chemical cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I was originally using Ageless and then starting using Bel Essence. My skin feels so soft and stays soft and supple until the next morning. I use Bel Essence in conjunction with Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum and Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Daily Face Peel, Original Strength. I don&#x27;t know which of the three products is working or if they just all work well together, but I have been using all of them for 3 months and the difference is amazing. No more crows feet around my eyes and the deep crease between my eyebrows has diminished. In addition, the appearance of large pores and smile/laugh lines have diminished as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream lasts forever. A little bit goes a long way. There is a slight vanilla fragrance that is very, very light. I used Ageless again the other day, and it felt like I was rubbing perfumed water on my face compared to the Bel Essence cream. I just bought my second jar and the consistency in quality remains as well. Very satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that I waited to write this review after using this product for 3 months, and therefore did not receive a free jar of cream that would make my review a biased one.</li>
            <li> It reviews as good stuff.  It arrived with a broken lid, I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to spoil.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL moisturizer! I couldn&#x27;t be happier about the quality or results of this moisturizer. I use it when I am feeling too lazy to do my usual hyaluronic serum and Aragon oil routine, and it works like a dream. It smells wonderful too-not to heavily scented though! Looking forward to using it everyday this winter!</li>
            <li> Nice.  Moisturizing.  Smells pretty.  Love it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Life changing! Love it so much I&#x27;ve purchased it for others to experience.</li>
            <li> I have Hashimoto disease and dry skin is just one of the many issues that comes with. This product is amazing, and has smoothed away my smile lines, as well as the dreaded &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; between my eyebrows. Will continue to buy!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product, little too heavy and reach for face. I use it for my lips. Works great. My lips are smooth and free of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday natural moisturizer.  I love the ingredients, and my skin drinks it in every night.  I have allergy problems with many products, but this is great for EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> After looking around for a good anti-aging cream, I decided to purchased this product mainly because it contains many natural products: Avocado, Grapeseed, Sesame, Almond, Argan, Shea, Coconut, Meadowfoam Seed and Kukui oils. I tried other more expensive products, but I was actually surprised at how well this cream works for my skin.I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It makes your face feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> Love all the natural ingredients.  Great for skin!  I also use it on the back of my hands to help with wrinkles!</li>
            <li> The Bel Essence Anti Wrinkle Treatment is a very nice product. It has a great texture, goes on smooth, and leaves skin feeling moist but not greasy.I like this better than some of the much more pricey products that I have tried by skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> This is the best one out of four that I tried so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 weeks on my face at night. My skin definitely feels softer and looks plumper and more hydrated than before. Good for dry patches too. It&#x27;s on the pricey side but a little goes a long way. Great product</li>
            <li> Awesome ! Very light! Got sooo many compliments on my face after using for about 2 or 3 weeks! Fast and great seller!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry. Best face cream. At first it feels very thick but you get used to it. Has a wonderful smell and makes slin look noticeably more youthful!</li>
            <li> Funny thing, the first time I used it, it had an amazing softening effect on face. But only the very  first time. Now  it&#x27;s back to normal. But I still like it, though I may not buy again because of the cost.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or what, but mine smelled like kitchen oil that was past its prime. For that amount of money, the product should smell good.</li>
            <li> This item, to me, is just okay.  I bought it after reading a really convincing review.  Luckily, my skin is, and always has been, nice for my age (57).  I can&#x27;t say that this item is any better than any others on the market.  I even bought the other one suggested in the review to go along with this one.  Not sure I would purchase it again, but it&#x27;s not a bad thing.  :)</li>
            <li> Too expensive and did nothing for me. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this. It was greasy and didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything for me. It made me smell like a tart tropezienne( French pastry). I ended up just using it for my hands.</li>
            <li> I like this product. But I didn&#x27;t really feel like it was doing anything &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; related. I did like how it was so gentle.. I could use it around my eyes and not have any irritation... other, stronger lotions sting my eyes sometimes if not made for eyes... so this is nice as an all-over face lotion when I&#x27;m out of eye cream.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, this stuff makes my skin moist again.</li>
            <li> I ordered based on the good reviews of other people.  I can&#x27;t say this worked for me.  After 2 weeks of use, my face has a lot of breakouts (I and never had acne) all over my face.  I stopped using it and the breakouts went away.  A waste of my money because I could have gotten any other cream and probably save money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is phenomenal - moisturizing, smells great, but doesn&#x27;t cause breakout.  I love the natural oils.  I need more moisture now since I&#x27;m 50, but I still break out easy, so this stuff is a god-send.  It totally minimizes lines/wrinkles.  I also love the Bel Essence Oil.  I use both - the oil is really healing for my skin and soaks in, but the lotion seems to stay longer, and is great for under makeup.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. What a joke! Product is not FDA approved. The smell is awful. Returned. Then seller tried to charge me for shipping and it was listed as free shipping. Had to get Amazon customer support involved. Doesn&#x27;t work. It burns, itches, and irritates skin.</li>
            <li> this cream feels luscious on the skin.  I read a recommendation from someone else on this cream and decided to try it and I have loved it.  I live in a desert and we get very dry skin, but not with this cream.  it is not at all oily, though has lots of oils in it but makes the skin super smooth and hydrated/</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic!  Makes my skin so smooth and soft!  A little bit goes a long way so use sparingly. Will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Does nothing to improve skin, wrinkles, etc.  Only positive comment is that itmis odorless! Complete&lt;br /&gt;waste of money!</li>
            <li> Something is wrong with the 2nd bottle of this cream.  It smells terrible and I have to throw it away.  It&#x27;s normally wonderful, but when I opened this jar, wow, a crazy bad smell.  I&#x27;m out of the window for a return but am concerned about ordering it again. If Big Health, LLC reads this maybe we can make an arrangement and I&#x27;ll try it again.  It&#x27;s usually very nice and has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing miraculous about this.  It&#x27;s a moisturizer, like any other.  However, since distilled water is it&#x27;s first ingredient, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have much body.  I&#x27;m just going to make my own with the next listed ingredients, like avocado and coconut oil.  Love coconut oil</li>
