            <li>I absolutely love the Pro-Health line.</li>
            <li>I have to preface this by saying that I am a BzzAgent and received this product for free from the company in exchange for my opinion - which I will give .. honestly.  </li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a free sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t leave a residue on my mouth or teeth and the taste was ok.</li>
            <li>And we could all use some tartar control :)</li>
            <li>I received this mouthwash as a trial for bzzAgent for free!</li>

            <li>I was able to join a free test of Crest&#x27;s ProHealth Tarter Protection Mouthwash challenge!</li>
            <li>Even though I got this product free for testing, the opinions I post here are my own and have not been paid for by Crest or the BzzAgent...</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>we love it</li>
            <li>, I tend to like mouthwash that is more of a cinnamon flavor the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this Alcohol Free mouthwash!</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t burn and is refreshing.</li>
            <li>And I feel more confident about going to the dentist after using this because it helps to control tarter and plaque build up for 12 hours</li>
            <li>I love the after taste that does NOT burn my mouth like most others do to me.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it does not burn.  </li>
            <li>This mouth wash tasted much better than listerine</li>

            <li>and it makes your mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>This is the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li>The Crest does a wonderful job on keeping my breath fresh for about a 1 1/2 hours that I can notice directly.</li>
            <li>and I can easily use it more than once a day (which I do sometimes).</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong and it what most people would come to expect in a mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>The #1 greatest thing I love is it doesn&#x27;t sting my mouth when swishing and the clean feeling last!</li>
            <li>However, after a recent free sample was sent my way via BzzAgent, I have to say that this product really impressed me.</li>
            <li>Brushing my teeth seem to work a bit more easy and the clean feeling lasts a bit longer!</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling clean!</li>
            <li>Still leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and clean!</li>
            <li>I recieved this product free, from Crest, through BzzAgent and all opinions are original and my own.</li>
            <li>A clean, healthy mouth that shines with no cavities or tartar-cannot ask for much more.</li>
            <li>(Although I did receive a free bottle of Crest Pro-Health Tarter Protection to try through a promotion, my opinions expressed here are my own pure honest views of the product)</li>

            <li>The best part is, it keeps my mouth feeling clean and fresh way longer than other brands of popular mouthwashes out</li>
            <li>If I had to change anything or improve anything about it, i wish it was fouride free but other than that it&#x27;s a GREAT mouthwash!</li>
            <li>I thought that this product worked fine.</li>

            <li>Since I&#x27;m a huge coffee and tea drinker, I also appreciate that fact that it helps to ward off surface stains.</li>
            <li>If you like using Crest toothpaste this mouthwash has the same great minty taste.</li>

            <li>I am trying this free with Crest.  </li>
            <li>I got it free to try from @CrestPtoHealth</li>
            <li>Though I was relatively pleased with the result of the alternative brand, the burning sensation I felt with every use was too intense to be enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this mouthwash compared to others that I&#x27;ve used mostly because of the not so intense mint flavor and</li>
            <li>With a high (10.8%) alcohol content, it sure as heck burns my mouth!.  </li>
            <li>special thanks to Buzzagent and Crest for letting me test this product for free, however, the opinion of this review is 100% my own.</li>

            <li>I got a free full size bottle of the Crest Pro-Health Multi-Care mouthwash from Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I have seen a significant decrease in tartar buildup and looking forward to continue using this product moving forward.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think there is anything that makes the brand unique.</li>
            <li>After swishing with this, I noticed my breath was fresh for hours!</li>
            <li>So thank you, BzzAgent, for allowing me to try this complimentary for review purposes!</li>
            <li>although I will admit, I do use a small amount after meals to help keep my chompers looking great!</li>
            <li>What excited me about this product was that it fought against surface stains.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels significantly healthier.</li>
            <li>It gives you a tingly sensation that makes your mouth feel clean, but it does not have a burn that alcohol gives.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest, I was pleased to try Crest Pro-health Tartar Protection Mouthwash for free to help reduce tartar build-up and plaque.</li>
            <li>However, Crest Pro-health Tartar Protection Mouthwash provides a clean feeling mouth with fresher breath without any burning sensation.</li>

            <li>First, it didn&#x27;t sting as much and had a really nice flavor.</li>
            <li>It helps making your weaker teeth more strong, helps with the tartar that builds up on your teeth, helps with stains that you my have, I m a coffee drinker all day so that is a big plus for me , and most importantly, when rinsing with it you get a nice feeling of clean as you switch it around your mouth without the initial stinging and burning feel.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash for about a week, thanks to bzzagent.com, and so far I have nothing but good things to say.</li>
            <li>Started using this a few weeks ago when I received a free sample from Crest through Bzz agent and the product is great.</li>
            <li>Loved it, left my mouth feeling fresh, without that overly antiseptic taste.</li>
            <li>In only one week usin this product 2 times daily you would see the tartar of your theeth reduce in 95% so this is awesome.</li>
            <li>I did receive this for free for review from BzzAgent, but I am giving my own personal review...</li>
            <li>My teeth felt smooth and if touched, my gums also felt smooth and clean (no icky build up at all).</li>
            <li>The taste was so much better than other brands I have tried, even my teenagers liked it.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>I was SUPER excited - and slightly skeptical - when Crest sent this to try for free from BzzAgent (#GotItFree), but I am impressed!  </li>
            <li>One thing that would be nice is if this variety came in some other flavors, especially unique ones that other brands do not have available!</li>
            <li>A special thanks to Buzzagent and crest for letting me test this product for free</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean and fresh that I&#x27;ve used it more than twice  a day on certain occasions or after certain dishes.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection has to be my new favorite mouthwash.</li>
            <li>My first BzzAgent product was this mouthwash from Crest!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone and will buy it again for sure!</li>
            <li>I have found great results in as little as 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t burn too much, keeps your tartar to a minimum, and leaves your mouth super minty and fresh, then this is the mouthwash for you!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying this product free thanks to Crest through BzzAgent as part of a promotion from the brand.  </li>
            <li>I am using this product for free thanks to crest.</li>
            <li>Thanks BuzzAgent for letting me try a free sample.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest for sending me this product for free to try and review</li>
            <li>I recieved this product for free to test out thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>The whole family really enjoy using Crest Pro Health every morning and night.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Buzzagent and Crest for letting me test this product for free.</li>
            <li>I recieved cres pro health tartar protection for free thanks to bzzagent.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Buzzagent and crest for letting me test this product for free</li>
            <li>/&gt;The downside of this is that&lt;br /&gt;You get a burning sensation when you are rinsing your mouth but later on put warm water in your mouth for after rinse&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the taste.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh minty taste of Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection with Fluoride mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary bottle of Crest ProHealth Tartar Protection for the purposes of review</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m not crazy about the taste.</li>
            <li>The fresh taste lasted for hours and after a couple of uses my teeth felt smoother &amp; just knowing that it contains fluoride</li>
            <li>This is the product that is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth feel so fresh and even in between brushes</li>
            <li>When my bottle is done I will definitely get more to keep the tartar off my teeth since brushing alone without using this will lead to more buildup and more scraping when I go to the dentist in the next three months.</li>
            <li>and I am definitely seeing great results and so far I have zero complaints.</li>
            <li>Leave a fresh sesation on your mouth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn but still leaves your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>The girls at work are noticing my smile is whiter</li>
            <li>I am glad that I was fortunate enough to get to try this product out as part of a promotional offer through BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li>After using this product a couple weeks I have notice a change in fresher breath and a smile I am no longer ashamed of.</li>
            <li>The only downside is you&#x27;re not supposed to eat or drink anything for thirty minutes after using the wash but other than that- great product!</li>
            <li>and it makes my whole mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, but strong enough.  </li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>I really like how clean my mouth feels after using this wash.  </li>
            <li>I especially like that I now feel more confident that my back teeth are getting a more complete clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Much like a dentist visit or dentist-grade product, you aren&#x27;t supposed to eat and/or drink for 30 minutes after using the product in order to get the full benefits of use.</li>
            <li>- Much like a dentist visit or dentist-grade product, you aren&#x27;t supposed to eat and/or drink for 30 minutes after using the product in order to get the full benefits of use.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that the amount of tartar is not as great as usual.  </li>
            <li>Overall, however, I really liked it and will buy it next time as I was part of a campaign this time and received it for free from Crest!</li>
            <li>I received the new Crest Pro-Health Tatar Protection Mouthwash free from Crest and BzzAgent, and was asked to write a review.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product and will absolutely be purchasing a bottle of my own l, when this is gone.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited about this new crest tartar protection with fluoride new mouthwash I got from buzz agent for free for trying and reviewing their product.</li>
            <li>I am hoping with further use that feeling will last much more longer!!</li>
            <li>This is in sharp contrast to the other Pro-Health rinses that have no alcohol and have a very smooth, pleasant taste.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li>If anyone has ever had to use the dentist strength Crest fluoride rinse from a dentist, it is more reflective of that taste than it is a standard (or Crest Pro-Health for that matter) mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Crest!</li>
            <li>If anyone has ever had to use the dentist strength Crest fluoride rinse from a dentist, it is more reflective of that taste than it is a standard (or Crest Pro-Health for that matter) mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d not used any of the Crest Pro-Health products before, and, honestly, have never really been convinced products like this</li>
            <li>Thanks, Crest and Bzzagent!</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I was pleased with the safety precaution of the cap to ensure it would be tricky for my toddler to open if it somehow mistakenly got within her</li>
            <li>20 numbing shots later, my teeth felt better and cleaner</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the refreshing mint flavor, but i would definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li>The first two or three times I used this</li>
            <li>At my next dental checkup my tartar buildup was definitely better.</li>
            <li>Thanks BzzAgent for sending me a bottle to test and review!</li>
            <li>It REALLY Works!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the product and have been using it daily since I got it.</li>
            <li>Love taste and looking forward to my next dentist visit!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried the Tartar Protection one thanks to BzzAgent!  </li>
            <li>I figured out that diluting the rinse before hand with some tap water made it possible for me to spit it out at the end without needing to re-rinse with more tap water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell a difference in how fresh it makes my breath or</li>
            <li>My mouth feel so much better after rinsing and really last for hours afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is pretty comparable to any mouthwash, although I do find that it keeps my mouth feeling fresher longer.</li>
            <li>I would like it so much more if it was in a different flavor</li>
            <li>It would be my first choice in a mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I got a sample, but this is now going to be my first choice.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much BzzAgent for sending me this to try out!</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get this for free.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how quickly I began to want that fresh taste at bedtime and in the mornings to start my day refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product about two weeks ago (thanks to Crest, they shipped it to me for FREE), and I can clearly see and feel a difference!</li>
            <li>Your left with just a nice deep clean.</li>
            <li>I have always liked the Crest Brand - and have used other ProHealth mouthwashes before.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely a product I would purchase and use, but it probably wouldn&#x27;t be my primary mouthwash (for fresh breath), hence the 4 star rating.</li>
            <li>This often left me feeling like I didn&#x27;t get as much value from the product as I may have been able to.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>Only issue is that the alcohol really drys out my mouth , but the mouth wash does not have that &amp;#34; sting &amp;#34; that most products in this area have .</li>
            <li>However, if this one really does make a noticeable dent in my tartar build-up then I would get more of it since nothing else I have used (outside of flossing) seems to help in reducing it.</li>
            <li>This product not only fights against tartar but leaves your breathe smelling fresh andtproducti got for free for giving a review after trying product</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth replacing your old burning rinse with!!</li>
            <li>all day long i feel really confident with using this</li>
            <li>You really can tell a difference from the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>have a tendency towards fast tartar build up (thanks genetics!)</li>
            <li>Since it is a mouthwash, I am pretty much used to that anyway.</li>
            <li>I was very unsure about this mouth wash at first just because I have always used 1 mouth wash brand and never changed it.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash not only makes your breath fresh - it also makes your mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>how well it protects my teeth, in comparison to other brands, but I do love the refreshing mint flavor and the fact that it has a relatively low alcohol content.</li>
            <li>It is easy to work into my daily routine.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is modern, the label is clean, and the blue color is fun.</li>
            <li>The blue staining scraped off easily, but it concerned me that the coloring from the mouth rinse had stained my teeth.</li>
            <li>The blue staining scraped off easily, but it concerned me that the coloring from the mouth rinse had stained my teeth.</li>
            <li>Pure luck?</li>
            <li>This is my new mouth wash brand! !</li>
            <li>Crest sent me a free bottle and it really leaves me with fresh breath for a long time.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t overly powerful and didn&#x27;t burn my sensitive gums!</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection mouthwash comes in a great flavor, and is easy to use, but I felt like it didn&#x27;t last as long as other mouthwashes I have used.</li>
            <li>I got a full size bottle of this for free from BzzAgent and Crest a few weeks before my most recent dental checkup.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the lack of &amp;#34;mouth sting&amp;#34; compared to other mouthwashes; I was able to swish away for a minute without feeling like my mouth was in minty pain.</li>
            <li>I was surprised because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special in the ingredients that looks like it would help with tartar, any more than other Crest mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently been using this product that I recieved for FREE thanks to Crest..</li>
            <li>I drink so much coffee, I can use all the protection I can get.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will really burn&lt;br /&gt;Buts</li>
            <li>and i really like it if you like their  toothpaste</li>
            <li>My mouth is so much healthier and fresher.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t really enjoy the &amp;#34;dentisty&amp;#34; taste in my at-home products, I consider it a draw back.  </li>
            <li>There is no &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; during use, and I really like the added benefit of tartar protection.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for allowing me to discover this #CrestForFree</li>
            <li>make much difference.</li>
            <li>But after using it twice a day for a couple of weeks now, I have to admit I really HAVE noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>In all fairness,  sometimes I have to see a drastic change to really get me to notice results.</li>
            <li>Because I didn&#x27;t have any discomfort in using this product, I felt I could really swish the product around to really get in the grooves and spaces between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed myself reaching for this Crest mouthwash throughout the day because I don&#x27;t have to dread the feeling of intense burning gums when I use it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that I do not have as much build up through the days now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I cannot tell too much of a difference in the tartar control.</li>
            <li>I got to try the Tartar Protection formula thanks to a 500 ml sample from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest</li>
            <li>It really does help with tartar build up and plaque.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest for the promotion product here are my thoughts.  </li>
            <li>I really do feel that this mouthwash works....</li>
            <li>THIS, however, was fantastic and it&#x27;s definitely a keeper!  </li>
            <li>It really reduce the tartar of your theeth.</li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to all!</li>
            <li>I really like that</li>
            <li>I am more a Colgate fan and never really used Crest products before.</li>
            <li>I was having a problem with tartar between my 2 front bottom teeth and didn&#x27;t see much difference from using this mouthwash or using no mouthwash.</li>
            <li>No burning, pleasant and subtle aftertaste</li>
            <li>I do wish that it kept my mouth fresh for a little longer but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I wish it did come in a larger quantity as it seemed to go pretty quickly in my household.</li>
            <li>At first I could not tell the difference since I was new to the product.</li>
            <li>I like using mouthwashes particularly this one with my regular routine because it strengthens the enamel while preventing cavities and tartar and dental care is extremely important.</li>
            <li>If the other Pro-Health formulas reduced tartar I would stick with them because they taste a lot better.</li>
            <li>I am normally a listerine girl, but maybe sold!</li>
            <li>I like keeping my teeth white and clean with this product.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t feel the burn its not truly getting your mouth clean enough.</li>
            <li>It made my mouth feel so clean and fresh without the burn of alcohol like  other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li>More importantly (for me, anyway) I have to disagree with the other reviewer&#x27;s comment that \\&quot;the flavor is really invigorating, not intense that it burns your mouth\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>enamel freshens breath &amp; has a invigorating sensation and no harsh burn and even after the first rinse my mouth felt cleaner</li>
            <li>After several weeks (and just about a full bottle) of me and my husband using Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash is my new fave!</li>
            <li>So, for example, my husband doesn&#x27;t mind the taste at all and would have no problem switching to this particular product if I was on board.</li>
            <li>I found this to be a decent mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the mouthwash isn&#x27;t super &#x27;spicy&#x27; to where it makes your eyes water, but it has enough zing to it.</li>
            <li>Now, I do traditionally have some sensitive spots in my mouth from gum recession and cavities that were filled, but I noticed no pain in even these areas.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>and it is really refreshing the freshness last quite a while the only thing I do not like about this mouthwash is the taste</li>
            <li>I have highly recommended this crest tartar protection mouth to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li>I was a long time Listerine user, but this doesn&#x27;t have that alcohol sting AND leaves my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It keeps my teeth feeling clean all day long.</li>
            <li>It keeps my teeth feeling clean all day long.</li>
            <li>However, I like for the mouthwash that I use to give a little more of a burn.</li>
            <li>very mild and not overpowering like some other mouthwashes/rinses.</li>
            <li>it offers so much.</li>
            <li>The taste is refreshing but not to harsh.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my mouth with a fresh breath that lasts the entire day.  </li>
            <li>It left my breath feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling fresh and minty.</li>
            <li>Not only does it leave your breath fresh, it also fights tartar while using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll preface this review by disclosing I was sent this product for free to try and give my thoughts on it after a trial period thanks to BzzAgent!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks down,</li>
            <li>I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a great &amp; hard working mouthwash!</li>
            <li>While I still dislike the taste, I must admit that I am still loving this mouthwash for all of the previous reasons stated above.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants to have great clean teeth without a weird aftertaste and spend less time getting tartar scraped off their teeth in the dentist&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li>Just started using the new Crest Pro Health Tartar protection mouth wash.</li>
            <li>So I started using this new mouth wash that I #gotforfree from #bzzagent.</li>
            <li>If better dental visits, less scraping, more confidence, less surface stains on teeth and strengthened enamel are something u look for in a mouthwash, look no further.</li>
            <li>But it does leave a tingly sensation for at least a half hour after use that I found refreshing and enjoyable.</li>
            <li>If it really is doing it&#x27;s job, I am really looking forward to &amp;#34;escaping the scrape&amp;#34; at my next dental appointment!</li>
            <li>The taste is not my favorite, as I do not really care for overpowering mint, but that is just my personal preference.</li>
            <li>The taste is great and not overwhelming like other mouthwashes!</li>
            <li>I really like all the benefits that this mouthwash has to offer and if it will help my dental checkups that is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>When I got this in the mail I was excited about it because it was something new for me to try but on the other side of that I was thinking yeah</li>
            <li>Pros: Seems to clean and freshen breath after brushing as well as the other Pro-Health formulas Very light &#x27;burn&amp;#34; compared to other mouthwashes with alcohol such as Listerine.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>We will definitely continue using the Pro-Health line, including their regular mouth wash, but since I know I like another product in the line more than this one - it will not be the Tartar Protection in the future.</li>
            <li>It is the first mouth wash that isn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; and my mouth definitely feels fresher</li>
            <li>There is no burning sensations from alcohol, although when I first started there was a brief (10-15 seconds) of tingling on/around my tongue.</li>
            <li>not sure what more I could say about mouthwash without sounding cliche...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use products for whitening,  enamel strengthening, freshen breath because this offers it all!</li>
            <li>AND, ACT is considerably cheaper here on Amazon as well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty big fan of mouthwash.</li>
            <li>At first the taste was a bit strong, but not as strong as several other rinses that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>An unusual &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34; taste which reminds me of older mouthwashes such as Cepacol.</li>
            <li>I actually thing that using that Tartar protection formulas enhances the deep clean feeling in my mouth after using the moth was.</li>
            <li>I am excited to add a little of this to my new Waterpik for additional protection!</li>
            <li>I usually have a problem with mouthwashes being too hot, but this one is just right!</li>
            <li>My husband and I religiously use the sensitive + enamel shied toothpaste and the regular Pro-Health mouthwash, so I was excited to add another defense against mouth yuck to my arsenal.</li>
            <li>My husband and I religiously use the sensitive + enamel shied toothpaste and the regular Pro-Health mouthwash, so I was excited to add another defense against mouth yuck to my arsenal.</li>
            <li>This new product has completely changed the way I feel about mouthwash.</li>
            <li>It definitely freshens my breath for long periods of time, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>In any case, it was enough to make me want to get more and see if the tartar reducing trend continues  as well as to bump my previous 3 star rating up a notch.</li>
            <li>so I try to use alcohol free or mix it with a little water.</li>
            <li>I felt the clean longer than any other brand!</li>
            <li>product packaging was easy to use and the cap is easier to open than the pinch and twist safety caps on other bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s hard to tell whether the &#x27;tartar&#x27; part of this mouthwash is effective or not (at least I can&#x27;t tell), I really like how fresh it makes your mouth feel.</li>
            <li>This left my mouth feeling perfect and I like that it will help my teeth, not just bad breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection mouth rinse comes in a clear bottle whose label exclaims &amp;#34;Escape the Scrape&amp;#34;, meaning that it helps keep tartar away so that at your next dental cleaning, the hygienist doesn&#x27;t have to scrape so much plaque (hardened tartar) off your teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also portable enough to fit in a back pack or big purse&lt;</li>
            <li>Before I used this, I had no idea how much tartar buildup was actually on my teeth.</li>
            <li>After a few days of use, my teeth felt so smooth and looked noticeably cleaner.  </li>
            <li>No harsh burn or yucky taste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for 30 minutes before eating or drinking is a real pain, especially in the morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being a BzzAgent definitely has it&#x27;s perks &amp; thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>With the alternative brand, I never strayed far from the sink</li>
            <li>Since using this product my teeth are getting whiter, and they don&#x27;t feel as sensitive as they did before.</li>
            <li>I use it at least twice a day or more and my last checkup went really well.</li>
            <li>After using it for several weeks I have noticed how much cleaner my teeth feel and</li>
            <li>It is one of those push and screw tops, but it seems the top is too thick.</li>
            <li>Although I was pleased with this product, I didn&#x27;t really notice dramatic results.</li>
            <li>My other mouthwash helped with keeping my breath fresh but did nothing for the tartar build up that occours.</li>
            <li>The taste of this mouth rinse is a mild mint taste, but there is a slight burn because there is alcohol in the tartar protection variety.</li>
            <li>only downside is that its flavor is a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li>there is no painful burn, but it does get a little tingly.</li>
            <li>I regularly use mouthwash, however, normally I choose a mouthwash with whitening power, which the Crest&#x27;s ProHealth Tarter Protection Mouthwash doesn&#x27;t offer.  </li>
            <li>Well ive been using it for a few days now and its not bad.</li>
            <li>After using the product for a week, I was able to notice that my teeth felt cleaner due to less plaque buildup.</li>
            <li>I typically struggle with finding a good mouthwash because I hate the burning after I&#x27;ve attacked my mouth with my toothbrush and strong toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>BzzAgent is a word of mouth program and for this recent campaign all participating agents were blessed by #CrestForFree to try this new Pro-Health line of mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>I live this simple product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed less build-up feeling and my mouth feels fresh.  </li>
            <li>I do wish the bottle came in a bigger size, since it does get depleted much quicker in a household with multiple users.</li>
            <li>With tartar protection and fluoride, My Dentist was lso very surprised at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to my old mouthwash again!</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>Left my teeth smooth all day when I was not able to brush after lunch.</li>
            <li>The flavor is really invigorating, not intense that it burns your mouth, but it wroks you can see and feel the diffrence.</li>
            <li>It leaves a fresh feeling and taste to my mouth, and I can already feel less plaque when I run my tongue along my teeth!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see the point of it having a color, other than that</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see the point of it having a color, other than that</li>
            <li>The mouthwash felt smooth in my mouth and had a subtle mint flavor.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s not a harsh burning sensation like some mouthwashes, especially if it&#x27;s used daily.  </li>
            <li>daily and twice daily use: After rinsing with the product, I did not like the funny aftertaste and prefer the other brand recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>As one would expect with a Pro-Health mouth wash, there is no &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; (aka intense alcohol sting) associated with using it like you can expect from other big brands like Listerine or Scope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- As one would expect with a Pro-Health mouth wash, there is no &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; (aka intense alcohol sting) associated with using it like you can expect from other big brands like Listerine or Scope.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I did not find anything objectionable ingredients, one should take heed of the warning label on the bottle: &amp;#34;If more than used for is accidentally swallowed, get medical help or call a Poison Control center right away.&amp;#34;  Sounds crazy, but I had a housemate in college who used to swallow his toothpaste thinking it would give him fresher breath.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely noticing less tartar build up, and much fresher breath.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge mouthwash fan in general because I don&#x27;t particularly care for the burning, but I do like this one.  </li>

            <li> Me and my family have always been fans of mouth wash and this is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best one that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant taste and does not burn like Listerine, but without that burn, I do not feel like my teeth are as clean as with Listerine.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using it twice a day for the full minute and can feel the difference before and after!!</li>
            <li> It felt great to be so confident and to feel super kissable.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels much healthier and it has a great refreshing taste!</li>
            <li> It was a great product, left my breath feeling great.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this for free thanks to Crest and am very impressed based on my experience.</li>
            <li> It seems to work best when I use it right after brushing and before leaving the house, and again after my nighttime brushing right before bed.</li>
            <li> I am trying this product for free from crest and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> And my kids enjoy it better as well!</li>
            <li> This is a huge plus in my book!</li>
            <li> I also love all the benefits it has, like protecting against surface stains.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Pro-Health line.</li>
            <li> - they seem to work best as a unit when the entire line that is meant to be used together is in fact used together..</li>
            <li> Thumbs up!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Crest for letting me try this product for free!</li>
            <li> Since using Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash, my teeth are in better shape than ever before.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Pro-Health line.</li>
            <li> I have to preface this by saying that I am a BzzAgent and received this product for free from the company in exchange for my opinion - which I will give .. honestly.  </li>
            <li> - they seem to work best as a unit when the entire line that is meant to be used together is in fact used together..</li>
            <li> My gums feel so healthy now</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t use it more than once a day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed the fresher breathe</li>
            <li> How could I be winning on both levels?</li>
            <li> dentist appointments more enjoyable</li>
            <li> better dental check-ups**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did you know rinsing with Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash or Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash can lead to better dental check-ups?</li>
            <li> I do not know anyone that does not want better dental check-</li>
            <li> I love Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection with fluoride.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it as it did not leave my mouth</li>
            <li> Love that it has no burn, though the after taste is a bit off.</li>
            <li> This tastes great and really does the job.</li>
            <li> but I really love that there is no burn to this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> the more I used it</li>
            <li> Even though I got this product free for testing, the opinions I post here are my own and have not been paid for by Crest or the BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> You use it twice a day, mostly after you eat I think.</li>
            <li> This even does more than a mouthwash, as it eliminates tartar build-up and prevents cavity.</li>
            <li> Would I go out and get more?</li>
            <li> I love the crest pro-health tartar protection mouthwash.</li>
            <li> My whole mouth felt happy and healthy after using it.</li>
            <li> My opinions are strictly 100% my own and not influenced by receiving the product for free.</li>
            <li> It is so invigorating and refreshing.</li>
            <li> and I love it compared to the mouthwash I had been using.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product and wish I had considered it sooner.</li>

            <li> I also was getting better results from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**I received a free sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t leave a residue on my mouth or teeth and the taste was ok.</li>
            <li> And we could all use some tartar control :)</li>
            <li> I received this mouthwash as a trial for bzzAgent for free!</li>
            <li> BuzzAgent.&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I was able to join a free test of Crest&#x27;s ProHealth Tarter Protection Mouthwash challenge!</li>
            <li> Even though I got this product free for testing, the opinions I post here are my own and have not been paid for by Crest or the BzzAgent...</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> we love it</li>
            <li> , I tend to like mouthwash that is more of a cinnamon flavor the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this Alcohol Free mouthwash!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t burn and is refreshing.</li>
            <li> And I feel more confident about going to the dentist after using this because it helps to control tarter and plaque build up for 12 hours</li>
            <li> I love the after taste that does NOT burn my mouth like most others do to me.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it does not burn.  </li>
            <li> This mouth wash tasted much better than listerine</li>
            <li> I was very excited about the claim that it would protect my teeth from tartar.</li>
            <li> it leaves my  breath smelling nice and clean</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the flavor and the way it made my mouth feel clean!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and leaves you with a clean feeling for hours!</li>
            <li> and it makes your mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> This is the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> The Crest does a wonderful job on keeping my breath fresh for about a 1 1/2 hours that I can notice directly.</li>
            <li> and I can easily use it more than once a day (which I do sometimes).</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too strong and it what most people would come to expect in a mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> The #1 greatest thing I love is it doesn&#x27;t sting my mouth when swishing and the clean feeling last!</li>
            <li> However, after a recent free sample was sent my way via BzzAgent, I have to say that this product really impressed me.</li>
            <li> Brushing my teeth seem to work a bit more easy and the clean feeling lasts a bit longer!</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling clean!</li>
            <li> Still leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and clean!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product free, from Crest, through BzzAgent and all opinions are original and my own.</li>
            <li> A clean, healthy mouth that shines with no cavities or tartar-cannot ask for much more.</li>
            <li> (Although I did receive a free bottle of Crest Pro-Health Tarter Protection to try through a promotion, my opinions expressed here are my own pure honest views of the product)</li>

            <li> The best part is, it keeps my mouth feeling clean and fresh way longer than other brands of popular mouthwashes out</li>
            <li> If I had to change anything or improve anything about it, i wish it was fouride free but other than that it&#x27;s a GREAT mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I thought that this product worked fine.</li>
            <li> I am already a huge fan of crest products and now I just added another crest product to my must have shopping list.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m a huge coffee and tea drinker, I also appreciate that fact that it helps to ward off surface stains.</li>
            <li> If you like using Crest toothpaste this mouthwash has the same great minty taste.</li>
            <li> I have to preface this by saying that I am a BzzAgent and received this product for free from the company in exchange for my opinion - which I will give ..</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t really enjoy the &amp;#34;dentisty&amp;#34; taste in my at-home products, I consider it a draw</li>

            <li> I expect a great dentist visit the next time I go.</li>

            <li> though I got to try Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash for free as part of a BzzCampaign, courtesy of Crest; I&#x27;ll probably just switch to this product permanently.</li>

            <li> I got it free to try from @CrestPtoHealth</li>
            <li> Though I was relatively pleased with the result of the alternative brand, the burning sensation I felt with every use was too intense to be enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this mouthwash compared to others that I&#x27;ve used mostly because of the not so intense mint flavor and</li>
            <li> With a high (10.8%) alcohol content, it sure as heck burns my mouth!.  </li>
            <li> special thanks to Buzzagent and Crest for letting me test this product for free, however, the opinion of this review is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I was able to continue using my sensitivity toothpaste and have fresh clean breath.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt very clean and my breath stayed fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li> that it gives my mouth a very clean feeling and my fresh breath lasts almost all day.</li>
            <li> It is easy and quick to use twice a day.</li>
            <li> I got a free full size bottle of the Crest Pro-Health Multi-Care mouthwash from Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I have seen a significant decrease in tartar buildup and looking forward to continue using this product moving forward.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think there is anything that makes the brand unique.</li>
            <li> After swishing with this, I noticed my breath was fresh for hours!</li>
            <li> So thank you, BzzAgent, for allowing me to try this complimentary for review purposes!</li>
            <li> although I will admit, I do use a small amount after meals to help keep my chompers looking great!</li>
            <li> What excited me about this product was that it fought against surface stains.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels significantly healthier.</li>
            <li> It gives you a tingly sensation that makes your mouth feel clean, but it does not have a burn that alcohol gives.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I was pleased to try Crest Pro-health Tartar Protection Mouthwash for free to help reduce tartar build-up and plaque.</li>

            <li> the plaque on my teeth comes right off!</li>
            <li> First, it didn&#x27;t sting as much and had a really nice flavor.</li>
            <li> It helps making your weaker teeth more strong, helps with the tartar that builds up on your teeth, helps with stains that you my have, I m a coffee drinker all day so that is a big plus for me , and most importantly, when rinsing with it you get a nice feeling of clean as you switch it around your mouth without the initial stinging and burning feel.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash for about a week, thanks to bzzagent.com, and so far I have nothing but good things to say.</li>
            <li> Started using this a few weeks ago when I received a free sample from Crest through Bzz agent and the product is great.</li>
            <li> Loved it, left my mouth feeling fresh, without that overly antiseptic taste.</li>
            <li> In only one week usin this product 2 times daily you would see the tartar of your theeth reduce in 95% so this is awesome.</li>
            <li> I did receive this for free for review from BzzAgent, but I am giving my own personal review...</li>
            <li> My teeth felt smooth and if touched, my gums also felt smooth and clean (no icky build up at all).</li>
            <li> The taste was so much better than other brands I have tried, even my teenagers liked it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much!</li>
            <li> I was SUPER excited - and slightly skeptical - when Crest sent this to try for free from BzzAgent (#GotItFree), but I am impressed!  </li>
            <li> One thing that would be nice is if this variety came in some other flavors, especially unique ones that other brands do not have available!</li>
            <li> A special thanks to Buzzagent and crest for letting me test this product for free</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean and fresh that I&#x27;ve used it more than twice  a day on certain occasions or after certain dishes.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection has to be my new favorite mouthwash.</li>
            <li> My first BzzAgent product was this mouthwash from Crest!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone and will buy it again for sure!</li>
            <li> I have found great results in as little as 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t burn too much, keeps your tartar to a minimum, and leaves your mouth super minty and fresh, then this is the mouthwash for you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this product free thanks to Crest through BzzAgent as part of a promotion from the brand.  </li>
            <li> I am using this product for free thanks to crest.</li>
            <li> Thanks BuzzAgent for letting me try a free sample.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for sending me this product for free to try and review</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free to test out thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> The whole family really enjoy using Crest Pro Health every morning and night.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Buzzagent and Crest for letting me test this product for free.</li>
            <li> I recieved cres pro health tartar protection for free thanks to bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Buzzagent and crest for letting me test this product for free</li>
            <li> /&gt;The downside of this is that&lt;br /&gt;You get a burning sensation when you are rinsing your mouth but later on put warm water in your mouth for after rinse&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the taste.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh minty taste of Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection with Fluoride mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary bottle of Crest ProHealth Tartar Protection for the purposes of review</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m not crazy about the taste.</li>
            <li> The fresh taste lasted for hours and after a couple of uses my teeth felt smoother &amp; just knowing that it contains fluoride</li>
            <li> This is the product that is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel so fresh and even in between brushes</li>
            <li> When my bottle is done I will definitely get more to keep the tartar off my teeth since brushing alone without using this will lead to more buildup and more scraping when I go to the dentist in the next three months.</li>
            <li> and I am definitely seeing great results and so far I have zero complaints.</li>
            <li> Leave a fresh sesation on your mouth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn but still leaves your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> The girls at work are noticing my smile is whiter</li>
            <li> I am glad that I was fortunate enough to get to try this product out as part of a promotional offer through BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li> After using this product a couple weeks I have notice a change in fresher breath and a smile I am no longer ashamed of.</li>
            <li> The only downside is you&#x27;re not supposed to eat or drink anything for thirty minutes after using the wash but other than that- great product!</li>
            <li> and it makes my whole mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, but strong enough.  </li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> I really like how clean my mouth feels after using this wash.  </li>
            <li> I especially like that I now feel more confident that my back teeth are getting a more complete clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Much like a dentist visit or dentist-grade product, you aren&#x27;t supposed to eat and/or drink for 30 minutes after using the product in order to get the full benefits of use.</li>

            <li> I have also noticed that the amount of tartar is not as great as usual.  </li>
            <li> Overall, however, I really liked it and will buy it next time as I was part of a campaign this time and received it for free from Crest!</li>
            <li> I received the new Crest Pro-Health Tatar Protection Mouthwash free from Crest and BzzAgent, and was asked to write a review.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product and will absolutely be purchasing a bottle of my own l, when this is gone.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited about this new crest tartar protection with fluoride new mouthwash I got from buzz agent for free for trying and reviewing their product.</li>
            <li> I am hoping with further use that feeling will last much more longer!!</li>
            <li> This is in sharp contrast to the other Pro-Health rinses that have no alcohol and have a very smooth, pleasant taste.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> If anyone has ever had to use the dentist strength Crest fluoride rinse from a dentist, it is more reflective of that taste than it is a standard (or Crest Pro-Health for that matter) mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Crest!</li>
            <li> If anyone has ever had to use the dentist strength Crest fluoride rinse from a dentist, it is more reflective of that taste than it is a standard (or Crest Pro-Health for that matter) mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d not used any of the Crest Pro-Health products before, and, honestly, have never really been convinced products like this</li>
            <li> Thanks, Crest and Bzzagent!</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I was pleased with the safety precaution of the cap to ensure it would be tricky for my toddler to open if it somehow mistakenly got within her</li>
            <li> 20 numbing shots later, my teeth felt better and cleaner</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the refreshing mint flavor, but i would definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> The first two or three times I used this</li>
            <li> At my next dental checkup my tartar buildup was definitely better.</li>
            <li> Thanks BzzAgent for sending me a bottle to test and review!</li>
            <li> It REALLY Works!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the product and have been using it daily since I got it.</li>
            <li> Love taste and looking forward to my next dentist visit!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried the Tartar Protection one thanks to BzzAgent!  </li>
            <li> I figured out that diluting the rinse before hand with some tap water made it possible for me to spit it out at the end without needing to re-rinse with more tap water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell a difference in how fresh it makes my breath or</li>
            <li> My mouth feel so much better after rinsing and really last for hours afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is pretty comparable to any mouthwash, although I do find that it keeps my mouth feeling fresher longer.</li>
            <li> I would like it so much more if it was in a different flavor</li>
            <li> It would be my first choice in a mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I got a sample, but this is now going to be my first choice.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much BzzAgent for sending me this to try out!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get this for free.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how quickly I began to want that fresh taste at bedtime and in the mornings to start my day refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product about two weeks ago (thanks to Crest, they shipped it to me for FREE), and I can clearly see and feel a difference!</li>
            <li> Your left with just a nice deep clean.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the Crest Brand - and have used other ProHealth mouthwashes before.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely a product I would purchase and use, but it probably wouldn&#x27;t be my primary mouthwash (for fresh breath), hence the 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> This often left me feeling like I didn&#x27;t get as much value from the product as I may have been able to.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Only issue is that the alcohol really drys out my mouth , but the mouth wash does not have that &amp;#34; sting &amp;#34; that most products in this area have .</li>
            <li> However, if this one really does make a noticeable dent in my tartar build-up then I would get more of it since nothing else I have used (outside of flossing) seems to help in reducing it.</li>
            <li> This product not only fights against tartar but leaves your breathe smelling fresh andtproducti got for free for giving a review after trying product</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth replacing your old burning rinse with!!</li>
            <li> all day long i feel really confident with using this</li>
            <li> You really can tell a difference from the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> have a tendency towards fast tartar build up (thanks genetics!)</li>
            <li> Since it is a mouthwash, I am pretty much used to that anyway.</li>
            <li> I was very unsure about this mouth wash at first just because I have always used 1 mouth wash brand and never changed it.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash not only makes your breath fresh - it also makes your mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> how well it protects my teeth, in comparison to other brands, but I do love the refreshing mint flavor and the fact that it has a relatively low alcohol content.</li>
            <li> It is easy to work into my daily routine.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is modern, the label is clean, and the blue color is fun.</li>
            <li> The blue staining scraped off easily, but it concerned me that the coloring from the mouth rinse had stained my teeth.</li>
            <li> The blue staining scraped off easily, but it concerned me that the coloring from the mouth rinse had stained my teeth.</li>
            <li> Pure luck?</li>
            <li> This is my new mouth wash brand! !</li>
            <li> Crest sent me a free bottle and it really leaves me with fresh breath for a long time.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t overly powerful and didn&#x27;t burn my sensitive gums!</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection mouthwash comes in a great flavor, and is easy to use, but I felt like it didn&#x27;t last as long as other mouthwashes I have used.</li>
            <li> I got a full size bottle of this for free from BzzAgent and Crest a few weeks before my most recent dental checkup.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the lack of &amp;#34;mouth sting&amp;#34; compared to other mouthwashes; I was able to swish away for a minute without feeling like my mouth was in minty pain.</li>
            <li> I was surprised because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special in the ingredients that looks like it would help with tartar, any more than other Crest mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been using this product that I recieved for FREE thanks to Crest..</li>
            <li> I drink so much coffee, I can use all the protection I can get.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will really burn&lt;br /&gt;Buts</li>
            <li> and i really like it if you like their  toothpaste</li>
            <li> My mouth is so much healthier and fresher.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t really enjoy the &amp;#34;dentisty&amp;#34; taste in my at-home products, I consider it a draw back.  </li>
            <li> There is no &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; during use, and I really like the added benefit of tartar protection.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for allowing me to discover this #CrestForFree</li>
            <li> make much difference.</li>
            <li> But after using it twice a day for a couple of weeks now, I have to admit I really HAVE noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> In all fairness,  sometimes I have to see a drastic change to really get me to notice results.</li>
            <li> Because I didn&#x27;t have any discomfort in using this product, I felt I could really swish the product around to really get in the grooves and spaces between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed myself reaching for this Crest mouthwash throughout the day because I don&#x27;t have to dread the feeling of intense burning gums when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that I do not have as much build up through the days now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I cannot tell too much of a difference in the tartar control.</li>
            <li> I got to try the Tartar Protection formula thanks to a 500 ml sample from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest</li>
            <li> It really does help with tartar build up and plaque.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for the promotion product here are my thoughts.  </li>
            <li> I really do feel that this mouthwash works....</li>
            <li> THIS, however, was fantastic and it&#x27;s definitely a keeper!  </li>
            <li> It really reduce the tartar of your theeth.</li>
            <li> I really do.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to all!</li>
            <li> I really like that</li>
            <li> I am more a Colgate fan and never really used Crest products before.</li>
            <li> I was having a problem with tartar between my 2 front bottom teeth and didn&#x27;t see much difference from using this mouthwash or using no mouthwash.</li>
            <li> No burning, pleasant and subtle aftertaste</li>
            <li> I do wish that it kept my mouth fresh for a little longer but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I wish it did come in a larger quantity as it seemed to go pretty quickly in my household.</li>
            <li> At first I could not tell the difference since I was new to the product.</li>
            <li> I like using mouthwashes particularly this one with my regular routine because it strengthens the enamel while preventing cavities and tartar and dental care is extremely important.</li>
            <li> If the other Pro-Health formulas reduced tartar I would stick with them because they taste a lot better.</li>
            <li> I am normally a listerine girl, but maybe sold!</li>
            <li> I like keeping my teeth white and clean with this product.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t feel the burn its not truly getting your mouth clean enough.</li>
            <li> It made my mouth feel so clean and fresh without the burn of alcohol like  other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> More importantly (for me, anyway) I have to disagree with the other reviewer&#x27;s comment that \\&quot;the flavor is really invigorating, not intense that it burns your mouth\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> enamel freshens breath &amp; has a invigorating sensation and no harsh burn and even after the first rinse my mouth felt cleaner</li>
            <li> After several weeks (and just about a full bottle) of me and my husband using Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash is my new fave!</li>
            <li> So, for example, my husband doesn&#x27;t mind the taste at all and would have no problem switching to this particular product if I was on board.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a decent mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the mouthwash isn&#x27;t super &#x27;spicy&#x27; to where it makes your eyes water, but it has enough zing to it.</li>
            <li> Now, I do traditionally have some sensitive spots in my mouth from gum recession and cavities that were filled, but I noticed no pain in even these areas.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> and it is really refreshing the freshness last quite a while the only thing I do not like about this mouthwash is the taste</li>
            <li> I have highly recommended this crest tartar protection mouth to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I was a long time Listerine user, but this doesn&#x27;t have that alcohol sting AND leaves my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It keeps my teeth feeling clean all day long.</li>
            <li> It keeps my teeth feeling clean all day long.</li>
            <li> However, I like for the mouthwash that I use to give a little more of a burn.</li>
            <li> very mild and not overpowering like some other mouthwashes/rinses.</li>
            <li> it offers so much.</li>
            <li> The taste is refreshing but not to harsh.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my mouth with a fresh breath that lasts the entire day.  </li>
            <li> It left my breath feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling fresh and minty.</li>
            <li> Not only does it leave your breath fresh, it also fights tartar while using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface this review by disclosing I was sent this product for free to try and give my thoughts on it after a trial period thanks to BzzAgent!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks down,</li>
            <li> I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a great &amp; hard working mouthwash!</li>
            <li> While I still dislike the taste, I must admit that I am still loving this mouthwash for all of the previous reasons stated above.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants to have great clean teeth without a weird aftertaste and spend less time getting tartar scraped off their teeth in the dentist&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li> Just started using the new Crest Pro Health Tartar protection mouth wash.</li>
            <li> So I started using this new mouth wash that I #gotforfree from #bzzagent.</li>
            <li> If better dental visits, less scraping, more confidence, less surface stains on teeth and strengthened enamel are something u look for in a mouthwash, look no further.</li>
            <li> But it does leave a tingly sensation for at least a half hour after use that I found refreshing and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> If it really is doing it&#x27;s job, I am really looking forward to &amp;#34;escaping the scrape&amp;#34; at my next dental appointment!</li>
            <li> The taste is not my favorite, as I do not really care for overpowering mint, but that is just my personal preference.</li>
            <li> The taste is great and not overwhelming like other mouthwashes!</li>
            <li> I really like all the benefits that this mouthwash has to offer and if it will help my dental checkups that is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> When I got this in the mail I was excited about it because it was something new for me to try but on the other side of that I was thinking yeah</li>
            <li> Pros: Seems to clean and freshen breath after brushing as well as the other Pro-Health formulas Very light &#x27;burn&amp;#34; compared to other mouthwashes with alcohol such as Listerine.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> We will definitely continue using the Pro-Health line, including their regular mouth wash, but since I know I like another product in the line more than this one - it will not be the Tartar Protection in the future.</li>
            <li> It is the first mouth wash that isn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; and my mouth definitely feels fresher</li>
            <li> There is no burning sensations from alcohol, although when I first started there was a brief (10-15 seconds) of tingling on/around my tongue.</li>
            <li> not sure what more I could say about mouthwash without sounding cliche...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use products for whitening,  enamel strengthening, freshen breath because this offers it all!</li>
            <li> AND, ACT is considerably cheaper here on Amazon as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty big fan of mouthwash.</li>
            <li> At first the taste was a bit strong, but not as strong as several other rinses that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> An unusual &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34; taste which reminds me of older mouthwashes such as Cepacol.</li>
            <li> I actually thing that using that Tartar protection formulas enhances the deep clean feeling in my mouth after using the moth was.</li>
            <li> I am excited to add a little of this to my new Waterpik for additional protection!</li>
            <li> I usually have a problem with mouthwashes being too hot, but this one is just right!</li>
            <li> My husband and I religiously use the sensitive + enamel shied toothpaste and the regular Pro-Health mouthwash, so I was excited to add another defense against mouth yuck to my arsenal.</li>
            <li> My husband and I religiously use the sensitive + enamel shied toothpaste and the regular Pro-Health mouthwash, so I was excited to add another defense against mouth yuck to my arsenal.</li>
            <li> This new product has completely changed the way I feel about mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It definitely freshens my breath for long periods of time, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> In any case, it was enough to make me want to get more and see if the tartar reducing trend continues  as well as to bump my previous 3 star rating up a notch.</li>
            <li> so I try to use alcohol free or mix it with a little water.</li>
            <li> I felt the clean longer than any other brand!</li>
            <li> product packaging was easy to use and the cap is easier to open than the pinch and twist safety caps on other bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s hard to tell whether the &#x27;tartar&#x27; part of this mouthwash is effective or not (at least I can&#x27;t tell), I really like how fresh it makes your mouth feel.</li>
            <li> This left my mouth feeling perfect and I like that it will help my teeth, not just bad breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection mouth rinse comes in a clear bottle whose label exclaims &amp;#34;Escape the Scrape&amp;#34;, meaning that it helps keep tartar away so that at your next dental cleaning, the hygienist doesn&#x27;t have to scrape so much plaque (hardened tartar) off your teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also portable enough to fit in a back pack or big purse&lt;</li>
            <li> Before I used this, I had no idea how much tartar buildup was actually on my teeth.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use, my teeth felt so smooth and looked noticeably cleaner.  </li>
            <li> No harsh burn or yucky taste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for 30 minutes before eating or drinking is a real pain, especially in the morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being a BzzAgent definitely has it&#x27;s perks &amp; thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> With the alternative brand, I never strayed far from the sink</li>
            <li> Since using this product my teeth are getting whiter, and they don&#x27;t feel as sensitive as they did before.</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a day or more and my last checkup went really well.</li>
            <li> After using it for several weeks I have noticed how much cleaner my teeth feel and</li>
            <li> It is one of those push and screw tops, but it seems the top is too thick.</li>
            <li> Although I was pleased with this product, I didn&#x27;t really notice dramatic results.</li>
            <li> My other mouthwash helped with keeping my breath fresh but did nothing for the tartar build up that occours.</li>
            <li> The taste of this mouth rinse is a mild mint taste, but there is a slight burn because there is alcohol in the tartar protection variety.</li>
            <li> only downside is that its flavor is a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li> there is no painful burn, but it does get a little tingly.</li>
            <li> I regularly use mouthwash, however, normally I choose a mouthwash with whitening power, which the Crest&#x27;s ProHealth Tarter Protection Mouthwash doesn&#x27;t offer.  </li>
            <li> Well ive been using it for a few days now and its not bad.</li>
            <li> After using the product for a week, I was able to notice that my teeth felt cleaner due to less plaque buildup.</li>
            <li> I typically struggle with finding a good mouthwash because I hate the burning after I&#x27;ve attacked my mouth with my toothbrush and strong toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> BzzAgent is a word of mouth program and for this recent campaign all participating agents were blessed by #CrestForFree to try this new Pro-Health line of mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I live this simple product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less build-up feeling and my mouth feels fresh.  </li>
            <li> I do wish the bottle came in a bigger size, since it does get depleted much quicker in a household with multiple users.</li>
            <li> With tartar protection and fluoride, My Dentist was lso very surprised at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to my old mouthwash again!</li>
            <li> No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> Left my teeth smooth all day when I was not able to brush after lunch.</li>
            <li> The flavor is really invigorating, not intense that it burns your mouth, but it wroks you can see and feel the diffrence.</li>
            <li> It leaves a fresh feeling and taste to my mouth, and I can already feel less plaque when I run my tongue along my teeth!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the point of it having a color, other than that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the point of it having a color, other than that</li>
            <li> The mouthwash felt smooth in my mouth and had a subtle mint flavor.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s not a harsh burning sensation like some mouthwashes, especially if it&#x27;s used daily.  </li>
            <li> daily and twice daily use: After rinsing with the product, I did not like the funny aftertaste and prefer the other brand recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> As one would expect with a Pro-Health mouth wash, there is no &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; (aka intense alcohol sting) associated with using it like you can expect from other big brands like Listerine or Scope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - As one would expect with a Pro-Health mouth wash, there is no &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; (aka intense alcohol sting) associated with using it like you can expect from other big brands like Listerine or Scope.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I did not find anything objectionable ingredients, one should take heed of the warning label on the bottle: &amp;#34;If more than used for is accidentally swallowed, get medical help or call a Poison Control center right away.&amp;#34;  Sounds crazy, but I had a housemate in college who used to swallow his toothpaste thinking it would give him fresher breath.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely noticing less tartar build up, and much fresher breath.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge mouthwash fan in general because I don&#x27;t particularly care for the burning, but I do like this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying this product for over a month, along with regular brushing and flossing, I expect my next dental checkup will show no problems beyond normal tartar buildup since that was my previous result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this product, I didn&#x27;t notice any less tartar buildup or plaque than I do by normally brushing with my Crest toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way when Crest first began their Pro-Health line.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it really keeps the tartar at bay.</li>
            <li> With the Crest I have went to 3x per day on the use because it does not seem to last as long as my Listerene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never used to use mouthwash because I didnt like the burn or the long lasting after taste.</li>
            <li> I have had big dental bills my entire adulthood and was often told to use a fluoride rinse due to low dentin.</li>
            <li> Not gone completely but a lot less chipping away.</li>
            <li> So far I have been using the Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection mouth rinse almost every day for about two and a half weeks now.</li>
            <li> My husband did say though that it made he back of his throat dry.</li>
            <li> I have used other mouthwashes in the past but they have not impacted my checkups in such a positive way.</li>
            <li> being said, I ABSOLUTELY have no problem negatively reviewing a product if I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> My breath smells minty for a long time after rinsing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a strange taste or feel in your mouth.</li>
            <li> If you use any other Pro-Health products, then you get that feeling of having the defense of an entire line.</li>
            <li> I went in for an emergency root canal the other day, only to have my dentist (yet again)</li>
            <li> - If you use any other Pro-Health products, then you get that feeling of having the defense of an entire line.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the initial shock of some other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> I also like that my entire family can use it too since it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth like other mouthwashes seem to do.  </li>
            <li> the Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection mouth rinse with five stars is because the other day as I was flossing my teeth before using the mouth rinse, I noticed blue staining on the sides of my eye teeth.</li>
            <li> the Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection mouth rinse with five stars is because the other day as I was flossing my teeth before using the mouth rinse, I noticed blue staining on the sides of my eye teeth.</li>
            <li> The only gripe I had with it was the white top was a little difficult for someone with small hands to open.</li>
            <li> On the other hand it definitely made my mouth feel way fresher and cleaner!</li>
            <li> The after-taste is a little odd, but it&#x27;s nowhere near unbearable, especially because of all the benefits this mouthwash has to offer!</li>
            <li> I heard the alcohol in mouth wash can dry out your teeth</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mouth wash that diminishes the bad odor in my mouth for a long time and have not been able to until now.  </li>
            <li> last less than thirty seconds&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to go to my next cleaning to see if I have less build-up for my hygienist to scrape.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to go to my next cleaning to see if I have less build-up for my hygienist to scrape.  </li>
            <li> In regards to its claim that it would help my teeth have less tartar, I&#x27;m not sure that it was very different than the other mouthwashes that Crest offers.</li>
            <li> I am a coffee drinker and a smoker so over the years my teeth have gotten a little yellow.</li>
            <li> BUT, within about two weeks of using them I developed severe brown staining on ALL my teeth that my hygienist had to work hard to remove.</li>
            <li> bad breath&lt;br /&gt;Prevent and reduce gingivitis for healthy gums</li>
            <li> :) Also the taste isn&#x27;t bad at all</li>
            <li> I have not really been a fan of mouthwash as I have always found the taste of the alcohol in it way too overpowering for me, along with the burning sensation</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be switching back to what I had been using because it was too harsh</li>
            <li> We use it daily and have noticed less tartar build up!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to have my next cleaning and see how little tartar they have to combat!</li>
            <li> This can be somewhat non-feasible in the mornings when rushed (which sometimes includes breakfast in the car) and a little inconvenient at night, because I get thirsty quite easily and drink a lot of water.</li>
            <li> This can be somewhat non-feasible in the mornings when rushed (which sometimes includes breakfast in the car) and a little inconvenient at night, because I get thirsty quite easily and drink a lot of water.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves a bad after taste that is pretty long lasting.</li>
            <li> like I had with other brands of mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t burn like some other mouthwashes I have tried.</li>
            <li> the other side, my husband isn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol burn that other brands do.</li>
            <li> and I was worried about trying this mouth rinse because a lot of the other Crest Pro-Health products contain &amp;#34;Stannous Flouride&amp;#34;, which I cannot use.</li>
            <li> However, unlike other mouth rinses that contain alcohol, this one does not have a medicinal taste.</li>
            <li> However, unlike other mouth rinses that contain alcohol, this one does not have a medicinal taste.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get to foamy or start to burn your mouth like other mouthwashes do.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t experience the severe burning sensation with this mouth wash that you may have with other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t burn like every other mouthwash I&#x27;ve used had.</li>
            <li> it is strong without the bad taste.</li>
            <li> at least twice daily</li>
            <li> and this mouthwash helped break down some of that build up -</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any burning your mouth off feeling while tears running down your face, no gum and mouth peeling afterwards as I&#x27;ve done both with another product.</li>
            <li> The taste is fairly mild and not at all unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less build-up feeling and my mouth feels fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a slight burn to it, but it&#x27;s an invigorating sensation that makes it feel like it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> What I am not noticing (in comparison to my previous mouth wash) are any whitening benefits.</li>
            <li> I spit the rinse out, my mouth continued to water (with a slight burn) and I kept wanting to spit out the product (even though it already was spit out).  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed that I have less tartar</li>
            <li> I previously was not using a mouthwash and feel no that I can no longer go without.</li>
            <li> The sodium fluoride content of 0.02% in &#x27;Crest Pro-Health&#x27; is less than 1/2 that of &#x27;ACT Anticavity Fluoride Rinse, Cinnamon&#x27;  (at 0.05%).  </li>
            <li> I do think there is less buildup</li>
            <li> Been using it for a week now and the sensitivity I had in one tooth is now gone when I drink hot and cold.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> It was probably a little tartar build up</li>
            <li> It was probably a little tartar build up</li>
            <li> I have never really enjoyed other mouth washes until I tried this.  </li>
            <li> I started using this rinse when I recieved it FREE as part of a Crest campaign-a time where I was having terrible tooth pain/sensitivity following a cavity filing.</li>
            <li> This product cleans and refresh without that harsh burn.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Incase you havent tried Crest ProHealth Tarter protection mouth wash/rinse, here are a few things you may want to consider.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a huge deal to me, but it might be to some consumers.</li>
            <li> Give it a try for less scraping at the dentist!</li>
            <li> I also feel there is less tartar buildup on my teeth!</li>
            <li> I have used it for less than a week, and I am already seeing results!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed less tartar &amp; plaque build up on my teeth since I started using it!</li>
            <li> You are not supposed to eat or drink for at least thirty minutes after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other Crest Pro-Health produces</li>
            <li> Other mouthwashes in the past have left this weird, metallic taste in my mouth when they were supposed to leave a &amp;#34;clean feeling&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> No one wants to walk up to someone with bad breath.</li>
            <li> I will be using it everyday from now on!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and never forget to take it with me when I leave for the weekends!</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t wait the 30 min after use (thats why I use it a few times a day, or if my mouth starts feeling icky),</li>
            <li> It causes a bit of a tingle to my tongue, but it is not overwhelming like some products that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Usually I stop because I don&#x27;t like the taste or the mouthwash burns.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use mouthwash often</li>
            <li> We usually use the store Brand.</li>
            <li> It could be better but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering or taste terrible.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not whiter, but definitely no more spots.</li>
            <li> mind had previous bad experience with mouthwashes because most have bad taste.</li>
            <li> I also despise a nasty, medicine-like aftertaste some of the strong mouthwashes leave.  </li>
            <li> He thinks the flavor is weak and he likes the burn of the alcohol heavy mouthwashes.)</li>
            <li> Since I have braces I need to at least rinse my  mouth every time I eat.</li>
            <li> I have poor teeth enamel and have noticed less plaque build up over time!</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash for free via Bzz Agent and have to admit, I usually can&#x27;t stand mouthwashes because of the bad taste and the fact they burn my mouth so bad.</li>
            <li> I am one of the small percentage of people of who when we use &amp;#34;Stannous Flouride&amp;#34; it stains our teeth a brown/yellow color that is very, very, very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> This was so bad that I ended up rinsing my mouth out with water - which I&#x27;m not sure if this then lost some of the benefits of the initial rinse.  </li>
            <li> I do wish there was a way of cutting out the dyes and artificial sweeteners but then again no one would really buy it them.</li>
            <li> I did find that the next morning when I woke up, there was a bad taste in my mouth...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also not a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> No more scaling and root planing for me!!</li>
            <li> It also seemed to me that this product had a little bit of a bad aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I hate the burn of other mouthwashes - Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash saves me from that uncomfortable feeling every day.</li>
            <li> Well guess what , I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two weeks and already notice a difference in less tarter buildup, whiter teeth and all without the annoying alcohol burning!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-health kills 99% of the germs that cause plaque, gingivitis and bad breath — all without the burn of alcohol.</li>
            <li> After I started using crest, my husband quit complaining about me having bad breath.</li>
            <li> , I feel like this product helps to ward off bad breath longer.</li>
            <li> then I realized that I wasn&#x27;t experiencing that horrible burning at the end</li>
            <li> I also noticed how it doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty alcohol taste in my mouth after rinsing.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it! Crest sent me a free bottle and it really leaves me with fresh breath for a long time. I also love all the benefits it has, like protecting against surface stains. I drink so much coffee, I can use all the protection I can get. You can tell it&#x27;s working as soon as you start using it.</li>
            <li> I had a try to test out this mouthwash for free&lt;br /&gt;And what I have to say about this is&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash is amazing&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for four days&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;ve seen improvements and not only me&lt;br /&gt;Other people tell me how amazing teeth looks&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also portable enough to fit in a back pack or big purse&lt;br /&gt;The downside of this is that&lt;br /&gt;You get a burning sensation when you are rinsing your mouth but later on put warm water in your mouth for after rinse&lt;br /&gt;It will really burn&lt;br /&gt;Buts it&#x27;s a temporary burn last less than thirty seconds&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this mouthwash to any one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this product free thanks to Crest through BzzAgent as part of a promotion from the brand.  If you like using Crest toothpaste this mouthwash has the same great minty taste. I like using mouthwashes particularly this one with my regular routine because it strengthens the enamel while preventing cavities and tartar and dental care is extremely important. No one wants to walk up to someone with bad breath. I like keeping my teeth white and clean with this product.</li>
            <li> I received the new Crest Pro-Health Tatar Protection Mouthwash free from Crest and BzzAgent, and was asked to write a review. I have not really been a fan of mouthwash as I have always found the taste of the alcohol in it way too overpowering for me, along with the burning sensation it would leave me with. This new product has completely changed the way I feel about mouthwash. There is no strong taste of alcohol, but a nice cool feeling that is bright and crisp. It does not burn at all - a BIG bonus in my opinion. The fact that it is also working on my tatar is also a plus. I am not a fan of the dental hygienist, but go every six months. This should make my visit to her a much more pleasant experience. I actually cannot wait to go and see if she sees a difference in my tartar buildup. This is definitely a product that will be a staple in my daily routine. Thanks Crest! #CrestProHealth</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Pro-Health line. My husband and I religiously use the sensitive + enamel shied toothpaste and the regular Pro-Health mouthwash, so I was excited to add another defense against mouth yuck to my arsenal. I have to preface this by saying that I am a BzzAgent and received this product for free from the company in exchange for my opinion - which I will give .. honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- As one would expect with a Pro-Health mouth wash, there is no &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; (aka intense alcohol sting) associated with using it like you can expect from other big brands like Listerine or Scope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- For all intents and purposes, it does the job! I&#x27;ve noticed less build-up feeling and my mouth feels fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If you use any other Pro-Health products, then you get that feeling of having the defense of an entire line. Kind of like with beauty or hair products - they seem to work best as a unit when the entire line that is meant to be used together is in fact used together.. if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m not crazy about the taste. If anyone has ever had to use the dentist strength Crest fluoride rinse from a dentist, it is more reflective of that taste than it is a standard (or Crest Pro-Health for that matter) mouthwash. Since I don&#x27;t really enjoy the &amp;#34;dentisty&amp;#34; taste in my at-home products, I consider it a draw back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Much like a dentist visit or dentist-grade product, you aren&#x27;t supposed to eat and/or drink for 30 minutes after using the product in order to get the full benefits of use. This can be somewhat non-feasible in the mornings when rushed (which sometimes includes breakfast in the car) and a little inconvenient at night, because I get thirsty quite easily and drink a lot of water.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the results of this mouthwash! I feel like the plaque on my teeth comes right off! It seems to work best when I use it right after brushing and before leaving the house, and again after my nighttime brushing right before bed. It has a slight burn to it, but it&#x27;s an invigorating sensation that makes it feel like it&#x27;s working. It definitely freshens my breath for long periods of time, which is a huge plus. I recommend this mouthwash and will be buying this when mine runs out! Thumbs up!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Crest for letting me try this product for free!</li>
            <li> Since using Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash, my teeth are in better shape than ever before. Before I used this, I had no idea how much tartar buildup was actually on my teeth. After a few days of use, my teeth felt so smooth and looked noticeably cleaner.  The after-taste is a little odd, but it&#x27;s nowhere near unbearable, especially because of all the benefits this mouthwash has to offer! I would definitely recommend this product and will absolutely be purchasing a bottle of my own l, when this is gone.  *Disclaimer* I recieved this product free, from Crest, through BzzAgent and all opinions are original and my own. #FreefromCrest @Crest #gotitfree #bzzagent #crestprohealth  *ETA: This is my last day in the Crest campaign for this mouthwash. While I still dislike the taste, I must admit that I am still loving this mouthwash for all of the previous reasons stated above. I went in for an emergency root canal the other day, only to have my dentist (yet again) tell me that he is proud of my work towards achieving all around, better dental health! He assured me that, since using this mouthwash, my teeth are in the best shape he has ever seen them! Wow! Thanks, Crest! I couldn&#x27;t have gotten these results without you!</li>
            <li> i got a free sample from crest via bzzagent and i really like it if you like their  toothpaste then you&#x27;ll like this mouth wash it taste similar&lt;br /&gt;#CrestProHealth#CrestSmile#FreeFromCrest</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent, and I am so glad I got to try it! This mouthwash is fantastic and works great!  If you are looking for a mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t burn too much, keeps your tartar to a minimum, and leaves your mouth super minty and fresh, then this is the mouthwash for you!</li>
            <li> I received this as a free product trial. I love this mouthwash! No harsh burn or yucky taste. My mouth is so much healthier and fresher. I will never go back to my old mouthwash again! #CrestProHealth #FreeFromCrest #CrestSmile.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh minty taste of Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection with Fluoride mouthwash. I&#x27;ve been swishing twice a day to improve my dental health.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fights unwanted surface stains&lt;br /&gt;Strengthens weakened enamel&lt;br /&gt;Freshens breath&lt;br /&gt;Helps prevent cavities&lt;br /&gt;Helps prevent tartar buildup&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for 30 minutes before eating or drinking is a real pain, especially in the morning.&lt;br /&gt; #FreeFromCrest&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary bottle of Crest ProHealth Tartar Protection for the purposes of review but my opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being said, I ABSOLUTELY have no problem negatively reviewing a product if I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this mouthwash, It leaves my teeth and mouth feeling clean and has a great taste. My breath smells minty for a long time after rinsing. I am recommending this mouthwash to all my friends and family. Anyone who buys will definitely be pleased!</li>

This can be somewhat non-feasible in the mornings when rushed (which sometimes includes breakfast in the car) and a little inconvenient at night, because I get thirsty quite easily and drink a lot of water.  Overall, the cons are very specific to me as a person and should not turn you off from trying it. So, for example, my husband doesn&#x27;t mind the taste at all and would have no problem switching to this particular product if I was on board. We will definitely continue using the Pro-Health line, including their regular mouth wash, but since I know I like another product in the line more than this one - it will not be the Tartar Protection in the future.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the flavor and the way it made my mouth feel clean!  It felt great to be so confident and to feel super kissable.</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash for free via Bzz Agent and have to admit, I usually can&#x27;t stand mouthwashes because of the bad taste and the fact they burn my mouth so bad. But, this was different. It has a great taste and didn&#x27;t set my mouth on fire! I have used it twice a day for a month, once in the morning and once at night, and have been completely impressed! My mouth feels fresh ALL DAY, even after breakfast and lunch, my teeth feel so clean and I don&#x27;t feel tartar buildup now. My gums feel so healthy now and I was having some problems with my gums before. I even wake up in the morning with NO morning breath! I am so glad I used this product! I will be using it everyday from now on! Can&#x27;t wait to see what my dentist says on my next visit</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of a fresh mouth from mouthwash but hate the burning sensation of the alcohol.  I felt like I could never have both until I used the Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection.  It gives you a tingly sensation that makes your mouth feel clean, but it does not have a burn that alcohol gives.  I have also noticed that the amount of tartar is not as great as usual.  I have always had a problem with tartar and anything that can help with that is amazing to me!</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection mouthwash comes in a great flavor, and is easy to use, but I felt like it didn&#x27;t last as long as other mouthwashes I have used. This could be a good thing because it reminded me to rinse again.There is no &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; during use, and I really like the added benefit of tartar protection. It is definitely a product I would purchase and use, but it probably wouldn&#x27;t be my primary mouthwash (for fresh breath), hence the 4 star rating. Give it a try for less scraping at the dentist! I did receive this product free to try and review from BzzAgent and Crest, however my opinion was not based upon that fact. #FreeFromCrest #CrestProHealth #GotItFree #CrestSmile</li>
            <li> Being a BzzAgent definitely has it&#x27;s perks &amp; thanks to Crest I was able to try this product for free! This is probably the best mouthwash that I&#x27;ve ever gotten my hands on! BzzAgent is a word of mouth program and for this recent campaign all participating agents were blessed by #CrestForFree to try this new Pro-Health line of mouthwashes. I chose the Tartar Protection with Fluoride &amp; I began to feel a difference immediately! The fresh taste lasted for hours and after a couple of uses my teeth felt smoother &amp; just knowing that it contains fluoride puts your mind at ease....you know it&#x27;s strengthening your teeth over time. The taste is great and not overwhelming like other mouthwashes! Thanks so much for allowing me to discover this #CrestForFree</li>
            <li> #FreeFromCrest I am so excited about this new crest tartar protection with fluoride new mouthwash I got from buzz agent for free for trying and reviewing their product. I have found great results in as little as 2 weeks. My breath is fresh and clean. My teeth feel cleaner an I love smiling a lot more now, knowing I have a super white smile and tartar free teeth. I would recommend others to try this product. I have highly recommended this crest tartar protection mouth to all my friends and family. I am already a huge fan of crest products and now I just added another crest product to my must have shopping list.</li>
            <li> Good product, taste better than others. Can feel it working from day 1.</li>
            <li> I was provided Crest Pro Health free from Crest to review. Great mouthwash, tastes great, no burn and helps with tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I love this mouth wash! I use it everyday and never forget to take it with me when I leave for the weekends! I usually have a problem with mouthwashes being too hot, but this one is just right! It leaves my mouth feeling clean!</li>
            <li> I received this as a freebie from BzzAgent to review. I&#x27;d not used any of the Crest Pro-Health products before, and, honestly, have never really been convinced products like this make much difference. But after using it twice a day for a couple of weeks now, I have to admit I really HAVE noticed a difference. My teeth have felt cleaner after use, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference after flossing. The taste is fairly mild and not at all unpleasant. I&#x27;m just really pleased with the results. I&#x27;ll definitely continue buying and using this regularly in the future. Thanks, Crest and Bzzagent!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I was pleased to try Crest Pro-health Tartar Protection Mouthwash for free to help reduce tartar build-up and plaque. Although I was pleased with this product, I didn&#x27;t really notice dramatic results. In all fairness,  sometimes I have to see a drastic change to really get me to notice results. With this product, I didn&#x27;t notice any less tartar buildup or plaque than I do by normally brushing with my Crest toothpaste.  I have a dental cleaning scheduled soon which may lead me to a change of opinion. Nonetheless, I was pleased with the safety precaution of the cap to ensure it would be tricky for my toddler to open if it somehow mistakenly got within her reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to trying Crest Pro-health Tartar Protection Mouthwash, I had been using an alternative brand of mouthwash. Though I was relatively pleased with the result of the alternative brand, the burning sensation I felt with every use was too intense to be enjoyable. However, Crest Pro-health Tartar Protection Mouthwash provides a clean feeling mouth with fresher breath without any burning sensation. Because I didn&#x27;t have any discomfort in using this product, I felt I could really swish the product around to really get in the grooves and spaces between my teeth. With the alternative brand, I never strayed far from the sink so I could immediately spit out the product. This often left me feeling like I didn&#x27;t get as much value from the product as I may have been able to.  I also didn&#x27;t use it more than once a day. I&#x27;ve noticed myself reaching for this Crest mouthwash throughout the day because I don&#x27;t have to dread the feeling of intense burning gums when I use it. I also haven&#x27;t found myself asking &amp;#34;Why do I do this to myself every day?&amp;#34; Ha Ha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed the fresher breathe this product provides so I keep a bottle of Crest Pro-health Tartar Protection Mouthwash in my office at work. I like having this handy to use after lunch or to freshen up a bit before meetings.It&#x27;s a win-win for me and my co-workers!</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection rinse for several weeks now. I started using this rinse when I recieved it FREE as part of a Crest campaign-a time where I was having terrible tooth pain/sensitivity following a cavity filing. I started using a sensitivity protection toothpaste but was left with a not-so-clean feeling afterwards. I started following my brushing ritual with rinsing with Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection rinse. At first I was soooo happy to have a fresh mouth back.....then I realized that I wasn&#x27;t experiencing that horrible burning at the end like I had with other brands of mouthwash. How could I be winning on both levels? Pure luck? No- this product was the answer to my problems! I was able to continue using my sensitivity toothpaste and have fresh clean breath. I can&#x27;t wait to have my next cleaning and see how little tartar they have to combat! This product is definitely worth replacing your old burning rinse with!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Pro-Health with Tartar Protection now for a couple of weeks. I have noticed that I do not have as much build up through the days now. At first I could not tell the difference since I was new to the product. My other mouthwash helped with keeping my breath fresh but did nothing for the tartar build up that occours. The Crest does a wonderful job on keeping my breath fresh for about a 1 1/2 hours that I can notice directly. With the Crest I have went to 3x per day on the use because it does not seem to last as long as my Listerene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some additional benefits:&lt;br /&gt;Fights unwanted surface stains&lt;br /&gt;Strengthens weakened enamel&lt;br /&gt;Freshens breath&lt;br /&gt;Makes dentist appointments more enjoyable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Pro-health kills 99% of the germs that cause plaque, gingivitis and bad breath — all without the burn of alcohol. The mouthwash provides 12 hour protection to help:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prevent and reduce plaque build-up&lt;br /&gt;Fight bad breath&lt;br /&gt;Prevent and reduce gingivitis for healthy gums&lt;br /&gt;Freshen breath without the burn of alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Keep teeth cleaner for longer*&lt;br /&gt;Kill germs&lt;br /&gt;Get better dental check-ups**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, use it 2X a day after you brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey! Did you know rinsing with Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash or Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash can lead to better dental check-ups? I do not know anyone that does not want better dental check-ups!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a sample for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

            <li> I love Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection with fluoride.  It made my mouth feel so clean and fresh without the burn of alcohol like  other mouthwashes.  I also feel there is less tartar buildup on my teeth! I highly recommend this product! #FreeFromCrest #ThanksBzzAgent</li>
            <li> I was apart of the bzzagent campaign and got this product to try. I absolutely love it as it did not leave my mouth feel like it was burning immediately after taking a rinse to rinse my mouth! Mind you, not one brushes or flosses perfectly, and I felt like my teeth were really clean while using this! Proud to say my house will be switching from listerine to crest!</li>
            <li> I received #crest pro health tartar protection mouthwash for free from crest while doing a bzzagent campaign and I absolutely love it such a great rinse it protects and strengthens enamel for a healthy and clean feeling it also helps prevent tartar helps prevent cavities protects against surface stains strengths weakened enamel freshens breath &amp; has a invigorating sensation and no harsh burn and even after the first rinse my mouth felt cleaner I have recommended to family and friends and they have done the switch to #freefromcrest #crestprohealth #bzzagent</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW IT MAKES MY MOUTH FEEL!!! The best part is i got to to try it for FREE!! I have tried a lot of Crest products before but by far this is the best!! BzzAgent let me try it and now I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I got a free full size bottle of the Crest Pro-Health Multi-Care mouthwash from Crest and BzzAgent. I have been using the product for a little over a month now and I absolutely love it! My mouth feels much healthier and it has a great refreshing taste! It&#x27;s definitely a product I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free thanks to Crest. I was very excited about the claim that it would protect my teeth from tartar. I liked the taste and it did not burn too much as some mouthwashes can which is great! My teeth felt very clean and my breath stayed fresh throughout the day. In regards to its claim that it would help my teeth have less tartar, I&#x27;m not sure that it was very different than the other mouthwashes that Crest offers. I didn&#x27;t notice any change in the tartar of my teeth. Overall, a great product. As a mouthwash, to keep your teeth feeling clean and your breath fresh, it did its job.</li>
            <li> Refreshing, leaves teeth so clean and no burning. I use this twice a day , as well as my family. I am using this product for free thanks to crest.</li>
            <li> A great tartar protection rinse that is gentle yet effective!  The taste is refreshing but not to harsh.  Teeth feel clean and breath is fresher.  Thanks BuzzAgent for letting me try a free sample.  All opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li> I never used to use mouthwash because I didnt like the burn or the long lasting after taste. When I got a bottle of Crest Pro-hPro-health Tartar protection in a buzz kit. I started using it everytime I was in the bathroom. Love that it has no burn, though the after taste is a bit off. And I don&#x27;t wait the 30 min after use (thats why I use it a few times a day, or if my mouth starts feeling icky),</li>
            <li> I love the way this mouth wash makes my mouth feel so clean.  I also noticed how it doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty alcohol taste in my mouth after rinsing.</li>
            <li> My first BzzAgent product was this mouthwash from Crest! The tartar protection line with fluoride helps tartar build up and surface stains. It tingles but doesn&#x27;t burn which is my favorite part! A clean, healthy mouth that shines with no cavities or tartar-cannot ask for much more. This tastes great and really does the job. Another perfect product from Crest!!&lt;br /&gt;-I am not being paid for this review, this product was sent to me for free from BzzAgent-</li>
            <li> Today is 5/15. On 4/30 I laid in a dental chair for 7.5 hours while the dentist did root scaling and planing on my teeth and below my gums. 20 numbing shots later, my teeth felt better and cleaner then I ever remember them being! To my dismay, even with proper brushing and flossing I could feel the plaque building back up. BzzAgent sent me a full size sample of Crest Tartar protection as part of Crests brand promotion. Ive been using it twice a day for the full minute and can feel the difference before and after!! I am excited to add a little of this to my new Waterpik for additional protection! No more scaling and root planing for me!!</li>
            <li> I really like how clean my mouth feels after using this wash.  It doesn&#x27;t have the initial shock of some other mouthwashes.  It is easy to work into my daily routine.  I have seen a significant decrease in tartar buildup and looking forward to continue using this product moving forward.  I did receive this product free courtesy of Crest.</li>
            <li> Just swish and done! I live this simple product. The bottle is modern, the label is clean, and the blue color is fun. I like the minty flavor alot but I really love that there is no burn to this mouthwash. I wish it did come in a larger quantity as it seemed to go pretty quickly in my household. I felt my teeth feeling cleaner the more I used it and I can only  hope that it is helping my teeth from tarter. Crest is a well known brand and I think this product fits well in their product line. Thanks Crest for the free trial of the product!</li>
            <li> Best mouthwash ever! This product cleans and refresh without that harsh burn. This is the product that is worth the buy. Im a buzzagent and i got to try this product free. Trust me this product is amazing....</li>
            <li> I am excited to have been given the opportunity to try a free sample of Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection with Fluoride by BzzAgent!  I must say that this product is amazing!  I have used it for less than a week, and I am already seeing results!  It leaves a fresh feeling and taste to my mouth, and I can already feel less plaque when I run my tongue along my teeth!  It causes a bit of a tingle to my tongue, but it is not overwhelming like some products that I have tried.  I would definitely recommend Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection with Fluoride!</li>
            <li> I started using this product about two weeks ago (thanks to Crest, they shipped it to me for FREE), and I can clearly see and feel a difference! I am a coffee drinker and a smoker so over the years my teeth have gotten a little yellow. Since using this product my teeth are getting whiter, and they don&#x27;t feel as sensitive as they did before.</li>
            <li> I joined a free test of Crest&#x27;s ProHealth Tarter Protection Mouthwash challenge because I am a BzzAgent. Even though I got this product free for testing, the opinions I post here are my own and have not been paid for by Crest or the BzzAgent.  I found this to be a decent mouthwash.  I like that it&#x27;s not a harsh burning sensation like some mouthwashes, especially if it&#x27;s used daily.  I regularly use mouthwash, however, normally I choose a mouthwash with whitening power, which the Crest&#x27;s ProHealth Tarter Protection Mouthwash doesn&#x27;t offer.  Other than that, I do like this mouthwash because of its minty flavor, and makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Love this mouthwash!!!! Thanks to crest and bzz agent I got to try it tottally free!! But this mouthwash is amazing! Makes my mouth feel so fresh and even in between brushes my mouth feels amazing! It it definitely one you should try!</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I got a full size bottle of this for free from BzzAgent and Crest a few weeks before my most recent dental checkup. This review is my own honest opinion. I use it at least twice a day or more and my last checkup went really well. There was not a lot of scraping by the hygienist to remove tartar and plaque from my teeth and I can see it was a result of using Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash. I have used other mouthwashes in the past but they have not impacted my checkups in such a positive way. For those who care about taste, it tastes great and I can easily use it more than once a day (which I do sometimes). I do not like the no eating or drinking for 30 minutes after using this but I do it anyway. When my bottle is done I will definitely get more to keep the tartar off my teeth since brushing alone without using this will lead to more buildup and more scraping when I go to the dentist in the next three months. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to have great clean teeth without a weird aftertaste and spend less time getting tartar scraped off their teeth in the dentist&#x27;s chair. #crestprohealth #freefromcrest</li>
            <li> Just started using the new Crest Pro Health Tartar protection mouth wash. Been using it for a week now and the sensitivity I had in one tooth is now gone when I drink hot and cold. I cannot tell too much of a difference in the tartar control. What I am not noticing (in comparison to my previous mouth wash) are any whitening benefits. I also do not 100%  enjoy the flavor. Overall I would buy the product again and use it when I have sensitivity problems arise. If you are looking for a good &amp;#34;all-around&amp;#34; mouthwash, I would recommend trying another Crest product like the Multi Protection line.  Disclosure: Thanks to Crest for sending me this product for free to try and review</li>
            <li> this is a really good product i have been using it a couple of weeks it leaves my  breath smelling nice and clean all day long i feel really confident with using this</li>
            <li> I took part in a bzzagent campaign and got this product to try for free. I really enjoyed using this mouthwash, it is very effective at reducing tartar on your teeth and freshening your breath. I really liked the tingling feeling it leaves in your mouth because you can feel it working and it makes your mouth feel very clean. I am not a fan of the refreshing mint flavor, but i would definitely use this product again. I like how this product actually works and I would definitely recommend trying this product if you have not already!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been using this product that I recieved for FREE thanks to Crest.. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this mouthwash compared to others that I&#x27;ve used mostly because of the not so intense mint flavor and because I think I&#x27;ve actually seen results! You use it twice a day, mostly after you eat I think. The only downside is you&#x27;re not supposed to eat or drink anything for thirty minutes after using the wash but other than that- great product!</li>
            <li> Every so often, I will begin the routine of using mouthwash. Usually I stop because I don&#x27;t like the taste or the mouthwash burns. This was a welcome change. The first two or three times I used this, I did feel a burning sensation on my gums and tongue, but after, I never felt burning or tingling. The mouthwash felt smooth in my mouth and had a subtle mint flavor. I did not find the flavor overwhelming and it felt my mouth feeling fresh. The minty-fresh breath lasted about an hour or two (or until I ate if that was sooner). I used immediately after brushing in the morning and night. My teeth felt smooth and if touched, my gums also felt smooth and clean (no icky build up at all). I tested this product for free from BzzAgent and am glad that I did---I recommend this mouthwash for anyone who is sensitive to strong mouthwashes...this is gentle, fresh tasting, and leaves your mouth feeling clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle free from Crest to try, and I absolutely love it. I was a long time Listerine user, but this doesn&#x27;t have that alcohol sting AND leaves my teeth feeling clean. After just a couple weeks my teeth are whiter and my mouth just feels fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this for free thanks to Crest and am very impressed based on my experience. I have been looking for a mouth wash that diminishes the bad odor in my mouth for a long time and have not been able to until now.  This leaves my mouth with a fresh breath that lasts the entire day.  This even does more than a mouthwash, as it eliminates tartar build-up and prevents cavity. I can just use a regular toothpaste without cavity or tartar protection and rely on this to eliminate cavity or tartar.  It is easy and quick to use twice a day.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion through bzzagent.com. I loved it! It left my breath feeling fresh all day. My teeth weren&#x27;t in the best shape and I feel like this product has helped that. I expect a great dentist visit the next time I go. :) Also the taste isn&#x27;t bad at all and it doesn&#x27;t burn like some other mouthwashes I have tried.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that my teeth were so shot that I had to put flouride on my teeth overnight to streignthen my said enamel . This makes it alot easier on me . Very nice taste + makes my mouth feel refreshed and energized. Only issue is that the alcohol really drys out my mouth , but the mouth wash does not have that &amp;#34; sting &amp;#34; that most products in this area have . Would recommend</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of the Crest Pro-Health line. The mouthwashes I regularly use are the &amp;#34;Multi-Protection&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Complete&amp;#34; (which contains fluoride). I got to try the Tartar Protection formula thanks to a 500 ml sample from Bzzagent. I was eager to try it because even with regular brushing, flossing and mouthwash I still always have a tartar scraping adventure when I go in for a cleaning. I am hoping this mouthwash will reduce my tartar but I won&#x27;t know until next month when I go in for my cleaning. In any case, here&#x27;s a brief rundown of the Pros and Cons. Pros: Seems to clean and freshen breath after brushing as well as the other Pro-Health formulas Very light &#x27;burn&amp;#34; compared to other mouthwashes with alcohol such as Listerine. Cons: An unusual &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34; taste which reminds me of older mouthwashes such as Cepacol. It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s also not a pleasant taste. There is also a light alcohol burn. This is in sharp contrast to the other Pro-Health rinses that have no alcohol and have a very smooth, pleasant taste.  Would I go out and get more? That depends on how well it does a job on my tartar build-up. If the other Pro-Health formulas reduced tartar I would stick with them because they taste a lot better. However, if this one really does make a noticeable dent in my tartar build-up then I would get more of it since nothing else I have used (outside of flossing) seems to help in reducing it. Update: At my next dental checkup my tartar buildup was definitely better. Not gone completely but a lot less chipping away. I was surprised because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special in the ingredients that looks like it would help with tartar, any more than other Crest mouthwashes. In any case, it was enough to make me want to get more and see if the tartar reducing trend continues  as well as to bump my previous 3 star rating up a notch.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this as a promotion from BzzAgent.  After using it for several weeks I have noticed how much cleaner my teeth feel and my breath smells good too. I also like that my entire family can use it too since it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth like other mouthwashes seem to do.  #BzzAgent #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I love the crest pro-health tartar protection mouthwash. You really can tell a difference from the first time you use it. Thanks to BzzAgent and Crest I was lucky enough to get this for free. I will definitely keep using this product in the future. It really does help with tartar build up and plaque. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After several weeks (and just about a full bottle) of me and my husband using Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is mild, but minty.&lt;br /&gt;The results are great!&lt;br /&gt;I have a tendency towards fast tartar build up (thanks genetics!) and this mouthwash helped break down some of that build up - which means I may not need that extra cleaning this year!&lt;br /&gt;You do get a &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; that tells you it&#x27;s getting the job done - but there is NO burn. I hate the burn of other mouthwashes - Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash saves me from that uncomfortable feeling every day. It&#x27;s glorious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Even though I got to try Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash for free as part of a BzzCampaign, courtesy of Crest; I&#x27;ll probably just switch to this product permanently. I like it that much.&lt;br /&gt;(For the other side, my husband isn&#x27;t a fan. He thinks the flavor is weak and he likes the burn of the alcohol heavy mouthwashes.)</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest for the promotion product here are my thoughts.  I loved it, it never burned while using it. The taste was so much better than other brands I have tried, even my teenagers liked it. My whole mouth felt happy and healthy after using it. I do wish there was a way of cutting out the dyes and artificial sweeteners but then again no one would really buy it them. Over all I feel like this is a great product and I hope I get a great check up at the dentist in July from using it.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Rinse. My opinions are strictly 100% my own and not influenced by receiving the product for free. It is so invigorating and refreshing. My mouth feels clean after I use the mouth wash. I really do feel that this mouthwash works....but I don&#x27;t think there is anything that makes the brand unique. I felt like it did everything listerine did for me. I did find that the next morning when I woke up, there was a bad taste in my mouth...I didn&#x27;t have that happening to me until I used this mouthwash</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash is my new fave! It doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol burn that other brands do. The taste is nice and minty fresh. It makes my mouth feel clean and invigorated. And I can already tell a difference in the lack of tartar or plaque buildup on my teeth. I&#x27;m happy to add this to my brushing routine every day. Thanks BzzAgent for sending me a bottle to test and review!</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle from another site to test. I like the minty taste and it makes my whole mouth feel fresh and clean. I do wish that it kept my mouth fresh for a little longer but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li> I would buy and recommend crest pro tarter protection mouthwash. It&#x27;s like a tingly fresh mint in your mouth but still with no burning, but leaves your mouth feeling completely clean. If better dental visits, less scraping, more confidence, less surface stains on teeth and strengthened enamel are something u look for in a mouthwash, look no further. Crest has you covered! A special thanks to Buzzagent and crest for letting me test this product for free, however the opinion of this review is 100% my own.

            <li> It was a great product, left my breath feeling great. It just didn&#x27;t wash away plague like the bottle had said. Overall, however, I really liked it and will buy it next time as I was part of a campaign this time and received it for free from Crest!</li>
            <li> I got this to try and I love it compared to the mouthwash I had been using.  This has a great flavor and leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed. I don&#x27;t think I will be switching back to what I had been using because it was too harsh and this provides the enamel strengthening I desire. #CrestSmile #FreeFromCrest</li>
            <li> So far I have been using the Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection mouth rinse almost every day for about two and a half weeks now. The Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection mouth rinse comes in a clear bottle whose label exclaims &amp;#34;Escape the Scrape&amp;#34;, meaning that it helps keep tartar away so that at your next dental cleaning, the hygienist doesn&#x27;t have to scrape so much plaque (hardened tartar) off your teeth. You are supposed to use the rinse twice a day after brushing and flossing, swishing it in your mouth for one minute each time. You are not supposed to eat or drink for at least thirty minutes after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other Crest Pro-Health produces and I was worried about trying this mouth rinse because a lot of the other Crest Pro-Health products contain &amp;#34;Stannous Flouride&amp;#34;, which I cannot use. I am one of the small percentage of people of who when we use &amp;#34;Stannous Flouride&amp;#34; it stains our teeth a brown/yellow color that is very, very, very hard to remove. I learned this the hard way when Crest first began their Pro-Health line. Yes, my teeth felt cleaner and smoother than they ever had, BUT, within about two weeks of using them I developed severe brown staining on ALL my teeth that my hygienist had to work hard to remove. It was embarassing. This CREST PRO-HEALTH TARTAR PROTECTION mouth rinse does NOT contain &amp;#34;Stannous Flouride&amp;#34;, rather it uses &amp;#34;Sodium Flouride&amp;#34;, which does not cause staining. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have had a dental cleaning fairly recently, it will months before I will know if this product does what it claims, but I have noticed that since I started using it that my teeth do feel smoother. I also feel like my breath is fresher for a longer period of time in the morning, than when I just brush and floss. That makes me happy! The taste of this mouth rinse is a mild mint taste, but there is a slight burn because there is alcohol in the tartar protection variety. That&#x27;s not a huge deal to me, but it might be to some consumers. However, unlike other mouth rinses that contain alcohol, this one does not have a medicinal taste. I like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The reason why I did not rate the Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection mouth rinse with five stars is because the other day as I was flossing my teeth before using the mouth rinse, I noticed blue staining on the sides of my eye teeth. I have a tooth scraper at home, so I scraped at the blue staining. It appeared as if the blue substance was sticky tartar that had been colored blue from the mouth rinse! The blue staining scraped off easily, but it concerned me that the coloring from the mouth rinse had stained my teeth. It&#x27;s the only blue substance I have had in my mouth recently, so I don&#x27;t think the blue stains were from anything else. It was probably a little tartar build up I had missed whenever I floss my eye teeth. It would be nice if the Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection mouth rinse didn&#x27;t have any artificial colors in it. I don&#x27;t really see the point of it having a color, other than that maybe people think since it is colored blue that it is &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall I am happy with this mouth rinse. I can&#x27;t wait to go to my next cleaning to see if I have less build-up for my hygienist to scrape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free bottle of Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection mouth rinse in Refreshing Mint flavor from BzzAgent in return for my honest opinion.to some consumers.

            <li> I Cant Believe How Awesome This Mouth Wash Is! It REALLY Works! Everyone should try it!</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s hard to tell whether the &#x27;tartar&#x27; part of this mouthwash is effective or not (at least I can&#x27;t tell), I really like how fresh it makes your mouth feel. After swishing with this, I noticed my breath was fresh for hours! Plus, the mouthwash isn&#x27;t super &#x27;spicy&#x27; to where it makes your eyes water, but it has enough zing to it. One thing that would be nice is if this variety came in some other flavors, especially unique ones that other brands do not have available! So thank you, BzzAgent, for allowing me to try this complimentary for review purposes! (:</li>
            <li> I have been a hardcore user of Listerine and all generic versions (Equate/CVS) since I was a teen. I thought I needed all that alcohol to kill germs. However, after a recent free sample was sent my way via BzzAgent, I have to say that this product really impressed me. First, it didn&#x27;t sting as much and had a really nice flavor. I have had big dental bills my entire adulthood and was often told to use a fluoride rinse due to low dentin. I really love this product and wish I had considered it sooner. The only downside is this is definitely costlier than my prior brands. But it does leave a tingly sensation for at least a half hour after use that I found refreshing and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Well ive been using it for a few days now and its not bad. Leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh. Since its alcohol free it doesnt burn moke listerine. A downside to it is i felt like what i can describe a crysta residue but that could just be the tartar protection. I had recieved this product as survey campaign on bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash for about a week, thanks to bzzagent.com, and so far I have nothing but good things to say. It&#x27;s refreshing and leaves you with a clean feeling for hours! Most mouthwashes seem to burn but this one is great and my teeth have never looked better!</li>
            <li> I received this free from BzzAgent. I LOVE the product and have been using it daily since I got it. I can&#x27;t imagine my life before Crest Pro-Health. I have poor teeth enamel and have noticed less plaque build up over time!</li>
            <li> Started using this a few weeks ago when I received a free sample from Crest through Bzz agent and the product is great. I have never really enjoyed other mouth washes until I tried this.  It is the first mouth wash that isn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; and my mouth definitely feels fresher is the morning.</li>
            <li> I would purchase this product again. The only gripe I had with it was the white top was a little difficult for someone with small hands to open. It is one of those push and screw tops, but it seems the top is too thick. I&#x27;ve used the product a handful of times and like that it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong after taste. Within 15-20 any trace of the taste was gone.</li>
            <li> At first the taste was a bit strong, but not as strong as several other rinses that I have used in the past. Since it is a mouthwash, I am pretty much used to that anyway. Plus, once I began swishing it around, I actually got used to it. Now I enjoy the minty taste. The best part is, it keeps my mouth feeling clean and fresh way longer than other brands of popular mouthwashes out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now incorporating Crest Pro-Health Mouthwash into my daily oral care routine. Since I&#x27;m a huge coffee and tea drinker, I also appreciate that fact that it helps to ward off surface stains. This is a huge plus in my book! I do wish the bottle came in a bigger size, since it does get depleted much quicker in a household with multiple users. My next dental check-up is in a couple of months, so I can’t wait to see what my dentist thinks. (Although I did receive a free bottle of Crest Pro-Health Tarter Protection to try through a promotion, my opinions expressed here are my own pure honest views of the product)</li>
            <li> Loved it, left my mouth feeling fresh, without that overly antiseptic taste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use mouthwash often but i really enjoyed this one. it doesn&#x27;t get to foamy or start to burn your mouth like other mouthwashes do. i will be buying this again and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this for free from Crest and I&#x27;m happy with my results. I started to see an improvement almost immediately. It keeps my teeth feeling clean all day long.</li>
            <li> I was SUPER excited - and slightly skeptical - when Crest sent this to try for free from BzzAgent (#GotItFree), but I am impressed!  I typically struggle with finding a good mouthwash because I hate the burning after I&#x27;ve attacked my mouth with my toothbrush and strong toothpaste!  I also despise a nasty, medicine-like aftertaste some of the strong mouthwashes leave.  THIS, however, was fantastic and it&#x27;s definitely a keeper!  It didn&#x27;t battle with my toothpaste for an aftertaste; if anything, it complemented it!  And it left my mouth feeling noticeably fresher starting my morning.  No burning, pleasant and subtle aftertaste - I dig it!  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I was very unsure about this mouth wash at first just because I have always used 1 mouth wash brand and never changed it. If you don&#x27;t feel the burn its not truly getting your mouth clean enough.For me starting the morning off right is important to me because it sets the mood for the rest of your day. You get your shower, get dressed, throw on some make up, some even drink morning coffee and go about there day. Although I felt that something important was missing from my everyday routine. So I started using this new mouth wash that I #gotforfree from #bzzagent. It is #CrestProHealth moth wash in the tartar protection formula. I have been using the same mouth wash for about 10 years. When I got this in the mail I was excited about it because it was something new for me to try but on the other side of that I was thinking yeah right. This is not going to compare to the mouth wash that I am using now. Well guess what , I was so wrong. I actually thing that using that Tartar protection formulas enhances the deep clean feeling in my mouth after using the moth was. It make my teeth feel so clean, and my mouth as fresh as a mint. It helps making your weaker teeth more strong, helps with the tartar that builds up on your teeth, helps with stains that you my have, I m a coffee drinker all day so that is a big plus for me , and most importantly, when rinsing with it you get a nice feeling of clean as you switch it around your mouth without the initial stinging and burning feel. Your left with just a nice deep clean. I really love using this mouth wash. Its a great clean. It has been keeping the tartar off my teeth, so I made the switch. As a member of #bzzagent I was able to try this product #free in exchange for my honest opinion on it. @crest #CrestProHealth #FreefromCrest</li>
            <li> Me and my family have always been fans of mouth wash and this is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. It left my mouth feeling fresh and minty. I also loved how there was no overpowering burn while I was using it. This is my new mouth wash brand! !</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free to test out thanks to Crest and I love it!! My mouth feels so clean and fresh without the burning taste/feel from strong alcohol and I&#x27;ve noticed less tartar &amp; plaque build up on my teeth since I started using it! I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a great &amp; hard working mouthwash!</li>
            <li> Great Flavor !! Love this Product . We usually use the store Brand.But I can already see the difference !! Thank you BzzAgent For the free Sample !! I will be using this From now on !!</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve tried multiple mouthwash but this one is the best. leaves my mouth refreshinng, quite strong</li>
            <li> This is the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve used in a long time. It taste good, It doesn&#x27;t burn my gums, awesome fresh sensation in my mouth for a while, nice color. I really loved it. After using it my teeth feel smooth and shinny. It&#x27;s a MUST HAVE!.</li>
            <li> I been using Crest pro health tartar protection and I can say I&#x27;m starting to like it because of how my mouth feels after I rinsed. I just have to keep reminding myself not to eat or drink for 30 min after I rinsed.</li>
            <li> Awesome mouthwash. It does not burn you like the others do and still leaves you smelling and feeling clean after you brush. I definitely recommend using this product over the competition. Excellent job by Crest!</li>
            <li> I was accept into a free Sample  of Crest&#x27;s ProHealth Tarter Protection Mouthwash challenge!I found Crest Pro-Heath does give your mouth the protection it deserves,  Growing up using  Listerine, I was surprised by how much I liked this product. This mouthwash not only makes your breath fresh - it also makes your mouth feel clean. With tartar protection and fluoride, My Dentist was lso very surprised at my next cleaning. All i can say is 10 starts to this product</li>
            <li> After I started using crest, my husband quit complaining about me having bad breath. I also was getting better results from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love taste and looking forward to my next dentist visit!</li>
            <li> Great product! I felt the clean longer than any other brand! I couldn&#x27;t have tried this amazing product without the help of BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free from Crest and have noticed my breath is much better. I drink coffee and have not had a problem since trying Crest. It will be in cabinet from now on.</li>
            <li> I have been incredibly satisfied with the Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection Mouthwash that I received free from Crest to try. The first thing I noticed was the lack of &amp;#34;mouth sting&amp;#34; compared to other mouthwashes; I was able to swish away for a minute without feeling like my mouth was in minty pain. After using the product for a week, I was able to notice that my teeth felt cleaner due to less plaque buildup. I&#x27;m confident that this product does what it claims it does! I&#x27;m actually looking forward to my next dentist visit. Thank you Crest!</li>
            <li> I used to think all mouthwash was the same, so I did not mind receiving Crest Pro-Health with Tartar Protection to try in place of my regular mouthwash as a freebie from BzzAgent and Crest.  I trust the &amp;#34;Crest&amp;#34; brand since I have used their toothpaste with good results for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this product for over a month, along with regular brushing and flossing, I expect my next dental checkup will show no problems beyond normal tartar buildup since that was my previous result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product packaging was easy to use and the cap is easier to open than the pinch and twist safety caps on other bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I did not find anything objectionable ingredients, one should take heed of the warning label on the bottle: &amp;#34;If more than used for is accidentally swallowed, get medical help or call a Poison Control center right away.&amp;#34;  Sounds crazy, but I had a housemate in college who used to swallow his toothpaste thinking it would give him fresher breath.  Keep it simple and just rinse and spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding daily and twice daily use: After rinsing with the product, I did not like the funny aftertaste and prefer the other brand recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the Crest Brand - and have used other ProHealth mouthwashes before.  This was the first time I tried the Tartar Protection one thanks to BzzAgent!  I used it on-and-off for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I liked:&lt;br /&gt;-- The flavor.  It isn&#x27;t too strong and it what most people would come to expect in a mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;-- During the swishing/rinsing, it doesn&#x27;t burn or string your mouth.  Now, I do traditionally have some sensitive spots in my mouth from gum recession and cavities that were filled, but I noticed no pain in even these areas.&lt;br /&gt;-- My mouth actually did feel refreshed and cleaner when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the one thing I didn&#x27;t care for:&lt;br /&gt;When I spit the rinse out, my mouth continued to water (with a slight burn) and I kept wanting to spit out the product (even though it already was spit out).  This was so bad that I ended up rinsing my mouth out with water - which I&#x27;m not sure if this then lost some of the benefits of the initial rinse.  I figured out that diluting the rinse before hand with some tap water made it possible for me to spit it out at the end without needing to re-rinse with more tap water.&lt;br /&gt;I would use this product again and would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It make my mouth feel clean and invigorating and freshens my breath. The whole family really enjoy using Crest Pro Health every morning and night. Crest is a name that my family have trusted for years, I grew up using this brand. The flavor is really invigorating, not intense that it burns your mouth, but it wroks you can see and feel the diffrence. My gums feel healthier,tatar has reduce,made my eeth healthiers, after I have used it for a couple of times. I received a sample of this product from Smiley360. Thank you #smiley360  and  #crestprohealth.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection has to be my new favorite mouthwash. Other mouthwashes in the past have left this weird, metallic taste in my mouth when they were supposed to leave a &amp;#34;clean feeling&amp;#34;.  Crest Pro-Health was totally different. The flavor was &amp;#34;refreshing mint&amp;#34; and it reminded me of the flavor of chewing gum. This mouthwash does have alcohol in it but it wasn&#x27;t overly powerful and didn&#x27;t burn my sensitive gums! I give this mouthwash 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I would recommend it to everyone. Not only does it leave your breath fresh, it also fights tartar while using it.  Thanks to Buzzagent and Crest for letting me test this product for free.</li>
            <li> I am trying this product for free from crest and absolutely love it! I am normally a listerine girl, but maybe sold! The #1 greatest thing I love is it doesn&#x27;t sting my mouth when swishing and the clean feeling last!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface this review by disclosing I was sent this product for free to try and give my thoughts on it after a trial period thanks to BzzAgent!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks down, at least twice daily and I am definitely seeing great results and so far I have zero complaints. Great product. I am definitely noticing less tartar build up, and much fresher breath. The taste isn&#x27;t awful and I don&#x27;t experience the severe burning sensation with this mouth wash that you may have with other mouthwashes. Overall I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars. I like it very much! Thank you BzzAgent&amp;#60;3!</li>
            <li> mind had previous bad experience with mouthwashes because most have bad taste. When testing crets pro health tartar protection I saw the difference. It really reduce the tartar of your theeth. I use this two times per day after brush and I can tell you that this works. It have a good taste like mint. Leave a fresh sesation on your mouth. In only one week usin this product 2 times daily you would see the tartar of your theeth reduce in 95% so this is awesome. I recieved cres pro health tartar protection for free thanks to bzzagent. If it works for me , trust me Can do the same for you. You should tried.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell a difference in how fresh it makes my breath or how well it protects my teeth, in comparison to other brands, but I do love the refreshing mint flavor and the fact that it has a relatively low alcohol content. I would definitely recommend this brand to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awsome! I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best one that I&#x27;ve tried. There isn&#x27;t any burning your mouth off feeling while tears running down your face, no gum and mouth peeling afterwards as I&#x27;ve done both with another product. This didn&#x27;t leave a residue on my mouth or teeth and the taste was ok. It could be better but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering or taste terrible. This is now my mouthwash of choice. This left my mouth feeling perfect and I like that it will help my teeth, not just bad breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A special thanks to Buzzagent and Crest for letting me test this product for free, however, the opinion of this review is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have always been a fan of Crest products and when I got the opportunity to try this for free I jumped on it.  It has a great taste leaves your mouth fresh!</li>
            <li> I received this as a free gift from crest. It does everything it says! I love this product and will be buying it from now on!</li>
            <li> I recieved this as part of an online promotion from Crest. I like it. I really do. It doesn&#x27;t burn but still leaves your mouth feeling fresh. And we could all use some tartar control :)</li>
            <li> BzzAgent and Crest provided me with a bottle to try of Crest Pro-Health, and I am enjoying the change!  The girls at work are noticing my smile is whiter and I feel my breath stays freser at the start of my day.  Crest doesn&#x27;t have that alcohol burn and makes it easier to rinse for the full minute.  My mouth feel so much better after rinsing and really last for hours afterwards.  I was surprised how quickly I began to want that fresh taste at bedtime and in the mornings to start my day refreshed.  I have changed my mouthwash from now on and look forward to seeing whiter and stronger teeth after continuous use.  YOU will taste the difference!</li>
            <li> i got this product as a promotion from Crest through bzzagent.com i like that it gives my mouth a very clean feeling and my fresh breath lasts almost all day. only downside is that its flavor is a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I received this product free for review purposes from BzzAgent and Crest. I have been using it for a few weeks now. I do like that there is no painful burn, but it does get a little tingly. The flavor is pretty comparable to any mouthwash, although I do find that it keeps my mouth feeling fresher longer. If it really is doing it&#x27;s job, I am really looking forward to &amp;#34;escaping the scrape&amp;#34; at my next dental appointment!</li>
            <li> I received this mouthwash as a trial for bzzAgent for free! This is a nice mouthwash. It doesn&#x27;t leave a strange taste or feel in your mouth. It&#x27;s not overly strong. We use it after brushing in the morning and before bed. My husband and I both have very sensitive teeth and it doesn&#x27;t increase the sensitivity like several others we have tried. I would highly recommend it to all!</li>
            <li> Got this products free from BuzzAgent.&#x3D;) My dentist even recommended mouthwash that said Pro-Health on it and had fluoride in it. Since I have braces I need to at least rinse my  mouth every time I eat. I eat 5-6 times a day, so I can&#x27;t brush my teeth every time, but I can use mouthwash or swish with water. I heard the alcohol in mouth wash can dry out your teeth so I try to use alcohol free or mix it with a little water.</li>
            <li> I was able to join a free test of Crest&#x27;s ProHealth Tarter Protection Mouthwash challenge! Even though I got this product free for testing, the opinions I post here are my own and have not been paid for by Crest or the BzzAgent...&lt;br /&gt;The tart protection has a nice flavor, and pleasant after taste... very mild and not overpowering like some other mouthwashes/rinses. There is no burning sensations from alcohol, although when I first started there was a brief (10-15 seconds) of tingling on/around my tongue. That has since stopped...Now, I have been using it for a couple of days, and have noticed my breath is a bit more pleasant throughout the day, even after eating... although I will admit, I do use a small amount after meals to help keep my chompers looking great! Brushing my teeth seem to work a bit more easy and the clean feeling lasts a bit longer! I am hoping with further use that feeling will last much more longer!! I would suggest use of this rinse to others... not sure what more I could say about mouthwash without sounding cliche... so I will leave it here for now and see what happens with future use.&lt;br /&gt;#BzzAgent #GotItFree #CrestProHealth #FreeFromCrest #CrestSmile</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash!</li>
            <li> i have been using this for over a month and I LOVE IT. my husband had his wisdom teeth removed and the day after he used it and was amazed it did not burn, crest sent a free bottle the bzzagent.com we love it</li>
            <li> Overall a great product. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two weeks and already notice a difference in less tarter buildup, whiter teeth and all without the annoying alcohol burning! #freefromcrest #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I was able to try this for free from Crest and I&#x27;m happy with my results. I started to see an improvement almost immediately. It keeps my teeth feeling clean all day long.</li>
            <li> I really like all the benefits that this mouthwash has to offer and if it will help my dental checkups that is a major plus for me. I have been using this mouthwash for about a month now and I have noticed that I have less tartar and it is really refreshing the freshness last quite a while the only thing I do not like about this mouthwash is the taste and it leaves a bad after taste that is pretty long lasting. I would like it so much more if it was in a different flavor, I tend to like mouthwash that is more of a cinnamon flavor the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a member of BzzAgent and I received Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I thought that this product worked fine. However, I like for the mouthwash that I use to give a little more of a burn. That&#x27;s how I know that it is working. It also seemed to me that this product had a little bit of a bad aftertaste. I am glad that I was fortunate enough to get to try this product out as part of a promotional offer through BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health Tartar protection has been great!  We use it daily and have noticed less tartar build up!  It has also help freshen up our breath too!  Good product!</li>
            <li> Love this Alcohol Free mouthwash! Still leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and clean! And my kids enjoy it better as well! Thanks Crest for the free sample! And the great product!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t burn and is refreshing. It&#x27;s an easy thing to add to your dental health regime. Kids like it too! I got it as a free sample and I will be buying this in the future.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash has everything I look for-gum protection as well as extra flouride to protect your teeth. Unlike others I have tried this does not burn your mouth- it is strong without the bad taste. It would be my first choice in a mouthwash. I got a sample, but this is now going to be my first choice.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection free from Crest to test and review. It has become a must-use product among everyone in my home. I previously was not using a mouthwash and feel no that I can no longer go without. What excited me about this product was that it fought against surface stains. I feel that this product met all of its claims. My teeth are not whiter, but definitely no more spots. My mouth feels significantly healthier. I especially like that I now feel more confident that my back teeth are getting a more complete clean. I also have noticed a difference in my breath, I feel like this product helps to ward off bad breath longer. I recommend this product to friends and will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I am trying this free with Crest.  This product is a good basic mouthwash.  It has a pleasant taste and does not burn like Listerine, but without that burn, I do not feel like my teeth are as clean as with Listerine.  It also does not provide the whitening benefits of Listerine.</li>
            <li> Great product-- will try to stock up when I can coupon it while on sale. Left my teeth smooth all day when I was not able to brush after lunch. My husband did say though that it made he back of his throat dry.</li>
            <li> Worked amazing and I loved the results! My teeth and mouth felt so clean. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and will buy it again for sure!</li>
            <li> I am always purchasing items that help strengthen my Enamel. So I was stoked to get this from BzzAgent to try out. I really like that it offers so much. I don&#x27;t have to use products for whitening,  enamel strengthening, freshen breath because this offers it all! And it doesn&#x27;t burn like every other mouthwash I&#x27;ve used had. From the first time I&#x27;ve used this, I was impressed. My mouth feels so clean and fresh that I&#x27;ve used it more than twice  a day on certain occasions or after certain dishes. And I feel more confident about going to the dentist after using this because it helps to control tarter and plaque build up for 12 hours and I know that isn&#x27;t an exaggeration! I will continue to use Crest Pro Health Mouthwash and Tooth Paste. If I had to change anything or improve anything about it, i wish it was fouride free but other than that it&#x27;s a GREAT mouthwash! Thank you so much BzzAgent for sending me this to try out!</li>
            <li> The sodium fluoride content of 0.02% in &#x27;Crest Pro-Health&#x27; is less than 1/2 that of &#x27;ACT Anticavity Fluoride Rinse, Cinnamon&#x27;  (at 0.05%).  More importantly (for me, anyway) I have to disagree with the other reviewer&#x27;s comment that \\&quot;the flavor is really invigorating, not intense that it burns your mouth\\&quot;.  With a high (10.8%) alcohol content, it sure as heck burns my mouth!.  So, I&#x27;d recommend the ACT...AND, ACT is considerably cheaper here on Amazon as well!</li>
            <li> Incase you havent tried Crest ProHealth Tarter protection mouth wash/rinse, here are a few things you may want to consider. After using this product a couple weeks I have notice a change in fresher breath and a smile I am no longer ashamed of. I have been using it twice a day and am a smoker. I love the after taste that does NOT burn my mouth like most others do to me. The bottle size is great for one or two people to use over a weeks time. The flavor is good and does not leave a foul taste in your mouth. In my opinion, I recommend this product to my friends and family. I will be switching to this product myself. A+++ I got it free to try from @CrestPtoHealth</li>
            <li> I loved that it doesn&#x27;t leave an alcohol taste in my mouth.  Not too strong, but strong enough.  Thanks to Buzzagent and crest for letting me test this product for free - but the opinion of this review is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Received the product via a promotion from Bzzagent. I am more a Colgate fan and never really used Crest products before. I have to admit I feel a difference using this product as it was recommended. I feel and see a difference. I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I did receive this for free for review from BzzAgent, but I am giving my own personal review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge mouthwash fan in general because I don&#x27;t particularly care for the burning, but I do like this one.  It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  I do think there is less buildup and I love the fact that it does not burn.  The taste is not my favorite, as I do not really care for overpowering mint, but that is just my personal preference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty big fan of mouthwash. I always have a bottle of it under my sink. This mouth wash tasted much better than listerine but I&#x27;m not sure if it really keeps the tartar at bay. I was having a problem with tartar between my 2 front bottom teeth and didn&#x27;t see much difference from using this mouthwash or using no mouthwash. On the other hand it definitely made my mouth feel way fresher and cleaner!</li>
