            <li>A nice neutral color.</li>
            <li>Color is lighter than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>The color is perfect, light pink, OPI is the best brand nail brand in its category</li>
            <li>Great coverage, not too pink or chalky - its a great choice!</li>

            <li>I love love love OPI nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE OPI nail polish.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>OPI lacquer is one of my favorite nail color products.</li>
            <li>I will always love OPI..</li>
            <li>This color immediately became my favorite nail polish ever.</li>
            <li>this is part of the NY ballet series and they colors and textures are just lovely.</li>
            <li>One more magnificent than the next.</li>
            <li>Will keep it because it is inoffensive and doesn&#x27;t  reek like many polishes.</li>
            <li>Fabulous hint of color!</li>
            <li>The product is ok -- it is just too light for me.</li>
            <li>OPI has done it again with a great soft shade.</li>
            <li>It is great if you want to do a pink-ish french manicure, as the top coat.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect light pink.  </li>
            <li>and I loved the natural color</li>
            <li>OPI Nail Lacquer Limited Edition New York City Ballet Collection is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I really like OPI and am a huge fan!</li>
            <li>I have used it on its own, with an almost transparent look, and I have used it as a top coat for a dark color.</li>
            <li>I had hoped this color would be more opaque, but unfortunately, it is nearly clear.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a french manicure and liked the results.</li>
            <li>I would have done better to stick with just clear.  </li>
            <li>Years ago I used a color that gave a more noticeable but still clear tinge to the nail</li>
            <li>Thanks for not disappointing!</li>
            <li>It gives a whole new look as a top coat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has superior evenly saturated color and coverage with as little as one application.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, not streaky, and gives a nice &#x27;clean&#x27; look.</li>
            <li>I love the look and all their polishes dry pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>You can never go wrong with OPI products they are the best.  </li>
            <li>The color was too light, it looked like I had a clear coat on.</li>
            <li>Very soft and clean looking.</li>
            <li>Now to be honest I purchased the entire collection on ebay (brand new) and not here, but I&#x27;ll post my review</li>
            <li>It is a similar color to my natural nail color, except with a nice metallic shine.</li>
            <li>After going to a salon that was out of my usual neutral color, I used this instead and it has become my new very favorite OPI color!  </li>
            <li>Color is opaque with only 1 coat, which is good; so many colors are not completely opaque and require many thick coats.</li>
            <li>Love this color, especially when adding a little sparkle as the top coat.</li>
            <li>Very transparent - even after 3 coats...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shimmery, but not too much.</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and last longer than most other brands.</li>
            <li>But it will not give you a light pink nail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like the pink you might use for a french manicure than a wear alone color.</li>
            <li>It stays on for at least half a week without chipping which is great.  </li>
            <li>It is very transparent, doesnt have a lot of solid color to it.</li>
            <li>it just looks like you have shiny nails now (no difference in color from natural nails).  </li>
            <li>OPI is good polish but a bit difficult to buy specific colors without seeing them on.</li>
            <li>- it had a hint of white, yet very natural.</li>
            <li>it was natural but so sheer even after 3 coats...</li>
            <li>but SO much thinner than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest if you go above 2 coats to really let it dry, even if you have a LED/UV nail lamp.</li>
            <li>and that was why I ordered it, but when held up against a nail with clear polish the difference was so minor</li>
            <li>On the other hand I have a darker color polish that, when combined with this gives a more subtle effect, so that will probably be what I do with it in future.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Neutrel shade, not too beige or pink.  </li>
            <li> This is fake and, as a result, thickens rapidly and does not yield a consistent application.</li>
            <li> Maybe the salon added something to it to make it less transparent bc</li>
            <li> This is a pale beige</li>
            <li> I understood it was very pale</li>
            <li> It will take at least 3 to 5 coats to get a non-see through shade.</li>
            <li> THey are as delicate as the ballet themselves and i bough all of the colors</li>
            <li> A little disappointed bc</li>
            <li> It was just disappointing.  </li>

            <li> It is very sheer but I love the color. When you just want a hint, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> The product is ok -- it is just too light for me.</li>
            <li> Love this color! It is a similar color to my natural nail color, except with a nice metallic shine. It just dresses my nails up a bit, and is not as noticable when it starts to chip off. Color is opaque with only 1 coat, which is good; so many colors are not completely opaque and require many thick coats.</li>
            <li> It is very transparent, doesnt have a lot of solid color to it. I thought one or two coats qould get the color, but only 4-5 does.</li>
            <li> I love love love OPI nail polish.  The colors are very nice they have a great shine and stay on longer without chipping!  This is a very nice neutral color and I get compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> OPI the only one for me</li>
            <li> The color is perfect, light pink, OPI is the best brand nail brand in its category p it goes on smooth and last longer than most other brands.</li>
            <li> I had hoped this color would be more opaque, but unfortunately, it is nearly clear. It is great if you want to do a pink-ish french manicure, as the top coat. But it will not give you a light pink nail.</li>
            <li> Love this color, especially when adding a little sparkle as the top coat. Perfect for the holidays. OPI has done it again with a great soft shade.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is not authentic OPI nail lacquer. This is fake and, as a result, thickens rapidly and does not yield a consistent application. Some nails may be lighter and/or streaked and unsmooth. There is a huge amount of online information on identifying fake OPI nail lacquer yet it continues to be sold.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect semi-sheer pinky nude. Goes on smoothly, not streaky, and gives a nice &#x27;clean&#x27; look. Love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE OPI nail polish. This is a pale beige but I like it with sparkles on top! A nice neutral color.</li>
            <li> Love the color !! Very soft and clean looking.</li>
            <li> Poor coverage and dull color...thought it was a pretty light pink, but not.  Gave this away already.  OPI is good polish but a bit difficult to buy specific colors without seeing them on. 5 for OPI, a 1 for the color/coverage. A solid 2.5</li>
            <li> Color is great....not old...and delivered in good time.</li>
            <li> Good polish and nice color.</li>
            <li> Like all OPI products, it lasts, doesn&#x27;t chip.  But this color doesn&#x27;t cover, it&#x27;s almost transparent.  I use it over Dulce la Leche for a pale pink natural color.</li>
            <li> Very transparent - even after 3 coats... A little disappointed bc I had used this color in the salon and I loved the natural color - it had a hint of white, yet very natural. I had to buy it and I did. Maybe the salon added something to it to make it less transparent bc what I received did not have the same effect...it was natural but so sheer even after 3 coats... I really like OPI and am a huge fan! But this color was very very sheer...</li>
            <li> OPI Nail Lacquer Limited Edition New York City Ballet Collection is wonderful.  You can never go wrong with OPI products they are the best.  This color is very elegant and beauiful.</li>
            <li> This is a sheer, delicate and very feminine color. I have used it on its own, with an almost transparent look, and I have used it as a top coat for a dark color. It gives a whole new look as a top coat. I love it.</li>
            <li> OPI lacquer is one of my favorite nail color products. It&#x27;s has superior evenly saturated color and coverage with as little as one application. Also, a speedy delivery and product properly fits sellers description of it.</li>
            <li> Now to be honest I purchased the entire collection on ebay (brand new) and not here, but I&#x27;ll post my review nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To let everyone know who is looking at these to buy or just one of these colors from this collection...ALL OF THEM ARE SHEER. It will take at least 3 to 5 coats to get a non-see through shade. It took 2 coats (at least for me) to get the desired look I, in particular, wanted. I&#x27;d suggest if you go above 2 coats to really let it dry, even if you have a LED/UV nail lamp.</li>
            <li> I will always love OPI.. Thanks for not disappointing!</li>
            <li> After going to a salon that was out of my usual neutral color, I used this instead and it has become my new very favorite OPI color!  Great coverage, not too pink or chalky - its a great choice!</li>
            <li> This color immediately became my favorite nail polish ever. It&#x27;s shimmery, but not too much. It changes colors for&lt;br /&gt;pink-ey to lavender . It&#x27;s a perfect color for every day, even &#x27;staid office&#x27; appropriate, but it will,work for a special,occasion as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that OPI will never discontinue making this awesome color!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect light pink.  It is fairly sheer but adds just enough to you nails to perk them up a bit.  I have used it for a french manicure and liked the results.</li>
            <li> I love the look and all their polishes dry pretty quickly.  It stays on for at least half a week without chipping which is great.  It is one of the only types of polish I will use now.</li>
            <li> I like the product but I didn&#x27;t like the color.  The color was too light, it looked like I had a clear coat on.</li>
            <li> this is part of the NY ballet series and they colors and textures are just lovely. THey are as delicate as the ballet themselves and i bough all of the colors int he series. One more magnificent than the next. ALl of them are wonderful</li>
            <li> Color is lighter than I would have liked. Will keep it because it is inoffensive and doesn&#x27;t  reek like many polishes.</li>
            <li> The color on this polish is beautiful - but SO much thinner than I expected.  I put on 3 coats, and my husband&#x27;s only comment was - it just looks like you have shiny nails now (no difference in color from natural nails).  It&#x27;s more like the pink you might use for a french manicure than a wear alone color.</li>
            <li> Neutrel shade, not too beige or pink.  Application is what you expect of OPI.  Quality of nail laquer is lastng.</li>
            <li> The quality of OPI products is known.  I have no complaints with quality.  Nor do I fault anyone that would cause a 3star rating.  The 3 stars is with the color.  I understood it was very pale and that was why I ordered it, but when held up against a nail with clear polish the difference was so minor I would have done better to stick with just clear.  Years ago I used a color that gave a more noticeable but still clear tinge to the nail and I was trying to attain the same results with this.  Didn&#x27;t happen.  I still use this polish; it isn&#x27;t THAT big a deal.  It was just disappointing.  On the other hand I have a darker color polish that, when combined with this gives a more subtle effect, so that will probably be what I do with it in future.</li>
            <li> Fabulous hint of color!</li>
