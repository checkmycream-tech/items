            <li>The romance of this relates, impressively, to this world, as opposed to fashion-mag tableaus.  </li>
            <li>It could have stayed that way had it not fallen upon the ears of one of the greatest perfumers at work today, Annick M&amp;eacute;nardo of Firmenich.</li>

            <li>The scent is vey good</li>
            <li>Very interesting fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The notes get warmer and more vanilla-esque at the end.. very very nice.</li>

            <li>Love this unisex cologne!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!!</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance!  </li>
            <li>It is a softer and quite pleasant that is quite memorable.</li>
            <li>Well, it seems it was great choice that Menardo decided to push the envelope, and even though this will never be the fragrance I will wear often (too strong for me)</li>
            <li>I own 60 bottles and growing.  </li>
            <li>people often ask me what kind of perfume I wear.</li>
            <li>I used to own this scent.  </li>
            <li>Not my perfume type, I just get hooked with the looks of the bottle and its packaging, but doesnt smell really nice.</li>
            <li>*just* liked it.</li>
            <li>Yes I liked it.</li>
            <li>but, it mellows out into a really nice scent.</li>
            <li>Bvlgari has fragrances which are very mainstream, well balanced and polished, very pleasant but</li>
            <li>but for sure the fragrance is very innovative.</li>
            <li>great product &amp; most fabulous price.</li>
            <li>It was a great purchase and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>what kind of cars they drive but it sure smells nothing like any tire I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>True..!!  </li>
            <li>you are looking for an scent that is a bit more androgynous, then this is a pretty good one!</li>
            <li>create a beautiful unique scent of light vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I have loved this perfume since it came out and still find it to be unique.</li>
            <li>Good experience, a special</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pleasant and modest.</li>
            <li>It was great when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>I use it by any occasion, but I enjoy the most while wearing it at night, it is great too for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Always the best - everyone always tells me how good I smell and want to know what I am wearing, I love that it is not sweet.</li>
            <li>SATISFIED  </li>
            <li>I love the smell to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cute, like they&#x27;re writing out ancient Latin or something.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cologne.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>A unisex perfume that gets better throughout the day.</li>
            <li>the more fragrant it becomes.</li>
            <li>this scent is not for everyone, be sure to sample it before you commit to a full-size bottle.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this more as a men&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>My Favorite.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>&quot; I am sure this not advisable for women.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like crack for my nose and makes me want him all the more.</li>
            <li>One more thing.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find it here.  </li>
            <li>That said, I love the smoky, woody heart of this scent.</li>
            <li>and I love the cinnamon smell that is integrated within the notes.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments from women and a lot of my colleagues have asked me what cologne do I</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>Girls simply love it, I&#x27;ve never got a bad/negative comment about.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t pull it myself, but I am sure others can wear it</li>
            <li>I dont think I have ever smelled a better cologne in my life.</li>
            <li>My wife seems to like this better</li>
            <li>Not really disgusting as it may seem.</li>
            <li>I checked the product code on the many \\&quot;perfume check\\&quot; sites and it seems to be manufactured February &#x27;14.</li>
            <li>my wonderful husband will love his christnas present!</li>
            <li>Though Unisex, feel it works better for women.</li>
            <li>Appears to be authentic.</li>
            <li>It smells better the longer</li>
            <li>Yes, as many have commented, it resembles a hockey puck.  </li>
            <li>I do love it, regardless, for its originality and complexity.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this fragrance...</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells on him.</li>
            <li>Cost much more retail.</li>
            <li>I love the scent on me.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I love all bulgari fragances.</li>
            <li>However, after experimenting with more fragrances,  you&#x27;ll notice this is a very unique scent.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very unique.</li>
            <li>Pretty good value</li>
            <li>This is probably the best smelling scent I&#x27;ve tried in a long time!</li>
            <li>nothing very special about them either.</li>
            <li>A very special and distinctive fragrance.</li>
            <li>had this a long time ago and forgot how great this smelled, glad to have re-visited it!</li>
            <li>As the day progresses on, it mellows out into a warm vanilla scent that&#x27;s not too strong, not to mild.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast! and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Okay, so I was looking for one unique perfume and the sales person at a store</li>
            <li>Too strong in my opinion for work.</li>
            <li>Manly, not too strong, or over bearing.</li>
            <li>THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THIS IS THE PACKAGE ,IT DID CAME IN A NICE PACKAGE .I  </li>
            <li>It smells strongly of vanilla and the tire section of Sears.</li>
            <li>I like the scent however too strong to be worn to work.</li>
            <li>We liked it very much and the price too</li>
            <li>Eventually,this first kick became the most attractive feature of this classic.</li>
            <li>it was a very interesting combination of scents, and over time, it changed into a very woodsy scent, with a hint of vanilla (like others said).</li>
            <li>A delicious, unisex, slightly kinky fragrance.</li>
            <li>And the bottle design is fine too, based on inkwell.</li>
            <li>Very woody, warm spiced scent, should give a try to it if you enjoy using Black.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves the distinct tea based juice but agrees she could not wear this and be confident in her femininity.  </li>
            <li>While this would probably smell great on either a man or a woman, I think that it&#x27;s overwhelmingly a male fragrance.</li>
            <li>Definitively it is smokey, leathery and rubbery at the very beginning which I really really like to be honest, then becomes to warm vanilla.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an interesting, slightly intriguing scent.  </li>
            <li>When right this fragrance is in my top 10.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy it leaves a lasting impression of clean taken care guy</li>
            <li>This is a very unique fragrance, right up there with Fahrenheit and A Men.  </li>
            <li>a great scent for guy, came fast and brand new in packaging.</li>
            <li>She took the rubbery idea, added a cloud of talcum powder and blended the two with a luscious fur-coat structure from the fifties, something like the original Je Reviens.</li>
            <li>This is worth a try - for experience, if nothing else!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly unique, but be warned.</li>
            <li>It arrived well packaged and in a timely fashion - many thanks!</li>
            <li>Not an offensive smell, just unique.  </li>
            <li>Yet the design is so unique, it will be a conversation piece in your collection.  </li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate it as creation on its own right.</li>
            <li>believe my skin gets a little more sweaty and is warm and the perfume smells very smooth on it.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and is the original scent.</li>
            <li>On my brother it smells too sweet</li>
            <li>I asked around about soft smelling cologne&#x27;s before I purchased it and this kind was mentioned</li>
            <li>I love the Gentle aroma of this perfume.</li>
            <li>monolithic steel towers, steamy asphalt, sweaty markets full of spices and teas ...</li>
            <li>Love the perfume, always have, and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never shipped a full bottle of perfume</li>
            <li>and i really didn&#x27;t enjoy it!</li>
            <li>After reading the many glorious reviews on this and the whole \\&quot;It smells like rubber!\\&quot; thing, I tried it and said, \\&quot;This is it, vanilla and tea?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Who</li>
            <li>Not a vile, sickeningly sweet vanilla either.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for this, but if you want to give it a shot try and find it at a discount department store.</li>
            <li>but it is durable and sweet</li>
            <li>Be easy on the trigger and you have a one of a kind, upper class, suit and tie EDT.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for the item, im so happy with it and hope to get more item later.</li>
            <li>The result is more akin to the black mink mitt James Bond uses to induce beautiful spies to talk in From Russia With Love: a torture instrument, only nobody gets hurt.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Stand apart from the crowd and show your artistic flare.</li>
            <li>I do believe that it is better suited for women that not just show up but make memorable and lasting impressions (just like the perfume itself).</li>
            <li>Classic, sexy and not overpowerful.  </li>
            <li>but the fact that it&#x27;s gone so quickly is why I rated it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>The stuff smells phenomenal and I&#x27;d highly recommend trying it out.  </li>
            <li>A very unique fragrance starting with a rubber note and then developing into  a tea note and becoming smokey.</li>
            <li>As it is a fragrance that sticks close to skin level, Black offers great flexibility as an office safe fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The engraving and distinct tire look compliment the fragrance inside.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion it is worth checking it..</li>
            <li>I buy this for me, what great soft fragrance for daily use, works for man or woman and change depending on your PH.</li>
            <li>I think it is more of a masculine fragance, but it can work for women too.</li>
            <li>RARELY anyone</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more masculine than feminine.</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li>i was really turned off when i smelled the burnt rubber like opening; but after 45 minutes, the dry down is lovely and exquisite....</li>
            <li>Very clean and classy scent.</li>
            <li>But wear just the right amount, and it&#x27;s quite divine.    </li>
            <li>Shortly after the initial application, the vanilla and leather settles into a fragrance that is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>and I would say more toward a masculine smell; however, the scent fades away much too quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells slightly sweet but mainly musky dominated by a burnt rubber like smell that can be quite nice if you use only 1 or 2 spritzes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is NOT by any means a crisp or fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Men find it strong, evident, and masculine; women are mesmerized by its fluidity and flowery scent.</li>
            <li>I suppose that the description written by the other reviewer (\\&quot;like crack for your nose\\&quot;) is accurate, but not quite elegant as I would have put it.    </li>
            <li>This is one of my absolute favorite fragrances on my better half.</li>
            <li>I occasionally sneak some for myself, as this scent is also striking on a woman.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Product was well packages &amp; exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise to avoid the Tester bottles, the standard ones are a bit more pricey however for every Tester bottle I&#x27;ve had (two or three of them)</li>
            <li>I got a sample, tried it and totally fell in love.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>Quite different compared to the modern day fresh scents that many men are wearing.  </li>
            <li>This one indeed smell of a Tire or more likely a shoe wax or a garage</li>
            <li>SOOOO glad that they finally changed the sprayer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite colognes currently.</li>
            <li>It didnt smell like the original one I had for some reason....and the scent doesn&#x27;t last on the skin, like the original one does.</li>
            <li>this is the exact item i looked for</li>
            <li>The first phase (\\&quot;tire\\&quot;) of the impression was grest on him; the \\&quot;girly\\&quot; conclusion was too feminine for him.</li>
            <li>I first got this one since I couldn&#x27;t find any in stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert, and I don&#x27;t know all that fancy fragrance jargon, but it&#x27;s good, and really what it comes down to for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually i&#x27;m much more into citrus or green scents, but this has become a cool weather, night out on the town go to scent because of its complexity!</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is like every other bvlgari bottle I own, a piece of art.  </li>
            <li>Ok, well I have not used t his perfume too much lately as I like it more for night time or weekends.  </li>
            <li>Long time favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li>They say good things come in small packages, this 2.5 ouncer packs a wallop.</li>
            <li>Bvlgari Black is a super sexy leather like fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I do love it and alternate it with Bandit, my other favorite.</li>
            <li>It lacks the alcoholic smell that backs most fragrances, replacing it with smooth tones of sandalwood.</li>
            <li>I have an allergy to propellants in certain fragrance formulations and I do not get that with this</li>
            <li>To my senses the scent seems to fade very quickly after application, which I know is a major contention some have with this product, however I&#x27;ve been told that this isn&#x27;t actually the case by those around me - even after a full night of work or day of walking the scent is still perceptible, just not to the wearer it seems.  </li>
            <li>This is not exactly what I was hoping for but it is subtle and elegant and very nice.</li>
            <li>I use it for work and some of the ladies really get attracted to the smell.</li>
            <li>This scent is really great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This is really one of the classics.</li>
            <li>Very pricey.  </li>
            <li>This is a very risky thing to buy without testing it beforehand.</li>
            <li>I really have to disagree with this being classified as a unisex fragrance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this scent!</li>
            <li>this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH FOR THIS ..</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but I kept the paper as my nose was filled with different perfumes I couldn&#x27;t make decision.</li>
            <li>The price is really unbeatable as well.</li>
            <li>like the puck design, it doesn&#x27;t take up much room and won&#x27;t fall over EVER, plus the rubber sides prevent shattering if you drop the bottle in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pi and Fahrenheit 32, Very Irresistible - Givenchy, CH for men Carolina Herrera</li>
            <li>I am female, and on my skin the primary aroma is vanilla.  </li>
            <li>Very sensual.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really see a woman wearing this.</li>
            <li>It has a rubber outer cover and it looks very luxurious.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really get that, but rather vanilla, tea (</li>
            <li>but it was much cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very \\&quot;current\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the most intriguing characteristic about Black is that it is daring - as a fragrance that provides many masculine notes yet daring enough to be worn by a woman, and vice-versa, many soft feminine notes that are daring for a man to wear.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend also loves it on me, it&#x27;s very different and unique.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rubber smell can be overpowering if you spray too much, silage is strong and not much needed of fragrance,in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true about this having a different scent.  </li>
            <li>It had an elegant, dark, smell to it.  </li>
            <li>As someone else stated, too much and you&#x27;ll smell like a new tire..</li>
            <li>Black tells a story; a coherent one in fact.  </li>
            <li>Those that penetrate &amp;#34;my space&amp;#34;, and I am &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; with that, Black garners many compliments, i.e. &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Given the uniqueness of all the notes at play, I would suggest that Black can be worn any time of year and for most events.  </li>
            <li>Always a classic.</li>
            <li>This was actually my niece asked me to order for her husband and despite the packaging - which is definitely &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; - she asked if I was sure this was for men.  </li>
            <li>Though the main weakness is the longevity, wearing all day will need to end up in close contact -which</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit peppery at first but that gives way to a sweet cedary scent.</li>
            <li>Always a classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Bvlgari Black for very nearly eight years and have received only good responses to it.  </li>
            <li>For any man or woman, I highly recommend adding to your collection.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Gives you a unique smell most guys don&#x27;t have (so tired of armani code which gets used as often as axe).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overbearing or invasive, but subtle and sexy and for me worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Bvlgari Black is quite strong, and if you wear too much, you&#x27;ll end up smelling like a tire.</li>
            <li>It is a very daring scent and should be treated as such, don&#x27;t kill your coworkers or an unsuspecting first date with this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little bit wild, contemporary, innovative, and I have to admire Annick Menardo</li>
            <li>The packaging was brand new</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it has much complexity, nor does it change much for the entire duration of a wearing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very baby-powdery and sweet.  Not as dark as the moniker.  </li>
            <li>But the only flaw is that the first 15 to 45 minutes smells like new rubber tires.</li>
            <li>and he says he can&#x27;t discern between his two bottles, and after my own fervent inspection I must say this bottle looks and smells legit from the first spray to final dry down.</li>
            <li>It doesnt matter who I walk past... they love it.</li>
            <li>Fell in love with this fragrance after receiving a small bottle from my sister.</li>
            <li>I have to day that at first I simply did not get it.</li>
            <li>I first sprayed it on, I actually smelled fire, and burnt rubber.</li>
            <li>Bulgari black is a fairly one-dimensional cologne, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Those who glorify it as being a manly, black rubber-smelling, industrial city cologne</li>
            <li>The finish about an hour later is a deep cool floral, almost jasmine/anise scent which lingers the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, I was scared and completely turned off by its initial \\&quot;tire\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li>Definitely need to be a certain someone / personality to pull this off</li>
            <li>no matter what bvlgari says, this is as uniquely masculine as it gets.  </li>
            <li>It takes on the personality of your natural skin fragrance and enhances it.</li>
            <li>Women love it,at least all the ones who smell it on me and my 30 yr.</li>
            <li>old nephew..</li>
            <li>Initially I didnt like it much.  </li>
            <li>Old one used to break after 1/3rd the bottle was gone.</li>
            <li>scent is quite masculine for a unisex product</li>
            <li>but I could definitely imagine a woman rocking it (and now that I think about it, would really entice me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having said that, it&#x27;s not that masculine.</li>
            <li>Out of the bottle, I get the vanilla and soft leather notes with under-notes of amber, floral, and musk.  </li>
            <li>It actually arrived earlier than expected, and I was able to try it out.</li>
            <li>Sweet, dark, and everything in between.  </li>
            <li>Upon first spray it&#x27;s very rubbery and heavy.  </li>
            <li>Been using this particular fragrance since its debut about ten or so years ago.</li>
            <li>One of the few true masculine fragrances out there today.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this first impression wears off giving way to a more flowery fragrance.</li>
            <li>I only wear this cologne and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is deep and dark and rich.  </li>
            <li>This one is very well done, and has layers of developing scents (on my skin it seemed to change more often than other complex fragrances did).</li>
            <li>I did not recieve it, I called amazon and at the same time they send me a new one.</li>
            <li>I actually use it as a base and add a bit of Rochas Man for the perfect combo.</li>
            <li>A bit strong so a little goes a long way but</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t see it as a fragrance worn during extreme hot temperatures.  </li>
            <li>Joop for men is to heavy and sweet for my taste, so is Black by Bvlgari,which is less sweet but very simmialr to Joop.</li>
            <li>second favorite, been using it for five years is London by Burberry, a truly truly masculine scent, which is another love it or hate it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments about it, some even \\&quot;closer\\&quot; than expected ;).</li>
            <li>have wound up using this ~60% of the time I wear scents because it mixes nicely between work and casual hanging out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the projection is modest, very close to skin level, I do get about 6-8 hours longevity out of Black and even longer on my clothing.  </li>
            <li>It did smell a little rubbery at first, but it disappears, on me at least, after twenty minutes and turns into a more vanilla-like scent that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what I expected, not old or anything like that.  </li>
            <li>Firstly I must add that this cologne, indeed, smells like a tyre and you should be very wary of how many sprays you apply to your body/clothing.</li>
            <li>Much longer lasting than other Bvlgari fragrances.</li>
            <li>Not sweet really, but a mix of smoke and vanilla.</li>
            <li>compared with other new \\&quot;trendy\\&quot; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I call that EXCELLENT AAA+++</li>
            <li> The romance of this relates, impressively, to this world, as opposed to fashion-mag tableaus.  </li>
            <li> It could have stayed that way had it not fallen upon the ears of one of the greatest perfumers at work today, Annick M&amp;eacute;nardo of Firmenich.</li>

            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> It is so good to have this perfume again.  </li>

            <li> Good price too.</li>
            <li> The women loved it and so did I.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> The scent is vey good</li>
            <li> Very interesting fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The notes get warmer and more vanilla-esque at the end.. very very nice.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!  </li>
            <li> Love this unisex cologne!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!  </li>
            <li> It is a softer and quite pleasant that is quite memorable.</li>
            <li> Well, it seems it was great choice that Menardo decided to push the envelope, and even though this will never be the fragrance I will wear often (too strong for me)</li>
            <li> I own 60 bottles and growing.  </li>
            <li> people often ask me what kind of perfume I wear.</li>
            <li> I used to own this scent.  </li>
            <li> Not my perfume type, I just get hooked with the looks of the bottle and its packaging, but doesnt smell really nice.</li>
            <li> *just* liked it.</li>
            <li> Yes I liked it.</li>
            <li> but, it mellows out into a really nice scent.</li>
            <li> Bvlgari has fragrances which are very mainstream, well balanced and polished, very pleasant but</li>
            <li> but for sure the fragrance is very innovative.</li>
            <li> great product &amp; most fabulous price.</li>
            <li> It was a great purchase and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> what kind of cars they drive but it sure smells nothing like any tire I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> True..!!  </li>
            <li> you are looking for an scent that is a bit more androgynous, then this is a pretty good one!</li>
            <li> create a beautiful unique scent of light vanilla.  </li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume since it came out and still find it to be unique.</li>
            <li> Good experience, a special</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pleasant and modest.</li>
            <li> It was great when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li> I use it by any occasion, but I enjoy the most while wearing it at night, it is great too for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Always the best - everyone always tells me how good I smell and want to know what I am wearing, I love that it is not sweet.</li>
            <li> SATISFIED  </li>
            <li> I love the smell to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute, like they&#x27;re writing out ancient Latin or something.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> A unisex perfume that gets better throughout the day.</li>
            <li> the more fragrant it becomes.</li>
            <li> this scent is not for everyone, be sure to sample it before you commit to a full-size bottle.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this more as a men&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> My Favorite.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> &quot; I am sure this not advisable for women.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like crack for my nose and makes me want him all the more.</li>
            <li> One more thing.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to find it here.  </li>
            <li> That said, I love the smoky, woody heart of this scent.</li>
            <li> and I love the cinnamon smell that is integrated within the notes.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments from women and a lot of my colleagues have asked me what cologne do I</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Girls simply love it, I&#x27;ve never got a bad/negative comment about.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pull it myself, but I am sure others can wear it</li>
            <li> I dont think I have ever smelled a better cologne in my life.</li>
            <li> My wife seems to like this better</li>
            <li> Not really disgusting as it may seem.</li>
            <li> I checked the product code on the many \\&quot;perfume check\\&quot; sites and it seems to be manufactured February &#x27;14.</li>
            <li> my wonderful husband will love his christnas present!</li>
            <li> Though Unisex, feel it works better for women.</li>
            <li> Appears to be authentic.</li>
            <li> It smells better the longer</li>
            <li> Yes, as many have commented, it resembles a hockey puck.  </li>
            <li> I do love it, regardless, for its originality and complexity.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance...</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells on him.</li>
            <li> Cost much more retail.</li>
            <li> I love the scent on me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> I love all bulgari fragances.</li>
            <li> However, after experimenting with more fragrances,  you&#x27;ll notice this is a very unique scent.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very unique.</li>
            <li> Pretty good value</li>
            <li> This is probably the best smelling scent I&#x27;ve tried in a long time!</li>
            <li> nothing very special about them either.</li>
            <li> A very special and distinctive fragrance.</li>
            <li> had this a long time ago and forgot how great this smelled, glad to have re-visited it!</li>
            <li> As the day progresses on, it mellows out into a warm vanilla scent that&#x27;s not too strong, not to mild.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast! and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was looking for one unique perfume and the sales person at a store</li>
            <li> Too strong in my opinion for work.</li>
            <li> Manly, not too strong, or over bearing.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THIS IS THE PACKAGE ,IT DID CAME IN A NICE PACKAGE .I  </li>
            <li> It smells strongly of vanilla and the tire section of Sears.</li>
            <li> I like the scent however too strong to be worn to work.</li>
            <li> We liked it very much and the price too</li>
            <li> Eventually,this first kick became the most attractive feature of this classic.</li>
            <li> it was a very interesting combination of scents, and over time, it changed into a very woodsy scent, with a hint of vanilla (like others said).</li>
            <li> A delicious, unisex, slightly kinky fragrance.</li>
            <li> And the bottle design is fine too, based on inkwell.</li>
            <li> Very woody, warm spiced scent, should give a try to it if you enjoy using Black.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the distinct tea based juice but agrees she could not wear this and be confident in her femininity.  </li>
            <li> While this would probably smell great on either a man or a woman, I think that it&#x27;s overwhelmingly a male fragrance.</li>
            <li> Definitively it is smokey, leathery and rubbery at the very beginning which I really really like to be honest, then becomes to warm vanilla.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an interesting, slightly intriguing scent.  </li>
            <li> When right this fragrance is in my top 10.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy it leaves a lasting impression of clean taken care guy</li>
            <li> This is a very unique fragrance, right up there with Fahrenheit and A Men.  </li>
            <li> a great scent for guy, came fast and brand new in packaging.</li>
            <li> She took the rubbery idea, added a cloud of talcum powder and blended the two with a luscious fur-coat structure from the fifties, something like the original Je Reviens.</li>
            <li> This is worth a try - for experience, if nothing else!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly unique, but be warned.</li>
            <li> It arrived well packaged and in a timely fashion - many thanks!</li>
            <li> Not an offensive smell, just unique.  </li>
            <li> Yet the design is so unique, it will be a conversation piece in your collection.  </li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Clean scent.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate it as creation on its own right.</li>
            <li> believe my skin gets a little more sweaty and is warm and the perfume smells very smooth on it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and is the original scent.</li>
            <li> On my brother it smells too sweet</li>
            <li> I asked around about soft smelling cologne&#x27;s before I purchased it and this kind was mentioned</li>
            <li> I love the Gentle aroma of this perfume.</li>
            <li> monolithic steel towers, steamy asphalt, sweaty markets full of spices and teas ...</li>
            <li> Love the perfume, always have, and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never shipped a full bottle of perfume</li>
            <li> and i really didn&#x27;t enjoy it!</li>
            <li> After reading the many glorious reviews on this and the whole \\&quot;It smells like rubber!\\&quot; thing, I tried it and said, \\&quot;This is it, vanilla and tea?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Who</li>
            <li> Not a vile, sickeningly sweet vanilla either.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for this, but if you want to give it a shot try and find it at a discount department store.</li>
            <li> but it is durable and sweet</li>
            <li> Be easy on the trigger and you have a one of a kind, upper class, suit and tie EDT.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the item, im so happy with it and hope to get more item later.</li>
            <li> The result is more akin to the black mink mitt James Bond uses to induce beautiful spies to talk in From Russia With Love: a torture instrument, only nobody gets hurt.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Stand apart from the crowd and show your artistic flare.</li>
            <li> I do believe that it is better suited for women that not just show up but make memorable and lasting impressions (just like the perfume itself).</li>
            <li> Classic, sexy and not overpowerful.  </li>
            <li> but the fact that it&#x27;s gone so quickly is why I rated it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The stuff smells phenomenal and I&#x27;d highly recommend trying it out.  </li>
            <li> A very unique fragrance starting with a rubber note and then developing into  a tea note and becoming smokey.</li>
            <li> As it is a fragrance that sticks close to skin level, Black offers great flexibility as an office safe fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The engraving and distinct tire look compliment the fragrance inside.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion it is worth checking it..</li>
            <li> I buy this for me, what great soft fragrance for daily use, works for man or woman and change depending on your PH.</li>
            <li> I think it is more of a masculine fragance, but it can work for women too.</li>
            <li> RARELY anyone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more masculine than feminine.</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li> i was really turned off when i smelled the burnt rubber like opening; but after 45 minutes, the dry down is lovely and exquisite....</li>
            <li> Very clean and classy scent.</li>
            <li> But wear just the right amount, and it&#x27;s quite divine.    </li>
            <li> Shortly after the initial application, the vanilla and leather settles into a fragrance that is beautiful.  </li>
            <li> and I would say more toward a masculine smell; however, the scent fades away much too quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells slightly sweet but mainly musky dominated by a burnt rubber like smell that can be quite nice if you use only 1 or 2 spritzes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is NOT by any means a crisp or fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Men find it strong, evident, and masculine; women are mesmerized by its fluidity and flowery scent.</li>
            <li> I suppose that the description written by the other reviewer (\\&quot;like crack for your nose\\&quot;) is accurate, but not quite elegant as I would have put it.    </li>
            <li> This is one of my absolute favorite fragrances on my better half.</li>
            <li> I occasionally sneak some for myself, as this scent is also striking on a woman.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Product was well packages &amp; exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise to avoid the Tester bottles, the standard ones are a bit more pricey however for every Tester bottle I&#x27;ve had (two or three of them)</li>
            <li> I got a sample, tried it and totally fell in love.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> Quite different compared to the modern day fresh scents that many men are wearing.  </li>
            <li> This one indeed smell of a Tire or more likely a shoe wax or a garage</li>
            <li> SOOOO glad that they finally changed the sprayer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite colognes currently.</li>
            <li> It didnt smell like the original one I had for some reason....and the scent doesn&#x27;t last on the skin, like the original one does.</li>
            <li> this is the exact item i looked for</li>
            <li> The first phase (\\&quot;tire\\&quot;) of the impression was grest on him; the \\&quot;girly\\&quot; conclusion was too feminine for him.</li>
            <li> I first got this one since I couldn&#x27;t find any in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert, and I don&#x27;t know all that fancy fragrance jargon, but it&#x27;s good, and really what it comes down to for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually i&#x27;m much more into citrus or green scents, but this has become a cool weather, night out on the town go to scent because of its complexity!</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is like every other bvlgari bottle I own, a piece of art.  </li>
            <li> Ok, well I have not used t his perfume too much lately as I like it more for night time or weekends.  </li>
            <li> Long time favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li> They say good things come in small packages, this 2.5 ouncer packs a wallop.</li>
            <li> Bvlgari Black is a super sexy leather like fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I do love it and alternate it with Bandit, my other favorite.</li>
            <li> It lacks the alcoholic smell that backs most fragrances, replacing it with smooth tones of sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I have an allergy to propellants in certain fragrance formulations and I do not get that with this</li>
            <li> To my senses the scent seems to fade very quickly after application, which I know is a major contention some have with this product, however I&#x27;ve been told that this isn&#x27;t actually the case by those around me - even after a full night of work or day of walking the scent is still perceptible, just not to the wearer it seems.  </li>
            <li> This is not exactly what I was hoping for but it is subtle and elegant and very nice.</li>
            <li> I use it for work and some of the ladies really get attracted to the smell.</li>
            <li> This scent is really great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is really one of the classics.</li>
            <li> Very pricey.  </li>
            <li> This is a very risky thing to buy without testing it beforehand.</li>
            <li> I really have to disagree with this being classified as a unisex fragrance.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this scent!</li>
            <li> this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH FOR THIS ..</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> but I kept the paper as my nose was filled with different perfumes I couldn&#x27;t make decision.</li>
            <li> The price is really unbeatable as well.</li>
            <li> like the puck design, it doesn&#x27;t take up much room and won&#x27;t fall over EVER, plus the rubber sides prevent shattering if you drop the bottle in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pi and Fahrenheit 32, Very Irresistible - Givenchy, CH for men Carolina Herrera</li>
            <li> I am female, and on my skin the primary aroma is vanilla.  </li>
            <li> Very sensual.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really see a woman wearing this.</li>
            <li> It has a rubber outer cover and it looks very luxurious.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really get that, but rather vanilla, tea (</li>
            <li> but it was much cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very \\&quot;current\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the most intriguing characteristic about Black is that it is daring - as a fragrance that provides many masculine notes yet daring enough to be worn by a woman, and vice-versa, many soft feminine notes that are daring for a man to wear.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend also loves it on me, it&#x27;s very different and unique.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rubber smell can be overpowering if you spray too much, silage is strong and not much needed of fragrance,in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true about this having a different scent.  </li>
            <li> It had an elegant, dark, smell to it.  </li>
            <li> As someone else stated, too much and you&#x27;ll smell like a new tire..</li>
            <li> Black tells a story; a coherent one in fact.  </li>
            <li> Those that penetrate &amp;#34;my space&amp;#34;, and I am &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; with that, Black garners many compliments, i.e. &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Given the uniqueness of all the notes at play, I would suggest that Black can be worn any time of year and for most events.  </li>
            <li> Always a classic.</li>
            <li> This was actually my niece asked me to order for her husband and despite the packaging - which is definitely &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; - she asked if I was sure this was for men.  </li>
            <li> Though the main weakness is the longevity, wearing all day will need to end up in close contact -which</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit peppery at first but that gives way to a sweet cedary scent.</li>
            <li> Always a classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Bvlgari Black for very nearly eight years and have received only good responses to it.  </li>
            <li> For any man or woman, I highly recommend adding to your collection.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Gives you a unique smell most guys don&#x27;t have (so tired of armani code which gets used as often as axe).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overbearing or invasive, but subtle and sexy and for me worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Bvlgari Black is quite strong, and if you wear too much, you&#x27;ll end up smelling like a tire.</li>
            <li> It is a very daring scent and should be treated as such, don&#x27;t kill your coworkers or an unsuspecting first date with this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little bit wild, contemporary, innovative, and I have to admire Annick Menardo</li>
            <li> The packaging was brand new</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it has much complexity, nor does it change much for the entire duration of a wearing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very baby-powdery and sweet.  Not as dark as the moniker.  </li>
            <li> But the only flaw is that the first 15 to 45 minutes smells like new rubber tires.</li>
            <li> and he says he can&#x27;t discern between his two bottles, and after my own fervent inspection I must say this bottle looks and smells legit from the first spray to final dry down.</li>
            <li> It doesnt matter who I walk past... they love it.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this fragrance after receiving a small bottle from my sister.</li>
            <li> I have to day that at first I simply did not get it.</li>
            <li> I first sprayed it on, I actually smelled fire, and burnt rubber.</li>
            <li> Bulgari black is a fairly one-dimensional cologne, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Those who glorify it as being a manly, black rubber-smelling, industrial city cologne</li>
            <li> The finish about an hour later is a deep cool floral, almost jasmine/anise scent which lingers the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, I was scared and completely turned off by its initial \\&quot;tire\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> Definitely need to be a certain someone / personality to pull this off</li>
            <li> no matter what bvlgari says, this is as uniquely masculine as it gets.  </li>
            <li> It takes on the personality of your natural skin fragrance and enhances it.</li>
            <li> Women love it,at least all the ones who smell it on me and my 30 yr.</li>
            <li> old nephew..</li>
            <li> Initially I didnt like it much.  </li>
            <li> Old one used to break after 1/3rd the bottle was gone.</li>
            <li> scent is quite masculine for a unisex product</li>
            <li> but I could definitely imagine a woman rocking it (and now that I think about it, would really entice me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having said that, it&#x27;s not that masculine.</li>
            <li> Out of the bottle, I get the vanilla and soft leather notes with under-notes of amber, floral, and musk.  </li>
            <li> It actually arrived earlier than expected, and I was able to try it out.</li>
            <li> Sweet, dark, and everything in between.  </li>
            <li> Upon first spray it&#x27;s very rubbery and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Been using this particular fragrance since its debut about ten or so years ago.</li>
            <li> One of the few true masculine fragrances out there today.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this first impression wears off giving way to a more flowery fragrance.</li>
            <li> I only wear this cologne and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is deep and dark and rich.  </li>
            <li> This one is very well done, and has layers of developing scents (on my skin it seemed to change more often than other complex fragrances did).</li>
            <li> I did not recieve it, I called amazon and at the same time they send me a new one.</li>
            <li> I actually use it as a base and add a bit of Rochas Man for the perfect combo.</li>
            <li> A bit strong so a little goes a long way but</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t see it as a fragrance worn during extreme hot temperatures.  </li>
            <li> Joop for men is to heavy and sweet for my taste, so is Black by Bvlgari,which is less sweet but very simmialr to Joop.</li>
            <li> second favorite, been using it for five years is London by Burberry, a truly truly masculine scent, which is another love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments about it, some even \\&quot;closer\\&quot; than expected ;).</li>
            <li> have wound up using this ~60% of the time I wear scents because it mixes nicely between work and casual hanging out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the projection is modest, very close to skin level, I do get about 6-8 hours longevity out of Black and even longer on my clothing.  </li>
            <li> It did smell a little rubbery at first, but it disappears, on me at least, after twenty minutes and turns into a more vanilla-like scent that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I expected, not old or anything like that.  </li>
            <li> Firstly I must add that this cologne, indeed, smells like a tyre and you should be very wary of how many sprays you apply to your body/clothing.</li>
            <li> Much longer lasting than other Bvlgari fragrances.</li>
            <li> Not sweet really, but a mix of smoke and vanilla.</li>
            <li> compared with other new \\&quot;trendy\\&quot; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use it for almost ten years and has always been a really pleasant experience, it is my base cologne.</li>
            <li> Last really long on my skin.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean though, so it took a little longer to get my product from the US to my island</li>
            <li> This is not very masculine, and it is unisex, there is no denying that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does have a slight rubber smell to it the first few min</li>
            <li> The unusual thing is the rubber smell, very urban, slightly sweetened by heavy bey heaviness which resemble Joop for men.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this fragrance on Amazon but found it for a cheap price at a store that shall remain nameless.  </li>
            <li> Now here is where the praise ends, its longevity is only average and projection moderate.  </li>
            <li> Intensity remains for long and wears off without any degradation.</li>
            <li> the type they use does have a slight latex \\&quot;rubber\\&quot; quality, but not what you&#x27;d smell in a garage, for good or bad), and iris.  </li>
            <li> similar to the later dry down on Angel Men.</li>
            <li> Others are saying you either love it or hate it, so far everyone has complimented me and asked about it, so</li>
            <li> And less serious and complex more for the day to day ones...</li>
            <li> It is not a particularly feminine scent.</li>
            <li> final tally for Black is 4.5 stars out of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely use this as my usual scent, but it&#x27;s definitely not for everyone.</li>
            <li> After a a few seconds it was obvious this wasn&#x27;t a female scent, but it was questionable at first.</li>
            <li> AAMerchants also delivered the product on time as expected.</li>
            <li> I really do not believe this to be a unisex fragrance</li>
            <li> I spent 31.55 for this .</li>
            <li> A total waste.</li>
            <li> I really do not have an opinion on this item because was a gift</li>
            <li> &quot; this is not really a \\&quot;black\\&quot; EDT; For that, you might want to try Lalique&#x27;s \\&quot;Encre</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it arrived as i expected to be arrive</li>
            <li> the sprayer breaks and I&#x27;m left with roughly a quarter to an eighth of the bottle wasted.  </li>
            <li> very masculine, complex and Dark.</li>
            <li> it will work for long time not as the previous one</li>
            <li> The dry down turns into vanilla.  </li>
            <li> Lasting with very little application.</li>
            <li> At first, I was somewhat skeptical about its risky scent.</li>
            <li> With my body chemistry, I never experience a tire smell that people have mentioned in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I bought this cologne with absolutely no idea what it smells like and kept my fingers crossed based of the previous reviews.    </li>
            <li> Never really like the idea of unisex fragrances but Black</li>
            <li> Noire\\&quot; (dark, earthy vetiver) or Van Cleef and Arpels&#x27; \\&quot;Pour</li>
            <li> that as others said you either love or hate.  </li>
            <li> They either love it or hate it.     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its a love it or hate it thing.</li>
            <li> Its ok, smells like vanilla at base</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Black may have started out as a naughty joke in the [Bvlgari] marketing department.</li>
            <li> Black is a jewel in this collection but it has its caveats.</li>
            <li> Also, Black is not something you can wear anytime.  </li>
            <li> Within about half an hour it becomes a spicier warmer scent.  </li>
            <li> smell and it lasts for about half a day.</li>
            <li> I smelled again and it was even mellow than previous.</li>
            <li> Bvlgari Black is the cornucopia of fragrances..</li>
            <li> Another beauty of Black is the price/value.  </li>
            <li> I have now seen Black offered at discount retail stores at affordable prices on-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this review helped you, I&#x27;d appreciate you taking a moment to click the little \\&quot;yes\\&quot; button at the bottom, to let me know if this review is helping you.</li>
            <li> --a little like rubber.</li>
            <li> Do get a little rubbery/leather note on the die-down.</li>
            <li> I guess I am afraid I wont like it as much as when I bought it years ago.  </li>
            <li> Might take a few spin cycles to get it</li>
            <li> I actually had to stop wearing this perfume to work as I was getting quite annoyed with people asking about my perfume and trying to either follow me or smell me.  </li>
            <li> U need a waste one like this ?</li>
            <li> Get too heavy handed with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already gotten quite a few compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a few comments from friends that smelled this on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was watered down or</li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last after half an hour !!!!</li>
            <li> I just received it and tried it; so far I am not sure if I like it, but so far I don&#x27;t hate it--except that it kinda smells like a \\&quot;tire\\&quot;, yes like a rubber tire.  </li>
            <li> They usually have it in the fall around October I noticed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I usually wear Gaultier2, but the price has increased quite a bit.</li>
            <li> He loves it to, and wears it everyday!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this counts as a cologne or a fragrant hockey puck-obviously Bulgari&#x27;s designers didn&#x27;t work to hard on this one.  </li>
            <li> This is one complex fragrance.</li>
            <li> You know what I mean.</li>
            <li> My friends and family have been complimenting me non-stop, asking where they can buy it, and even the customers at my workplace have mentioned its subtle woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with bulgari black.</li>
            <li> And if over-sprayed becomes an annoying, cloying tar mess.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous that I was buying a fake fragrance.</li>
            <li> When I put this BVLGARI on my neck, my wife goes crazy.</li>
            <li> Homme\\&quot; (Soapy, dirty floral).</li>
            <li> but all in all my experience wasn&#x27;t bad    </li>
            <li> Ladies, don&#x27;t be afraid to try this!  </li>
            <li> Smells awful.</li>

            <li> HMMM - great scent for both sexes</li>
            <li> SATISFIED  W/  PURCHASE  AND  PROMPT  DELIVERY....</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!  The packaging was very good and arrived timely.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I always get this for my boo and he loves it! Always a classic. If I don&#x27;t get it online I will cop it for him at Marshall&#x27;s for abut 30 to 40 bucks. They usually have it in the fall around October I noticed. I ordered one from here for 40 bucks and he says he can&#x27;t discern between his two bottles, and after my own fervent inspection I must say this bottle looks and smells legit from the first spray to final dry down.</li>
            <li> I love the smell to it. I use it for work and some of the ladies really get attracted to the smell. I keep getting asked who makes it. I&#x27;m happy it leaves a lasting impression of clean taken care guy</li>
            <li> Bvlgari Black is a super sexy leather like fragrance.  I ordered this for my husband for Christmas.  I occasionally sneak some for myself, as this scent is also striking on a woman.  ;)</li>
            <li> This scent is really great!&lt;br /&gt;I must admit, when I set out to bought it, I knew nothing about it. I bought it for two reasons and two reasons only: 1) I wanted a unisex fragrance and 2) I like that they use v&#x27;s instead of u&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I was happy to see that indeed, they use a v where there should be a u! It&#x27;s so cute, like they&#x27;re writing out ancient Latin or something.&lt;br /&gt;I was quite happy with the scent as well. It definitely wasn&#x27;t Axe Bodyspray manly, and it wasn&#x27;t Bath and Body Works fruity either. I&#x27;m no expert, and I don&#x27;t know all that fancy fragrance jargon, but it&#x27;s good, and really what it comes down to for me is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for an scent that is a bit more androgynous, then this is a pretty good one!</li>
            <li> Good product. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I read reviews prior to buying the product which I had not tried before.  It&#x27;s true about this having a different scent.  I just received it and tried it; so far I am not sure if I like it, but so far I don&#x27;t hate it--except that it kinda smells like a \\&quot;tire\\&quot;, yes like a rubber tire.  But as it dries the scent melows a bit and I&#x27;m hoping it will grow on me...or should I say it will smell nice on me!  The service from Amazon was truly amasing, I received it in a couple of days.......I call that EXCELLENT AAA+++</li>
            <li> Kudos to Bvlgari for rejecting the focus group/box set approach dominating current perfumery.  Black tells a story; a coherent one in fact.  Oil slicks and tires, delivered into a palatial vanilla sweetness, with a parting that leaves neither unscathed.  The romance of this relates, impressively, to this world, as opposed to fashion-mag tableaus.  Still, be advised: this fragrance has an acrid beginning which, even as it sweetens, never relinquishes its origin: consumption by fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The indomitable Luca Turin blogs on Black:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Black may have started out as a naughty joke in the [Bvlgari] marketing department. It could have stayed that way had it not fallen upon the ears of one of the greatest perfumers at work today, Annick M&amp;eacute;nardo of Firmenich. She took the rubbery idea, added a cloud of talcum powder and blended the two with a luscious fur-coat structure from the fifties, something like the original Je Reviens. The result is more akin to the black mink mitt James Bond uses to induce beautiful spies to talk in From Russia With Love: a torture instrument, only nobody gets hurt.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product amazed me without a doubt. I bought this cologne with absolutely no idea what it smells like and kept my fingers crossed based of the previous reviews.    Firstly I must add that this cologne, indeed, smells like a tyre and you should be very wary of how many sprays you apply to your body/clothing. I for one think the cut off point is 4 at maximum. As the day progresses on, it mellows out into a warm vanilla scent that&#x27;s not too strong, not to mild. Simply perfect.     At night this cologne definitely shines. I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments about it, some even \\&quot;closer\\&quot; than expected ;). My personal favourite being \\&quot;My my, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want my husband smelling this on me. Might take a few spin cycles to get it out\\&quot;.     Amazing product!    AAMerchants also delivered the product on time as expected. I live in the Caribbean though, so it took a little longer to get my product from the US to my island but all in all my experience wasn&#x27;t bad    I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this unisex cologne! Product was well packages &amp; exactly as described.</li>
            <li> excellent product recommend 100%</li>
            <li> A bit strong so a little goes a long way but a great smell for after work and going out on the town.  Too strong in my opinion for work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Bvlgari Black for very nearly eight years and have received only good responses to it.  The stuff smells phenomenal and I&#x27;d highly recommend trying it out.  To my senses the scent seems to fade very quickly after application, which I know is a major contention some have with this product, however I&#x27;ve been told that this isn&#x27;t actually the case by those around me - even after a full night of work or day of walking the scent is still perceptible, just not to the wearer it seems.  I&#x27;d advise to avoid the Tester bottles, the standard ones are a bit more pricey however for every Tester bottle I&#x27;ve had (two or three of them) the sprayer breaks and I&#x27;m left with roughly a quarter to an eighth of the bottle wasted.  Which is a shame...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heaven on spice and price, and powdery as well. Not sure if this counts as a cologne or a fragrant hockey puck-obviously Bulgari&#x27;s designers didn&#x27;t work to hard on this one.  Are they going to make a baseball cologne next?</li>
            <li> Very clean and classy scent. Manly, not too strong, or over bearing. Lasting with very little application.</li>
            <li> This is a very unique fragrance, right up there with Fahrenheit and A Men.  I own 60 bottles and growing.  Black is a jewel in this collection but it has its caveats. The opening is just like everyone describes burnt rubber tar notes.  I really do not believe this to be a unisex fragrance no matter what bvlgari says, this is as uniquely masculine as it gets.  My girlfriend loves the distinct tea based juice but agrees she could not wear this and be confident in her femininity.  The bottle itself is like every other bvlgari bottle I own, a piece of art.  The engraving and distinct tire look compliment the fragrance inside.  Now here is where the praise ends, its longevity is only average and projection moderate.  And if over-sprayed becomes an annoying, cloying tar mess. Be easy on the trigger and you have a one of a kind, upper class, suit and tie EDT.  Also, Black is not something you can wear anytime.  It is a very daring scent and should be treated as such, don&#x27;t kill your coworkers or an unsuspecting first date with this stuff.</li>
            <li> A delicious, unisex, slightly kinky fragrance. Not sweet really, but a mix of smoke and vanilla. I wish the bottle were prettier, but you can&#x27;t have it all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne. This is really one of the classics. This is my second purchase. The smell is very unique. You can instantly tell that it is a high-end manufacturer cologne.</li>
            <li> This is one of those deep scents that uncovers itself as the day goes on.  Upon first spray it&#x27;s very rubbery and heavy.  Within about half an hour it becomes a spicier warmer scent.  The finish about an hour later is a deep cool floral, almost jasmine/anise scent which lingers the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually i&#x27;m much more into citrus or green scents, but this has become a cool weather, night out on the town go to scent because of its complexity!</li>
            <li> I buy this cologne once a year. Product arrived quickly and is the original scent. Love it.</li>
            <li> A unisex perfume that gets better throughout the day. The longer you wear it the more fragrant it becomes. It takes on the personality of your natural skin fragrance and enhances it. Men find it strong, evident, and masculine; women are mesmerized by its fluidity and flowery scent. This is worth a try - for experience, if nothing else! Forewarning: this scent is not for everyone, be sure to sample it before you commit to a full-size bottle.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for someone who used to wear this scent. Would recommend this more as a men&#x27;s scent. It is a softer and quite pleasant that is quite memorable. It is also not manufactured any longer.</li>
            <li> My Favorite. Been using this particular fragrance since its debut about ten or so years ago. I heard a rumor that &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; was being discontinued, so I stocked up. Hope that is not the case. One of the few true masculine fragrances out there today.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume. I got a sample, tried it and totally fell in love. I ordered 2.5 bottle and wear it every day. people often ask me what kind of perfume I wear. this is my fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> I used to own this scent.  It was great when I first bought it.  I loved it.  It had an elegant, dark, smell to it.  I would by it again but my nose seems to like different scents as times change.  I guess I am afraid I wont like it as much as when I bought it years ago.  But it does leave a plesant memory of a great colonge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume ever since it came out!  It is one that as others said you either love or hate.  Whenever I wear this people always stop to ask what perfume it is and you always get compliments with it.  I actually had to stop wearing this perfume to work as I was getting quite annoyed with people asking about my perfume and trying to either follow me or smell me.  I think you should only use this perfume if you want attention from lots of people.    Wanted to add update:    Ok, well I have not used t his perfume too much lately as I like it more for night time or weekends.  But I have been \\&quot;testing\\&quot; it again this week and everywhere I&#x27;ve worn it to people ask what it is and stop to talk to you.....  So, this perfume still works quite well for meeting people, I have to add..</li>
            <li> I did not recieve it, I called amazon and at the same time they send me a new one.</li>
            <li> Last really long on my skin.</li>
            <li> Women love it,at least all the ones who smell it on me and my 30 yr. old nephew..As with all fragrances it will smell different on the individual..On my brother it smells too sweet so he won&#x27;t wear it..In my opinion it is worth checking it..</li>
            <li> Very interesting fragrance.  Initially I didnt like it much.  However, after experimenting with more fragrances,  you&#x27;ll notice this is a very unique scent.  Definitely need to be a certain someone / personality to pull this off</li>
            <li> I buy this for me, what great soft fragrance for daily use, works for man or woman and change depending on your PH.</li>
            <li> Contrary to what is written \\&quot;for men and women\\&quot; I am sure this not advisable for women. Not my perfume type, I just get hooked with the looks of the bottle and its packaging, but doesnt smell really nice. I dont know with men.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best smelling scent I&#x27;ve tried in a long time! It was a great purchase and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift. I asked around about soft smelling cologne&#x27;s before I purchased it and this kind was mentioned so I went for it. It helps that it is a unisex cologne. And another great thing is that it lasts all throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Luv it!&lt;br /&gt;Great price...&lt;br /&gt;I have priced in the department stores.  Very pricey.  I thought I should try and get my perfume at this discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;Happy I did.</li>
            <li> When I put this BVLGARI on my neck, my wife goes crazy. I know I will have the &amp;#34;Lucky Night&amp;#34;. You know what I mean. I love the Gentle aroma of this perfume. It&#x27;s very pleasant and modest. Intensity remains for long and wears off without any degradation. I believe you would you like it.</li>
            <li> Always the best - everyone always tells me how good I smell and want to know what I am wearing, I love that it is not sweet.</li>
            <li> This is the best scent on a man I have ever had the pleasure of smelling. It&#x27;s like crack for my nose and makes me want him all the more.</li>
            <li> I suppose that the description written by the other reviewer (\\&quot;like crack for your nose\\&quot;) is accurate, but not quite elegant as I would have put it.    I&#x27;d call it the smell of a metropolitan jungle ... Hong Kong, Moscow ... monolithic steel towers, steamy asphalt, sweaty markets full of spices and teas ... you get the idea.     It&#x27;s certainly unique, but be warned. This is a very risky thing to buy without testing it beforehand. I&#x27;ve never heard a person say they *just* liked it. They either love it or hate it.     Bvlgari Black is quite strong, and if you wear too much, you&#x27;ll end up smelling like a tire. But wear just the right amount, and it&#x27;s quite divine.    One more thing. I really have to disagree with this being classified as a unisex fragrance. While this would probably smell great on either a man or a woman, I think that it&#x27;s overwhelmingly a male fragrance. Just keep that in mind before you buy.    If this review helped you, I&#x27;d appreciate you taking a moment to click the little \\&quot;yes\\&quot; button at the bottom, to let me know if this review is helping you. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the item, im so happy with it and hope to get more item later. appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews and ratings it received. At first, I was somewhat skeptical about its risky scent. It did smell a little rubbery at first, but it disappears, on me at least, after twenty minutes and turns into a more vanilla-like scent that lasts all day long. I highly recommend this scent! And the bottle itself is gorgeous, too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  So glad I was able to find it here.  My husband and I both use it!.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> smells good!! thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Unlike another fragrance I purchased at the same time (Jaques Fath)... this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T  BUY  ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH FOR THIS .. THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THIS IS THE PACKAGE ,IT DID CAME IN A NICE PACKAGE .I  SPRAYED THIS THING IT HAD NO SCENT IT&#x27;S LIKE I PAID AMAZON FOR WATER</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I&#x27;m reminded of Batman by this scent. I think it&#x27;s the rubber... and maybe a hint of leather. I actually use it as a base and add a bit of Rochas Man for the perfect combo.</li>
            <li> Granted, every scent smells different in every person. That said, I love the smoky, woody heart of this scent. Up here in the Pacific Northwest, it&#x27;s perfect all day, every day.</li>
            <li> Pretty good value and I love the cinnamon smell that is integrated within the notes.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell and it lasts for about half a day.</li>
            <li> Taking a whiff! of this product while I walked through Macy&#x27;s fragrance department I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and see if I could find it and order it through Amazon great product</li>
            <li> No one here in Canada seams to sell this masterpiece. A very unique fragrance starting with a rubber note and then developing into  a tea note and becoming smokey. I also have Body Kouros as well another masterpiece by Annick Menardo.  I recommend both of these works of art.  Quite different compared to the modern day fresh scents that many men are wearing.  Stand apart from the crowd and show your artistic flare. Thank you once again Amazon for bringing another product to me and shipping it to Canada.</li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last after half an hour !!!! U need a waste one like this ? think !!!!! I spent 31.55 for this . A total waste.</li>
            <li> Love it. It is not a particularly feminine scent. I don&#x27;t want to smell like flowers or food. I like scents like leather, paper and wood. This is not exactly what I was hoping for but it is subtle and elegant and very nice.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This was actually my niece asked me to order for her husband and despite the packaging - which is definitely &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; - she asked if I was sure this was for men.  After a a few seconds it was obvious this wasn&#x27;t a female scent, but it was questionable at first.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was looking for one unique perfume and the sales person at a store gave me a lot of sample to test. This one indeed smell of a Tire or more likely a shoe wax or a garage, I din&#x27;t buy it that time but I kept the paper as my nose was filled with different perfumes I couldn&#x27;t make decision. Before driving home I smelled that paper with this one sprinkled over it and I was amazed that how this perfume notes changed .. once again as soon i reached home I smelled again and it was even mellow than previous. .. I decided to buy this one the next time i visit the store but over and over that sample paper made me buy this immediately online..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe my skin gets a little more sweaty and is warm and the perfume smells very smooth on it. the longevity is good as it can hold fairly 6-7 hours. I get many compliments from women and a lot of my colleagues have asked me what cologne do I wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undoubtedly I am going to buy this after i finish this.</li>
            <li> Clean scent.  Receive compliments every time I wear it.  Great for men or women - is now my signature fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. SOOOO glad that they finally changed the sprayer. Old one used to break after 1/3rd the bottle was gone. Good buy!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived super fast! and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I did not buy this from Amazon, I actually received it as a gift. It&#x27;s one of my favorite colognes currently. Some reviewers say it smells like a tire......I&#x27;m not sure what kind of cars they drive but it sure smells nothing like any tire I&#x27;ve come across. Others are saying you either love it or hate it, so far everyone has complimented me and asked about it, so I don&#x27;t think its a love it or hate it thing. Its definitely great for a night on the town.</li>
            <li> Its ok, smells like vanilla at base</li>
            <li> My prefered fragance!</li>
            <li> Love the perfume, always have, and the shipping was fast. I&#x27;ve never shipped a full bottle of perfume and I was worried about the glass breaking but that wasn&#x27;t at all a problem with the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne. It lacks the alcoholic smell that backs most fragrances, replacing it with smooth tones of sandalwood. The price is really unbeatable as well.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: male reviewer and wearer for 8 months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is quite masculine for a unisex product but I could definitely imagine a woman rocking it (and now that I think about it, would really entice me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells slightly sweet but mainly musky dominated by a burnt rubber like smell that can be quite nice if you use only 1 or 2 spritzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the puck design, it doesn&#x27;t take up much room and won&#x27;t fall over EVER, plus the rubber sides prevent shattering if you drop the bottle in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wound up using this ~60% of the time I wear scents because it mixes nicely between work and casual hanging out. Gives you a unique smell most guys don&#x27;t have (so tired of armani code which gets used as often as axe).</li>
            <li> This is THE scent for those looking for a mellow, different, urban, luxurious and not \\&quot;mainstream\\&quot; at all. I&#x27;ve use it for almost ten years and has always been a really pleasant experience, it is my base cologne. Though the main weakness is the longevity, wearing all day will need to end up in close contact -which is a good thing- to be noticed. The notes get warmer and more vanilla-esque at the end.. very very nice. Girls simply love it, I&#x27;ve never got a bad/negative comment about. I think it is more of a masculine fragance, but it can work for women too. Definitively it is smokey, leathery and rubbery at the very beginning which I really really like to be honest, then becomes to warm vanilla. It is NOT by any means a crisp or fresh scent. I use it by any occasion, but I enjoy the most while wearing it at night, it is great too for special occasions. RARELY anyone but you will be using it... compared with other new \\&quot;trendy\\&quot; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second favorite, been using it for five years is London by Burberry, a truly truly masculine scent, which is another love it or hate it. Very woody, warm spiced scent, should give a try to it if you enjoy using Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another ones (newer ones) you may try if you like this: Spicebomb (Viktor &amp; Rolf), La nuit de l&#x27;homme YSL. And less serious and complex more for the day to day ones... Pi and Fahrenheit 32, Very Irresistible - Givenchy, CH for men Carolina Herrera</li>
            <li> I adore this scent.  I am female, and on my skin the primary aroma is vanilla.  It is deep and dark and rich.  Very sensual.  My boyfriend likes the scent on me.  With my body chemistry, I never experience a tire smell that people have mentioned in other reviews.  Ladies, don&#x27;t be afraid to try this!  It is simply wonderful.</li>
            <li> This one form Bvlgari smells like fragrance from niche perfumers.Bvlgari has fragrances which are very mainstream, well balanced and polished, very pleasant but nothing very special about them either.This one is very well done, and has layers of developing scents (on my skin it seemed to change more often than other complex fragrances did). The unusual thing is the rubber smell, very urban, slightly sweetened by heavy bey heaviness which resemble Joop for men. Joop for men is to heavy and sweet for my taste, so is Black by Bvlgari,which is less sweet but very simmialr to Joop. but for sure the fragrance is very innovative.I can&#x27;t pull it myself, but I am sure others can wear it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little bit wild, contemporary, innovative, and I have to admire Annick Menardo the creator of this fragrance for her spirit of innovation. In perfumery the combination of two resins makes the rubber smell, but perfumers stayed away from this. Well, it seems it was great choice that Menardo decided to push the envelope, and even though this will never be the fragrance I will wear often (too strong for me) I really appreciate it as creation on its own right. And the bottle design is fine too, based on inkwell. Or on standing vertically wheel of an automobile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rubber smell can be overpowering if you spray too much, silage is strong and not much needed of fragrance,in my opinion.Much longer lasting than other Bvlgari fragrances.</li>
            <li> This cologne may be unisex but I don&#x27;t really see a woman wearing this. It&#x27;s more masculine than feminine. Having said that, it&#x27;s not that masculine. It smells strongly of vanilla and the tire section of Sears. That&#x27;s actually a good combination. It lasts 6-8 hours. The bottle is pretty cool too. It has a rubber outer cover and it looks very luxurious.</li>
            <li> I dont think I have ever smelled a better cologne in my life. It doesnt matter who I walk past... they love it.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Gaultier2, but the price has increased quite a bit. My wife seems to like this better so I&#x27;m with it.</li>
            <li> They say good things come in small packages, this 2.5 ouncer packs a wallop. A couple of sprays is all it takes with this baby and you&#x27;re good to go. Get too heavy handed with it and it might be too over bearing to some. Bvlgari did themselves proud when they made this one! had this a long time ago and forgot how great this smelled, glad to have re-visited it! Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> It is so good to have this perfume again.  It arrived well packaged and in a timely fashion - many thanks!</li>
            <li> Never really like the idea of unisex fragrances but Black create a beautiful unique scent of light vanilla.  But the only flaw is that the first 15 to 45 minutes smells like new rubber tires. Not really disgusting as it may seem. When right this fragrance is in my top 10. Low projection and has about a 5 hour duration (4 exclude the 1/2 hour rubber phrase)</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this fragrance after receiving a small bottle from my sister. A very special and distinctive fragrance. Ordered from OxKom and received the product as advertised. Good experience, a special an distinctive product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later edit: I checked the product code on the many \\&quot;perfume check\\&quot; sites and it seems to be manufactured February &#x27;14.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife as requested by her.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume since it came out and still find it to be unique. To me, it smells edible. I always get compliments when I wear it. This and Dolce &amp; Gabana The One are my favorites.</li>
            <li> I really do not have an opinion on this item because was a gift and i really didn&#x27;t enjoy it!</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing! I&#x27;ve used it for awhile. I use this cologne daily and always receive multiples compliments on it. The packaging was brand new and it was a great price.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and grabs the attention of those surrounding me without being overpowering. I really enjoy it. My friends and family have been complimenting me non-stop, asking where they can buy it, and even the customers at my workplace have mentioned its subtle woodsy smell. It&#x27;s a bit peppery at first but that gives way to a sweet cedary scent. It grabs your attention and keeps it as it guides you through the Forrest of your mind. (Just writing enough so amazon will stop bugging me about writing too-short a review.) all in all it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> great product &amp; most fabulous price. my wonderful husband will love his christnas present! t</li>
            <li> Very nice smell. As someone else stated, too much and you&#x27;ll smell like a new tire.. Go lightly and it is very good , already many compliments on colongne ..!!!</li>
            <li> Bulgari black is a fairly one-dimensional cologne, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Those who glorify it as being a manly, black rubber-smelling, industrial city cologne are pushing it quite a bit.  You don&#x27;t really get that, but rather vanilla, tea (the type they use does have a slight latex \\&quot;rubber\\&quot; quality, but not what you&#x27;d smell in a garage, for good or bad), and iris.  This is not very masculine, and it is unisex, there is no denying that.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it has much complexity, nor does it change much for the entire duration of a wearing.&lt;br /&gt;I guess that women will like this on a man, however--in fact, they could probably wear it.  It is fairly non-offensive.  I think you could wear it anytime, even in the office--it won&#x27;t knock anyone out, but it won&#x27;t make you feel like you are driving a car and burning rubber.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to try this before buying if possible.  After reading the many glorious reviews on this and the whole \\&quot;It smells like rubber!\\&quot; thing, I tried it and said, \\&quot;This is it, vanilla and tea?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Who might like this: Vanilla and tea lovers with a metrosexual \\&quot;air\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Who might dislike this: Manly men who want a scent that exudes power and gravitas.&lt;br /&gt;Despite being called \\&quot;black\\&quot; this is not really a \\&quot;black\\&quot; EDT; For that, you might want to try Lalique&#x27;s \\&quot;Encre Noire\\&quot; (dark, earthy vetiver) or Van Cleef and Arpels&#x27; \\&quot;Pour Homme\\&quot; (Soapy, dirty floral).</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described. Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li> Yes I liked it. It was a gift for my daughter.  She likes this perfume and saw if for sale elsewhere but it was much cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this fragrance on Amazon but found it for a cheap price at a store that shall remain nameless.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Bvlgari perfumes and colognes.  To me it smells like rubber tires and powder.  Not an offensive smell, just unique.  The dry down turns into vanilla.  Not a vile, sickeningly sweet vanilla either.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear this during the day, maybe at night in the fall/winter months.  It&#x27;s an interesting, slightly intriguing scent.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for this, but if you want to give it a shot try and find it at a discount department store.</li>
            <li> Though Unisex, feel it works better for women. I like the scent however too strong to be worn to work. Wife uses it now.</li>
            <li> Always a classic fragrance. Appears to be authentic.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product. The perfume has a great smell and the shape of the bottle is amazing. Good price too.</li>
            <li> This is one complex fragrance. Not for everyone. Only for those who appreciate the complexity of a masterpiece.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this on me. It is leather, cigar, woody. Very \\&quot;current\\&quot; smell. I only wear this cologne and I highly recommend it. It smells better the longer it is on your skin!</li>
            <li> i was really turned off when i smelled the burnt rubber like opening; but after 45 minutes, the dry down is lovely and exquisite....similar to the later dry down on Angel Men.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already gotten quite a few compliments on it. It does have a slight rubber smell to it the first few min but, it mellows out into a really nice scent.</li>
            <li> Bvlgari Black is the cornucopia of fragrances.. Sweet, dark, and everything in between.  Out of the bottle, I get the vanilla and soft leather notes with under-notes of amber, floral, and musk.  Shortly after the initial application, the vanilla and leather settles into a fragrance that is beautiful.  Well done, Bvlgari...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the projection is modest, very close to skin level, I do get about 6-8 hours longevity out of Black and even longer on my clothing.  Those that penetrate &amp;#34;my space&amp;#34;, and I am &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; with that, Black garners many compliments, i.e. &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34;.  Given the uniqueness of all the notes at play, I would suggest that Black can be worn any time of year and for most events.  However, I don&#x27;t see it as a fragrance worn during extreme hot temperatures.  As it is a fragrance that sticks close to skin level, Black offers great flexibility as an office safe fragrance.  Perhaps the most intriguing characteristic about Black is that it is daring - as a fragrance that provides many masculine notes yet daring enough to be worn by a woman, and vice-versa, many soft feminine notes that are daring for a man to wear.  (if any of that makes any sense!! LOL - for you that have the fragrance or have tried it, you know what I am talking about..).  Truly beautiful,unique and totally unisex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle design is awesome.  Yes, as many have commented, it resembles a hockey puck.  True..!!  Yet the design is so unique, it will be a conversation piece in your collection.  Another beauty of Black is the price/value.  I have now seen Black offered at discount retail stores at affordable prices on-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Black is 4.5 stars out of 5 stars.  For any man or woman, I highly recommend adding to your collection.  Be different - be daring..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and make it count.  Invest your time rather than wasting your time...</li>
            <li> It didnt smell like the original one I had for some reason....and the scent doesn&#x27;t last on the skin, like the original one does.</li>
            <li> The smell seems like cologne for children but it is durable and sweet</li>
            <li> Great price and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this cologne for a while now. DOES NOT SMELL LIKE IT!!BUYERS BEWARE!! Not sure if it was watered down or what but it smells nothing like that cologne.Called amazon customer service and they were helpful to return my money. I will not buy it from here ever again.</li>
            <li> I came across this cologne several years ago by chance. The women loved it and so did I. Indeed if you read about it is a scent made to be used by both men and women.</li>
            <li> this is the exact item i looked for&lt;br /&gt;it arrived as i expected to be arrive&lt;br /&gt;hope it will work for long time not as the previous one</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous that I was buying a fake fragrance. After I compared it to the one I bought from a store, I felt it passed the test.</li>
            <li> I finally got the rubber smell cologne...and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I have to day that at first I simply did not get it. This was a \\&quot;blind\\&quot; purchase based on the reviews and desire to try something different and not \\&quot;obvious\\&quot;, corresponding with my aethetics and tastes. At first, I was scared and completely turned off by its initial \\&quot;tire\\&quot; smell. Eventually,this first kick became the most attractive feature of this classic. Unfortunately, this first impression wears off giving way to a more flowery fragrance. I do love it, regardless, for its originality and complexity. I do believe that it is better suited for women that not just show up but make memorable and lasting impressions (just like the perfume itself). My hysband tried it. The first phase (\\&quot;tire\\&quot;) of the impression was grest on him; the \\&quot;girly\\&quot; conclusion was too feminine for him. I do love it and alternate it with Bandit, my other favorite. Recently, I have ordered Cabochard (another \\&quot;blind\\&quot; by) - I hope I like it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance...</li>
            <li> We liked it very much and the price too</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells on him. He loves it to, and wears it everyday! a great scent for guy, came fast and brand new in packaging. will def buy from buyer again.</li>
            <li> Classic, sexy and not overpowerful.  I wore this years ago and I am not disappointed.  Same quality as years ago!</li>
            <li> e x c e l l e n t !!!&lt;br /&gt;On time, perfect package&lt;br /&gt;e x c e l l e n t !!!</li>
            <li> Cost much more retail. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I first got this one since I couldn&#x27;t find any in stores. Upon reading the reviews, I ordered it and waited for it to arrive. It actually arrived earlier than expected, and I was able to try it out. I love the scent on me. My boyfriend also loves it on me, it&#x27;s very different and unique. I&#x27;ve got a few comments from friends that smelled this on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first sprayed it on, I actually smelled fire, and burnt rubber. it was a very interesting combination of scents, and over time, it changed into a very woodsy scent, with a hint of vanilla (like others said). It also lasts all day, which is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely use this as my usual scent, but it&#x27;s definitely not for everyone.</li>
            <li> This is one of my absolute favorite fragrances on my better half. It&#x27;s not overbearing or invasive, but subtle and sexy and for me worth every penny. I have an allergy to propellants in certain fragrance formulations and I do not get that with this</li>
            <li> Long time favorite of mine.  Product is exactly what I expected, not old or anything like that.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!  I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> Best of the Best.  I love this stuff... very masculine, complex and Dark.</li>
            <li> Yuck. Smells awful. --a little like rubber.</li>
            <li> Definitely an evening/fall/winter scent.  Very baby-powdery and sweet.  Not as dark as the moniker.  Do get a little rubbery/leather note on the die-down.</li>
            <li> Great product, price is amazing and delivered on time as promised.</li>
            <li> Great service. Great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have words to discribe.. perfect. I love all bulgari fragances. You will not be disappointed with bulgari black.</li>
            <li> The scent is vey good and I would say more toward a masculine smell; however, the scent fades away much too quickly.  I would estimate it lasted 2-3 hrs or so.  I&#x27;d give the scent 4 stars but the fact that it&#x27;s gone so quickly is why I rated it 3 stars.</li>
