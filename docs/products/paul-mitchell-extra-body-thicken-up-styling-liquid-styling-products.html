            <li>The root lifter gives your hair some texture for very fine, thing hair.  </li>
            <li>I usually love Paul Mitchell products but this one did not do the job.</li>
            <li>It works better than any in-shower conditioner I&#x27;ve ever seem.</li>
            <li>I have fussed with my hair for 58 years and finally found the perfect product!!</li>
            <li>I have used this product  for many years-</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when the magic happens.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for making it look fuller than it really is.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product I have used for several years.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years to help my fine hair have more body..  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the investment and makes my hair look better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this   product to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>Helps volumize and hold style in my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length fine hair</li>
            <li>Helps to lift fine hair to make it appear fuller.  </li>
            <li>My hair is short and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>There are not many places that sell the PM Thicken Up serum anymore, but this product works so great on my hair!</li>
            <li>6.8-Ounces Bottle arrived quickly, but it is not as good a product as the Generic &amp;#34;look-alike&amp;#34; I can no longer find</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good overall thickener</li>
            <li>I look like I have thick beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li>This gel takes very fine hair and gives it extra fullness.</li>
            <li>I used a similar Paul Mitchell product called &amp;#34;Quick Slip&amp;#34; and my hair responded to that product much better.</li>
            <li>first at the recommendation of my hair salon stylist.</li>
            <li>I really like PM Extra Body Thicken Up as a quick and easy way to give some style to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Decided to try it in NYC, where it can get humid pretty fast.</li>
            <li>This product really helped me.</li>
            <li>It makes getting ready in the morning a snap.</li>
            <li>The real trick was to use it with the Paul Mitchell root lifter.  </li>
            <li>Very sticky &amp; made my hair very greasy.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really thicken that well.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll choose healthy hair with somewhat less volume.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but maybe a little better with some humidity in the air.</li>
            <li>It makes my normally stick straight fine hair look like its not glued down to my head, but appears far thicker and healthier without looking like I&#x27;ve goosed on some &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line?</li>
            <li>My hair with the product look and feel exactly the same like with no product.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tends to be limp when conditioned.</li>
            <li>Curls remained soft and humidity had no impact.</li>
            <li>I opened up the other bottle and it didn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li>I wear it every day and finally got rid of that limp, lifeless look and feel of baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>and this allows me to give it some body and thickness like no other product does.  </li>
            <li>I have big natural curls.</li>
            <li>so it does not weigh it down too much, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin and easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t meld itself with the oil glands at the  roots of the hair follicles.</li>

            <li> Have used this (along with mousse) for several days now in dry climate over Thanksgiving and now back in rainy NW.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product for years, would not blow dry my hair without it.</li>
            <li> I use about 5 pumps, rub my hands together and run through almost dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry my roots on low heat, then finish with a round brush/dryer.  </li>
            <li> This product does not really thicken my hair but it rather smooths it out and ads shine.</li>
            <li> but since it doesn&#x27;t dry hair out like a lot of other products you won&#x27;t see the results other drying products might give you.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake like lots of other products do.</li>
            <li> This is the only Paul Mitchell product that I have used that I am not pleased with.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit in the hair while wet before styling</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine hair but quite a lot of it which means that unless I use some serious product after shampooing, my hair goes flat within seconds.</li>
            <li> One or two little squirts did it.</li>
            <li> Well packaged and even a little cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh my hair down!</li>
            <li> This product gives my ultra-fine hair the body it needs without being heavy.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure , but it seems like something else was in the bottle, not what i ordered.</li>
            <li> I still can use it when a slick looks is desired.</li>
            <li> This takes my thin limp hair and gives it body.  </li>
            <li> but ... thin. &#x27;</li>
            <li> I am on medication that makes my hair thin.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This product gives my ultra-fine hair the body it needs without being heavy.  It&#x27;s thin and easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t meld itself with the oil glands at the  roots of the hair follicles. Now I can hold a curl for hours. I&#x27;d recommend this   product to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I am 68 with thinning white hair.  This product really helped me. It makes my normally stick straight fine hair look like its not glued down to my head, but appears far thicker and healthier without looking like I&#x27;ve goosed on some &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line? It&#x27;s well worth the investment and makes my hair look better!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Helps volumize and hold style in my fine hair. Just a little bit in the hair while wet before styling and it works great! Does not weigh my hair down!</li>
            <li> A friend at work recommended this product to me. One or two little squirts did it. Didn&#x27;t feel like I had product in my hair like some I&#x27;ve tried. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This takes my thin limp hair and gives it body.  I look like I have thick beautiful hair.  It was a great find.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length fine hair and I didn&#x27;t see any thickening. My hair with the product look and feel exactly the same like with no product. Used as directed.</li>
            <li> This product was a great deal compared to salon prices. I have used it for a couple of years and am so happy with my purchase. It makes getting ready in the morning a snap.</li>
            <li> I usually love Paul Mitchell products but this one did not do the job. I used a similar Paul Mitchell product called &amp;#34;Quick Slip&amp;#34; and my hair responded to that product much better. My advice, find something else.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  I have very fine hair ... lots of hair ..but ... thin. &#x27;thicken up&#x27; works!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this allows me to give it some body and thickness like no other product does.  I wear it every day and finally got rid of that limp, lifeless look and feel of baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years, would not blow dry my hair without it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that tends to be limp when conditioned. This product adds body and texture to my hair and helps the curl and style last longer. Recommend!</li>
            <li> This gel takes very fine hair and gives it extra fullness. It works better than any in-shower conditioner I&#x27;ve ever seem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years to help my fine hair have more body..  Couldn&#x27;t find it locally so went through the internet.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Extra Body Thicken Up, 6.8-Ounces Bottle arrived quickly, but it is not as good a product as the Generic &amp;#34;look-alike&amp;#34; I can no longer find</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin, straight hair.  This is absolutely the best product I have found.  I use about 5 pumps, rub my hands together and run through almost dry hair.  I blow dry my roots on low heat, then finish with a round brush/dryer.  My hair is short and it looks great.  I have fussed with my hair for 58 years and finally found the perfect product!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product  for many years- first at the recommendation of my hair salon stylist. They used to sell this product but quit selling it so I found it online at a good price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t appreciate this product until going to others and then back to it again.  The real trick was to use it with the Paul Mitchell root lifter.  That&#x27;s when the magic happens.  The root lifter gives your hair some texture for very fine, thing hair.  This is a pretty good overall thickener but since it doesn&#x27;t dry hair out like a lot of other products you won&#x27;t see the results other drying products might give you.  I think I&#x27;ll choose healthy hair with somewhat less volume.</li>
            <li> I am on medication that makes my hair thin.  This product is great for making it look fuller than it really is.  It doesn&#x27;t flake like lots of other products do.</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine hair but quite a lot of it which means that unless I use some serious product after shampooing, my hair goes flat within seconds. Have used this (along with mousse) for several days now in dry climate over Thanksgiving and now back in rainy NW.  Seems to hold up well to almost anything but maybe a little better with some humidity in the air. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> There are not many places that sell the PM Thicken Up serum anymore, but this product works so great on my hair! And people always complement on the smell. Love this product and love that Amazon cares it!</li>
            <li> I thought I would order this online because it is cheaper than in the local stores, but upon arrival one of the bottles leaked all over the inside of the box. I opened up the other bottle and it didn&#x27;t smell right. Im not sure , but it seems like something else was in the bottle, not what i ordered. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very sticky &amp; made my hair very greasy.  This is the only Paul Mitchell product that I have used that I am not pleased with.</li>
            <li> This product does not really thicken my hair but it rather smooths it out and ads shine. My hair is medium thickness so it does not weigh it down too much, so I still can use it when a slick looks is desired.</li>
            <li> Helps to lift fine hair to make it appear fuller.  Excellent product I have used for several years.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for awhile and it&#x27;s OK but it doesn&#x27;t really thicken that well.  It does put a lot of shine in my hair which is nice.</li>
            <li> I really like PM Extra Body Thicken Up as a quick and easy way to give some style to my hair.  It is a great product, but a bit pricey.  Well packaged and even a little cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have big natural curls. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products that range from curly spray to curl gel to curl cream and everything in between. Came across this while at my parent&#x27;s house in the CA desert. Friends complimented me on how amazing my hair looked. Decided to try it in NYC, where it can get humid pretty fast. Curls remained soft and humidity had no impact. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
