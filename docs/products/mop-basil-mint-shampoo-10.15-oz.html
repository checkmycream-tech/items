            <li>This was a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>Very effective as a shampoo.</li>
            <li>But for this price, I&#x27;d like a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>This does not smell good.  </li>
            <li>This is good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Almost as good as Aveda, and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>Nice and tingly.</li>
            <li>I wish more shampoos smelled so good.</li>
            <li>The scent was nice.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but not too nice for the gentlemen to use.</li>
            <li>love the scent, doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I find this works much better for me.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for some years now and still love it.</li>
            <li>Authentic Product.</li>
            <li>i love this so much, it smells amazing</li>
            <li>Awesome hair feel after shampooing, not oily or dry, just right.</li>
            <li>But honestly unless this next week of shampooing makes my hair amazing, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li>It gives your hair a true clean feel without a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>It does clean hair well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all I use gives hair a clean smell.</li>
            <li>You feel light and clean after using this shampoo and its very much a salon experience!</li>
            <li>This smells absolutely divine and even better, both of us &amp;#34;grease-balls&amp;#34; can make it 24 hours without needing another shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love Modern Organic Products shampoo.</li>
            <li>The basil in it is a &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; scent, but not a bad one.</li>
            <li>Great organic shampoo for who has oily hair, it keeps it clean for 2 days, but I wish it keeps clean a little longer.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a better quality shampoo and mainly one that was also eco-friendly.</li>
            <li>Fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>After reading countless reviews and doing my own research, i chose this one from MOP.  </li>
            <li>Is a little drying to my hair, so I dont think will buy again for this reason - may be better if you have naturally more greasy hair.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this about five years ago when I had a pixie cut.</li>
            <li>exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It is crisp smelling and doesn&#x27;t have un-natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have been using Mop for long time I like how it leaves your hair soft and smelling good for hours and hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells very medicinal, not minty at all.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, the mint is pretty subtle.  </li>
            <li>It works well, and only requires a small amount, making it a good deal despite the relatively high cost per ounce.  </li>
            <li>It has some natural ingredients, but I don&#x27;t know if the people here reviewing it read the ingredients, but it contains \\&quot;Sodium Laureth Sulfate\\&quot; and this, my friends, is NOT organic or natural!  </li>
            <li>Completely manageable, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and it is hard to find locally.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I moved and the water here is slightly softer than where I lived. Revisited this shampoo and it works wonderfully. The basil in it is a &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; scent, but not a bad one. Just different. Nice and tingly. Fresh feeling. Will buy again eventually. Cleans hair of previous nasty oily, buildup shampoo residue.</li>
            <li> i love this so much, it smells amazing and I want to try the lemon grass one next. I wish more shampoos smelled so good.</li>
            <li> This smells absolutely divine and even better, both of us &amp;#34;grease-balls&amp;#34; can make it 24 hours without needing another shampoo.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!!!! *IN ALL SHOUTY CAPITAL LETTERS*&lt;br /&gt;WILL BE BUYING AGAIN SOON!</li>
            <li> This does not smell good.  It&#x27;s smells very medicinal, not minty at all.  It does clean hair well.  But for this price, I&#x27;d like a pleasant scent.</li>

            <li> I first purchased this about five years ago when I had a pixie cut. My hair is by my shoulder blades now. And it is the best shampoo ever. Not only am I using the conditioner and leave-in conditioner as well as the shine drops but my hair is looking healthier than ever. Completely manageable, soft and shiny. I will never go back. Worth the price. And smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for over 10 years. Great product that doesnt leave build up, cleans well and rinses well.</li>
            <li> When you want a wake-up shampoo that does a wonderful job and can also be used as a body wash this is it!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, the mint is pretty subtle.  Is a little drying to my hair, so I dont think will buy again for this reason - may be better if you have naturally more greasy hair.</li>
            <li> Love Modern Organic Products shampoo. It seems to be getting harder and harder to find. I buy several when I see it. MOP Rocks!</li>
            <li> great every day shampoo.  love the scent, doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.  use with MOP Pear Detangler and don&#x27;t even need conditioning.</li>
            <li> Great organic shampoo for who has oily hair, it keeps it clean for 2 days, but I wish it keeps clean a little longer.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It&#x27;s all I use gives hair a clean smell.</li>
            <li> We have used another Mop shampoo....I find this works much better for me.  I have oilier hair than others in the household.</li>
            <li> It has some natural ingredients, but I don&#x27;t know if the people here reviewing it read the ingredients, but it contains \\&quot;Sodium Laureth Sulfate\\&quot; and this, my friends, is NOT organic or natural!  Sodium Laureth Sulfate: [...]</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised. excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair with an oily scalp. My hair literally will not go from an evening shower to the next morning without looking oily. It is in our genes. Anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I &amp;#34;splurged&amp;#34; and purchased this with hopes of it helping even a bit. The scent was nice. It smelled like tea tree oil a bit but it faded quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a week, it has done nothing. My hair is just as oily as ever. I&#x27;m about half way through the bottle. So basically it will last me two weeks. Again, I have a lot of hair. But honestly unless this next week of shampooing makes my hair amazing, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This was a great shampoo. It is crisp smelling and doesn&#x27;t have un-natural ingredients. It is a no-nocense product that I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mop for long time I like how it leaves your hair soft and smelling good for hours and hours.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for some years now and still love it. Awesome hair feel after shampooing, not oily or dry, just right.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a better quality shampoo and mainly one that was also eco-friendly. After reading countless reviews and doing my own research, i chose this one from MOP.  You feel light and clean after using this shampoo and its very much a salon experience! I would recommend this brand and this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and it is hard to find locally. It is the best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Very effective as a shampoo. Smells nice, but not too nice for the gentlemen to use.</li>
            <li> Authentic Product. Thank you.</li>
