            <li>Love all the colors.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping and good product</li>
            <li>Which I liked also and very inexpensive :)</li>
            <li>Now i just need to find a dispenser to use them easily.  </li>
            <li>i came up with so many cool designs also.</li>
            <li>it was accurate size.</li>
            <li>I enjoy my item.</li>
            <li>Received a GREAT SELECTION of colors, This was a terrific buy and a MUST HAVE for nail art</li>
            <li>Loved all the different colors and was packaged well</li>
            <li>Loved the item only thing</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, love the colors.</li>
            <li>Great buy for all the other nail art lovers out there.</li>
            <li>Even with a clear coat over the top they do not stick to the nail.</li>
            <li>awhile to get here, but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>These are fun art for your nails.  </li>
            <li>and I found they stay on LONGER if you put a clear top coat on after you&#x27;ve applied them.  </li>
            <li>Other than this (which isn&#x27;t a big deal) it was in perfect condition and worth it.</li>
            <li>but there is so many that I will enjoy these for a long time,</li>
            <li>There are so many different designs to choose from, so I know she&#x27;ll have fun with these.</li>
            <li>The colors most needed wasn&#x27;t enough of.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Most of them weren&#x27;t solid either.</li>
            <li>They are very inexpensive and well worth it.</li>
            <li>They are pretty.</li>
            <li>but anyway I really liked this striping tape for nail art if your new to nail art these are not as big as they look on the pics</li>
            <li>Very polite and accommodating.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky when you get it out of the baggies.</li>
            <li>I got these on time and tried it on the very day</li>
            <li>Came early!!!</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my wife and she is so excited to start using them next time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to make cool designs apply Polish and Peel but to actually use it as a design itself sucks it won&#x27;t stick on the nail long enough to enjoy the corners always lift up</li>
            <li>They came quickly and each roll came individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>I use a clear thickening polish as a second-to-top coat over them to smooth the line out so that it is completely flat to the polish</li>
            <li>I apply a light clear coat of polish under the ends and press down for a second or two to really secure them to the nail</li>
            <li>The colors simply pop when used with the right corresponding color.  </li>
            <li>They have limited side-to-side bend, so use them on a dry or semi-dry topcoat if your trying to curve them at all to get your angle correct (I use them as a border on french manicures and they give it a nice slick-looking finish).&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are really unlimited possibilities of what you can do with these, and they&#x27;ve become an essential part of my manicure kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>NOTE: to dispense the striping tape I use an old plastic tape dispenser.  </li>
            <li>and I am just  to old to use</li>
            <li>i like the colors and the different variations of designs , even thou you have to look really close to see it...</li>
            <li>They really only work is you put the design on when your nails are still tacky and you have to be super careful about not messing they up.</li>
            <li>but it was exactly what I hoped for and expected</li>
            <li>The tape doesn&#x27;t tend to stay put long enough to keep on nails but could always try if you really wanted to by putting clear coat on nail and then applying for</li>
            <li>Took a little while to get here but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>and the reviews other buyers wrote really helped.</li>

            <li> Super weak.</li>
            <li> it with no apparent</li>
            <li> it will surely last me for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Thinner than I expected, however when I looked back at the picture</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no white, no silver, 1 roll of blacK and 5 rolls of red.</li>
            <li> There is little piece of a different color tape on the actual tape you will be using, so you can tell where to pull to find the start.</li>
            <li> paint another color, dry</li>
            <li> the only disappointment is i did not get the colorful collection shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> As I expected</li>
            <li> But other then that I guess it will have to do.</li>
            <li> do not need any other tool to fix it onto the nail.</li>
            <li> So no worth it.</li>
            <li> Only issue was they are so narrow it is hard to find the beginning of the tape and get it started.  </li>
            <li> A few were messed up.</li>
            <li> Waste of $5.</li>
            <li> a little slow in delivery, but when received she was well satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li> I thought with an assortment of 30 colors I&#x27;d get at least a few of the colors I wanted.</li>
            <li> The downside to it is you dont know which direction to pull to find the start of the tape and the little different colored piece is hard to get off without cutting it.  </li>
            <li> is so thin makes very hard to use</li>
            <li> and they may be supposed to be that thin</li>
            <li> Difficult to unravel.</li>
            <li> (Sorry if that makes no sense.)</li>
            <li> They had this weird pattern that you&#x27;d see in an 80s photo background.</li>
            <li> All the rest are crap.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are a great deal. You get a ton of colors, and the quality of the tape itself if very good. There are really unlimited possibilities of what you can do with these, and they&#x27;ve become an essential part of my manicure kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;- They have limited side-to-side bend, so use them on a dry or semi-dry topcoat if your trying to curve them at all to get your angle correct (I use them as a border on french manicures and they give it a nice slick-looking finish).&lt;br /&gt;- I apply a light clear coat of polish under the ends and press down for a second or two to really secure them to the nail&lt;br /&gt;- I use a clear thickening polish as a second-to-top coat over them to smooth the line out so that it is completely flat to the polish</li>
            <li> perfect item and service</li>
            <li> Thinner than I expected, however when I looked back at the picture it was accurate size. Only thing is that I only got 29 rolls not 30. Shipping &amp; delivery was both before the time given</li>
            <li> Great colors.  There are duplicates.  I only rec&#x27;d 27 but there is so many that I will enjoy these for a long time,</li>
            <li> Works as they should.</li>
            <li> I thought there would be a better selections. Not 3 of 10 different colors. 3 of which were greens.</li>
            <li> Product works alright. They really only work is you put the design on when your nails are still tacky and you have to be super careful about not messing they up. Other than that it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Even with a clear coat over the top they do not stick to the nail.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, fast shipping (received in 2 weeks). Package comes with 2 of each color. NOTE: to dispense the striping tape I use an old plastic tape dispenser.  These rolls fit perfectly and keep your striping tape organized and accessible.  Instead of picking the end every time you want to use it you can dispense it like scotch tape.  I have 10 that fit perfectly on one dispenser.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good product</li>
            <li> is so thin makes very hard to use but you do get a very good variety and a lot for the price and they may be supposed to be that thin and I am just  to old to use</li>
            <li> Love the colors easy to apply on nails</li>

            <li> Very happy with my purchase. I had received it before its estimated delivery. I do recommend to order from them. I enjoy my item.</li>
            <li> Difficult to unravel.</li>
            <li> Awesome tape for nail designs</li>
            <li> There is little piece of a different color tape on the actual tape you will be using, so you can tell where to pull to find the start. The downside to it is you dont know which direction to pull to find the start of the tape and the little different colored piece is hard to get off without cutting it.  (Sorry if that makes no sense.) Other than this (which isn&#x27;t a big deal) it was in perfect condition and worth it. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Some of the strips fell off of the roll and messed up the strips. But I love the colors. That was the the only problem I had.</li>
            <li> Received a GREAT SELECTION of colors, This was a terrific buy and a MUST HAVE for nail art lovers.&lt;br /&gt;Took awhile to get here, but was worth the wait. Would definately purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love the variety of tapes. Just what I expected. FABULOUS!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but there&#x27;s a lot of them for good price. I see a lot of repeat colors but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> i like the colors and the different variations of designs , even thou you have to look really close to see it...lol  it will surely last me for a very long time. i came up with so many cool designs also.</li>
            <li> Came early!!! A few were messed up. But nothing I can&#x27;t use overall great!!</li>
            <li> Good price and quality</li>
            <li> These are fun art for your nails.  They work good.  I&#x27;ve had no problem getting them started off the rolls.  They go on good.  They stay on and I found they stay on LONGER if you put a clear top coat on after you&#x27;ve applied them.  I get alot of compliments on my nails</li>
            <li> I ordered these on my boyfriends account he&#x27;s a prime member so most of the time my orders go through his account but anyway I really liked this striping tape for nail art if your new to nail art these are not as big as they look on the pics but there is still a ton for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. It comes with lots of colors but its better used to make designs with. The tape doesn&#x27;t tend to stay put long enough to keep on nails but could always try if you really wanted to by putting clear coat on nail and then applying for extra stickiness hope this helps. Great buy for all the other nail art lovers out there.</li>
            <li> It is very sticky when you get it out of the baggies. They also send you the colors repeated up to 7 of the same color. So no worth it. It is the same as if you  throw away the 4 dollars in the trash.</li>
            <li> I bought enough to last a life time.  These work well for nail art. Paint a bottom color, place these for design,  paint another color, dry,  peel them off. I guess you could leave the stickers on but when I tried that they peeled off.</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;It was sooooooo awesome oll my friends like it and they need to buy 😊</li>
            <li> Love all the colors. Only issue was they are so narrow it is hard to find the beginning of the tape and get it started.  Took some patience.</li>
            <li> Tape peels often no matter how much top coat I apply</li>
            <li> Super weak. I thought with an assortment of 30 colors I&#x27;d get at least a few of the colors I wanted. Nope. I got like, 7 reds, 5 greens, some blues, and none of them I&#x27;ll use. Ever. There&#x27;s only one I&#x27;ll use, the solid gold one. All the rest are crap. Most of them weren&#x27;t solid either. They had this weird pattern that you&#x27;d see in an 80s photo background. Waste of $5.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and perfectly!  I bought them for my sister and she loves them.</li>
            <li> I got these on time and tried it on the very day i got it. veru happy with the way it sticks to the nail. do not need any other tool to fix it onto the nail. the only disappointment is i did not get the colorful collection shown in the picture. i got 3-5 tapes of 9 very regular colors. that&#x27;s why 3 stars for it</li>
            <li> Really love these. will be buying again. The customer service was spectacular and had a very quick response time.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife and she is so excited to start using them next time she does her nails. There are so many different designs to choose from, so I know she&#x27;ll have fun with these.</li>
            <li> came in good condition thank you</li>
            <li> Not too great of an assortment of color but work really well</li>
            <li> On Time! As I expected</li>
            <li> This tape collection is great.  I am in love with all the colors.  I just cannot wait to use them more.  The colors simply pop when used with the right corresponding color.  Salon look without the salon price.  Now i just need to find a dispenser to use them easily.  I have been told that a regular tape dispenser will do the trick.  They are very inexpensive and well worth it.</li>
            <li> Arrived early and the colors are great!!</li>
            <li> A big variety of tape. Love it</li>
            <li> Revising my review.  I did finally receive the striping tape, which my daughter likes.  However, it took 7 weeks to receive it--a week later than promised.  Received 29 instead of 30 rolls.  They are pretty.</li>
            <li> These 30 rolls are beautiful! They came quickly and each roll came individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> it was a gift for my daughter, and she hasn&#x27;t had any complaints.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to have reach her approval.&lt;br /&gt;was a little slow in delivery, but when received she was well satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;used it with no apparent difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;And I even got a chance to get a manicure from her!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful!</li>
            <li> They took about 4 weeks to get here and for some reason I thought the wheels were much larger. but they are not. however, many colors and neatly packed. I watch a lot of nail art on youtube so I have a lot of ideas. looking for to using them. and the reviews other buyers wrote really helped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to make cool designs apply Polish and Peel but to actually use it as a design itself sucks it won&#x27;t stick on the nail long enough to enjoy the corners always lift up</li>
