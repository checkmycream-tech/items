            <li>bottom line is that none of the 5 products are magical</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>I love that I can buy this great quality conditioner at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the Lorel</li>
            <li>so glad I was able to get on there testing site</li>
            <li>I think I love it.  </li>
            <li>It has a thicker texture than the truly cheap brands (Suave) conditioner and feels nice and silky.</li>
            <li>but I was able to detangle my hair in a record 5-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>and I simply love the way my curls look.</li>
            <li>For better results I invite you to use this conditioner and Biotin hair loss shampoo-</li>
            <li>It is even better than some salon brands.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s still my favorite until I find something better.</li>
            <li>There are better serum products out there that you can use after washing to suppress the frizz.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>but I had to buy an additional product to make sure my SCALP looked okay.</li>
            <li>My friends love it as well, and we are women who have varying hair types from A to Z.</li>
            <li>It also made it to were it just made it more manageable without making it look greasy.</li>
            <li>My curls have never looked better and I get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>This one is definitely better.</li>
            <li>so glad i can find this product on line instead of having to hunt all over town for it.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Even though my fine hair is prone to tangling, this conditioner makes it much more manageable.</li>
            <li>John Frieda Frizz-Ease products are cheap and work better than any of the $30 products that I have tried.</li>
            <li>that it is non-greasy and is easy on the pocket book.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is hands down the best product to use.</li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Below is a detailed review of each product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how this actually not only causes my hair to be more curly, but helps it hold the curls better throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair silky, shiny, and frizz free.</li>
            <li>The price is affordable to such a great product.</li>
            <li>but when they are used together my hair stays shiny and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>Is it a rich creamy texture or 90% water with a bit of cream?</li>
            <li>Rich Creamy Texture. 2)</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it I could tell that the John Freida products work so much better on my hair.</li>
            <li>And when the lid was not on right it easily spilled all over the place.</li>
            <li>Maybe if my hair was normal and not so fine, this would work better.</li>
            <li>This just fixed my hair and made it look amazing.</li>
            <li>That means it also requires a good amount of the blue gel to work it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That means it also requires a good amount of the blue gel to work it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so cool</li>
            <li>The scent is fine, it rinses pretty well.</li>
            <li>- It works noticeably better than my old shampoo (Aussie Smooth).</li>
            <li>Super curly, super frizzy hair....</li>
            <li>but they seem to quickly turn to frizz whether I like it or not.</li>
            <li>(Current price: $0.54/ounce) - If the shampoo does most of the moisturizing \\&quot;work,\\&quot; then the conditioner seems kind of like the sealant to lock it in and protect it all day, and to make your hair more \\&quot;manageable.\\&quot; This conditioner does that job well enough</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because hydrated hair is pretty much what healthy hair</li>
            <li>My scalp also feels much better &amp; the itching is nearly gone!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thin, but since it is fine</li>
            <li>by far my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length baby fine hair which is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>This seems to have the same effect as the Frieda conditioner, except that it makes my hair even slightly more helmet-y.</li>
            <li>I thought this would help define my curls more than the regular</li>
            <li>I like the conditioner because it helps smooth out the hair but keep the natural curl, too</li>
            <li>This make my hair so soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Personally, the shampoo seems to moisturize my hair better than the conditioner</li>
            <li>The conditioner does exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is super moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t seem better than the average drugstore brand at controlling my curls and keeping the frizz at bay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. - Many of these same products are probably available at your local Wal-Mart (or whatever), and probably for a 10-25% lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Maybe it would be worth it if it gave my hair a brilliant luster or thickness, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all, at least not above what the shampoo and conditioner are already doing.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be worth it if it gave my hair a brilliant luster or thickness, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all, at least not above what the shampoo and conditioner are already doing.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful for long, thick, naturally very wavy hair</li>
            <li>Most of the time I blow dry my hair straight</li>
            <li>If you have really tight curls, Frizz Ease will loosen them up into lovely big curls and if you have looser curls, this product will make your hair wavy and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I have very thick wavy hair and this work great on it</li>
            <li>Detangles my curly hair very well.</li>
            <li>Works great on my thin curly hair.</li>
            <li>I was browsing the aisles at my local grocery store looking for something cheap but geared towards curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have never been nor will ever be one of the people who can detangle their hair with their fingers I have to use a comb and therefore never expect much from a detangler</li>
            <li>I have very curly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the dream curls line</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I have very kinky/curly hair</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shampoo and conditioner, and I definitely see a difference in my hair&#x27;s appearance using this product, as compared to using past shampoos and conditioners (Garnier, Herbal Essences, Aussie</li>
            <li>Healthy hair is also the result of things like drinking water and eating right and avoiding excessive sun or heat.</li>
            <li>I could tell after washing out 60% of the conditioner (I leave some in for extra conditioning) that I had found something special.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed a mild to moderate improvement in shine, darkness, and thickness.</li>
            <li>So rather than recommending a particular product, I recommend that you do some trials and see what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This leaves my frizzy, wavy hair very soft!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations when I purchased the Dream Curls conditioner by John Freida</li>
            <li>but I have high hopes for this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y</li>
            <li>It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not magic, but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>My hair is VERY long (like to my butt long) and very fine.</li>
            <li>You apply it to dry hair at night, work it through the ends, and then sleep with your hair in a mildly goopy state.</li>

            <li>You will expect a healthy growth and soft hair and less frizz!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling very soft and shiny but even after applying leave in conditioner and mousse</li>
            <li>I was a classic too-manly-for-hair-care male until I recently resolved (out of either vanity or self-respect, or maybe both) to start attending more carefully to my health/appearance/grooming.</li>
            <li>I tried the other kind that has the purple cap and it felt like it was watered down.</li>
            <li>I chose this shampoo and conditioner because I wanted a little higher end shampoo, for not too much higher of a price...</li>
            <li>Plus, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing much to make my hair healthier because you only apply it to the end of the hair and not to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I had read some caveman-y theories about how hair products damage our hair because they crowd out the natural moisturizing chemicals and blah blah.</li>

            <li>I had read some caveman-y theories about how hair products damage our hair because they crowd out the natural moisturizing chemicals and blah blah.</li>
            <li>and it really does help with the frizz in the winter especially.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to spend $20 on &#x27;professional brand&#x27; anymore.</li>
            <li>this is what it should of been and so soft and managleable ..</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Vitamins Natural DHT.</li>
            <li>If frizz is your problem, then Frizz Ease will kill the frizz and make your hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>B002PBCABY L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Overnight Treatment]] (2.5 stars) ($1.76/ounce) - I have only used it a few times but haven&#x27;t noticed anything magical.</li>
            <li>B002PBCABY L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Overnight Treatment]] (2.5 stars) ($1.76/ounce) - I have only used it a few times but haven&#x27;t noticed anything magical.</li>
            <li>I saw no difference, and it isn&#x27;t as potent as it advertises (and my hair is not exceptionally frizzy).</li>
            <li>Believe me,I have bought and tried the more high-end products of this type and they are not nearly as good.</li>
            <li>Weighs down my hair a lot more than other products.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find much difference in this conditioner vs their regular deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t carried in stores near me anymore, so I ordered it for nearly the same price on here.</li>
            <li>In general, the John Freida Frizz Ease Smooth Start Hydrating Conditioner For extra Dry hair works well on my extremely dry hair</li>
            <li>This conditioner would probably have a more desirable effect for people with long (at least shoulder-length) hair.</li>
            <li>Hair is, of course, at the front line of that battle, so I interrogated some professional hair people and did some Internet browsing and learned that hair care is only partly a matter of what products you use.</li>
            <li>He has coarse, wild, curly hair.</li>
            <li>Another thing I learned while researching hair is that we are all unique little flowers with very different filaments on our noggins that respond differently to different things.</li>
            <li>then spent a decent (if not ridiculous) amount of time browsing Amazon&#x27;s hydrating hair products and reading the reviews, and then I experimented with 5 different, relatively inexpensive</li>
            <li>Sometimes I still need a little extra hair product, but overall this helps out so much.</li>

            <li> (Current price: $0.54/ounce) - If the shampoo does most of the moisturizing \\&quot;work,\\&quot; then the conditioner seems kind of like the sealant to lock it in and protect it all day, and to make your hair more \\&quot;manageable.\\&quot; This conditioner does that job well enough</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because hydrated hair is pretty much what healthy hair</li>
            <li> My scalp also feels much better &amp; the itching is nearly gone!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thin, but since it is fine</li>
            <li> by far my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length baby fine hair which is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> This seems to have the same effect as the Frieda conditioner, except that it makes my hair even slightly more helmet-y.</li>
            <li> I thought this would help define my curls more than the regular</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner because it helps smooth out the hair but keep the natural curl, too</li>
            <li> This make my hair so soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Personally, the shampoo seems to moisturize my hair better than the conditioner</li>
            <li> The conditioner does exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is super moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t seem better than the average drugstore brand at controlling my curls and keeping the frizz at bay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S. - Many of these same products are probably available at your local Wal-Mart (or whatever), and probably for a 10-25% lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Maybe it would be worth it if it gave my hair a brilliant luster or thickness, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all, at least not above what the shampoo and conditioner are already doing.</li>

            <li> Works wonderful for long, thick, naturally very wavy hair</li>
            <li> Most of the time I blow dry my hair straight</li>
            <li> If you have really tight curls, Frizz Ease will loosen them up into lovely big curls and if you have looser curls, this product will make your hair wavy and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair and this work great on it</li>
            <li> Detangles my curly hair very well.</li>
            <li> Works great on my thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was browsing the aisles at my local grocery store looking for something cheap but geared towards curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have never been nor will ever be one of the people who can detangle their hair with their fingers I have to use a comb and therefore never expect much from a detangler</li>
            <li> I have very curly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the dream curls line</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I have very kinky/curly hair</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo and conditioner, and I definitely see a difference in my hair&#x27;s appearance using this product, as compared to using past shampoos and conditioners (Garnier, Herbal Essences, Aussie</li>
            <li> Healthy hair is also the result of things like drinking water and eating right and avoiding excessive sun or heat.</li>
            <li> I could tell after washing out 60% of the conditioner (I leave some in for extra conditioning) that I had found something special.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a mild to moderate improvement in shine, darkness, and thickness.</li>
            <li> So rather than recommending a particular product, I recommend that you do some trials and see what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This leaves my frizzy, wavy hair very soft!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations when I purchased the Dream Curls conditioner by John Freida</li>
            <li> but I have high hopes for this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y</li>
            <li> It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic, but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY long (like to my butt long) and very fine.</li>
            <li> You apply it to dry hair at night, work it through the ends, and then sleep with your hair in a mildly goopy state.</li>
            <li> You apply it to dry hair at night, work it through the ends, and then sleep with your hair in a mildly goopy state.</li>
            <li> You will expect a healthy growth and soft hair and less frizz!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling very soft and shiny but even after applying leave in conditioner and mousse</li>
            <li> I was a classic too-manly-for-hair-care male until I recently resolved (out of either vanity or self-respect, or maybe both) to start attending more carefully to my health/appearance/grooming.</li>
            <li> I tried the other kind that has the purple cap and it felt like it was watered down.</li>
            <li> I chose this shampoo and conditioner because I wanted a little higher end shampoo, for not too much higher of a price...</li>
            <li> Plus, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing much to make my hair healthier because you only apply it to the end of the hair and not to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I had read some caveman-y theories about how hair products damage our hair because they crowd out the natural moisturizing chemicals and blah blah.</li>

            <li> and it really does help with the frizz in the winter especially.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to spend $20 on &#x27;professional brand&#x27; anymore.</li>
            <li> this is what it should of been and so soft and managleable ..</li>

            <li> If frizz is your problem, then Frizz Ease will kill the frizz and make your hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> B002PBCABY L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Overnight Treatment]] (2.5 stars) ($1.76/ounce) - I have only used it a few times but haven&#x27;t noticed anything magical.</li>
            <li> B002PBCABY L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Overnight Treatment]] (2.5 stars) ($1.76/ounce) - I have only used it a few times but haven&#x27;t noticed anything magical.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference, and it isn&#x27;t as potent as it advertises (and my hair is not exceptionally frizzy).</li>
            <li> Believe me,I have bought and tried the more high-end products of this type and they are not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> Weighs down my hair a lot more than other products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find much difference in this conditioner vs their regular deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t carried in stores near me anymore, so I ordered it for nearly the same price on here.</li>
            <li> In general, the John Freida Frizz Ease Smooth Start Hydrating Conditioner For extra Dry hair works well on my extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> This conditioner would probably have a more desirable effect for people with long (at least shoulder-length) hair.</li>
            <li> Hair is, of course, at the front line of that battle, so I interrogated some professional hair people and did some Internet browsing and learned that hair care is only partly a matter of what products you use.</li>
            <li> He has coarse, wild, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Another thing I learned while researching hair is that we are all unique little flowers with very different filaments on our noggins that respond differently to different things.</li>
            <li> then spent a decent (if not ridiculous) amount of time browsing Amazon&#x27;s hydrating hair products and reading the reviews, and then I experimented with 5 different, relatively inexpensive</li>
            <li> Sometimes I still need a little extra hair product, but overall this helps out so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that my hair during those months was surprisingly less nappy and gross than I expected, and it&#x27;s maybe even true that the artificial chemicals we put on our scalps have some serious, unwelcome consequences, but all I can say is that I much prefer how my hair looks and feels after it&#x27;s been shampooed, to the point that I&#x27;m willing to take whatever risks</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m telling you, this conditioner in conjunction with the matching shampoo has really helped to tame my curls.</li>
            <li> It quiets down the frizz, so you can see definition in natural curls.</li>
            <li> No heavy residue to weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> It keeps it soft and moisturized, but he says it does leave his hair a little greasy.</li>
            <li> 5) How does my hair look once it&#x27;s dry?</li>
            <li> and if I dry it with a diffuser I can get some curls</li>
            <li> It tends to get dry.  </li>
            <li> It was so dry and fizzy</li>
            <li> (and I guess I&#x27;m not sure if this can be attributed directly to this shampoo)</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend and I live in Houston and we both have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> Given what I&#x27;ve seen from the different products, I will probably settle into a routine of using a small amount of the Frieda shampoo and conditioner daily, and then using an overnight treatment maybe once a month (but probably not the L&#x27;Oreal one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before I use this product, my hair was very dry</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look flat.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was neither great nor horrible.</li>
            <li> i have 3c hair and have been natural since the late 90s.</li>
            <li> With this shampoo, my hair stays wet after a shower about 40% longer</li>
            <li> I had a different shipment on my wife&#x27;s account that ended up coming together with a heavy item (29 pounds).  </li>
            <li> However, you need to be careful what else you purchase with it due to the lid not locking.  </li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I had spent a lot of money and time on numerous products with not very good results.</li>
            <li> but I only use a little bit of it because it makes my hair a little too helmet-y for my liking.</li>
            <li> but so do the other conditioners.</li>

            <li> ; hydrating; I don&#x27;t prefer one over the other, I just like the auto ship and savings</li>
            <li> The movement in the box was enough to force a lot of product past this lid.</li>
            <li> Although the size is small it actually lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a problem I&#x27;ve ever had any other winter.</li>

            <li> It WILL tend to weigh my hair down a bit if I overdue it...</li>
            <li> but there are times that I&#x27;m too lazy and will dry my hair curly with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> It has a scent that is a little too much like a household cleaning product, but it&#x27;s a faint smell and goes away after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of money on products in the past suggested by stylists as I have really thick, dry, wavy hair.  </li>

            <li> all products were too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend any curly girl with thick hair to try it, especially for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

            <li> I purchased this product after I ran out of my expensive conditioner (paid day isn&#x27;t until next week).</li>
            <li> My hair is curly again and no more frizz.</li>

            <li> Was definitely skeptical, but reordered because it just worked so well.</li>

            <li> I like this product. Before I use this product, my hair was very dry now it&#x27;s smooth&lt;br /&gt;and manageable. Another reason that I like is, it&#x27;s UNISEX.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful for long, thick, naturally very wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of money on products in the past suggested by stylists as I have really thick, dry, wavy hair.  John Frieda Frizz-Ease products are cheap and work better than any of the $30 products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair and this work great on it and it has a great smell.  Definitively would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was a classic too-manly-for-hair-care male until I recently resolved (out of either vanity or self-respect, or maybe both) to start attending more carefully to my health/appearance/grooming.

Maybe you like that from a conditioner--I don&#x27;t. I prefer that my hair move in the breeze. This conditioner would probably have a more desirable effect for people with long (at least shoulder-length) hair. As for the scent, I would describe it as \\&quot;neutral.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B0034F7F2E John Frieda Frizz-Ease Shampoo]] (4.3 stars) ($0.60/ounce) - It works noticeably better than my old shampoo (Aussie Smooth). With this shampoo, my hair stays wet after a shower about 40% longer and it retains a subtle moisture all day. After a shower, when I comb my wet hair, I can hardly even feel it because there is so little resistance against the comb. In other words, my hair becomes a weird combination of wet and airy. The shampoo seems to work best when I leave it in for a minute or two before rinsing. I only need to use about a nickel-sized amount (I have medium-to-shaggy hair).

Also, it has an initially-strong scent that faintly lingers in my hair all day, even when I only use a dime-sized amount. It&#x27;s a smell that I would describe as endurable but not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B000UPOBRI Paul Mitchell leave-in conditioner]] (3.0 stars) ($1.03/ounce) - My second-biggest complaint with this product is that it is sort of annoying to apply - after the shower, you have to dab a few blotches of it onto your damp hair and then brush it through.

Plus, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing much to make my hair healthier because you only apply it to the end of the hair and not to the scalp.

            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used for frizzy hair. It quiets down the frizz, so you can see definition in natural curls. No heavy residue to weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> love this and it really does help with the frizz in the winter especially. pantene did away with their anti frizz so I started using this brand. I am happy with the results. Smooth; hydrating; I don&#x27;t prefer one over the other, I just like the auto ship and savings and I see frizz results from both so I buy either one.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  However, you need to be careful what else you purchase with it due to the lid not locking.  I had a different shipment on my wife&#x27;s account that ended up coming together with a heavy item (29 pounds).  The movement in the box was enough to force a lot of product past this lid.</li>
            <li> Super curly, super frizzy hair....that&#x27;s me.  I&#x27;m telling you, this conditioner in conjunction with the matching shampoo has really helped to tame my curls. It WILL tend to weigh my hair down a bit if I overdue it...so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how this actually not only causes my hair to be more curly, but helps it hold the curls better throughout the day. I honestly can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t scrunch my hair (which is somewhat wavy to begin with) without using this conditioner anymore! Was definitely skeptical, but reordered because it just worked so well.</li>
            <li> This has worked great on my frizzy hair.  Sometimes I still need a little extra hair product, but overall this helps out so much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for curls or frizz easing - did detangle, though. Would not repurchase and wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Weighs down my hair a lot more than other products. I attempted to switch when my local stores stopped offering Tresemme&#x27;s curly hair product, and this one just isn&#x27;t for me. The scent is fine, it rinses pretty well. I&#x27;ve used for about 5 months with the matching shampoo and mousse - all products were too heavy for my hair. My curls are not tight and my hair is not super thick.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything to make my hair curlier or to help define my curls. frizz is still there.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend and I live in Houston and we both have thick wavy hair so frizz is a very common problem here with all the humidity we get. I have to say this is hands down the best product to use. Although the size is small it actually lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li> great brand and works well</li>
            <li> Great for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Detangles my curly hair very well. Leaves curls well-defined. Good product.</li>
            <li> Naturally curly hair&#x27;s BEST FRIEND. I love that I can buy this great quality conditioner at a reasonable cost. I don&#x27;t have to spend $20 on &#x27;professional brand&#x27; anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works great on my thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> this is what it should of been and so soft and managleable .. I love the Lorel so glad I was able to get on there testing site and here i order there shampoo so cool</li>
            <li> I received this last week and have used twice.  I think I love it.  My hair seems softer and it has a nice curl, without frizz.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is super moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t seem better than the average drugstore brand at controlling my curls and keeping the frizz at bay. It has a thicker texture than the truly cheap brands (Suave) conditioner and feels nice and silky. It leaves my hair feeling very soft and shiny but even after applying leave in conditioner and mousse my hair frizzes. It does smell very nice though.</li>
            <li> I only use John Frieda regime on my hair.  Great price and excellent packaging.  Was scared it would be open or destroyed in shipping but it came in a sealed plastic bag.</li>
            <li> my granddaughter loved it....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews for anything but I felt like I had to this time for all my curly girls out there. I purchased this product after I ran out of my expensive conditioner (paid day isn&#x27;t until next week). I was browsing the aisles at my local grocery store looking for something cheap but geared towards curly hair. I didn&#x27;t have high expectations when I purchased the Dream Curls conditioner by John Freida but I was pleasantly surprised. I have thick 3a/3b hair (Botticelli in DevaCurl language) and have run the gamut of curly hair products. As a result, I put my conditioner through a 5 prong test. 1) The consistency? Is it a rich creamy texture or 90% water with a bit of cream? John Freida &#x3D; Rich Creamy Texture. 2) How does it feel when I apply it to my hair?  Does my hair feel conditioned as soon as I apply the conditioner (is there a lot of slip) or does it feel like I am re-washing it with extra moisturizing shampoo? John Freida &#x3D; Lots of slip while massaging the conditioner into my scalp I could feel the roots detangling. 3) How well does it detangle? I have never been nor will ever be one of the people who can detangle their hair with their fingers I have to use a comb and therefore never expect much from a detangler but John Freida Dream Curls conditioner was pretty awesome. I still had to use my comb but I was able to detangle my hair in a record 5-8 minutes. 4) How does my hair feel after I wash out the conditioner? I could tell after washing out 60% of the conditioner (I leave some in for extra conditioning) that I had found something special. My hair smelled great (plus) and felt even better. When I did the curly girl crunch (as I call it) when you crunch/squish you ends to your scalp I could hear the squishy watery sounds of a well hydrated do. 5) How does my hair look once it&#x27;s dry? I just used the product this morning so can&#x27;t say yet (which is why I only gave it four stars) but I have high hopes for this conditioner. I would definitely recommend any curly girl with thick hair to try it, especially for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for year now and I simply love the way my curls look. For better results I invite you to use this conditioner and Biotin hair loss shampoo- Vitamins Natural DHT. You will expect a healthy growth and soft hair and less frizz!</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY long (like to my butt long) and very fine. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have a lot of hair. It&#x27;s not thin, but since it is fine and I have a lot of hair, it tends to tangle. This conditioner is the best non-salon conditioner I have ever tried. It is even better than some salon brands. It keeps my hair silky, shiny, and frizz free. Even though my fine hair is prone to tangling, this conditioner makes it much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find much difference in this conditioner vs their regular deep conditioner. Most of the time I blow dry my hair straight but there are times that I&#x27;m too lazy and will dry my hair curly with a diffuser. I thought this would help define my curls more than the regular Frizz Ease deep conditioner but it does not. I have shoulder length baby fine hair which is naturally wavy and if I dry it with a diffuser I can get some curls but they seem to quickly turn to frizz whether I like it or not. Maybe if my hair was normal and not so fine, this would work better. I don&#x27;t know. But I can&#x27;t recommend it for curls over the regular Frizz Ease conditioner. That&#x27;s still my favorite until I find something better.</li>
            <li> This product does not do what it promises. I saw no difference, and it isn&#x27;t as potent as it advertises (and my hair is not exceptionally frizzy). There are better serum products out there that you can use after washing to suppress the frizz. I&#x27;m not convinced this conditioner is the solution.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The conditioner was neither great nor horrible. The lid, however, broke immediately and in several spots. And when the lid was not on right it easily spilled all over the place. I will not buy it again for this reason alone.</li>
            <li> I chose this shampoo and conditioner because I wanted a little higher end shampoo, for not too much higher of a price... Frizz-Ease did the trick. It&#x27;s a great shampoo and conditioner, and I definitely see a difference in my hair&#x27;s appearance using this product, as compared to using past shampoos and conditioners (Garnier, Herbal Essences, Aussie products.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER (and I guess I&#x27;m not sure if this can be attributed directly to this shampoo) but I have never had problems in my LIFE with dandruff, and since beginning using this product I have had to alternate every wash with head and shoulders. Maybe it&#x27;s the season... but like I said... it&#x27;s not a problem I&#x27;ve ever had any other winter. So my hair looks great... but I had to buy an additional product to make sure my SCALP looked okay.</li>
            <li> In general, the John Freida Frizz Ease Smooth Start Hydrating Conditioner For extra Dry hair works well on my extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> This is the best product for anyone who has really curly or frizzy hair.  Believe me,I have bought and tried the more high-end products of this type and they are not nearly as good. I have been using John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Curls Conditioner for the last three years and it  works!  My friends love it as well, and we are women who have varying hair types from A to Z. If you have really tight curls, Frizz Ease will loosen them up into lovely big curls and if you have looser curls, this product will make your hair wavy and more manageable. If frizz is your problem, then Frizz Ease will kill the frizz and make your hair silky and soft.I also like  that it is non-greasy and is easy on the pocket book.</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner because it helps smooth out the hair but keep the natural curl, too</li>
            <li> This conditioner was amazing. This make my hair so soft and frizz free. I have very curly wavy hair. I cannot believe I haven&#x27;t tried this sooner. It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look flat. This just fixed my hair and made it look amazing. It also made it to were it just made it more manageable without making it look greasy. I will buy again and I recommend you try it. The price is affordable to such a great product. Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Got this product for my wife, she loves the John Frieda products so I am sure it is good!.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My curls have never looked better and I get lots of compliments. Thanks to the dream curls line I have finally broken the habit of straightening my hair!</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair.  It tends to get dry.  This is wonderful for giving it a nice, soft feel.  Wonderful</li>
            <li> This leaves my frizzy, wavy hair very soft! The smell is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this. He has coarse, wild, curly hair. It keeps it soft and moisturized, but he says it does leave his hair a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I like this product line.  Personally, the shampoo seems to moisturize my hair better than the conditioner but when they are used together my hair stays shiny and frizz free.  It really works.</li>
            <li> I LOVE all my John Frieda Frizz Ease products and this one works great.  I have very kinky/curly hair and I am love with this line of products!</li>
            <li> I chose this shampoo and conditioner hoping it would bring back the curls as it says it would do. I have never been one to believe the the hype of a curling shampoo and conditioner. After using both the shampoo and conditioner for a couple of years I decided I was not happy with the results. I have wavy and curly hair. It was so dry and fizzy and I had spent a lot of money and time on numerous products with not very good results. I finally decided after reading numerous testimonials of not using shampoo on curly hair. So I stopped the shampoo and replaced that with a baking soda and apple cider vinegar rinse once or twice a week then using the John Frieda Dream Curls conditioner. WOW what a difference. I haven&#x27;t used shampoo for 7 months and will never go back. My hair is curly again and no more frizz. The conditioner does exactly what I was looking for. Also after coloring my hair the color lasts much longer since the shampoo was constantly stripping out the color with in a few weeks.So happy with this conditioner</li>
            <li> I have used Pantene for several years &amp; decided to try something different.  I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now.  From the first time I used it I could tell that the John Freida products work so much better on my hair. My scalp also feels much better &amp; the itching is nearly gone!  The shampoo &amp; conditioner both feel so wonderfully luxurious.  My hair is soft again, my scalp feels great &amp; I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. It isn&#x27;t carried in stores near me anymore, so I ordered it for nearly the same price on here. I tried the other kind that has the purple cap and it felt like it was watered down. This one is definitely better.</li>
            <li> by far my favorite conditioner. i have 3c hair and have been natural since the late 90s. so glad i can find this product on line instead of having to hunt all over town for it.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product. I don&#x27;t like the shampoo that goes with it but the conditioner does its work well. It&#x27;s not magic, but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
