            <li>It gives me the perfect highlight without looking powdery or chalky.</li>
            <li>The best highlighter I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>It really is a wonderful highlighter that shows up even though I have very fair skin.</li>
            <li>Ever wonder how movie stars and celebrities get that beautiful sheen to their skin?</li>
            <li>Its not glittery, and gives a beautiful sheen that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Beautiful packaging, pigmentation &amp; shades.</li>
            <li>This highlighter is a gorgeous gold color, but it is incredibly reflective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a night out.</li>
            <li>Albatross is great for every skintone.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I bet it would look great on all skintones too.</li>
            <li>I am happy I bought this.</li>
            <li>Albatross is great for all skin-tones, (I&#x27;m NW45)</li>
            <li>This highlighter is great for darker skin tones since it has a gold sheen/undertone.</li>
            <li>I love Nars Products and this is the best highlighter I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and it looks great on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sooooo fair.</li>
            <li>This is a good product to have in your makeup collection.</li>
            <li>Their highlighters truly give a gorgeous glow, without glitter, frostiness, and without making your pores look cavernous.</li>
            <li>With Sun God is a gorgeous non-orange cream stick</li>
            <li>and it looks just as good now that my hair is brown again.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll I&#x27;m glad I jumped the fence because it&#x27;s a GREAT highlight blush.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied!</li>
            <li>I love this hightlighter!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>B000PVPEFU NARS Orgasm Blush]]I love Nars blush in Orgasm!</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m sure it will!</li>
            <li>Love this as an addition to my creamy blush from Nars also!</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>The color however, is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, amazing, amazing stuff to give you youthful glow.</li>
            <li>They make amazing bronzers, blushes &amp; highlighters.</li>
            <li>stunningly amazing La Femme blushes.</li>
            <li>looks amazing</li>
            <li>I was hoping to have a nice sheen using it...</li>
            <li>However, for a glitzy, nighttime occasion it can be nice, and I like it in the corners of my eye.</li>
            <li>I can honestly cannot ask for anything more in a highlighter.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re beautiful &amp; cost so much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>No wonder its a cult favorite.</li>
            <li>I use it under my eyebrows, on the inside corner of my eye and the top of my cheekbone.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s much better for flash photography.  </li>
            <li>I had always looked at this when I was in Sephora and wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to spend the $30 on it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love to use it on the cheekbones over a blush or bronzer.  </li>
            <li>this is the most flattering highlighter I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it after applying it in the store.</li>
            <li>I love this paired with NARS Exhibit A and Taos blushes.</li>
            <li>I love it as a highlighter.  </li>
            <li>I love NARS products.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE QUAILITY.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is perfect for the upper brows, bridge of the nose, cheek bones and chest.</li>
            <li>My favorite highlighter that doesn&#x27;t have glitter in it</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I will buy more</li>
            <li>Phenomenal products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Multiples have been duped by so many companies</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Let me begin by stating I love NARS.</li>
            <li>I love NARS products, but this color is a way glittery and shimmery for my liking.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and lasts all day:)</li>
            <li>That really tells you how good they are.</li>
            <li>It adds a wonderful golden glow to the tops of my cheekbones or my brow bones without looking white or ashy.</li>
            <li>Has a gorgeous golden shimmer to it that gives you a pretty glow.</li>
            <li>This has fine gold shimmers or flex in it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a fabulous highlighter.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report back that I have found my miracle highlighter.</li>
            <li>Just a touch of light.</li>
            <li>Great staying power and provides just enough shine.</li>
            <li>and it was fantastic</li>
            <li>It also is good for people with sensitive skin because it does not make your skin break out.</li>
            <li>Very nice product(Nars Albatross), but very similar to E.L.F blush in Gotta Glow with a huge price difference, will stick to E.L.F.</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS WORTH THE $$$!</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this by mistake because I had one-click ordering set up on my phone and didn&#x27;t realize it.  </li>
            <li>:) Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dislike this product for certain occasions, but I don&#x27;t love it for all the time.</li>
            <li>I hope that it looks just a good when I switch to red hair</li>
            <li>It has good lasting power.</li>
            <li>Great product if used correctly, however i used a eyeshawdow from the BH cosemetics 88 pallette before purhcasing this and it provides the same effect for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super shiny, like, metallic.</li>
            <li>it looks intimidating because it is bright white but glides on skin like a golden shimmer.</li>
            <li>Orgasm is a beautiful pinky peach with a little shimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t look like a disco ball.</li>
            <li>I love how other users are marking this review as unhelpful JUST because I was honest...</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t give the drastic highlight I was looking for when I purchased it, but it does give a bit of a blur to my skin that is very pretty.</li>
            <li>It gives a beautiful champagne glow and you only need to lightly tap your brush in here to get enough product for your cheeks.</li>
            <li>Heard such amazing reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin looks fresh and dewy.</li>
            <li>The second product is more of a light cream stick highlighter/blush.</li>
            <li>I own Orgasm and Laguna blush and bronzer and use them daily.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a really sheer nice highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I get just the right amount of flush</li>
            <li>Even Wet n Wild blushes are more pigmented &amp; more finely milled than NARS.</li>
            <li>I love this highlighter great product and worth the price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed I think it works well on most skin tones.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and looks like a natural glow.</li>
            <li>It gives a beautiful glow and subtle sheen to the cheeks.  </li>
            <li>La Femme blushes are even better, they come in about 40 beautiful shades, are crazily pigmented, and are under $3 each.</li>
            <li>It is really pretty, but I wouldn&#x27;t dream of wearing this during the day.  </li>
            <li>does not blend well with bronzers so be aware.</li>
            <li>This is the ultimate &amp;#34;any season&amp;#34; highlighter for any (most) skin types, ethnicity, color (ie ivory skin, tan skin, olive skin, medium, etc.).</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say it enough how much I love it.</li>
            <li>Works exactly like I hoped it would.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to purchase more of Nars&#x27; blushes in the future, they have the staying power that I like!</li>
            <li>It is translucent but still gives enough glow to look very clean.</li>
            <li>Sleek blushes are also far far better than NARS, for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t quite produce the most \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; glow for every day; it can look like makeup on the skin in stead of a \\&quot;natural glowing face\\&quot; in certain natural lighting.</li>
            <li>I have dark skin and it looks amazing on me.</li>
            <li>It lasts long, it goes well with most skintones, I&#x27;m NC 30-35 for reference.</li>
            <li>This color would be good for the extremely pale skin tone and doesn&#x27;t work for me on the  way I apply and use my makeup!</li>
            <li>Easy to go overboard, especially when it&#x27;s cracked.</li>
            <li>Beautiful for highlighting, brows, eyeshadow, I have even mixed with some of my lip gloss a few times.</li>
            <li>If I did not have a gift card, I certainly would NOT pay $28 for it.</li>
            <li>I actually really like the e.l.f.</li>
            <li>fast shipment.</li>
            <li>And extremely fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am fair-medium skinned with blonde hair and light eyes.</li>
            <li>I love this highlight because its not stark white and its nothing drastic.  </li>
            <li>Better than expected!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re debating trying it, head over to a Sephora or any other cosmetic store, try it out and go ahead and purchase this because you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>A container of this blush will last you forever, so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>not really a highlighter, more like a white eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Start off small because you can always apply more, but if you come out the starting gate with too much, you&#x27;re gonna have to remove it and start over</li>
            <li>Many are really not very good - try one of their horrifically creasing fat eyeshadow pencils &amp; you&#x27;ll see what I mean - and are easily duped by other companies with much better pigmentation, at much lower prices.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin look so soft and youthful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a waste, just not what I reach for 24/7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Edit</li>
            <li>La Femme blushes are also used by professional makeup artists.</li>
            <li>- it looks natural, but just brightens up my face.</li>
            <li>Still love the product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>As long as you use a primer underneath it works very well.</li>
            <li>It could look super glittery if you did it with a heavy hand, like anything else.</li>
            <li>not only did the gold shimmer settle in every crease and pore, my 30 year old face looked 80.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can imagine how bad this would be for someone with less than perfect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like any other NARS blush in that it is very pigmented, so I recommend using a stipiling or feather brush.</li>
            <li>It kind of makes my face look really weird up close (if its too much on your cheeks or down your nose).  </li>
            <li>They blow NARS, MAC &amp; every other high end</li>
            <li>blushes are nothing special, &amp; they&#x27;re ridiculously overpriced.</li>

            <li> it looks intimidating because it is bright white but glides on skin like a golden shimmer.</li>
            <li> Orgasm is a beautiful pinky peach with a little shimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t look like a disco ball.</li>
            <li> I love how other users are marking this review as unhelpful JUST because I was honest...</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t give the drastic highlight I was looking for when I purchased it, but it does give a bit of a blur to my skin that is very pretty.</li>
            <li> It gives a beautiful champagne glow and you only need to lightly tap your brush in here to get enough product for your cheeks.</li>
            <li> Heard such amazing reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin looks fresh and dewy.</li>
            <li> The second product is more of a light cream stick highlighter/blush.</li>
            <li> I own Orgasm and Laguna blush and bronzer and use them daily.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a really sheer nice highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I get just the right amount of flush</li>
            <li> Even Wet n Wild blushes are more pigmented &amp; more finely milled than NARS.</li>
            <li> I love this highlighter great product and worth the price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed I think it works well on most skin tones.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and looks like a natural glow.</li>
            <li> It gives a beautiful glow and subtle sheen to the cheeks.  </li>
            <li> La Femme blushes are even better, they come in about 40 beautiful shades, are crazily pigmented, and are under $3 each.</li>
            <li> It is really pretty, but I wouldn&#x27;t dream of wearing this during the day.  </li>
            <li> does not blend well with bronzers so be aware.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate &amp;#34;any season&amp;#34; highlighter for any (most) skin types, ethnicity, color (ie ivory skin, tan skin, olive skin, medium, etc.).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it enough how much I love it.</li>
            <li> Works exactly like I hoped it would.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to purchase more of Nars&#x27; blushes in the future, they have the staying power that I like!</li>
            <li> It is translucent but still gives enough glow to look very clean.</li>
            <li> Sleek blushes are also far far better than NARS, for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t quite produce the most \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; glow for every day; it can look like makeup on the skin in stead of a \\&quot;natural glowing face\\&quot; in certain natural lighting.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin and it looks amazing on me.</li>
            <li> It lasts long, it goes well with most skintones, I&#x27;m NC 30-35 for reference.</li>
            <li> This color would be good for the extremely pale skin tone and doesn&#x27;t work for me on the  way I apply and use my makeup!</li>
            <li> Easy to go overboard, especially when it&#x27;s cracked.</li>
            <li> Beautiful for highlighting, brows, eyeshadow, I have even mixed with some of my lip gloss a few times.</li>
            <li> If I did not have a gift card, I certainly would NOT pay $28 for it.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the e.l.f.</li>
            <li> fast shipment.</li>
            <li> And extremely fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am fair-medium skinned with blonde hair and light eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this highlight because its not stark white and its nothing drastic.  </li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re debating trying it, head over to a Sephora or any other cosmetic store, try it out and go ahead and purchase this because you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> A container of this blush will last you forever, so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> not really a highlighter, more like a white eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Start off small because you can always apply more, but if you come out the starting gate with too much, you&#x27;re gonna have to remove it and start over</li>
            <li> Many are really not very good - try one of their horrifically creasing fat eyeshadow pencils &amp; you&#x27;ll see what I mean - and are easily duped by other companies with much better pigmentation, at much lower prices.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin look so soft and youthful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a waste, just not what I reach for 24/7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Edit</li>
            <li> La Femme blushes are also used by professional makeup artists.</li>
            <li> - it looks natural, but just brightens up my face.</li>
            <li> Still love the product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As long as you use a primer underneath it works very well.</li>
            <li> It could look super glittery if you did it with a heavy hand, like anything else.</li>
            <li> not only did the gold shimmer settle in every crease and pore, my 30 year old face looked 80.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can imagine how bad this would be for someone with less than perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other NARS blush in that it is very pigmented, so I recommend using a stipiling or feather brush.</li>
            <li> It kind of makes my face look really weird up close (if its too much on your cheeks or down your nose).  </li>
            <li> They blow NARS, MAC &amp; every other high end</li>
            <li> blushes are nothing special, &amp; they&#x27;re ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li> whoever has anything negative to say about this product obviously doesn&#x27;t know how to use it right.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey as hell, but it will last you a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is soft and creamy and a little goes a long way, which means that the product will last a long time.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other products for cheaper that do the same job with the same quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> And you won&#x27;t regret a penny you&#x27;ve spent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous, and at far lower prices.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
            <li> It creates a golden glow, not too obvious but definitely impossible to miss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other highlighters - Bobbi Brown, Chanel, Sephora and none of them</li>
            <li> In other words, it doesn&#x27;t look like you applied make up</li>
            <li> I have never had problems with it breaking me out or causing irritation, which is saying a lot, because tons of other products have caused issues for me with breakouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not all that!</li>
            <li> It has that chunky gold glitter that can go a little dry</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought it even though it was a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I think its a little too chalky to be a highlighter.</li>
            <li> but I wish it was a little lighter in color.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for its size</li>
            <li> so I have tons and tons of products, but this is the one thing that stays in my everyday makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Get a life, losers.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about this product because I didn&#x27;t want to look like a shinny gold black Barbie-lol!</li>
            <li> Just looks odd!</li>
            <li> dont know if it was because I looked so pale, or because I was covered in gold glitter.</li>
            <li> It adds a little shimmer to my cheeks!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> I used it to highlight and it just puts this very obvious and weird sheen and reflection on your skin.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just cheap products in expensive packaging with extremely expensive marketing campaigns behind them.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past four years and every time I try something else</li>
            <li> There simplyis no good reason to buy NARS products.</li>
            <li> Mine came cracked, which was not a great way to start.</li>
            <li> For the price of ONE NARS blush you can get approximately 15-18</li>
            <li> This is very subtle-</li>
            <li> Yes its expensive</li>
            <li> This is a white powder with gold shimmer and made my skin look disgusting.</li>
            <li> This color has crazy shimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Laguna bronzer is just plain boring, as well as overpriced.</li>
            <li> for whoever out there says bad things about it is because they don&#x27;t know how and where to apply, period.</li>
            <li> It made me break out, so I can&#x27;t even use it :(  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Better than expected! Has a gorgeous golden shimmer to it that gives you a pretty glow. Totally satisfied!</li>
            <li> Thought it would be a white/silver highlighter but is actually gold.  Still love the product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Heard such amazing reviews on this product. I bought it even though it was a little pricey. I don&#x27;t like it at all. I was hoping to have a nice sheen using it... maybe even dewey. But it just looks white and powdery.</li>
            <li> Ever wonder how movie stars and celebrities get that beautiful sheen to their skin? Well besides great diet/exercise, its highlighting products!!! This highlighter is no exception. It makes your skin look so soft and youthful. I love this stuff. It gives a beautiful champagne glow and you only need to lightly tap your brush in here to get enough product for your cheeks. It looks ethereal almost. No wonder its a cult favorite. It lasts long, it goes well with most skintones, I&#x27;m NC 30-35 for reference. If you&#x27;re debating trying it, head over to a Sephora or any other cosmetic store, try it out and go ahead and purchase this because you&#x27;ll love it. If not there are plenty of highlighting products out there designed for you. No harm in trying eh?</li>
            <li> This highlighter is a gorgeous gold color, but it is incredibly reflective.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of other highlighters - Bobbi Brown, Chanel, Sephora and none of them came close to how reflective this product is.  It is really pretty, but I wouldn&#x27;t dream of wearing this during the day.  It&#x27;s great for a night out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a fabulous highlighter. One that would make my cheekbones glow but will not be obvious or sparkly or, god forbid, glittery. I am happy to report back that I have found my miracle highlighter. The packaging is sleek and luxurious. The product itself is soft and creamy and a little goes a long way, which means that the product will last a long time. It creates a golden glow, not too obvious but definitely impossible to miss. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t look like you applied make up but rather that you have glorious skin. I was psyched to found out Amazon Prime carries NARS and as such I got it 2 days after ordering it. As soon as it arrived, at 10:30 am I applied it and it stayed put, very beautifully put, all-day-long, until the wee hours of the night. I can honestly cannot ask for anything more in a highlighter.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS WORTH THE $$$! It creates an illuminous grow that is not matched by anything else I&#x27;ve EVER tried! Makes my skin looks fresh and dewy. GREAT find!</li>
            <li> Very nice product(Nars Albatross), but very similar to E.L.F blush in Gotta Glow with a huge price difference, will stick to E.L.F.</li>
            <li> Great product if used correctly, however i used a eyeshawdow from the BH cosemetics 88 pallette before purhcasing this and it provides the same effect for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Mine came cracked, which was not a great way to start. This is a shimmery gold on the skin, not white at all. Easy to go overboard, especially when it&#x27;s cracked.</li>
            <li> I like this highlighter.  I use it under my eyebrows, on the inside corner of my eye and the top of my cheekbone.</li>
            <li> I love Nars Products and this is the best highlighter I have ever used. It goes on so smoothly and lasts all day:)</li>
            <li> I prefer highlighters that have a \\&quot;sheen\\&quot; rather than shimmers or flexes of gold/silver.  This has fine gold shimmers or flex in it.  It kind of makes my face look really weird up close (if its too much on your cheeks or down your nose).  It just looks unnatural and not like dewy hydrated skin.  I think it&#x27;s much better for flash photography.  I actually really like the e.l.f. shimmering facial whips as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> This color has crazy shimmer. Not for a novice looking to just highlight. This product practically illuminates the areas it on. does not blend well with bronzers so be aware.</li>
            <li> This is just not my cup of tea. It&#x27;s a super shiny, like, metallic. I couldn&#x27;t get away with wearing even the smallest amount without looking like the Tin Man.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this by mistake because I had one-click ordering set up on my phone and didn&#x27;t realize it.  I had always looked at this when I was in Sephora and wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to spend the $30 on it.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It isn&#x27;t as white as it appears.  It gives a beautiful glow and subtle sheen to the cheeks.  I love to use it on the cheekbones over a blush or bronzer.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for the perfect highlighter.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday! It really is a wonderful highlighter that shows up even though I have very fair skin. It makes your skin glow just enough to look like you are wearing makeup! It also is good for people with sensitive skin because it does not make your skin break out.</li>
            <li> Totally lives up to it&#x27;s hype. It could look super glittery if you did it with a heavy hand, like anything else. Makes my face glow and I use it daily!</li>
            <li> this is the most flattering highlighter I have ever used. It was recommended to me by a Sephora rep and I fell in love with it after applying it in the store. then she told me it wasn&#x27;t in stock.  well thankfully Amazon had it in stock. It&#x27;s just like any other NARS blush in that it is very pigmented, so I recommend using a stipiling or feather brush. it&#x27;s wasy to get a clown face with NARS products. Albatross is great for every skintone. I have dark skin and it looks amazing on me. I love this paired with NARS Exhibit A and Taos blushes.</li>
            <li> It made me break out, so I can&#x27;t even use it :(  The color however, is amazing.  I will give it another shot.</li>
            <li> whoever has anything negative to say about this product obviously doesn&#x27;t know how to use it right. its not for allover your face, and its not supposed to look duey... its a powder.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing something about it on Pinterest.  I love it as a highlighter.  It adds a wonderful golden glow to the tops of my cheekbones or my brow bones without looking white or ashy.</li>
            <li> I love this hightlighter!  Its not glittery, and gives a beautiful sheen that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love NARS products. LOVE THE QUAILITY. This one just arrived today and in one piece :) Thank you so much! a+++</li>
            <li> for whoever out there says bad things about it is because they don&#x27;t know how and where to apply, period. It&#x27;s amazing, amazing, amazing stuff to give you youthful glow.</li>
            <li> fast shipment. came with a nars box and everything. packaged well. would buy again. Now alls i need is to figure out how to contour my cheekbones with it!!!</li>
            <li> great product! love it</li>
            <li> not really a highlighter, more like a white eyeshadow. I think its a little too chalky to be a highlighter.</li>
            <li> As long as you use a primer underneath it works very well. It is translucent but still gives enough glow to look very clean. I love it! Great product. And extremely fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is a darling gold color. I wear it on my upper cheek bone. I have fair skin and it looks great on. I bet it would look great on all skintones too. I am happy I bought this.</li>
            <li> daaaaang. glow for days</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate &amp;#34;any season&amp;#34; highlighter for any (most) skin types, ethnicity, color (ie ivory skin, tan skin, olive skin, medium, etc.). I adore it and am obsessed with shimmer and try most products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for the upper brows, bridge of the nose, cheek bones and chest.</li>
            <li> I like this but I wish it was a little lighter in color. I&#x27;m sooooo fair.</li>
            <li> Yes its expensive but there is nothing else like it! Albatross is great for all skin-tones, (I&#x27;m NW45) it looks intimidating because it is bright white but glides on skin like a golden shimmer. Beautiful for highlighting, brows, eyeshadow, I have even mixed with some of my lip gloss a few times. I&#x27;m a makeup junkie so I have tons and tons of products, but this is the one thing that stays in my everyday makeup bag. Can&#x27;t say it enough how much I love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite highlighter that doesn&#x27;t have glitter in it</li>
            <li> Works exactly like I hoped it would.  Just a touch of light.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about this product because I didn&#x27;t want to look like a shinny gold black Barbie-lol! We&#x27;ll I&#x27;m glad I jumped the fence because it&#x27;s a GREAT highlight blush. A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t over do it. Start off small because you can always apply more, but if you come out the starting gate with too much, you&#x27;re gonna have to remove it and start over OR you will look like a clown all day! This is a good product to have in your makeup collection. Yes, it&#x27;s pricey as hell, but it will last you a LONG time.  I&#x27;m going to purchase more of Nars&#x27; blushes in the future, they have the staying power that I like!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dislike this product for certain occasions, but I don&#x27;t love it for all the time. It has that chunky gold glitter that can go a little dry and it doesn&#x27;t quite produce the most \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; glow for every day; it can look like makeup on the skin in stead of a \\&quot;natural glowing face\\&quot; in certain natural lighting. However, for a glitzy, nighttime occasion it can be nice, and I like it in the corners of my eye. It&#x27;s not a waste, just not what I reach for 24/7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Edit:* I love how other users are marking this review as unhelpful JUST because I was honest... Would you rather I lied and say I think it&#x27;s the best product ever? Get a life, losers.</li>
            <li> ELF has one just like it and I would definetly stay with NARS. sizing is perfect, everything is perfect I love this product and it is amainzing I will buy more</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the hype over this product. I used it to highlight and it just puts this very obvious and weird sheen and reflection on your skin. Just looks odd! Sent it back.</li>
            <li> This highlighter is great for darker skin tones since it has a gold sheen/undertone. Also perfect when used with browns or neutral shades of eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on any of these. I&#x27;ve currently got 4 NARS blush, bronzer &amp; highlighter products. I had 8 to 10 at one point but returned all the others. I currently have Orgasm blush, Deep Throat blush, Laguna bronzer, &amp; Albatross highlighter. I regret buying every NARS product I&#x27;ve ever purchased, including these, as well as their eyeshadows, lip glosses, Multiples &amp; luminizer-type products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NARS blushes are nothing special, &amp; they&#x27;re ridiculously overpriced. They&#x27;re just cheap products in expensive packaging with extremely expensive marketing campaigns behind them. Even Wet n Wild blushes are more pigmented &amp; more finely milled than NARS. Sleek blushes are also far far better than NARS, for a fraction of the price. Beautiful packaging, pigmentation &amp; shades. La Femme blushes are even better, they come in about 40 beautiful shades, are crazily pigmented, and are under $3 each. La Femme blushes are also used by professional makeup artists. That really tells you how good they are. They blow NARS, MAC &amp; every other high end blush out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laguna bronzer is just plain boring, as well as overpriced. Try Fyrinnae&#x27;s matte &amp; shimmer bronzers. They&#x27;re beautiful &amp; cost so much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Albatross highlighter is a god-awful, glittery highlighter with gold specks in it that magnifies pores exponentially. Avoid like the plague. Once again, Fyrinnae to the rescue. They make amazing bronzers, blushes &amp; highlighters. Their highlighters truly give a gorgeous glow, without glitter, frostiness, and without making your pores look cavernous. Phenomenal products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NARS Multiples have been duped by so many companies it&#x27;s ridiculous, and at far lower prices. Try NYX Tango With Bronzing Stix. I have these in Cha Cha With Sun God &amp; Merengue Flush. The second product is more of a light cream stick highlighter/blush. Cha Cha With Sun God is a gorgeous non-orange cream stick bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the list goes on. There simplyis no good reason to buy NARS products. Many are really not very good - try one of their horrifically creasing fat eyeshadow pencils &amp; you&#x27;ll see what I mean - and are easily duped by other companies with much better pigmentation, at much lower prices. For the price of ONE NARS blush you can get approximately 15-18 stunningly amazing La Femme blushes. And you won&#x27;t regret a penny you&#x27;ve spent.</li>
            <li> One of the best highlighters around. Great staying power and provides just enough shine. It may be too white for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> This is very subtle- it doesn&#x27;t give the drastic highlight I was looking for when I purchased it, but it does give a bit of a blur to my skin that is very pretty. I paired this with Orgasm for cheeks and Laguna as a bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fair-medium skinned with blonde hair and light eyes.</li>
            <li> well I will finish the 3rd one soon so  I will  order  it again what ever foundation I  put or powder as soon as I put albatross on my hole face looks amazing</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000PVPEFU NARS Orgasm Blush]]I love Nars blush in Orgasm! I have been using it for the past four years and every time I try something else (Clinique, Tarte, MAC, etc), I always come back to NARS. Orgasm is a beautiful pinky peach with a little shimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t look like a disco ball. I wore it when my hair was blonde and it was fantastic and it looks just as good now that my hair is brown again. I hope that it looks just a good when I switch to red hair - I&#x27;m sure it will! I apply the blush with the MAC 116 blush brush and I get just the right amount of flush - it looks natural, but just brightens up my face. It has good lasting power. I never need to reapply. I have never had problems with it breaking me out or causing irritation, which is saying a lot, because tons of other products have caused issues for me with breakouts. A container of this blush will last you forever, so it&#x27;s worth the price. Sometimes products are raved about and then don&#x27;t deliver, but NARS blush in Orgasm lives up to my expectations. Believe the hype on this one.</li>
            <li> I look like a pixie every time I put this stuff on my face... it&#x27;s just too micro-sparkly for me.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a highlighter for my area under the eyebrows in some shade of white. I happened across this NARS albatross hightlighting blush. Since I had a gift card, I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s really not all that! I would describe it as \\&quot;just ok\\&quot;. If I did not have a gift card, I certainly would NOT pay $28 for it. There are plenty of other products for cheaper that do the same job with the same quality ingredients. In my opinion, it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> awesome highlighter!! LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Let me begin by stating I love NARS. I own Orgasm and Laguna blush and bronzer and use them daily. I was looking for a really sheer nice highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;I got this and wanted to try it immediately. I was at work and grabbed my powder brush from my purse and applied  to my cheeks and forehead. I instantly looked like a corpse. This is a white powder with gold shimmer and made my skin look disgusting. not only did the gold shimmer settle in every crease and pore, my 30 year old face looked 80.&lt;br /&gt;even my fingerprints had gold shimmer accenting each line. You can imagine how bad this would be for someone with less than perfect skin.&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately I had to go into a meeting and my boss asked me if I was feeling well.&lt;br /&gt;I dont know if it was because I looked so pale, or because I was covered in gold glitter.</li>
            <li> Love this as an addition to my creamy blush from Nars also! It adds a little shimmer to my cheeks!</li>
            <li> I love NARS products, but this color is a way glittery and shimmery for my liking. This color would be good for the extremely pale skin tone and doesn&#x27;t work for me on the  way I apply and use my makeup!</li>
            <li> i love it! thank god i got it here rather than pay $40 at Sephora!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and looks like a natural glow. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I love this highlighter great product and worth the price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed I think it works well on most skin tones.</li>
            <li> I love this highlight because its not stark white and its nothing drastic.  It gives me the perfect highlight without looking powdery or chalky.</li>
            <li> The best highlighter I&#x27;ve used! A little pricey for its size but it is worth it! I will continue using it.</li>
