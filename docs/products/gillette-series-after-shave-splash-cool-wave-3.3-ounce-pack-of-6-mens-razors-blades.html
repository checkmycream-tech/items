            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, but obnoxious.</li>
            <li>So glad Amazon sells it (pack of 6) and at a good price too.</li>
            <li>So, this is a win-win on nearly every front - (1) happy wife, (2) smells great, (3) gets the job done, and, (4) is inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very strong for 20 minutes or so</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned in their own reviews, I also love [[ASIN:</li>

            <li>Really works great.</li>
            <li>He get so many compliments on the aftershave splash, but he never tells them what it is.</li>
            <li>what more do you want.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this aftershave.</li>
            <li>I have never smelled an aftershave more revolting than this.</li>
            <li>I cannot count how many compliments I get from both women and men.  </li>
            <li>and I know better than that.</li>
            <li>Nice clean refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, and cool upon putting on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Good light scent with not to much burn.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s to strong and will overpower something else one may want to put on.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean fresh smell to it.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and refreshing and the alcohol content provides a satisfying burn on freshly scraped skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, my wife absolutely loves it as well and, to be honest, she is not the biggest fan of Aqua Velva.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Great after shave for guys such as me who like the sting of alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Millesime Spray 4.0 Oz]] pummeled by a cheap aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I use this I am constantly complimented on how great I smell.</li>
            <li>Always getting complements on the light scent.</li>
            <li>Much more pleasant than many other brands!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a great scent and stays for a long time!</li>
            <li>so I got a 6 pack of the  Cool Wave.  </li>
            <li>but good for public use once you get to where you are going.  </li>
            <li>Unless you want to smell like cheap aftershave for a few hours (albeit a pleasant cheap aftershave), give this one a pass.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many, many types of after-shaves throughout the years, running the entire spectrum of price as well.  </li>
            <li>Super deal on this buy</li>
            <li>This stuff feels great, has a nice amount of burn, and it has just a few, mostly natural ingredients:  Alcohol, Water, Fragrance, PEG-40, and Castor Oil.  </li>
            <li>This new one is a bit stronger and more &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>they not only have it at a cheaper price, I learned about their subscribe and save program and save even more!  </li>
            <li>Glass container, good for traveling as it wont be crushed or spill (if you tape the cap on) by being squeezed in your case.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Fresh line of aftershave they had, which I think is what everyone is referring to when they say Cool Wave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gillette Cool Wave Splash has a fresh, clean masculine scent that is not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes Gillette Series Cool Wave Aftershave Splash.</li>
            <li>really like the Gillette Cool Wave deodorant and was looking for a  equivalent cologne version, but not to be found.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and keeps long..</li>
            <li>B004EHMCJM Tom Ford Grey Vetiver Eau De Parfume Spray for Men, 3.4 Ounce]], Le Labo Rose 31 or [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It has a cool clean masculine smell.</li>
            <li>The older product line of Cool Wave had a scent titled Fresh.</li>
            <li>I had to throw away half a bag of perfectly good potato chips because the clashing smell started making me nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not buy this from Amazon because it was my first time buying it</li>
            <li>It dies instantly and smells great all day long without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Simple OTC scent that is not expensive, pretty easy to find, and gets me a lot of compliments about what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad Gillette realizes there are non-sissy men that are not scared of a little sting in their after shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You wont get charged with sexual harassment just by wearing this (as you might with other obnoxiously powerful aftershaves)...</li>
            <li>about $5 at walmart (not sure why its $29 on here) but a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient  thank you.</li>
            <li>Thanks ..</li>
            <li>Will buy another bulk box again real soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>But I recently bought a Braun 790 electric razor (I am currently training me face) and wanted a nice &amp;#34;stingy&amp;#34; aftershave to sooth my skin.  </li>
            <li>I would love to see their products back at the big box stores at some point.</li>
            <li>The odor is not too strong and not too weak, about moderate and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Nowadays we have too many sissy men using after shave balms, greasy creams or nothing at all because they are scared of a little sting.  </li>
            <li>TO GILLETTE: bring the Fresh line back.</li>
            <li>I hope Gillette makes the other scent available for purchase in a bulk package.  </li>
            <li>I first found this product at the local big-box store years ago and loved it as a more reasonably priced everyday alternative to my husband&#x27;s expensive aftershaves.  </li>
            <li>This new line, while Cool Wave, is not their Fresh scent of the past.</li>
            <li>Price is right , smells like a man, stays long.</li>
            <li>I have used Nivea for the past few years but missed the great smell of Gillette.  </li>
            <li>Cool Wave is made in France, home of the most expensive perfumes in the world.</li>
            <li>far as I&#x27;m concerned that stuff is junk.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had zero benefits to using it.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable for such a quality product.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find the wild rain scent.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it smells like one of my favorite old very expensive French Fragrances, Eau Savage.</li>
            <li>Cool Wave has been my favorite after shave scent for several years and has been difficult to find in my town.</li>
            <li>Considering how expensive so many of these products have become (and that some of them have eliminated aftershave and only offer cologne), we will continue to buy Cool Wave and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>After Shave, Classic Ice Blue - 7 fl oz]]</li>
            <li>This might be all right if it&#x27;s all you wear, but it will overlap with any other fragrance you might wear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving for 40 years and using Cool Wave occasionally for the past two years.</li>
            <li>Nearly every, single time I wear this</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the smell is far too strong for an aftershave.  </li>

            <li> TO GILLETTE: bring the Fresh line back.</li>
            <li> I hope Gillette makes the other scent available for purchase in a bulk package.  </li>
            <li> I first found this product at the local big-box store years ago and loved it as a more reasonably priced everyday alternative to my husband&#x27;s expensive aftershaves.  </li>
            <li> This new line, while Cool Wave, is not their Fresh scent of the past.</li>
            <li> Price is right , smells like a man, stays long.</li>
            <li> I have used Nivea for the past few years but missed the great smell of Gillette.  </li>
            <li> Cool Wave is made in France, home of the most expensive perfumes in the world.</li>
            <li> far as I&#x27;m concerned that stuff is junk.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had zero benefits to using it.</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find the wild rain scent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it smells like one of my favorite old very expensive French Fragrances, Eau Savage.</li>
            <li> Cool Wave has been my favorite after shave scent for several years and has been difficult to find in my town.</li>
            <li> Considering how expensive so many of these products have become (and that some of them have eliminated aftershave and only offer cologne), we will continue to buy Cool Wave and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> After Shave, Classic Ice Blue - 7 fl oz]]</li>
            <li> This might be all right if it&#x27;s all you wear, but it will overlap with any other fragrance you might wear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving for 40 years and using Cool Wave occasionally for the past two years.</li>
            <li> Nearly every, single time I wear this</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the smell is far too strong for an aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Again thank you Gillette for realizing that there are some young men who are old-school shavers who had tough fathers who thought their sons how to shave properly and use a REAL after shave such as Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I mixed this with my old half full bottle of the Eau Savage to make my expensive stuff go farther.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying it as long as Gillette keeps making it.</li>
            <li> so I can  have this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> What kind of sick hoax are the people at gillete trying to pull on us by bottling and selling this?</li>

            <li> No thanks.  </li>
            <li> Why would you put on anything else other than the complementary balm I mentioned.</li>
            <li> Let me put it this way, I&#x27;ve yet to encounter a single lady who does NOT love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if I were picking up on women at a bar, it would be cool, but for anything else, that stuff is like a bad marriage.</li>
            <li> I bought the aftershave and tried it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought the multi-pack, gave a few to some friends and kept the rest for myself.</li>
            <li> Not much more needs to be said.    </li>
            <li> I would pour it down my drain, but it would make my septic tank smell worse.</li>
            <li> Some of the Gillette series aftershaves are hard to find at the store.</li>
            <li> Well duh !</li>
            <li> I get tired of smelling &amp;#34;cool wave&amp;#34; after about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I HAD BEEN UNABLE TO FIND THIS PRODUCT IN THE STORE OF LATE.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you get this.</li>
            <li> and even though they inexplicably switched to a plastic bottle, I still use it.  </li>
            <li> Lunch has become a dred because I smell like &amp;#34;cool wave&amp;#34; kung po chicken.</li>

            <li> I did not buy this from Amazon because it was my first time buying it and I didn&#x27;t want to buy 6 bottles just in case I didn&#x27;t like it. Now I see I should have bought the 6 pack from Amazon. This aftershave is great. It has a nice clean fresh smell to it. It feels nice and soothing on the face. You won&#x27;t be sorry if you get this.</li>
            <li> Cool Wave is made in France, home of the most expensive perfumes in the world. It is considerably more expensive than barbershop aftershaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the perfume designers took off their pantyhose when they made this one. The scent is clean and refreshing and the alcohol content provides a satisfying burn on freshly scraped skin. It is an aftershave for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s bulk pack gives the best price on this product. Period. Don&#x27;t believe it?  Check your local retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving for 40 years and using Cool Wave occasionally for the past two years. I like it. Because it is more than twice as expensive as barbershop products, I&#x27;ve been debating whether or not to make it my regular. That debate is not finished. In the meantime, I appreciate Amazon&#x27;s terrific deal on this product.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this stuff for many years, and it&#x27;s still the best.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell, and not overbearing at all... about $5 at walmart (not sure why its $29 on here) but a good value for the money. Glass container, good for traveling as it wont be crushed or spill (if you tape the cap on) by being squeezed in your case. You wont get charged with sexual harassment just by wearing this (as you might with other obnoxiously powerful aftershaves)... Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many types of after-shaves throughout the years, running the entire spectrum of price as well.  As others have mentioned in their own reviews, I also love [[ASIN:B0000530HU Aqua Velva Cooling After Shave, Classic Ice Blue - 7 fl oz]] and even though they inexplicably switched to a plastic bottle, I still use it.  However one time, when my local shop was out of Aqua Velva, I tried this one.  I loved it and, since then, have used it most of the time.  It feels great going on and it smells outstanding.  Let me put it this way, I&#x27;ve yet to encounter a single lady who does NOT love the smell of this.  Nearly every, single time I wear this, I am always complemented on how great it smells.  Plus, my wife absolutely loves it as well and, to be honest, she is not the biggest fan of Aqua Velva.  So, this is a win-win on nearly every front - (1) happy wife, (2) smells great, (3) gets the job done, and, (4) is inexpensive.  Not much more needs to be said.    Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought the aftershave and tried it for a few days. It burns and smells nice...that&#x27;s about it. Oh yeah, it dries out my face too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, but obnoxious. I get tired of smelling &amp;#34;cool wave&amp;#34; after about 4 hours. I can&#x27;t get the stupid smell out of my hands either. Lunch has become a dred because I smell like &amp;#34;cool wave&amp;#34; kung po chicken. I had to throw away half a bag of perfectly good potato chips because the clashing smell started making me nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I&#x27;m concerned that stuff is junk. I suppose if I were picking up on women at a bar, it would be cool, but for anything else, that stuff is like a bad marriage. So far I&#x27;ve had zero benefits to using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this aftershave for years and it&#x27;s my all time favorite!  I love the smell and the feel.  And so does my wife.  I&#x27;ll keep buying it as long as Gillette keeps making it.</li>
            <li> Gillette just broke the mold with this one, awesome scent which the ladies just love. It&#x27;s so good, I use it as a light cologne. Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes Gillette Series Cool Wave Aftershave Splash. He likes the fragrance and the way it feels on his skin.  Gillette Cool Wave Splash has a fresh, clean masculine scent that is not too overpowering. I think it smells great!     Cool Wave has been my favorite after shave scent for several years and has been difficult to find in my town. So glad Amazon sells it (pack of 6) and at a good price too.</li>
            <li> I HAD BEEN UNABLE TO FIND THIS PRODUCT IN THE STORE OF LATE. GLAD TO SEE AMAZON STILL HAD IT. IT IS A VERY REFRESHING SCENT.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful aftershave.  I have used Nivea for the past few years but missed the great smell of Gillette.  I used to used their aftershave gel until the stores stopped carrying it and I moved on.  But I recently bought a Braun 790 electric razor (I am currently training me face) and wanted a nice &amp;#34;stingy&amp;#34; aftershave to sooth my skin.  I was intrigued by the Rum based aftershaves but didn&#x27;t care for the price.  I saw that Gillette is still on Amazon and went for it.  I wanted an alcohol based aftershave so I got a 6 pack of the  Cool Wave.  I gave my dad and brother in law each a bottle and have been happy ever since.  The smell is very very nice, I get complements.  Its stingy enough to sooth any burn I have but definitely has some conditioner in the mix.  The smell is very strong for 20 minutes or so but good for public use once you get to where you are going.  I would love to see their products back at the big box stores at some point.</li>
            <li> When I got this delivered I totally forgot it was 6 bottles of it and had to figure out who to gift a bottle to since there was enough here to have for the next 10 years! Great scent and not too much either. Super deal on this buy and I am glad to have it on my sink!</li>
            <li> The BEST aftershave EveeeeeeeeeR my gf and me love this product :)</li>
            <li> my husband&#x27;s  favorite and it smells good too! I have it on order so it comes automatically.It&#x27;s very convenient  thank you.</li>
            <li> There are only a couple of aftershaves left on the market. Gillette used to make several varieties, now this is all I can find.  Pacific light was a great product.  Cool Wave is good in both quality and value.  Really works great.</li>
            <li> I order this product for my husband and he loves it. Nice clean refreshing smell. Can not find this product in any stores in our neighborhood. He get so many compliments on the aftershave splash, but he never tells them what it is. Keep stocking this product, I order this all the time.</li>
            <li> Good packing and great product. It came just as in the stores and smells amazing. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Price is right , smells like a man, stays long. what more do you want. would buy again and again</li>
            <li> Great product, I liked and I always use Gillette aftershave.. Nice smell and keeps long..I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. Thanks ..</li>
            <li> Nice scent, and cool upon putting on the skin.  Price is reasonable for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this aftershave. It has a cool clean masculine smell. It cools your face after shaving or works as a great smelling cologne. Some of the Gillette series aftershaves are hard to find at the store. I bought the multi-pack, gave a few to some friends and kept the rest for myself. I wish I could find the wild rain scent. That was a great one too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is foul. Nasty. Think Brut meets sweaty jockstrap. I have never smelled an aftershave more revolting than this. I would pour it down my drain, but it would make my septic tank smell worse. What kind of sick hoax are the people at gillete trying to pull on us by bottling and selling this? They should be tarred and feathered.</li>
            <li> 4 years using it. really good</li>
            <li> Great after shave for guys such as me who like the sting of alcohol.  Smells great and not overpowering.  It also moisturizes my face. I was very happy to buy a bulk of 6 so I can  have this for a long time.  In a world now where you have sissy men who want sissy no-alcohol after shave this Gillette is a great buy.  I&#x27;m very glad Gillette realizes there are non-sissy men that are not scared of a little sting in their after shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that Gillette has another scent but I don&#x27;t see it.  I hope Gillette makes the other scent available for purchase in a bulk package.  Again thank you Gillette for realizing that there are some young men who are old-school shavers who had tough fathers who thought their sons how to shave properly and use a REAL after shave such as Gillette.  Nowadays we have too many sissy men using after shave balms, greasy creams or nothing at all because they are scared of a little sting.  That is shameful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless A GREAT PRODUCT. Thank you Gillette. Will buy another bulk box again real soon.</li>
            <li> A very refreshing aroma along with a soothing feeling at an affordable price! Much more pleasant than many other brands!</li>
            <li> The odor is not too strong and not too weak, about moderate and smells nice. My wife likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Gillette Cool Wave deodorant and was looking for a  equivalent cologne version, but not to be found. So the closest is this aftershave. Very happy and pleased. Would definitely recommend for others.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels great, has a nice amount of burn, and it has just a few, mostly natural ingredients:  Alcohol, Water, Fragrance, PEG-40, and Castor Oil.  Bravo for that.  Unfortunately, the smell is far too strong for an aftershave.  This might be all right if it&#x27;s all you wear, but it will overlap with any other fragrance you might wear.  So prepare to have your [[ASIN:B004EHMCJM Tom Ford Grey Vetiver Eau De Parfume Spray for Men, 3.4 Ounce]], Le Labo Rose 31 or [[ASIN:B000XE64XA Green Irish Tweed By Creed For Men. Millesime Spray 4.0 Oz]] pummeled by a cheap aftershave.  No thanks.  For something that smells great but is suitably light, check [[ASIN:B001N9MJX8 Proraso Dioibarba Aftershave Lotion (Liquid) 100ml/3.4oz]] or Booster Aftershaves (not sold on Amazon), or if you&#x27;re in the mood to treat yourself, get a bottle of Floid (also not sold on Amazon) or even [[ASIN:B000BBEP2M 4711 Cologne for Men By Muelhens After Shave Splash, 3.4-Ounce]].  Unless you want to smell like cheap aftershave for a few hours (albeit a pleasant cheap aftershave), give this one a pass.</li>
            <li> The best smelling aftershave around!  Whenever I use this I am constantly complimented on how great I smell. I work in IT and spend a lot of time bent over people using their mouse and keyboard.  I cannot count how many compliments I get from both women and men.  I now put this on every morning, whether I have shaved or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro Tip: Instead of wiping your hands on a towel when done, rub it on your shirt.  It dies instantly and smells great all day long without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it smells like one of my favorite old very expensive French Fragrances, Eau Savage. As a matter of fact, this is also made in France. There is also an after shave balm in a plastic aquamarine container. One guy, the 3 star guy, mentioned not to use this cause it&#x27;s to strong and will overpower something else one may want to put on. Well duh ! Why would you put on anything else other than the complementary balm I mentioned. I&#x27;m a hillbilly and I know better than that. I mixed this with my old half full bottle of the Eau Savage to make my expensive stuff go farther.</li>
            <li> The older product line of Cool Wave had a scent titled Fresh. This new line, while Cool Wave, is not their Fresh scent of the past. This new one is a bit stronger and more &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Fresh line of aftershave they had, which I think is what everyone is referring to when they say Cool Wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE TO GILLETTE: bring the Fresh line back.</li>
            <li> Still find this the best aftershave. Good light scent with not to much burn. Always getting complements on the light scent.</li>
            <li> I first found this product at the local big-box store years ago and loved it as a more reasonably priced everyday alternative to my husband&#x27;s expensive aftershaves.  We both like the scent a lot and appreciate that it is an aftershave, not the significantly more expensive cologne.  A couple of years ago I checked amazon and they not only have it at a cheaper price, I learned about their subscribe and save program and save even more!  Considering how expensive so many of these products have become (and that some of them have eliminated aftershave and only offer cologne), we will continue to buy Cool Wave and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a great scent and stays for a long time! My most preferred aftershave! One of the best of all time</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I has that nice tingly/burn/cooling effect that I love. I really should stockpile this stuff as it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> Quick ship, good price. Thanks</li>
            <li> Simple OTC scent that is not expensive, pretty easy to find, and gets me a lot of compliments about what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
