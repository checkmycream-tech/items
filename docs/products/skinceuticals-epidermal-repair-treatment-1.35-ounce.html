            <li>My skin feel great after using it.</li>
            <li>and My skin looks amazing!  </li>
            <li>This is a superior healing &amp; repair cream.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>and I noticed how smooth my skin is!!</li>
            <li>My wife used this for 5 days and her skin cleared up amazingly.  </li>
            <li>I have found biafine act to be just as effective, for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>price is a bit of a concern...but either way, the Epidermal Repair Treatment is effective in treating post laser skin, just not for me.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product, and it was great to get it quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many things, and sometimes I don&#x27;t even know what causes my reactions.  </li>
            <li>Within 2 days my breakout was was about 50% better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread easily, better on damp face.</li>
            <li>This product is a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I am glad to report there were no scarring from the treatments</li>
            <li>I found that my gel based Biotherm serum and moisturizer worked much better.</li>
            <li>this is the best moisturizer for dry, damaged, and compromised skin.</li>
            <li>Great skincare routine post Fraxel and a huge improvement on my man made scars, though with Frxel collagen builds for the next 3-6 months so it will get better.  </li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t squeeze a huge amount out.</li>
            <li>HUGE but skin care regimen is doing it all now.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave my face sticky or gummy.</li>
            <li>I would say it is most effective when you apply generously and frequently right after the treatment and the following 2 days.</li>
            <li>This product is recommended by plastic surgeons and is a tremendous price break on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I go through a tube of these creams relatively quickly, so</li>
            <li>It will even feel hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li>it was the OxyClean in my ALL Free and Clear detergent that I washed my pillowcases in.  </li>
            <li>First use took about 1/5 tube or $10+ to cover face.</li>
            <li>In fact, the skin became more irritated and red.  </li>
            <li>I really do like the skinceuticals epidermal repair treatment right after an EMatrix treatment..</li>
            <li>effective and soothing to my new pink skin.  </li>
            <li>It has been very soothing after fraxel</li>
            <li>really like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much it is</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>It really reduced the redness and speed up the healing time.</li>
            <li>Seems very soothing.  </li>
            <li>I just had a very aggressive Fraxel Repair (setting:50) Tuesday</li>
            <li>and it really helps with collagen build.  </li>
            <li>Tried this cream starting 5th day after full face fraxel repair.</li>
            <li>I have used this moisturizer for normally irritated skin and also after fraxel.</li>
            <li>First day wearing seemed to calm down redness.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>, I went back to the Spa and bought a whole tube.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it for mature skin also.</li>
            <li>I used it multiple times a day for the first day and immediately saw result the next morning.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for other skin conditions, or when there&#x27;s less invasive procedure.</li>
            <li>this is a new product for them and it is my second tube.i</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I got laser facial and was left with burn marks again, this time I ordered the real size package and just piled it on.</li>
            <li>This stuff heals like no other.</li>
            <li>And I frequently get itchy, red, blotchy skin with pimple like bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have never spent $50-60 on face cream, but when you find something that works when you are suffering, price doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>And finally 4th day was back to normal.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount and it is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry and sensitive skin.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have used this moisturizer for normally irritated skin and also after fraxel. It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave my face sticky or gummy. It has been very soothing after fraxel and I think helped my skin heal. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have sun screen or fragrance. I have combination skin and can break out so it is too moisturizing for every day, but after any sort of damage-- wind, chlorine-- it is great.</li>
            <li> i use lots of skinceuticals as i think they are the best on the market. this is a new product for them and it is my second tube.i really like it.</li>
            <li> Miracle Cream!  I have extremely dry and sensitive skin.  And I frequently get itchy, red, blotchy skin with pimple like bumps on my face.  (Not acne- allergic reaction hives).  It will even feel hot to the touch.  It looks terrible and feels awful.  I am allergic to many things, and sometimes I don&#x27;t even know what causes my reactions.  My last &amp;#34;breakout&amp;#34; I went to get a soothing facial and the aesthetician recommended this product and gave me a sample.  Wow!  Within 1 day I saw noticeable improvement.  Within 2 days my breakout was was about 50% better.  Within 3 days it was almost all gone.  And finally 4th day was back to normal.  I finally figured out it was the OxyClean in my ALL Free and Clear detergent that I washed my pillowcases in.  My next breakout, again not sure what caused it, I went back to the Spa and bought a whole tube.  I told the lady I don&#x27;t care how much it is, this is the only product that has ever repaired my skin from these irritations.  This time it cleared up totally in 2 days.  I&#x27;m actually thinking of discontinuing using regular moisturizer and only using this.  I have never spent $50-60 on face cream, but when you find something that works when you are suffering, price doesn&#x27;t matter.  I am really shocked to see other posts say this left their skin more irritated, but I guess everyone is different.  For me, it&#x27;s a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This is great for post peels, fraxel, laser. This stuff heals like no other. I&#x27;ve used this for years, &amp; even use it on wounds. This is a superior healing &amp; repair cream.</li>
            <li> Tried this cream starting 5th day after full face fraxel repair. It doesn&#x27;t spread easily, better on damp face. First use took about 1/5 tube or $10+ to cover face. Hard to see what&#x27;s left in tube. Good it has tiny tip so you won&#x27;t squeeze a huge amount out. First day wearing seemed to calm down redness. Second day so-so. Third day, I was back to irritated red so discontinued use. I wanted something that was soothing, helped heal, and took away the red/pink, but this isn&#x27;t it for me. Maybe it works better for other skin conditions, or when there&#x27;s less invasive procedure.</li>
            <li> This product is a favorite of mine. Intended for repair of damaged skin...I use it to offset the drying nature of retin A.</li>
            <li> My wife used this for 5 days and her skin cleared up amazingly.  It&#x27;s pricey but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product, and it was great to get it quickly and efficiently. I would not be without this night cream.</li>
            <li> I used a lot of skinceutical products for years but hands down this is the best moisturizer for dry, damaged, and compromised skin. It only takes a small amount and it is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not soothe my skin after I had a laser treatment.  In fact, the skin became more irritated and red.  I had to discontinue using it.</li>
            <li> I got 2 sample bottles from my dermatologist after a microderm had left me with burn marks. I used it multiple times a day for the first day and immediately saw result the next morning. I saw gradually reduced effects for the following two days after.  It really reduced the redness and speed up the healing time. Nonetheless, I got laser facial and was left with burn marks again, this time I ordered the real size package and just piled it on. I would say it is most effective when you apply generously and frequently right after the treatment and the following 2 days. I am glad to report there were no scarring from the treatments so I believe this product did ultimately help.</li>
            <li> I really do like the skinceuticals epidermal repair treatment right after an EMatrix treatment.. It provided a soothing layer without interfering with the treatment, however the supplier was slow in processing the order and shipping it:(</li>
            <li> This product is recommended by plastic surgeons and is a tremendous price break on Amazon.  If you want to get rid of RED irritated skin - this is the product for you.  It is also a great eye cream.</li>
            <li> Had a facial peel and this is the product I used after having any treatment.  Seems very soothing.  My skin feel great after using it.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as my normal skin care line after a bad bad peel from benzoyl peroxide wash.  It wasn&#x27;t soothing nor did it result in faster repair as promised.  I bought it based on the recommendation of a friend that had similar issues and it worked for her like a charm. Not me.  Guess different skin types react differently. I found that my gel based Biotherm serum and moisturizer worked much better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I dislike the skinceutical epidermal repair treatment, but it is quite a small amount for the price you pay.  I have found biafine act to be just as effective, for a fraction of the cost.  I go through a tube of these creams relatively quickly, so price is a bit of a concern...but either way, the Epidermal Repair Treatment is effective in treating post laser skin, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and it&#x27;s the best product on the market for repairing chapped compromised skin. I would recommend it for mature skin also.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life saver!  I just had a very aggressive Fraxel Repair (setting:50) Tuesday and after I peeled I started using this instead of the horribly greasy one recommended for Faxel post op.  It&#x27;s not oily but def.  effective and soothing to my new pink skin.  I will be using this for weeks along with my Elta MD SPF 46 sunscreen and TNS Essential and C &amp; E cream over my Biofine Topical Emulsion (Rx)  Literally the only product out there of this quality for post any type of skin stress.  A little goes a long way...  Update almost two weeks after Fraxel Repair:  I also recommend vitamin c serum of at least 10% post Fraxel repair.  I am using 30% vitamin c serum and it really helps with collagen build.  I am now using a few other products occasionally.  Perricone MD serum prep as a toner after cleansing my skin with Skin Medica&#x27;s Sensistive Skin Cleanser.  then I apply my vitamin c serum (at night only) then TNS Essential Serum then this Epideral cream.  Great skincare routine post Fraxel and a huge improvement on my man made scars, though with Frxel collagen builds for the next 3-6 months so it will get better.  Message me if you have any questions about Fraxel or the products.  I&#x27;ll be happy to help!   Edit:  It&#x27;s 3/3/17 and My skin looks amazing!  I haven&#x27;t had any procedures done to my skin since Fraxel Repair.  I know the Fraxel was HUGE but skin care regimen is doing it all now.  The TNS Essential Serum is the &#x27;All Star&#x27; but this Epidermal Repair has been right behind it.  For skincare, 75% of my routine is Skinceuticals or SkinMedica...</li>
            <li> I been using the repair treatment for awhile now and I noticed how smooth my skin is!! I recommend this product after you had a chemical peel done.</li>
