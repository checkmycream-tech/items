            <li>and with better deal.</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>This brush makes my concealer full coverage, it also defuses the product into the skin better!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely PERFECT for concealer under the eyes, around the nose or pretty much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft ( as all sigma brushes are) and a great brush for blending under eye concealer or eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I also use it for blemishes or any slight skin imperfections and it works wonderfully on that as well.</li>
            <li>once i had it and used it, OMG, excellent to covert with powder and sell concealer in the under eye area, to fill every little line and detail in your face</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for blending cream shadows to blend and smooth out the edges.  </li>
            <li>you want precise detail</li>
            <li>i would definitely recommend it for anyone, i myself have an oily t-zone &amp; this works great in those areas.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brush!</li>
            <li>and I love that this brush mimics exactly that.</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much !</li>
            <li>So easy to clean and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Sigma Precision Round - P82 is very good.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, and wash nicely.</li>
            <li>Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors.</li>
            <li>The Sigma brushes are very soft and cute.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush, I use it for concealer everyday and it blends it in so amazingly.</li>
            <li>Worth spending the money.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment.</li>
            <li>Second, when I opened up the packaging the first thing I noticed about the brush was how nice and sleek it looked.</li>
            <li>Its really great for small areas</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and have them in in the performance eyes kit and the mr bunny essential sigma max kit.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.</li>
            <li>, I love it, don&#x27;t use it often enough for some reason.</li>
            <li>A lot cheaper than Mac brushes but same or better quality.</li>
            <li>Would buy more of the same brand.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>good little brush!</li>
            <li>I like Sigma brushes and have three of the large Kabuki brushes that I use and adore.  </li>
            <li>Within a week of ordering I received it, the shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>The Sigma P82 is an absolute must for under eye concealing.</li>
            <li>The head is tiny but super dense,</li>
            <li>but it is too big and stiff to do a good job of it.  </li>
            <li>were the big brushes like kabukis cant go and deliver powder this really does.</li>
            <li>It is also so soft and doesn&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li>When I touched it, I noticed how soft and dense (but not harsh dense)</li>
            <li>The bristle are very concentrated and I have not had any fall out even with regular washing.</li>
            <li>First of all, the package came faster than I had expected!</li>
            <li>Feels exactly like using my pinky finger to apply primer or blend eyeshadows, except without the mess left on my hands afterwards.</li>
            <li>I use it to apply my concelaer and it really helps cover my dark under eye circles !</li>
            <li>A tad expensive in my opinion for such a small brush, but Sigma brushes are easy to clean and last a long time without any shedding</li>

            <li> This is one of my favorite brushes.  It acts like almost an eraser.  I use it primarily for blending cream shadows to blend and smooth out the edges.  Really love it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my order. Within a week of ordering I received it, the shipping was extremely fast. The brush was nicely packaged and none of the bristles were damaged.

            <li> When i ordered this brush i wasnt totally convinced to buy it, but once i had it and used it, OMG, excellent to covert with powder and sell concealer in the under eye area, to fill every little line and detail in your face were the big brushes like kabukis cant go and deliver powder this really does.</li>
            <li> A really great and easy to use multitasking face tool. It can be used for foundation, setting, concealer, eye makeup, or whatever your needs are. Worth spending the money. The bristles are soft, and wash nicely.</li>

            <li> This Sigma P82 brush is great for blending on the lid. The head is tiny but super dense, so &amp;#34;fingertip-like application&amp;#34; is 100% correct! Feels exactly like using my pinky finger to apply primer or blend eyeshadows, except without the mess left on my hands afterwards. A tad expensive in my opinion for such a small brush, but Sigma brushes are easy to clean and last a long time without any shedding so it&#x27;s definitely worth the splurge.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try these precision brushes and through reccomendations from youtube I decided to start with this one. I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s so soft ( as all sigma brushes are) and a great brush for blending under eye concealer or eyeshadow. I like it alot and will be ordering the rest of the set!! Thank you sigma for another great brush to add to my collection!! ( which is all sigma by the way) lol.</li>
            <li> Excellent for eyeshadows and/ or concealers. Great Quality. A lot cheaper than Mac brushes but same or better quality. Would buy more of the same brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift for my wife which  works as a make-up master and she was very satisfied to use sigma brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought from themm before this is a great product as always!!!!!!!!!!!!...i love sigma!ands will definitely be purchasing from them again</li>

            <li> i absolutely LOVED this brush, it work GREAT as a concealer or a powder brush around the eyes &amp; around the nose... in the harder to reach areas. i would definitely recommend it for anyone, i myself have an oily t-zone &amp; this works great in those areas.</li>
            <li> OH MY GOSH&lt;br /&gt;This brush is the best! First of all, the package came faster than I had expected! When I got it, it was in a box. I liked that because I knew it was taken good care of. Second, when I opened up the packaging the first thing I noticed about the brush was how nice and sleek it looked. When I touched it, I noticed how soft and dense (but not harsh dense) It&#x27;s absolutely PERFECT for concealer under the eyes, around the nose or pretty much any where! If you&#x27;re looking for something to purchase here on amazon, BUY THIS BRUSH!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it regularly to blend concealer in my eye area and on acne spots around my face. The bristle are very concentrated and I have not had any fall out even with regular washing. I love the Sigma brushes.</li>

            <li> I typically use my finger to blend concealer under my eyes but once I got this brush I use it all of the time now! I love how soft Sigma brushes they blend incredibly well!!</li>
            <li> I like Sigma brushes and have three of the large Kabuki brushes that I use and adore.  But I&#x27;m not sure what this one is meant to be used for.  I bought it to blend/apply cream eyeshadow but it is too big and stiff to do a good job of it.  It is also too stiff to apply concealer especially around the eye area -- too much tugging on the skin.  So unless there is another use I am not thinking of, I recommend passing on this brush!</li>
