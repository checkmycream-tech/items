            <li>It smells great and always leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Great for styling natural hair.</li>
            <li>I really like it and it smell good</li>
            <li>I spray it onto my hands and gently apply that way so I can feel the coverage, putting a fair amount on the ends.</li>
            <li>I love this spray, such a great quality for price</li>
            <li>strong flowery perfume smell.</li>
            <li>Far superior to most hair products I have used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time on Sunday and my hair was immediately looking awesome, it was super soft, silky, hydrated and the ends of my hair look</li>
            <li>This product is awesome when you are trying to repair your hair from previous damage and breakage.</li>
            <li>It makes it feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I spray it in my hait after I shower and it leaves it tangle free and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I woke up this morning with no frizz,and it stayed that way all day in very humid weather.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been softer, smoother, healthier, and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Very Light oil without all the heaviness, i used it on my hair and skin in addition to other products, smells great.</li>
            <li>very good product, really good repair broken or damaged hair by hair dye, rich smell of coconut and shines, recommended</li>
            <li>and i was so excited.</li>
            <li>It also looks very shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have very fine curly hair and live by the ocean.</li>
            <li>Probably if most consumers buy something that doesn&#x27;t have a scent, they&#x27;re more likely to believe it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It will not weigh your hair down and will protect it and give it great sheen.</li>
            <li>For me, this product smells too much like cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>so im always on the hunt for a product that will help make my hair fresh.</li>
            <li>Almost no hold, but my hair is so soft and light and I am constantly complimented on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>Good to put on dry or wet hair (preferred wet hair) and smells great!</li>
            <li>non that I can think of right now</li>
            <li>granted, if you are someone who sprays 5 sprays of perfume on them before they leave the house this may not bother you, but if you are a normal person or don&#x27;t prefer cheap selling perfume you might want to take a whiff of this in a store before you order it online.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I had used the dry oil from this brand and liked the results, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot.</li>
            <li>and it helps a lot with the dryness and makes my curls pretty again instead of frizzy</li>
            <li>It feels so light going on as well, not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>First I put a pea size of keratherapy in my hair.</li>
            <li>Since I use several products, I wasn&#x27;t sure which one it was.</li>
            <li>and I have really seen a difference in my hair with this product!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t appear oily at all, so you can use as much as you&#x27;d like!</li>
            <li>It smells really good, it really does make your hair shiny, soft, and it literally made my hair look like the models out of a shampoo commercial.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived with several other products and  What a great product.</li>
            <li>Although it probably is possible to get carried away and put on too much, it&#x27;s a very light formula, so not excessively greasy at all.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very dry/damaged during the winter months.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to protect much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Too much keratin can cause dryness as a warning to ladies.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>love the smell, don&#x27;t know about its effectiveness as I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a month and my hair is natural.</li>
            <li>each item was individually wrapped which was a good thing due to one of the four leaking.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair shiny and soft ,,but the bright shine doesn&#x27;t last for long</li>
            <li>I would suggest to tape the top of the bottles due to them coming lose on shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>The instructions are small but readable but what an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the one thing that has worked on my fine, dry, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>Likes: lightweight, non-greasy, pretty coconut/ vanilla scent, adds lost of shine, makes my frizzy hair so soft and defines my curls, lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:</li>
            <li>To be honest, I had tried a lot of products, expensive and cheap ones</li>
            <li>and they did some decent job</li>
            <li>I like stronger smells actually, but can add some essential oil to make the smell stronger. :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why nearly every beauty product you buy at one of the large pharmacy chains has to contain an overload of fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>like it way better than any of the Frizz*Ease serums that just feel heavy and kinda gloopy.</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant because it is a thicker oil than the dry oil, but my fears were quickly allayed when I realised that it didn&#x27;t weight my hair down or make it excessively more oily than regular.</li>
            <li>Last night was the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I could hardly believe how much better my hair felt after using this product.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, is a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so soft, i couldnt believe it.</li>
            <li>It makes it feel so soft, hydrated and shiny.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I would recommend spraying it into your hands and then just running it through your hair, because if you spray it directly on your hair it may make it look greasy.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s key to not put too much on, otherwise you will feel greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown a little coarse as I&#x27;ve gotten older and this does give my long, frequently hot-ironed hair more softness, and a hint of sheen.</li>
            <li>Being african american woman we both decided to go natural.  </li>
            <li>After one use my extremely dry colored hair was soft and silky!</li>

            <li> This product makes my hair so soft, i couldnt believe it.</li>
            <li> It makes it feel so soft, hydrated and shiny.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I would recommend spraying it into your hands and then just running it through your hair, because if you spray it directly on your hair it may make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s key to not put too much on, otherwise you will feel greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown a little coarse as I&#x27;ve gotten older and this does give my long, frequently hot-ironed hair more softness, and a hint of sheen.</li>
            <li> Being african american woman we both decided to go natural.  </li>
            <li> After one use my extremely dry colored hair was soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I spay this on before I use my flat iron to protect my hair from the heat.</li>
            <li> and I went over it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I put this on the ends of 2nd day hair, when its knotty and just feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I use while hair is damp or dry to give instant shine and softness.</li>
            <li> I spray a tiny bit of it on my wet hair after I get out of the shower, and then again after it&#x27;s become just damp</li>
            <li> My daughter has long curly hair</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this and other Organix products.</li>
            <li> I have had some chemical processes done on my hair like keratin blow dry</li>
            <li> I let it dry a bit.</li>
            <li> I had just dyed my hair and it was soo dry, and then I tried this.</li>
            <li> BUT I cannot get past the old lady</li>
            <li> I had very dry hair since moving to a dry climate and this has repaired my hair so that I don&#x27;t have to cut it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s managed to create any long term benefits, but it definitely works at protecting my hair from combing and styling, and with curly, prone-to-knotting hair, that&#x27;s all I can ask.</li>
            <li> which has been a problem with all other products..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate because it works really well.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all or make it oily either.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh down my hair or make it greasy looking.</li>
            <li> It has  moisturized and given my hair shine without weighing it down</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that I blow dry</li>
            <li> I spray a little into my hair in the morning</li>

            <li> Does not smooth or moisturize my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil a few times since I have ordered it</li>
            <li> I use Organix Morrocccan Argan Oil in my damp hair after a shower and then use this Keratin oil before styling once my hair is dried.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>

            <li> and it says to style your hair as usual; however, my hair smelled burnt when I flat-ironed it with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hair was thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair was shedding horribly, but using this daily has enhanced the shine and less breakage.</li>

            <li> I have very fine curly hair and live by the ocean. I spend a lot of time diving and in the sun, and my hair gets severely dried out and damaged. The keratin oil has done wonders for me. I spray a little into my hair in the morning and then anytime I&#x27;ve been in the water and it helps a lot with the dryness and makes my curls pretty again instead of frizzy and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all or make it oily either. I definitely recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also LOVE the shampoo and conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> I spay this on before I use my flat iron to protect my hair from the heat. It makes it feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Das Produkt ist top! Es lohnt sich jeder investierte Cent!</li>
            <li> I have bleached blonde hair. Does not smooth or moisturize my hair at all. And the smell is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It smells great and always leaves my hair soft and manageable. It feels so light going on as well, not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I really like it and it smell good</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have used many organix products before but i saw they recently released the keratin oil line and i was so excited. I picked up this oil after i ran out of the moroccan argan oil one. This product makes my hair so soft, i couldnt believe it. I only wash my hair every 2 to 3 days so im always on the hunt for a product that will help make my hair fresh. I put this on the ends of 2nd day hair, when its knotty and just feeling dry. It makes it feel so soft, hydrated and shiny. I have problems with brittle ends and this also makes those brittle parts feel stronger. I would definetly suggest picking up this product and giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Has a lovely scent! I am pleased with the output of this product. It leaves my hair soft and shiny. I have thick, curly hair that I blow dry and it&#x27;s very dry/damaged during the winter months. This product leaves it feeling so soft, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff! My hair has grown a little coarse as I&#x27;ve gotten older and this does give my long, frequently hot-ironed hair more softness, and a hint of sheen. Although it probably is possible to get carried away and put on too much, it&#x27;s a very light formula, so not excessively greasy at all. I spray it onto my hands and gently apply that way so I can feel the coverage, putting a fair amount on the ends.</li>
            <li> Very Light oil without all the heaviness, i used it on my hair and skin in addition to other products, smells great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on amazon after buying the anti-breakage keratin oil conditioner at a walgreens. I absolutely love this product. I spray it in my hait after I shower and it leaves it tangle free and frizz free. Product shipped and arrived in a timely manner. I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> very good product, really good repair broken or damaged hair by hair dye, rich smell of coconut and shines, recommended</li>
            <li> I have had some chemical processes done on my hair like keratin blow dry and my hair has gotten kind of fried at the ends. My hair looked like straw on the ends and had a lot of split ends. I got my split ends removed and decided to buy something to truly fix my hair so I got one of this at the drugstore. To be honest, I had tried a lot of products, expensive and cheap ones and they did some decent job but nothing quite as this healing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time on Sunday and my hair was immediately looking awesome, it was super soft, silky, hydrated and the ends of my hair look so healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this 100% to anybody who has hair issues or want to have your hair feeling awesome all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve gotten this stuff. It smells really good, it really does make your hair shiny, soft, and it literally made my hair look like the models out of a shampoo commercial. I would recommend spraying it into your hands and then just running it through your hair, because if you spray it directly on your hair it may make it look greasy. Over all I would definitely recommend this product. It could be a nice gift too.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work. Last night was the first time I used it. I can honestly say I woke up this morning with no frizz,and it stayed that way all day in very humid weather. First I put a pea size of keratherapy in my hair. I let it dry a bit. Then add the keratin oil. I don&#x27;t spray it in my hair, but in the palms of my hands, then run it through my hair. It&#x27;s soft and pretty. Smells really good.</li>
            <li> This product works great. It eliminates the appearance of frizz and flyaways perfectly...BUT I cannot get past the old lady strong flowery perfume smell. It&#x27;s so awful that I cannot use it. I should have listened to the reviews saying the same thing. It&#x27;s unfortunate because it works really well.</li>
            <li> When I saw my daughter&#x27;s hair I had to know what she was using. Being african american woman we both decided to go natural.  She blow dryed her hair and I went over it with a flat iron. I couldn&#x27;t believe how Silky, Shiny and Bouncy her hair had becomed. It truly looked like Silk! I only wish Amazon would allow you to post pictures. I would show the before and after pics!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I bought it because I had used the dry oil from this brand and liked the results, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot. At first I was hesitant because it is a thicker oil than the dry oil, but my fears were quickly allayed when I realised that it didn&#x27;t weight my hair down or make it excessively more oily than regular. I spray a tiny bit of it on my wet hair after I get out of the shower, and then again after it&#x27;s become just damp and I&#x27;m beginning to style it. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s managed to create any long term benefits, but it definitely works at protecting my hair from combing and styling, and with curly, prone-to-knotting hair, that&#x27;s all I can ask.</li>
            <li> This spray works better than ANY salon brand!  I could hardly believe how much better my hair felt after using this product.  It smells so good.  This will definitely be a staple in my hair care regimen.  I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Feels good on my hair</li>
            <li> Works well.  My hair likes it.  :)</li>
            <li> it makes my hair shiny and soft ,,but the bright shine doesn&#x27;t last for long and that&#x27;s it nthing more I saw</li>
            <li> This product is awesome when you are trying to repair your hair from previous damage and breakage. Of course you will need a trim.....NOT A CUT....but a trim. It will not weigh your hair down and will protect it and give it great sheen. Good to put on dry or wet hair (preferred wet hair) and smells great!</li>
            <li> I think the product works and it says to style your hair as usual; however, my hair smelled burnt when I flat-ironed it with the product. Since I use several products, I wasn&#x27;t sure which one it was. I purchased it 3x before I figured out that this product was causing my hair to smell.</li>
            <li> Nice to use if you want to wear your hair wavy.</li>
            <li> Worked very nice for my hair. Was having problems with breakage and I have really seen a difference in my hair with this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for me and my 3 daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I cnt tell what it did to my hair as yet as i only use it 2ce but i like the smell not tooooo oily, will update later on</li>
            <li> I have used this oil a few times since I have ordered it and I am very pleased! It does not weigh down my hair or make it greasy looking. It is very lightweight and makes my hair soft. It also looks very shiny and healthy. Organix is a very good brand of hair products. I use Organix Morrocccan Argan Oil in my damp hair after a shower and then use this Keratin oil before styling once my hair is dried. I would definitely recommend this and other Organix products. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> For me, this product smells too much like cheap perfume.I don&#x27;t understand why nearly every beauty product you buy at one of the large pharmacy chains has to contain an overload of fragrance. Have the product developers &#x27;discovered&#x27; a correlation between fragrance and consumer satisfaction? Probably if most consumers buy something that doesn&#x27;t have a scent, they&#x27;re more likely to believe it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Likes: lightweight, non-greasy, pretty coconut/ vanilla scent, adds lost of shine, makes my frizzy hair so soft and defines my curls, lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes: non that I can think of right now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it way better than any of the Frizz*Ease serums that just feel heavy and kinda gloopy. It just makes my hair look and feel really healthy.</li>
            <li> This product works really well and smells amazing!  I use it almost everyday. It&#x27;s definitely a bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. I love the light weight, Love the smell and the shine and smoothness of my hair</li>
            <li> Smells good, is a little smaller than I expected but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I have used products by this brand before and always found the product effective and the smells pleasant and light (like the coconut milk ones for instance). I bought this oil to repair my damaged sun &amp; salt hair and didn&#x27;t even think about the scent until I had it in my hand at home. I sprayed a couple of sprays and was in shock. It smells like I sprayed perfume in my hand and the smell is like the cheapest, worst scent you could buy at the $1 and under stores. I decided to try a few sprays anyway and when I walked in the room with my husband he was like what is that horrible perfume smell and I was like oh man, I know! And I just now had to shower to get it out of my hair because it was giving me a headache after 5 minutes. granted, if you are someone who sprays 5 sprays of perfume on them before they leave the house this may not bother you, but if you are a normal person or don&#x27;t prefer cheap selling perfume you might want to take a whiff of this in a store before you order it online. Love the brand, but this one is a miss.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hair was thick and frizzy. No keratin shampoo ever made my hair as shiny as this stuff makes it. Also the stuff smells soo good!</li>
            <li> This is amazing. After one use my extremely dry colored hair was soft and silky! Also, it&#x27;s key to not put too much on, otherwise you will feel greasy. But just two or three squirts worked for all of my hair and it was divine. Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It&#x27;s the one thing that has worked on my fine, dry, color treated hair. It has  moisturized and given my hair shine without weighing it down which has been a problem with all other products..</li>
            <li> I like it. giving nice results&lt;br /&gt;I will order another one soon</li>
            <li> Like the smell. Seems to make my hair frizzier. Doesn&#x27;t seem to protect much. Definitley don&#x27;t see the hype. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.. For curly hair</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says.  I had very dry hair since moving to a dry climate and this has repaired my hair so that I don&#x27;t have to cut it.  The instructions are small but readable but what an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived with several other products and  What a great product.</li>
            <li> love the smell, don&#x27;t know about its effectiveness as I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a month and my hair is natural. Will follow up, if another is ordered. Received product as displayed. thanks!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Product smells wonderful and makes my hair shine. My bangs had been breaking- I use while hair is damp or dry to give instant shine and softness.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t take the smell. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> This is a great value.</li>
            <li> This removes tangles. It will take longer than I have had the product to see if it reduces breakage, but I do like the fact that it does remove tangles. I will likely purchase this again because I like the ingredients (organic), the price and it doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily. Too much keratin can cause dryness as a warning to ladies. Argan oil (in this product) can counter this. It smells nice (mild). I like stronger smells actually, but can add some essential oil to make the smell stronger. :)</li>
            <li> Great for styling natural hair. It leaves your hair looking  nice and shiny without being oily.Also great on a hot / humid day for keeping the friz away.</li>
            <li> I love this spray, such a great quality for price</li>
            <li> Great product.. My hair was shedding horribly, but using this daily has enhanced the shine and less breakage. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works excellent with the shampoo and conditioner, but it also is amazing on its own. I had just dyed my hair and it was soo dry, and then I tried this. It is literally a miracle. My hair has never been softer, smoother, healthier, and frizz free. It also doesn&#x27;t appear oily at all, so you can use as much as you&#x27;d like! And it smells divine. Definitely try out this product.</li>
            <li> Far superior to most hair products I have used. Almost no hold, but my hair is so soft and light and I am constantly complimented on how good I smell. I have not shampooed my hair in over 2 years and this stuff  keeps it perfect.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. works as promised.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. I bought 4 of these items. each item was individually wrapped which was a good thing due to one of the four leaking. I would suggest to tape the top of the bottles due to them coming lose on shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other then that the product works great. My daughter has long curly hair she has mixed hair and i use this along with mixed chicks leave in conditioning and her hair stays hydrated and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Sprayer works...no noticeable benefit.</li>
            <li> great product exactly as ordered thank you</li>
