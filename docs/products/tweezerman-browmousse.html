            <li>Tweezerman&#x27;s works so amazingly well, just like their splinter tweezers!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>It is costly, but a nice product!  </li>
            <li>Beautifully groomed and tidy results.</li>
            <li>They worked good but doesn&#x27;t seem like there is a ton in the tube</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my eyebrows look!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 10+ years and love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Keeps brows in place and nicely groomed.</li>
            <li>kind of crunchy.</li>
            <li>Yep, it works and is nice for the price.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best brow tamer out there.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brow mousse.  </li>
            <li>I love Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brow mousse after my tinted brow wax and brow powder and it keeps my brows in place much better than just my wax.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Could the applicator be better?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I found this.  </li>
            <li>so i settled for elf brow gel, which was ok for the price, but sometimes flakes at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>:) this is now a must-have for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it&#x27;s a mousse, it&#x27;s also a bit thicker, and it seems to give a bit more volume to your brows.  </li>
            <li>hint if you have bangs is to be sure to pull your bangs aside until the mousse sets/dries.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li>This product is just okay to me.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not tented I have to spend more time blending my brow powder before setting it with the brow gel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake like most</li>
            <li>Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this as my eyebrows grow downwards.</li>
            <li>I have used this brow mousse for several years, and it&#x27;s the best for taming my brows without clumping them.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, just feels</li>
            <li>Better than any gel or mousse I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it was made of but should have been a more durable material.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is a reputable product and would advise others to try it for themselves.</li>
            <li>Love everything about this product.</li>
            <li>I use this product on a daily basis and it is awesome.</li>
            <li>I love everything about it.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many ways to just keep them where I want them.  </li>
            <li>Having used Anastasia products for many years I was a bit sceptical about the quality of the Tweezerman Brow Mousse.</li>
            <li>I love this product....</li>
            <li>Works better than any brow mousse I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this gel held better.  </li>
            <li>I have brown and gray in my eyebrows and would like to be able to hide the gray with it.</li>
            <li>It just left my brows clean, neat, natural-looking, and in perfect place all day.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, though, it doesn&#x27;t start flaking mid-way through the day.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s applicator is easy.</li>
            <li>I love the Benefit Gimmie Brow, because it&#x27;s tented and works super well.</li>
            <li>Just a light swipe on each brow helps keep them looking neatily groomed.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product goes on light.</li>
            <li>I think the brownmousse is fabulous; I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Eyebrows are so important because they frame your face.</li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly and hold my eyebrow hair in place.</li>
            <li>This mousse goes on smoothly with the applicator brush and does not flake unless applied in excess.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a light, natural hold, this brow mousse is a good bet.</li>
            <li>I love the applicator and packaging of this product; it holds just the right amount of brow gel.</li>
            <li>Based on positive reviews from others, I expected it to be an excellent product.</li>
            <li>It helps shape for a clean look and keep in place without flaking, etc.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman gives them lift, holds the brow hairs in place all day, and provides a clean finished look.</li>
            <li>Based on the positive reviews I read here and elsewhere, I decided to give this Tweezerman Brow Mousse a try, and I&#x27;m really glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holds brows in place and drys clear, what more could you want?!</li>
            <li>I really like it, if you have heavier eyebrows (thicker hair) and need something more substantial</li>
            <li>give this one a try if you&#x27;re searching for a nice, clear brow gel.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t an absolute &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; like I wanted, but it does work better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>I am cursed/blessed (depending on who you ask) with full, dark brown eyebrows that more often than not seem to have a mind of their own.</li>
            <li>The new one is more the size of mascara</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s EXACTLY what I needed, and everything it advertises to be!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as I&#x27;d hoped, this gel brushes and sets my brows - keeping them in place until I clean my makeup off.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the money in my opinion, I cant stand when my eyebrows get out of place.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brow gels, but always come back to this one because it is the best.  </li>
            <li>I have bushy eyebrows, and these do a good job of keeping them down.  </li>
            <li>Love the look, and the thin clean packaging design fits in with the other items in my makeup bag perfectly.</li>
            <li>After reading amazon review of various products, the Tweezerman mousse seemed like a good combination of value and quality, and has thus far lived up to that expectation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I was able to find it online since it&#x27;s not available in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>I like Brow Mousse very much, but I have never used another product like this so have no point of comparison.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This holds my eyebrows almost exactly like</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a product like this, so didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried cheap drugstore clear mascaras, hairspray, gel, wax...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>Love it and it is the only brand that doesn&#x27;t flake!</li>
            <li>I always color my eyebrows first then apply the mousse, so I have no idea</li>
            <li>I love it so much, definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute necessity in my cosmetics bag!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Brow Mousse for 1 week and can say that I LOVE this product and will not go back to Anastasia!</li>
            <li>fill in my eyebrows with a pen first, and then brush in the mousse --</li>
            <li>No flaky business, no crusty residue (eww), totally undetectable and removes easily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Blessed with thick brows, I&#x27;ve loved this gel since I first tried it.</li>
            <li>I really like this brow mousse.  </li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>eyebrow hair didn&#x27;t really stay in places when applied.</li>
            <li>For $9, I was hoping for more than making my eyebrow hair feeling wet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m very please with this product  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it is not supposed to - really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>Well it doesnt provide thag much hold as it says so</li>
            <li>However, it does keep them in place very well when I use it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a chance to really evaluate the product itself since the case was so inferior/poorly designed that it smashed into pieces when it fell off the sink onto the floor.</li>
            <li>It is a very neutral color and not noticeable at all.</li>
            <li>Very disapointing.</li>
            <li>I really likes this a lot.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for absolutely rigid, immobile brows, this is is not for you.</li>
            <li>I have ordered others that are more affordable, and will probably stay with them, due to the price.</li>
            <li>gel like consistency (much like Maybelline&#x27;s clear mascara, but even lighter)&lt;br /&gt;*I found that it needs to be coaxed out of the tube the first couple of uses</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the Maybelline great lash clear mascara for lashes and brows - twice as much product, half the cost and a clear tube, so you&#x27;re actually getting the product your paying for.  </li>
            <li>The older I get, the wilder my eyebrows get.  </li>
            <li>I have used so many different products over the years and this is the only product that has these features:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>(As I&#x27;ve gotten older my brows have thinned out some, so this helps define what i have.  </li>
            <li>The brush is generous and the product itself is very light, giving my brows just a little assistance in maintaining a defined shape without gooping them up.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It has no scent, is not thick and is colorless.  </li>
            <li>I normally use a tinted wax to keep my brows in place.</li>
            <li>While I preferred the Anastasia product of the three, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the price when I ran out of a recent tube.  </li>
            <li>The new wand seems a little more sturdy, and I like that.</li>
            <li>This is my new eyebrow control \\&quot;weapon\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new, bc</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product several times, but really don&#x27;t see much of a difference in the appearance of my brows.</li>
            <li>My lineage is pretty mixed, my mother is Filipino and my father is descended from German/Norwegian immigrants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>mouse does exactly what I need without binding the hairs together forcing a the look of a solid line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve repurchased this several times since my first purchase about 2 yrs ago.</li>
            <li>This is the first time something has actually worked for me and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I had to glop it on and smooth my hairs down with my finger.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even smooth them down.  </li>
            <li>It is a clear mousse that is applied with a brush applicator (built into the tube, like a mascara wand).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several brow gels, from the grocery store Covergirl clear gel to a Tart cosmetics product to the very pricy Anastasia brow products.  </li>
            <li>It is a clear gel like stuff that you brush on your brows.</li>
            <li>After application with the built-in applicator, I use a regular brow brush to fine-tune my brows and really distribute the mousse evenly...works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>, then I use this brow mousse over them and it keeps my brows looking natural and not angled/square shaped.</li>
            <li>(Revlon is cheaper, but doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well).</li>
            <li>not bother sensitive eyes&lt;</li>
            <li>My brows have to be filled in from years of uneven waxing.  </li>
            <li>Keeps brows in place, and not really heavy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different types of brow shapers and this comes closest to getting it right.  </li>
            <li>I used this to keep my super long brows in their proper place after applying all my makeup.</li>
            <li>I have tried several brow taming products, I even went as far as using my hair gel on an old toothbrush!!  </li>
            <li>My brows go wherever they want, some hairs straight down, some straight up.</li>
            <li>I try not to do too much in the ways of plucking or trimming; I pluck strays and sometimes I&#x27;ll trim a long hair.</li>
            <li>I feel pretty cheated out of the money I spent.</li>
            <li>There is no flaking, my eyebrows don&#x27;t feel hard, and it washs off as easy at it goes on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again but would wait for it to be majorly discounted before I did.</li>
            <li>My second purchase and part of my make-up routine; keeps brows in place.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are not thick or long.</li>
            <li>Personally, I like the old wand that came with this.</li>
            <li>This is the most I&#x27;ve ever spent on a brow product; in the past, I&#x27;ve always bought drugstore brands that have started flaking and leaving a white residue by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I do have to be somewhat image-conscious with my job, and a few seconds applying these each morning help me look a little more put-together.</li>
            <li>I like this product as it really does tame those wild eyebrow hairs that we get from time to time.</li>
            <li>Barely goes on my brows because the brush is too big.</li>
            <li>It really helps to keep those stray eyebrows in place all day long, without caking or flaking, as I have found with some other products.</li>

            <li> :) this is now a must-have for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it&#x27;s a mousse, it&#x27;s also a bit thicker, and it seems to give a bit more volume to your brows.  </li>
            <li> hint if you have bangs is to be sure to pull your bangs aside until the mousse sets/dries.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li> This product is just okay to me.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not tented I have to spend more time blending my brow powder before setting it with the brow gel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake like most</li>
            <li> Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this as my eyebrows grow downwards.</li>
            <li> I have used this brow mousse for several years, and it&#x27;s the best for taming my brows without clumping them.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, just feels</li>
            <li> Better than any gel or mousse I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it was made of but should have been a more durable material.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is a reputable product and would advise others to try it for themselves.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product on a daily basis and it is awesome.</li>
            <li> I love everything about it.</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many ways to just keep them where I want them.  </li>
            <li> Having used Anastasia products for many years I was a bit sceptical about the quality of the Tweezerman Brow Mousse.</li>
            <li> I love this product....</li>
            <li> Works better than any brow mousse I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this gel held better.  </li>
            <li> I have brown and gray in my eyebrows and would like to be able to hide the gray with it.</li>
            <li> It just left my brows clean, neat, natural-looking, and in perfect place all day.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, though, it doesn&#x27;t start flaking mid-way through the day.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s applicator is easy.</li>
            <li> I love the Benefit Gimmie Brow, because it&#x27;s tented and works super well.</li>
            <li> Just a light swipe on each brow helps keep them looking neatily groomed.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product goes on light.</li>
            <li> I think the brownmousse is fabulous; I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Eyebrows are so important because they frame your face.</li>
            <li> and it goes on smoothly and hold my eyebrow hair in place.</li>
            <li> This mousse goes on smoothly with the applicator brush and does not flake unless applied in excess.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a light, natural hold, this brow mousse is a good bet.</li>
            <li> I love the applicator and packaging of this product; it holds just the right amount of brow gel.</li>
            <li> Based on positive reviews from others, I expected it to be an excellent product.</li>
            <li> It helps shape for a clean look and keep in place without flaking, etc.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman gives them lift, holds the brow hairs in place all day, and provides a clean finished look.</li>
            <li> Based on the positive reviews I read here and elsewhere, I decided to give this Tweezerman Brow Mousse a try, and I&#x27;m really glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holds brows in place and drys clear, what more could you want?!</li>
            <li> I really like it, if you have heavier eyebrows (thicker hair) and need something more substantial</li>
            <li> give this one a try if you&#x27;re searching for a nice, clear brow gel.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t an absolute &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; like I wanted, but it does work better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am cursed/blessed (depending on who you ask) with full, dark brown eyebrows that more often than not seem to have a mind of their own.</li>
            <li> The new one is more the size of mascara</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s EXACTLY what I needed, and everything it advertises to be!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as I&#x27;d hoped, this gel brushes and sets my brows - keeping them in place until I clean my makeup off.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the money in my opinion, I cant stand when my eyebrows get out of place.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brow gels, but always come back to this one because it is the best.  </li>
            <li> I have bushy eyebrows, and these do a good job of keeping them down.  </li>
            <li> Love the look, and the thin clean packaging design fits in with the other items in my makeup bag perfectly.</li>
            <li> After reading amazon review of various products, the Tweezerman mousse seemed like a good combination of value and quality, and has thus far lived up to that expectation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I was able to find it online since it&#x27;s not available in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I like Brow Mousse very much, but I have never used another product like this so have no point of comparison.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This holds my eyebrows almost exactly like</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a product like this, so didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cheap drugstore clear mascaras, hairspray, gel, wax...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love it and it is the only brand that doesn&#x27;t flake!</li>
            <li> I always color my eyebrows first then apply the mousse, so I have no idea</li>
            <li> I love it so much, definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute necessity in my cosmetics bag!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Brow Mousse for 1 week and can say that I LOVE this product and will not go back to Anastasia!</li>
            <li> fill in my eyebrows with a pen first, and then brush in the mousse --</li>
            <li> No flaky business, no crusty residue (eww), totally undetectable and removes easily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Blessed with thick brows, I&#x27;ve loved this gel since I first tried it.</li>
            <li> I really like this brow mousse.  </li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> eyebrow hair didn&#x27;t really stay in places when applied.</li>
            <li> For $9, I was hoping for more than making my eyebrow hair feeling wet.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m very please with this product  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it is not supposed to - really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Well it doesnt provide thag much hold as it says so</li>
            <li> However, it does keep them in place very well when I use it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to really evaluate the product itself since the case was so inferior/poorly designed that it smashed into pieces when it fell off the sink onto the floor.</li>
            <li> It is a very neutral color and not noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> Very disapointing.</li>
            <li> I really likes this a lot.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for absolutely rigid, immobile brows, this is is not for you.</li>
            <li> I have ordered others that are more affordable, and will probably stay with them, due to the price.</li>
            <li> gel like consistency (much like Maybelline&#x27;s clear mascara, but even lighter)&lt;br /&gt;*I found that it needs to be coaxed out of the tube the first couple of uses</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the Maybelline great lash clear mascara for lashes and brows - twice as much product, half the cost and a clear tube, so you&#x27;re actually getting the product your paying for.  </li>
            <li> The older I get, the wilder my eyebrows get.  </li>
            <li> I have used so many different products over the years and this is the only product that has these features:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> (As I&#x27;ve gotten older my brows have thinned out some, so this helps define what i have.  </li>
            <li> The brush is generous and the product itself is very light, giving my brows just a little assistance in maintaining a defined shape without gooping them up.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It has no scent, is not thick and is colorless.  </li>
            <li> I normally use a tinted wax to keep my brows in place.</li>
            <li> While I preferred the Anastasia product of the three, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the price when I ran out of a recent tube.  </li>
            <li> The new wand seems a little more sturdy, and I like that.</li>
            <li> This is my new eyebrow control \\&quot;weapon\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new, bc</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times, but really don&#x27;t see much of a difference in the appearance of my brows.</li>
            <li> My lineage is pretty mixed, my mother is Filipino and my father is descended from German/Norwegian immigrants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> mouse does exactly what I need without binding the hairs together forcing a the look of a solid line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve repurchased this several times since my first purchase about 2 yrs ago.</li>
            <li> This is the first time something has actually worked for me and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> I had to glop it on and smooth my hairs down with my finger.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even smooth them down.  </li>
            <li> It is a clear mousse that is applied with a brush applicator (built into the tube, like a mascara wand).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several brow gels, from the grocery store Covergirl clear gel to a Tart cosmetics product to the very pricy Anastasia brow products.  </li>
            <li> It is a clear gel like stuff that you brush on your brows.</li>
            <li> After application with the built-in applicator, I use a regular brow brush to fine-tune my brows and really distribute the mousse evenly...works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> , then I use this brow mousse over them and it keeps my brows looking natural and not angled/square shaped.</li>
            <li> (Revlon is cheaper, but doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well).</li>
            <li> not bother sensitive eyes&lt;</li>
            <li> My brows have to be filled in from years of uneven waxing.  </li>
            <li> Keeps brows in place, and not really heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different types of brow shapers and this comes closest to getting it right.  </li>
            <li> I used this to keep my super long brows in their proper place after applying all my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brow taming products, I even went as far as using my hair gel on an old toothbrush!!  </li>
            <li> My brows go wherever they want, some hairs straight down, some straight up.</li>
            <li> I try not to do too much in the ways of plucking or trimming; I pluck strays and sometimes I&#x27;ll trim a long hair.</li>
            <li> I feel pretty cheated out of the money I spent.</li>
            <li> There is no flaking, my eyebrows don&#x27;t feel hard, and it washs off as easy at it goes on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again but would wait for it to be majorly discounted before I did.</li>
            <li> My second purchase and part of my make-up routine; keeps brows in place.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are not thick or long.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like the old wand that came with this.</li>
            <li> This is the most I&#x27;ve ever spent on a brow product; in the past, I&#x27;ve always bought drugstore brands that have started flaking and leaving a white residue by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I do have to be somewhat image-conscious with my job, and a few seconds applying these each morning help me look a little more put-together.</li>
            <li> I like this product as it really does tame those wild eyebrow hairs that we get from time to time.</li>
            <li> Barely goes on my brows because the brush is too big.</li>
            <li> It really helps to keep those stray eyebrows in place all day long, without caking or flaking, as I have found with some other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve got sensitive eyes and have to be very careful about what type of eye makeup I use lest</li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed to find out that it was really just ok.</li>
            <li> Less wild eyebrows for me!</li>
            <li> not thick enough to tame eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Moreover, it doesn&#x27;t flake or form a hard crust, and has a firm hold considering how light it applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably because I use so much of it trying to tame my brow hairs!</li>
            <li> the hairspray did, without making them crunchy or strange looking.  </li>
            <li> I was in the market for something to help manage my long eyebrow hairs and this product does the job.  </li>
            <li> It stays on all day long throughout my work day.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my eyebrows in shape all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of brow gels in the past, both colored and clear, and found this one to be far less gloppy.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman Brow Mousse is the only thing I use to tame my brows; I use it every single day and one tube generally lasts me 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since you don&#x27;t need very much of this product, I also see it lasting at least a few months.  </li>
            <li> The container lasts a long time, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products like this for eyebrows and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t turn filmy or gunky after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> As they are thick and full, I don&#x27;t need a pencil or shadow to fill them in; however, I do require some sort of product to hold them in place, lest I end up looking like a female version of Martin Scorsese (at least brow-wise).</li>
            <li> Once dry, it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my makeup.  </li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> My brows are not thick by any means, but this product (at least for me) didn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li> , I notice this gel isn&#x27;t heavy enough to make my hairs lie flat.</li>
            <li> I usually have to dip the brush back in 3 or 4 times to get enough on my brows.</li>
            <li> Like some others, my tube was basically dry, and the little that did come out, (seriously, a tiny drop on the tip of the brush) didn&#x27;t do anything to keep my brows groomed.  </li>
            <li> product works extremely well to hold your brows in place all day long.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, it&#x27;s the little things in life that make a difference, especially with beauty products.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s shelf life had expired, total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It works well shaping your eyebrow with no flyaways but isn&#x27;t too heavy like similar products I have used.</li>
            <li> Does not really hold the brows in place.</li>
            <li> It just seems to go on wet, and when it dries its like nothing was put on.</li>
            <li> This product was empty.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your eyebrows hard or strange looking, it does not dry up and shed</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to dry, but once dry, I&#x27;m done!  </li>
            <li> I always purchased this at ULTA, but for some unknown reason that they can&#x27;t explain, they don&#x27;t carry it anymore, even though they carry all of the other Tweezerman products.  </li>
            <li> What I personally do is brush on a little dark brown eyeshadow onto my brows to darken them a bit</li>
            <li> Warning: if you don&#x27;t close the tube tightly or wait or if it is about a year after the expiration date, it does tend to dry as glue would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it by using one side of the brush to do one brow, and then flipping it and using the other side of the brush to do the other brow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> I have used different brow styling gels in the past and this one didn&#x27;t hold up.  </li>
            <li> I smeared AquaNet or Dep on my face (which other products do).</li>
            <li> Not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> i have a weird bald spot just slightly in from the center of my left brow, and hoped this could help to maneuver it into something less obvious.</li>
            <li> -- it doesn&#x27;t make the brows feel too stiff or greasy and the brush&#x27;s bristles aren&#x27;t too widely spaced (some brands are), so it&#x27;s a nicer effect --</li>
            <li> My eyebrow hairs grow down, typically oriental (not Polynesian though</li>
            <li> It literally seems to do nothing except slightly dampen my brows.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, your bangs will mess up the look of your brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, relying mostly on a dramatic brow and thick eyelashes, so this product and mascara is basically it for me.  </li>
            <li> a little strange&lt;br /&gt;*No</li>
            <li> If you have a few stray hairs in your brows, this Brow Mouse helps tame them down</li>
            <li> I have a few misbehaved brow hairs.</li>
            <li> I have a few unruly hairs that stick out and make me feel like I look unkempt.</li>
            <li> I have thin brows and they tend to point in different directions.</li>
            <li> I have thick dark eyebrows and the hairs grow in slightly differnt direction.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my eyebrows in place without making them stiff or look like they have gel in them.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who needs to tame his or her eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I use it every day to tame my curly eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Very little product comes out on the brush, seems to have no effect on contolling hair.   </li>
            <li> so no more unruly eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what all the hype is.  </li>
            <li> If you have unruly arches that you&#x27;re trying to tame and groom into place, use this every night and eventually, they will stay that way!</li>
            <li> Does not make the brow hairs look hard</li>
            <li> it makes my eyebrows hard..</li>
            <li> extremely expensive for such thin coverage.</li>
            <li> i have thick eyebrows</li>
            <li> not cute!</li>
            <li> (There&#x27;s nothing worse for your self-esteem than looking like you have eyebrow dandruff!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does nothing to hold them up and in place, and worst of all it doesn&#x27;t tame brows down.</li>
            <li> Nothing against the Tweezerman Brow Mousse, it unfortunately just is not what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of crazy brows, this is the answer!</li>
            <li> I have crazy eyebrows</li>
            <li> I hate stray eyebrows hairs and</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> it was horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite brow mousse.  Just a light swipe on each brow helps keep them looking neatily groomed.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it works fantastic. Personally, I like the old wand that came with this. It was smaller. The new one is more the size of mascara but it works just as great!! I would recommend it to anyone who needs to tame his or her eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a product that would control some unruly eyebrow hair.  Very little product comes out on the brush, seems to have no effect on contolling hair.   Maybe it&#x27;s shelf life had expired, total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman products. The Tweezerman Brow Mousse is great. It works well shaping your eyebrow with no flyaways but isn&#x27;t too heavy like similar products I have used.</li>
            <li> If you have a few stray hairs in your brows, this Brow Mouse helps tame them down and I love the way it makes my eyebrows look! I have used this quite a lot and have not had any problems at all. It does what it says it does, plain and simple. Would recommend this product to everyone --- even people who do not have any issues with their brows!</li>
            <li> I normally use a tinted wax to keep my brows in place. It works but it&#x27;s not as great as I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;ve been using this brow mousse after my tinted brow wax and brow powder and it keeps my brows in place much better than just my wax. It also doesn&#x27;t flake or get goopy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could the applicator be better? Yes. I usually have to dip the brush back in 3 or 4 times to get enough on my brows. But the product does hold, which is why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again but would wait for it to be majorly discounted before I did.</li>
            <li> I really like this brow mousse.  It is a clear mousse that is applied with a brush applicator (built into the tube, like a mascara wand).  It really helps to keep those stray eyebrows in place all day long, without caking or flaking, as I have found with some other products. Easy to apply and it really works.  Note:  After application with the built-in applicator, I use a regular brow brush to fine-tune my brows and really distribute the mousse evenly...works like a charm.  This is my new eyebrow control \\&quot;weapon\\&quot;...I&#x27;m really glad I found this.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Based on positive reviews from others, I expected it to be an excellent product. Was a bit disappointed to find out that it was really just ok. It doesn&#x27;t flake, but it also doesn&#x27;t hold your brows in place all that great. I still believe that Anastasia brow gel is the best product out there.</li>
            <li> Blessed with thick brows, I&#x27;ve loved this gel since I first tried it. Nothing compares in my mind. The new wand seems a little more sturdy, and I like that. If you have unruly arches that you&#x27;re trying to tame and groom into place, use this every night and eventually, they will stay that way!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for this product in the philippines because of great reviews, but couldn&#x27;t. so i settled for elf brow gel, which was ok for the price, but sometimes flakes at the end of the day. when i got here in the US, i couldn&#x27;t find the elf brow gel nor this product, so i settled for hair sprays and gels using the brush from the elf brow gel. it was horrible! i always got white flakes by noon! so i ordered this product and it works perfectly! great hold so no more unruly eyebrows. and best of all, no flaking! :) this is now a must-have for me.</li>
            <li> The older I get, the wilder my eyebrows get.  Dang it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got sensitive eyes and have to be very careful about what type of eye makeup I use lest I end up with red, itchy eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a makeup artist once use hairspray on an eyelash wand to style my eyebrows, but I don&#x27;t use hairspray and didn&#x27;t want to buy hairspray JUST for my eyebrows (sheesh).  I&#x27;d been using aloe vera gel (I use it in my hair as styling gel), but it hasn&#x27;t been holding at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This holds my eyebrows almost exactly like the hairspray did, without making them crunchy or strange looking.  Once dry, it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my makeup.  It has no scent, is not thick and is colorless.  It takes a little while to dry, but once dry, I&#x27;m done!  My eyes are not at all irritated by it, and it doesn&#x27;t flake at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s EXACTLY what I needed, and everything it advertises to be!  Less wild eyebrows for me!</li>
            <li> eyebrow hair didn&#x27;t really stay in places when applied. I couldn&#x27;t notice a signficant different before and after application.  For $9, I was hoping for more than making my eyebrow hair feeling wet.</li>
            <li> This is the most I&#x27;ve ever spent on a brow product; in the past, I&#x27;ve always bought drugstore brands that have started flaking and leaving a white residue by the end of the day.  Based on the positive reviews I read here and elsewhere, I decided to give this Tweezerman Brow Mousse a try, and I&#x27;m really glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works extremely well to hold your brows in place all day long. Most importantly, though, it doesn&#x27;t start flaking mid-way through the day.  (There&#x27;s nothing worse for your self-esteem than looking like you have eyebrow dandruff!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s a mousse, it&#x27;s also a bit thicker, and it seems to give a bit more volume to your brows.  I&#x27;ve been using it after applying brow pencil, and it holds the color in place nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since you don&#x27;t need very much of this product, I also see it lasting at least a few months.  I&#x27;ve been applying it by using one side of the brush to do one brow, and then flipping it and using the other side of the brush to do the other brow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hint if you have bangs is to be sure to pull your bangs aside until the mousse sets/dries.  If you don&#x27;t, your bangs will mess up the look of your brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product! Like another reviewer said, it&#x27;s the little things in life that make a difference, especially with beauty products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several brow gels, from the grocery store Covergirl clear gel to a Tart cosmetics product to the very pricy Anastasia brow products.  While I preferred the Anastasia product of the three, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the price when I ran out of a recent tube.  After reading amazon review of various products, the Tweezerman mousse seemed like a good combination of value and quality, and has thus far lived up to that expectation.  The brush is generous and the product itself is very light, giving my brows just a little assistance in maintaining a defined shape without gooping them up.  I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, relying mostly on a dramatic brow and thick eyelashes, so this product and mascara is basically it for me.  I bought it on subscribe and save with plans to cancel if it was even just so-so but I&#x27;m very happy with the find.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Barely goes on my brows because the brush is too big.</li>
            <li> when applying  brush feels like it has no gel,  but it does the best job  brows are combed great and STAY in place  i have thick eyebrows and i&#x27;m very please with this product  definitely recommend  better than expensive brands i&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I like this product as it really does tame those wild eyebrow hairs that we get from time to time. It is a clear gel like stuff that you brush on your brows. I will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow sculpting product.  I have used so many different products over the years and this is the only product that has these features:&lt;br /&gt;- Does not make the brow hairs look hard (crunchy look that everyone who uses a gel product should recognize)&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t flake off during the day&lt;br /&gt;- Holds shape all day</li>
            <li> I had no color at all in the one I bought</li>
            <li> I was in the market for something to help manage my long eyebrow hairs and this product does the job.  It helps shape for a clean look and keep in place without flaking, etc. It is part of my daily make-up routine.  (As I&#x27;ve gotten older my brows have thinned out some, so this helps define what i have.  The container lasts a long time, too!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are a bit out of control and thus why I bought this product.  I like how this product controls the direction of the hair, making it appears like I had a recently eyebrow wax grooming.  It&#x27;s applicator is easy. There is no smell to the product. It stays on all day long throughout my work day.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I can actually tell the difference in using this product as opposed to a gel. My lineage is pretty mixed, my mother is Filipino and my father is descended from German/Norwegian immigrants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine/thin Scandinavian hair. My eyebrow hairs grow down, typically oriental (not Polynesian though, what&#x27;s up with that?! LOL), so I have to train them by brushing them up in order to open my eyes a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouse does exactly what I need without binding the hairs together forcing a the look of a solid line. I really like it, if you have heavier eyebrows (thicker hair) and need something more substantial I suggest you go with a gel that will lock it into place.</li>
            <li> Holds brows in place and drys clear, what more could you want?!</li>
            <li> Keeps brows in place and nicely groomed.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Lola Eyebrow Gel for several years now, but can no longer find it in Sephora, Amazon, anywhere -- I decided to give this one a try and I like it -- it doesn&#x27;t make the brows feel too stiff or greasy and the brush&#x27;s bristles aren&#x27;t too widely spaced (some brands are), so it&#x27;s a nicer effect -- give this one a try if you&#x27;re searching for a nice, clear brow gel.</li>
            <li> This product is just okay to me. I love the Benefit Gimmie Brow, because it&#x27;s tented and works super well. I wanted to try something new, bc I just can&#x27;t justify spending almost $30 on brow gel. This product goes on light. It does hold my brows in place for the majority of the day. Since it&#x27;s not tented I have to spend more time blending my brow powder before setting it with the brow gel. The product does indeed work. Maybe there will be tented versions of this coming out soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different types of brow shapers and this comes closest to getting it right.  It doesn&#x27;t flake like most but you do need several coats to keep everything in place.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have thick dark eyebrows and the hairs grow in slightly differnt direction. This product keeps them in order and doesn&#x27;t cause any visible flaking. Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this as my eyebrows grow downwards. This product lifts the eyebrows and keeps them in shape for hours. No flakyness either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10+ years and love it!  I have tried other brow gels, but always come back to this one because it is the best.  I always purchased this at ULTA, but for some unknown reason that they can&#x27;t explain, they don&#x27;t carry it anymore, even though they carry all of the other Tweezerman products.  I&#x27;m glad that I was able to find it online since it&#x27;s not available in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great service.</li>
            <li> I am a blond with unruly brows. I have used this brow mousse for several years, and it&#x27;s the best for taming my brows without clumping them.</li>
            <li> When a product has a lot of high-star reviews, I tend to ignore all the 1-star reviews and get it anyway. This time, it was a mistake. I was looking for something that would keep my brow hair in place all day. This doesn&#x27;t even keep it in place 10 seconds. It literally seems to do nothing except slightly dampen my brows. I feel pretty cheated out of the money I spent.</li>
            <li> Even when your eyebrows aren&#x27;t perfectly manicured this brow mousse tames them and shapes them up for you. What I personally do is brush on a little dark brown eyeshadow onto my brows to darken them a bit, then I use this brow mousse over them and it keeps my brows looking natural and not angled/square shaped.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works so well at holding my brows. An essential step every women needs in their beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I have bushy eyebrows, and these do a good job of keeping them down.  I do have to be somewhat image-conscious with my job, and a few seconds applying these each morning help me look a little more put-together.</li>
            <li> I have a few misbehaved brow hairs. Tweezerman&#x27;s works so amazingly well, just like their splinter tweezers! (Revlon is cheaper, but doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well). Warning: if you don&#x27;t close the tube tightly or wait or if it is about a year after the expiration date, it does tend to dry as glue would.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a product like this, so didn&#x27;t know what to expect. It has some hold, but does not lock the brows in place. Perhaps it is not supposed to - really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I hate stray eyebrows hairs and Brow Mousse does the trick.  Would also recommend it to the men out there.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference with this item from using hairspray applied to your fingertip and shaping with your fingertip.   (You could also spray an eyebrow comb!)</li>
            <li> This is pretty much useless. Does not really hold the brows in place. Not worth the price at all. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This product definitely did NOT meet my expectations!</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark eyebrows. I try not to do too much in the ways of plucking or trimming; I pluck strays and sometimes I&#x27;ll trim a long hair. I shaped my eyebrows to perfection once, and I am basically terrified to try to do anything else to them. I comb them into place and they look great, I don&#x27;t need to use pencil or powder, but I need something to keep them in place. I have a few unruly hairs that stick out and make me feel like I look unkempt. I&#x27;ve tried cheap drugstore clear mascaras, hairspray, gel, wax...And now this mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;*Has a mascara brush applicator&lt;br /&gt;*Thin, gel like consistency (much like Maybelline&#x27;s clear mascara, but even lighter)&lt;br /&gt;*I found that it needs to be coaxed out of the tube the first couple of uses&lt;br /&gt;*Once dry it makes my eyebrows hard..kind of crunchy. Probably because I use so much of it trying to tame my brow hairs! It&#x27;s not terrible, just feels a little strange&lt;br /&gt;*No fragrance&lt;br /&gt;*Does not bother sensitive eyes&lt;br /&gt;*Haven&#x27;t noticed any flaking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product didn&#x27;t \\&quot;wow\\&quot; me like I was hoping, and I won&#x27;t be repurchasing. Nothing against the Tweezerman Brow Mousse, it unfortunately just is not what I&#x27;ve been looking for. The search continues!</li>
            <li> I used this to keep my super long brows in their proper place after applying all my makeup. It didn&#x27;t glob up from my setting powder. It just left my brows clean, neat, natural-looking, and in perfect place all day.</li>
            <li> I think the brownmousse is fabulous; I&#x27;ve been using it for years. My brows have to be filled in from years of uneven waxing.  Eyebrows are so important because they frame your face. I use a slanted brush and cake powder, brush up (to shape) and use Tweezerman&#x27;s Browmousse.  It lasts until you wash off with no problem.  For me, it&#x27;s a must!</li>
            <li> Well it doesnt provide thag much hold as it says so in the package it comes in..sort of works.</li>
            <li> Keeps those brows in place!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s exactly what i was looking for. Love the look, and the thin clean packaging design fits in with the other items in my makeup bag perfectly.</li>
            <li> Better than any gel or mousse I have tried.  Brush it on your brow and it stays all day.  Great no touch-up</li>
            <li> I have tried several brow taming products, I even went as far as using my hair gel on an old toothbrush!!  This product was heaven sent!  Not too sticky, but just enough to have my brows stay in place all day.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without using it! It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake and I don&#x27;t feel like it is noticeable that I am using it! Love it and it is the only brand that doesn&#x27;t flake!</li>
            <li> My second purchase and part of my make-up routine; keeps brows in place.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clear and there&#x27;s no hint that you have anything on your brows......and works well for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s great. Can&#x27;t live with out it. I Wish I could still find it in stores locally.</li>
            <li> I like Brow Mousse very much, but I have never used another product like this so have no point of comparison. It does keep your brows in place well and doesn&#x27;t leave any clumps. I hoped it would train some of my wilder eyebrows that have appeared with age, but no such luck. However, it does keep them in place very well when I use it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to really evaluate the product itself since the case was so inferior/poorly designed that it smashed into pieces when it fell off the sink onto the floor. I don&#x27;t know what it was made of but should have been a more durable material.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what all the hype is.  There was no difference in my brows after using the product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times, but really don&#x27;t see much of a difference in the appearance of my brows. It is a very neutral color and not noticeable at all. Perhaps I did not give it enough of a chance. I&#x27;m sure it is a reputable product and would advise others to try it for themselves.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this product. Prior to using this my eyebrows would go every which way after putting on a sweat shirt or t-shirt, and this prevents that. Helps keep my eyebrows in place without making them stiff or look like they have gel in them. I&#x27;ve never notices any white flakes or things of the like. I always color my eyebrows first then apply the mousse, so I have no idea what the outcome would be if that process was reversed but it works great for me. Worth the money in my opinion, I cant stand when my eyebrows get out of place.</li>
            <li> I use this product on a daily basis and it is awesome. It does not leave your eyebrows hard or strange looking, it does not dry up and shed and it goes on smoothly and hold my eyebrow hair in place. I love it so much, definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used different brow styling gels in the past and this one didn&#x27;t hold up.  My brows are not thick by any means, but this product (at least for me) didn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job.  There didn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of product on the wand and I was constantly having to re-apply it during my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t hate it, It just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have thin brows and they tend to point in different directions. This mousse doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all for my problem. It just seems to go on wet, and when it dries its like nothing was put on. I tend to prefer using a wax-based brow stick.</li>
            <li> They worked good but doesn&#x27;t seem like there is a ton in the tube</li>
            <li> Keeps brows in place, and not really heavy.  Like this product.</li>
            <li> I am cursed/blessed (depending on who you ask) with full, dark brown eyebrows that more often than not seem to have a mind of their own. As they are thick and full, I don&#x27;t need a pencil or shadow to fill them in; however, I do require some sort of product to hold them in place, lest I end up looking like a female version of Martin Scorsese (at least brow-wise). This stuff is amazing! I only wish I&#x27;d discovered it years ago, back when I was doing what I like to call the &#x27;hairspray-on-my-finger-tip&#x27; method of brow control, which makes for not only sticky fingers but also the inevitable flakey bits -- not cute! I love the applicator and packaging of this product; it holds just the right amount of brow gel. (By the way it&#x27;s not really a mousse, in my opinion, but more of a thin transparent gel.) It takes all of 5 seconds to run the mascara-like wand through my brows, and voila! Beautifully groomed and tidy results. No flaky business, no crusty residue (eww), totally undetectable and removes easily at the end of the day. I love everything about it. I&#x27;ve repurchased this several times since my first purchase about 2 yrs ago. Tweezerman Brow Mousse is the only thing I use to tame my brows; I use it every single day and one tube generally lasts me 4-5 months. This is an absolute necessity in my cosmetics bag!</li>
            <li> I have crazy eyebrows and I have tried so many ways to just keep them where I want them.  This is the first time something has actually worked for me and it lasts all day.  There is no flaking, my eyebrows don&#x27;t feel hard, and it washs off as easy at it goes on.</li>
            <li> i have a weird bald spot just slightly in from the center of my left brow, and hoped this could help to maneuver it into something less obvious. it&#x27;s not as sticky as i would have hoped, and i probably gave up before my hair could be properly &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; into behaving the way i wanted it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my solution? christian dior&#x27;s brown pencil in universal brown:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.dior.com/beauty/en_us/fragrance-and-beauty/makeup/eyes/eyebrows/pr-eyebrows-Y0726130-diorshow-browstyler.html</li>
            <li> This mousse goes on smoothly with the applicator brush and does not flake unless applied in excess. It keeps my eyebrows in shape all day long.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brow tamer out there. My brows go wherever they want, some hairs straight down, some straight up. If you are tired of crazy brows, this is the answer!</li>
            <li> This product was empty.Not a sign of any mousse in it.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to find out how to return it I discovered the postage charges were more than the cost of the item.&lt;br /&gt;Never again!!</li>
            <li> Having used Anastasia products for many years I was a bit sceptical about the quality of the Tweezerman Brow Mousse. I&#x27;ve used the Brow Mousse for 1 week and can say that I LOVE this product and will not go back to Anastasia! My eyebrows are not thick or long. Tweezerman gives them lift, holds the brow hairs in place all day, and provides a clean finished look. Great product! Great price!</li>
            <li> Being a Tweezerman product I thought this would work well. It combs your brows but it does nothing to hold them up and in place, and worst of all it doesn&#x27;t tame brows down. Very disapointing.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd or 4th tube of this.  It keeps my brows the way I want them shaped!</li>
            <li> I love this product....and I guarantee you will too! It is costly, but a nice product!  I have ordered others that are more affordable, and will probably stay with them, due to the price.</li>
            <li> This brow mousse works great - I use it every day to tame my curly eyebrows. I&#x27;ve tried other products like this for eyebrows and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t turn filmy or gunky after a couple hours. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works better than any brow mousse I have ever tried. It wasn&#x27;t an absolute &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; like I wanted, but it does work better than anything else I have tried. I will definitely use this from now on.</li>
            <li> not thick enough to tame eyebrows. extremely expensive for such thin coverage.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this gel held better.  It doesn&#x27;t when you apply it with the mascara wand it comes with.  I had to glop it on and smooth my hairs down with my finger.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I&#x27;d hoped, this gel brushes and sets my brows - keeping them in place until I clean my makeup off.</li>
            <li> I like the ease of using this product but would like to see some color added to it.  I have brown and gray in my eyebrows and would like to be able to hide the gray with it.</li>
            <li> Like some others, my tube was basically dry, and the little that did come out, (seriously, a tiny drop on the tip of the brush) didn&#x27;t do anything to keep my brows groomed.  It didn&#x27;t even smooth them down.  I&#x27;ll stick with the Maybelline great lash clear mascara for lashes and brows - twice as much product, half the cost and a clear tube, so you&#x27;re actually getting the product your paying for.  And it works.</li>
            <li> Yep, it works and is nice for the price.</li>
            <li> Brow mousse is to keep your brows in place.</li>
            <li> I really likes this a lot. I didn&#x27;t repurchase again though and instead just use a cheaper brow color fill and spend the money on a brow wax stick (NYX) which us also sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product for controlling your brows.  No color.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for absolutely rigid, immobile brows, this is is not for you. If you&#x27;re looking for a light, natural hold, this brow mousse is a good bet. I&#x27;ve used plenty of brow gels in the past, both colored and clear, and found this one to be far less gloppy. Moreover, it doesn&#x27;t flake or form a hard crust, and has a firm hold considering how light it applies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fill in my eyebrows with a pen first, and then brush in the mousse -- I&#x27;m happy to report the mousse does not remove any of the brow pencil. It helps my brows stay in place all day, without looking like I smeared AquaNet or Dep on my face (which other products do). This mousse is odorless and has not made me break out -- something I&#x27;m prone to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone with somewhat curly, longer brow hairs, I notice this gel isn&#x27;t heavy enough to make my hairs lie flat. I think that&#x27;s the trade-off for using a lighter formula.</li>
