            <li>I had purchased this specifically to add shine to my color treated hair, but have discovered that it is the very best thing I have ever found to deal with staticy fly-away hair.</li>
            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for a leave-in and enhances shine without being oily.</li>
            <li>I think the best of the three is about 30 minutes after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>But I think it works best on damp hair.</li>

            <li>This is good stuff for men</li>
            <li>It has a tendency to get frizzy (even at this length) during the humid Georgia summers, and it just doesn&#x27;t look as good at those times.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Oh.. and it also makes it nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This made the hair silky and shiny, and was really a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I do not use any kind of blow dryer nor do I ever apply heat to my hair.)  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue or heaviness, which I liked a lot.</li>
            <li>It works best if you use it right after you wash your hair and then put a quarter sized amount (more or less-whatever works for you.</li>
            <li>Nothing I have tried, including Static Guard, has help, but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and when the Santa Anas blow here in California I look like a crazed Chia pet.</li>
            <li>Nice and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
            <li>Ordered many times before.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my ALL time favorite hair products.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>use this when I get out of the shower, mostly on the ends, but I&#x27;ve used it all over my hair, too.  </li>
            <li>product helps to make my hair look sleek, but it does not prevent my from being able to style it in a more voluminous manner, if I so choose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would compare it to many higher-end salon products.  </li>
            <li>I also have to use a lot more than the dime-sized amount recommended by the bottle to see any effect at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure how this was gonna work for me</li>
            <li>Okay, nothing fabulous!  </li>
            <li>and it stays better than light hold gels.</li>
            <li>I use this to dampen my hair when I brush it back into a ponytail and it does a GREAT keeping my hair together.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft, shiny and smell good.</li>
            <li>This stuff does smell amazing and would probably work great for someone who has thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Just ok, doesn&#x27;t really give shine.  </li>
            <li>What I was super impressed with is that my hair after it dried, was SUPER soft and very shiny!</li>
            <li>In my case, it does not add body, but since I don&#x27;t want to add body, this is all right.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards my hair felt super soft and light.</li>
            <li>My hair will stay smooth under Colorado weather which so far has been sun and rain (no snow!).</li>
            <li>recommend this product, and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I guess I will be stalking this product for a price reduction and buy some more in the future.</li>
            <li>So Much Vidal Sassoon!</li>
            <li>But with slightly damp hair, it&#x27;s easy to distribute evenly and easy to comb my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Third, it&#x27;s fairly easy to wash off my hands.  </li>
            <li>Since I did see some improvement, since the cost is low, and since it&#x27;s an easy product to work with, I&#x27;ll go ahead and give 4 stars.r.  </li>

            <li>Fourth, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair look a little bit shiny but overall great product to use.</li>
            <li>I really really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and it softens the curls and keeps the curls together.</li>
            <li>I needed something that left my hair smooth after it dries.</li>
            <li>The Vidal Sassoon does stay in my hair and it does smooth out my hair (only for max 8 hours after putting it on though).</li>
            <li>do think my hair is shiny after using this, though it was reasonably shiny before, as well.  </li>
            <li>This product does not make much of a difference in terms of keeping tangles from forming throughout the course of the day.  </li>
            <li>Too soon, and I don&#x27;t really feel like it \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; to my hair.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable since most cremes do cost roughly $5-$7 depending on size and brand.</li>
            <li>My secret to natural looking beautiful curls is this gloss!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many products weight my hair down and make me look like a scraggly animal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now when I brush it, my hair was back to its original soft, wavy and curly beautifullness that it was before I ever colored my hair.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I&#x27;m not noticing a huge difference in the appearance of my hair.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, I&#x27;m not noticing a huge difference in the appearance of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I use just a small amount on dry, styled hair and instantly the static is gone and my hair remains fly-away free all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried applying this product at three different times: immediately upon getting out of the shower (with lightly towel-dried hair), about 30 minutes after getting out of the shower, and when my hair was completely dry.  </li>
            <li>First, this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, even though I have to use a large amount.  </li>
            <li>I use it for styling my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>it made my hair soft but not shiny..</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I think the frizz might have been reduced some, but my hair doesn&#x27;t really come close to looking like a shampoo commercial.  </li>
            <li>, as far as APPLYING hair treatments goes, this one has a lot of advantages.  </li>

            <li> Good Product and good seller, recommended</li>
            <li> I purchased this gloss creme because it happened to be on sale, and I actually didn&#x27;t think I would even like it. Now I wish I had purchased more :(  I use this to dampen my hair when I brush it back into a ponytail and it does a GREAT keeping my hair together. I really really like this stuff. I guess I will be stalking this product for a price reduction and buy some more in the future. 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> I had just decided one day to try it on my hair,just a few days ago my hair was so awful,it was stringy, and rubbery, and broke off every time I brushed it.Now when I brush it, my hair was back to its original soft, wavy and curly beautifullness that it was before I ever colored my hair.It felt like there was never any damage to it.I&#x27;m serious.I can;t recommend this product enough.I almost cried because I now have my hair back to its normal self again.Thank You So Much Vidal Sassoon! This is the only hair repair product I will ever buy.Seriously.Please give this a try.Before you go to the salon and spend a ton of money trying to fix your hair if it is severely damaged, just pick up this product in stores, it is only $4.95. That price for a miracle? YES PLEASE!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had purchased this specifically to add shine to my color treated hair, but have discovered that it is the very best thing I have ever found to deal with staticy fly-away hair. My hair is very fine and when the Santa Anas blow here in California I look like a crazed Chia pet. Nothing I have tried, including Static Guard, has help, but this product is amazing. I use just a small amount on dry, styled hair and instantly the static is gone and my hair remains fly-away free all day. Oh.. and it also makes it nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
            <li> Ordered many times before.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff for men</li>
            <li> I used this for about 10 days in a row and saw no improvement.  In fact, it seemed to dry out my hair and leave it frizzy on the ends.</li>
            <li> This was recommended as a hair gel sibstitue for frizzy hair and works well. I don&#x27;t die my hair so I can&#x27;t comment on the color part. But leaves my hair feeling great and I can actually style it with this and it stays better than light hold gels.</li>
            <li> Does the job, tames my wild thick hair.  It does that for a fraction of what you would pay for other products like this.</li>
            <li> This is one of my ALL time favorite hair products. I use it for styling my naturally curly hair. It defines my curls without having a sticky feel to it. It even smells nice! If you have curly hair that&#x27;s frizzy, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wash my hair and let it dry I pump some in my hand and define my curls. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard at all, my hair is soft to the touch when I use it. My secret to natural looking beautiful curls is this gloss!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Although I love the actual product (which is the reason I rated it five stars), when I opened the packaging I was sad to see that there was a crack in the bottle, and it was leaking everywhere. I wish I didn&#x27;t have to return it to get a refund because it&#x27;s just such a hassle. I&#x27;m probably just going to patch it up! Hopefully that doesn&#x27;t happen to anyone else!*</li>
            <li> it made my hair soft but not shiny..i wanted it to work tho because i wanted my long hair to shine..</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my hair soft and shiny. I have very curly hair and it softens the curls and keeps the curls together. Doesn&#x27;t feel like there is anything on your hair after it dries.</li>
            <li> Just ok, doesn&#x27;t really give shine.  Leaves a film on hair.  I prefer Paul Mitchell skinny serum.  This stuff does smell amazing and would probably work great for someone who has thick hair.  Now with a coupon I paid only a $1 for this so wouldn&#x27;t buy again but does everything it claims but make my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, shiny and smell good.</li>
            <li> I needed something that left my hair smooth after it dries. When I used other cremes my hair would somehow absorb the liquids and become dry as if I didn&#x27;t put anything to begin with. The Vidal Sassoon does stay in my hair and it does smooth out my hair (only for max 8 hours after putting it on though). My hair will stay smooth under Colorado weather which so far has been sun and rain (no snow!). The price is reasonable since most cremes do cost roughly $5-$7 depending on size and brand. Will probably use again.</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to work with.  Doesn&#x27;t overly weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This made the hair silky and shiny, and was really a nice smell.  My Daughter aged 9 used it, and it made her hair gleam.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for a leave-in and enhances shine without being oily.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair look a little bit shiny but overall great product to use.</li>
            <li> This is a review for Vidal Sassoon ColorFinity Gloss Creme, 5.1 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard time finding hair products that work well for me.  I have fine, thin, straight hair that is slightly layered and shoulder-length.  Many products weight my hair down and make me look like a scraggly animal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this when I get out of the shower, mostly on the ends, but I&#x27;ve used it all over my hair, too.  I find that it helps to protect my hair when blow-drying.  It also eliminates the fly-aways and frizziness after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product helps to make my hair look sleek, but it does not prevent my from being able to style it in a more voluminous manner, if I so choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also will use some of this on the ends of my hair, prior to having it colored.  This seems to help keep it from breaking around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product, and the price is very reasonable.  I would compare it to many higher-end salon products.  It is worth at least three times the discount store price that I paid for it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and a half, and I&#x27;m having mixed feelings about it.  I think perhaps it&#x27;s not exactly the product I need, but I&#x27;ll go ahead and share my experience and hopefully the information will help someone out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have thick, waist-length, straight, color-treated hair.  It has a tendency to get frizzy (even at this length) during the humid Georgia summers, and it just doesn&#x27;t look as good at those times.  (Note: I do not use any kind of blow dryer nor do I ever apply heat to my hair.)  I was hoping this product would improve the appearance of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think my hair is shiny after using this, though it was reasonably shiny before, as well.  I think the frizz might have been reduced some, but my hair doesn&#x27;t really come close to looking like a shampoo commercial.  This product does not make much of a difference in terms of keeping tangles from forming throughout the course of the day.  In my case, it does not add body, but since I don&#x27;t want to add body, this is all right.  I do actually like that it seems to make my hair lie a bit flatter against me.  I also have to use a lot more than the dime-sized amount recommended by the bottle to see any effect at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of things I do like.  First, this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, even though I have to use a large amount.  Second, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky or greasy or oily.  Third, it&#x27;s fairly easy to wash off my hands.  Fourth, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, it does make my hair a little easier to comb out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried applying this product at three different times: immediately upon getting out of the shower (with lightly towel-dried hair), about 30 minutes after getting out of the shower, and when my hair was completely dry.  I think the best of the three is about 30 minutes after getting out of the shower.  Too soon, and I don&#x27;t really feel like it \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; to my hair.  With dry hair, it&#x27;s difficult to distribute the product evenly in my hair.  But with slightly damp hair, it&#x27;s easy to distribute evenly and easy to comb my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;m having a hard time assigning this product a rating.  One the one hand, as far as APPLYING hair treatments goes, this one has a lot of advantages.  On the other hand, I&#x27;m not noticing a huge difference in the appearance of my hair.  Subtle changes, yes, and they ARE improvements.  But nothing stunning or dramatic.  (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, and I love the shampoo and conditioner from the same line.  I think this just might not be what I need.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this product is cheap enough that it is certainly worth a try.  I suspect people with other hair textures and lengths, or other styling goals, might find a lot to like.  Since I did see some improvement, since the cost is low, and since it&#x27;s an easy product to work with, I&#x27;ll go ahead and give 4 stars.r.

            <li> I&#x27;m an African American with relaxed hair and I wasn&#x27;t sure how this was gonna work for me but it&#x27;s great. It works best if you use it right after you wash your hair and then put a quarter sized amount (more or less-whatever works for you. I have short hair) on your hands and work it through your hair. Then blow dry it. Or air dry it, if you prefer. But I think it works best on damp hair. Afterwards my hair felt super soft and light. It didn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue or heaviness, which I liked a lot. I would buy this again, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> great i love this!!!  What I was super impressed with is that my hair after it dried, was SUPER soft and very shiny!</li>
            <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Okay, nothing fabulous!  Comparable to all the other glossers out there.  Don&#x27;t overuse or too greasy.</li>
