            <li>The smell is great and it conditions my hair nicely</li>
            <li>So good conditioner, just not for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good conditioner, but not so good that I&#x27;ll have to have it again.</li>
            <li>LOVED the smell....</li>
            <li>and I really loved it.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>

            <li>I loved the scent of this shampoo and just wanted to try it since I saw it at the salon</li>
            <li>Super impressed with the service</li>
            <li>I switched to Matrix biolage and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It also didnt smell that great, more like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>i love this conditioner it makes my hair smooth and silky it the best in the market.i recommend this product</li>
            <li>Purchased from j&amp;b - authentic product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>Glad I switched!</li>
            <li>I love the smell!</li>
            <li>Love this brand!  </li>
            <li>Love Paul Mitchell products!</li>
            <li>smells wonderful and really works to keep tangles and static electricity at bay!</li>
            <li>I remember this shampoo made my hair feel amazing in the salon.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s luxurious and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>the smell is so good and makes your hair feel fantastic!</li>
            <li>I find, I have processed hair, that I have to use quite a bit of this after I shampoo for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>Like Chi products, kind of.</li>
            <li>I use this cream rinse once a week to make my hair smell good and more managable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried for 2 weeks now so that I could give a honest chance</li>
            <li>Give it a try for your self, I think the Chi lice of hair care products is much better at making good shampoo&#x27;s, conditioners &amp; hair repair products.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice product.</li>
            <li>I went out on my own and just tried it.</li>
            <li>Beautiful scent and my hair looks healthy strong.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li>this product smells wonderful, but it doesn&#x27;t detangle, nor does it make your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants great smelling, healthy hair!</li>
            <li>Some worked okay, but this product is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Love this product and can buy it cheaper online that in the stores</li>
            <li>love the cream rinse.  </li>
            <li>Love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I just love this product</li>
            <li>I am latin and have pretty spiral curls that tend to be unruly in the humidity, this mousse is amazing!</li>
            <li>so I follow after with a keratin conditioner with more slip.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love being able to purchase whenever I want.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li>The static that comes with brushing or just touching my hair has reduced drastically.</li>
            <li>The entire Awapuhi line is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Nice light scent too.  </li>
            <li>love that this doesn&#x27;t leave residue on my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this cream rinse.</li>
            <li>I will not be ordering from here, what was left of the product was Awesome.  </li>
            <li>One word: smooth operator!</li>
            <li>They help damaged hair look better and softer.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I had to go through a LOT of it to be able to detangle it.</li>
            <li>I love the Awapuhi products that were recommended to me by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>Excellent conditioner with a natural, light scent.</li>
            <li>My daughter and granddaughter also love this product.</li>
            <li>Had both my daughters try it and they love it a well.  </li>
            <li>i love the smell of this</li>
            <li>and i love these products</li>
            <li>the product, once settled, was about an inch from the top</li>
            <li>Love Paul Mitchell Awapuhi cream rinse.</li>
            <li>Of course, the product was more costly in the salon than through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Works great on dyed hair, conditions very well</li>
            <li>and I already love the product. :-)</li>
            <li>and I love these products.</li>
            <li>I love all lines of  awapuhi products which makes my hair keep silky and heathy.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells and the way it makes my hair look.</li>
            <li>Favorite conditioner of all time.  </li>
            <li>I never have any tangles, but there seems to be more of a shine when I use the rinse than when I do not.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>if not downright good right out of bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would really appreciate a free package of any of these two products for my continual purchases and as gratitude of my purchases!!!  </li>
            <li>I loved the shampoo and figured if the shampoo produced such good results, why not try another product in the line?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loving this product since the very first moment that appeared in my shower...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and need more de tangling</li>
            <li>I have fine textured hair, and I love the softness and shine of this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d try to pick up a sample from a salon before you purchase, and if you love it Amazon sells the 1-liter size which is definitely more economical than the 8.5-oz.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product lathers up great, you don&#x27;t have to use much, smells nice and leaves hair shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice would buy again.</li>
            <li>Product fine.</li>
            <li>Makes hair smell good &amp; very soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner was great and made my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, it stands up to all types of weather, keeping the hair nice and straight.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light and fresh.</li>
            <li>Nothing else needs to be said, except maybe buy the shampoo as well - my hair has never felt this fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This cream rinse is having none of that, but your hair is still silky smooth when it dries (which it does faster now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It, like the shampoo, smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fabulous conditioner for my over processed hair.</li>
            <li>It makes it silky and smooth in no time.</li>
            <li>It smells so good &amp; leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Having a water softener helps, but I still look forward to vacations sometimes to take a shower in normal water and have beautiful soft again!!  </li>
            <li>Love this product and this whole line!</li>
            <li>This cream rinse was originally recommended by the stylist who does my Brazilian Blowout.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and helps my hair stay smooth without weighing it down... not an easy feat in hot/</li>
            <li>They all do what they state they will do and with a special pleasing smell.</li>
            <li>Overall its a good product.</li>
            <li>was really taking it&#x27;s toll on it, but since using this my hair feels SOOOO much better</li>
            <li>The Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Cream Rinse is a really nice product (and I have tried dozens of products for my thinning, colored treated hair).  </li>
            <li>I have used most of the products in this line and really like them.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner has kept my hair looking healthy, soft, and amazingly easy to control.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it seems like a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about a third of the cost of Aveda and leaves my hair more more silky.</li>
            <li>It did arrive quickly and was priced well.</li>
            <li>So here is my quick but hopefully helpful review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Paul Mitchell ones, Bumble &amp; Bumble, Nexxus, Pantene, and Tresemme, and this Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Ginger is by far the best on my hair!</li>
            <li>Came intact and was exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend to all recipients!!!  </li>
            <li>I think for my straight(ish) and fine hair the Paul Mitchell products that work better are the volume products that are in the white bottle with purple tops.</li>
            <li>The combination provides great body and allows me a couple of days between hair washes without my hair going too limp.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This cream rinse not only smells great, but also makes my hair silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner along with the Awapuhi Wild Ginger Moisturizing Lather Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I left the rinse on for about 3 minutes and then rinsed it out with warm water.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money for me.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t impressed with how it made my hair feel in the shower, but I used my normal hair products &amp; styled it as normal &amp; when my hair was dry</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing special about it..</li>
            <li>Smells great, but not sure what it is.</li>
            <li>but with long hair i kind of have to use a lot</li>
            <li>My hair seemed kind of dry while using this.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a slight waxy feeling to it when I try to rinse it out, but I blow dry my hair and it looks awesome.</li>
            <li>First found it Australia but couldn&#x27;t find it in any retail shops here.</li>
            <li>Love this entire line of products.  </li>
            <li>Actually leaves my hair feeling like I&#x27;ve used hair conditioner...smells fantastic !</li>
            <li>so i only see 3-4 more uses max.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think so</li>
            <li>It might be me because Awapuhi has never been a big favorite for me; I hoped it was improved or changed.</li>
            <li>It funny detangle or leave my hair shiny either.</li>
            <li>I actually use it as a leave-in to keep my curls nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once and the fragrance is fresh and light.  </li>
            <li>This cream rinse is light, seems to help detangle and keep hair from becoming frizzy without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Anyways - this conditioner was pretty much gone in a week.  </li>
            <li>The rinse doesn&#x27;t have an odour I am aware of but it does make my hair very manageable after a wash.</li>
            <li>The product itself worked fairly well, but for the price and the small amount of product received, I decided not to repurchase.</li>
            <li>looks cool and professional</li>
            <li>Glad I found this...one of the many African American females transitioning from a relaxer perm to natural hair.</li>
            <li>Great for fine, limp hair without leaving a gummy feeling or making hair limp.</li>
            <li>I used to use Ojon products but now use this whole line.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell and what this does for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be real, here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter than some might like but it leaves hair shiny and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I get the rinse part...But not so much the cream part.</li>
            <li>it actually feels like straw now and has a heavier bizarre texture to it.  </li>
            <li>Even with using that much conditioner, I still had to use a leave-in spray on conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The smell</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>I would hope next time the dealer takes the time to properly secure things before shipping them.</li>
            <li>the smell is really the selling point .</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It really does smell yummy (and I&#x27;m a dude!)&lt;br /&gt;-Container</li>
            <li>My hair has NEVER felt this soft before unless it&#x27;s right after a visit to the salon.  </li>
            <li>This is the most I have ever spent on conditioner, particularly paired with its sister shampoo.</li>
            <li>I only took away a star because as much as I love this stuff, it&#x27;s not as natural and chemical-free as I normally like my beauty products to be.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, very dry, naturally frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>You only need a small squirt for medium-long hair, and it&#x27;s a great detangler.</li>
            <li>fabulous conditioner for grey, dyed and highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li>have fine, moderately dry hair and after using the shampoo, I applied the crème rinse.</li>
            <li>Was introduced to Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Cream Rinse by my hairdresser after my first Keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>But since more than 3/4 of the bottle was in the box it was not worth the $$</li>
            <li>The top of the bottle was not taped down even though the rest of the bottle was secured in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>We got lives to live, and people to see!</li>
            <li>It also smells SO good - a little sweet and a little spicy.</li>
            <li>more than half of the cream rinse had came out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I definitely plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>Excellent for my long thick blonde wavy / curly hair.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this rinse after using Awapui moisturizing lather shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so I need to use a little more than I do of the shampoo</li>
            <li>I use several of the Paul Mitchell Wild Ginger products and they keep my colored, blow dry and flat iron fine hair looking healthy.  </li>
            <li>the product is a bit slippery not thick n creamy.</li>
            <li>, it is worth EVERY second and EVERY</li>
            <li>&amp; I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking 3X the amount that I normally put in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this line, the shampoo is amazing but this cream rinse is not like regular conditioner, it is very thin.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a very light cream rinse similar to Tame which is sadly no longer made.  </li>
            <li>I double shampoo my hair, but I still ran out of this cream rinse first.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>It leaves hair silky smooth and workable without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>This combined with the Awapuhi Wild Ginger shampoo makes me hair silky soft!  </li>
            <li>I will certainly come back to this over and over again.</li>
            <li>but it really helps with winter weather by adding moisture back to my hair.</li>
            <li>Has taken the frizz out of my naturally curly, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I use this product in combination with the Awapuhi Wild Ginger Hydrocream Whip.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and leaves my hair feeling silky.</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair and it made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>This made my hair incredibly soft...</li>
            <li>and I use it after shampooing with its mate the wild ginger shampoo.</li>
            <li>Frizzy all year round, flips out at the bottom on one side, and is wavy—but only at the top.</li>
            <li>There was some leakage of the conditioner due to the top not being taped closed.</li>
            <li>(somewhat tropical, a bit floral) and the key point is, it simply didn&#x27;t seem to condition my hair very much.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight, highlighted, and very fine/limp, and this conditioner makes it shiny, soft, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li>and I was running out of what I normally use and just wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin, this does not make my hair thicker in any way</li>
            <li>I have very curly dry hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing and my hair has been a lot softer since I started using it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth at least one extra star to what would have been a pretty bummer review.</li>
            <li>I can barely smell it!</li>
            <li>and while this product isn&#x27;t cheap it does tame down frizz and one bottle lasts me 2 weeks as long as I use it with Paul Mitchell Super Shine Spray.</li>
            <li>I bought this line after hearing great reviews &amp; after using the shampoo, I was a bit skeptical since I didn&#x27;t like that it was a moisturizing one, but left my hair dry.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a little lricey, but it&#x27;s Paul Mitchell, and I think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I had hoped that this would make my hair feel wonderful as it did for other reviewers but my hair feels much healthier by using other much less expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I have wavy, very unruly hair, that is dry and heat stressed daily.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;just heavenly\\&quot; on other reviews I&#x27;ve read is a bit much.</li>
            <li>Does not have much &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; like other conditioners but if left on for a bit will detangle when you rinse.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is good, but it&#x27;s very expensive</li>
            <li>There is still a fine line between using just enough of this product to condition my hair versus too much which then weighs my thin hair down and makes it go &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; by the next day (that&#x27;s why 4 stars instead of 5).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The smell is great and it conditions my hair nicely</li>
            <li> So good conditioner, just not for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good conditioner, but not so good that I&#x27;ll have to have it again.</li>
            <li> LOVED the smell....</li>
            <li> and I really loved it.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>

            <li> I loved the scent of this shampoo and just wanted to try it since I saw it at the salon</li>
            <li> Super impressed with the service</li>
            <li> I switched to Matrix biolage and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> It also didnt smell that great, more like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> i love this conditioner it makes my hair smooth and silky it the best in the market.i recommend this product</li>
            <li> Purchased from j&amp;b - authentic product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> Glad I switched!</li>
            <li> I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Love this brand!  </li>
            <li> Love Paul Mitchell products!</li>
            <li> smells wonderful and really works to keep tangles and static electricity at bay!</li>
            <li> I remember this shampoo made my hair feel amazing in the salon.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s luxurious and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> the smell is so good and makes your hair feel fantastic!</li>
            <li> I find, I have processed hair, that I have to use quite a bit of this after I shampoo for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> Like Chi products, kind of.</li>
            <li> I use this cream rinse once a week to make my hair smell good and more managable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried for 2 weeks now so that I could give a honest chance</li>
            <li> Give it a try for your self, I think the Chi lice of hair care products is much better at making good shampoo&#x27;s, conditioners &amp; hair repair products.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product.</li>
            <li> I went out on my own and just tried it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent and my hair looks healthy strong.</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> this product smells wonderful, but it doesn&#x27;t detangle, nor does it make your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants great smelling, healthy hair!</li>
            <li> Some worked okay, but this product is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Love this product and can buy it cheaper online that in the stores</li>
            <li> love the cream rinse.  </li>
            <li> Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I just love this product</li>
            <li> I am latin and have pretty spiral curls that tend to be unruly in the humidity, this mousse is amazing!</li>
            <li> so I follow after with a keratin conditioner with more slip.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love being able to purchase whenever I want.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li> The static that comes with brushing or just touching my hair has reduced drastically.</li>
            <li> The entire Awapuhi line is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Nice light scent too.  </li>
            <li> love that this doesn&#x27;t leave residue on my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cream rinse.</li>
            <li> I will not be ordering from here, what was left of the product was Awesome.  </li>
            <li> One word: smooth operator!</li>
            <li> They help damaged hair look better and softer.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I had to go through a LOT of it to be able to detangle it.</li>
            <li> I love the Awapuhi products that were recommended to me by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner with a natural, light scent.</li>
            <li> My daughter and granddaughter also love this product.</li>
            <li> Had both my daughters try it and they love it a well.  </li>
            <li> i love the smell of this</li>
            <li> and i love these products</li>
            <li> the product, once settled, was about an inch from the top</li>
            <li> Love Paul Mitchell Awapuhi cream rinse.</li>
            <li> Of course, the product was more costly in the salon than through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Works great on dyed hair, conditions very well</li>
            <li> and I already love the product. :-)</li>
            <li> and I love these products.</li>
            <li> I love all lines of  awapuhi products which makes my hair keep silky and heathy.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells and the way it makes my hair look.</li>
            <li> Favorite conditioner of all time.  </li>
            <li> I never have any tangles, but there seems to be more of a shine when I use the rinse than when I do not.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> if not downright good right out of bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would really appreciate a free package of any of these two products for my continual purchases and as gratitude of my purchases!!!  </li>
            <li> I loved the shampoo and figured if the shampoo produced such good results, why not try another product in the line?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving this product since the very first moment that appeared in my shower...</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and need more de tangling</li>
            <li> I have fine textured hair, and I love the softness and shine of this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d try to pick up a sample from a salon before you purchase, and if you love it Amazon sells the 1-liter size which is definitely more economical than the 8.5-oz.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product lathers up great, you don&#x27;t have to use much, smells nice and leaves hair shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice would buy again.</li>
            <li> Product fine.</li>
            <li> Makes hair smell good &amp; very soft.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was great and made my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, it stands up to all types of weather, keeping the hair nice and straight.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very light and fresh.</li>
            <li> Nothing else needs to be said, except maybe buy the shampoo as well - my hair has never felt this fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This cream rinse is having none of that, but your hair is still silky smooth when it dries (which it does faster now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It, like the shampoo, smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fabulous conditioner for my over processed hair.</li>
            <li> It makes it silky and smooth in no time.</li>
            <li> It smells so good &amp; leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Having a water softener helps, but I still look forward to vacations sometimes to take a shower in normal water and have beautiful soft again!!  </li>
            <li> Love this product and this whole line!</li>
            <li> This cream rinse was originally recommended by the stylist who does my Brazilian Blowout.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and helps my hair stay smooth without weighing it down... not an easy feat in hot/</li>
            <li> They all do what they state they will do and with a special pleasing smell.</li>
            <li> Overall its a good product.</li>
            <li> was really taking it&#x27;s toll on it, but since using this my hair feels SOOOO much better</li>
            <li> The Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Cream Rinse is a really nice product (and I have tried dozens of products for my thinning, colored treated hair).  </li>
            <li> I have used most of the products in this line and really like them.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner has kept my hair looking healthy, soft, and amazingly easy to control.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it seems like a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about a third of the cost of Aveda and leaves my hair more more silky.</li>
            <li> It did arrive quickly and was priced well.</li>
            <li> So here is my quick but hopefully helpful review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Paul Mitchell ones, Bumble &amp; Bumble, Nexxus, Pantene, and Tresemme, and this Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Ginger is by far the best on my hair!</li>
            <li> Came intact and was exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend to all recipients!!!  </li>
            <li> I think for my straight(ish) and fine hair the Paul Mitchell products that work better are the volume products that are in the white bottle with purple tops.</li>
            <li> The combination provides great body and allows me a couple of days between hair washes without my hair going too limp.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This cream rinse not only smells great, but also makes my hair silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> I love this conditioner along with the Awapuhi Wild Ginger Moisturizing Lather Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I left the rinse on for about 3 minutes and then rinsed it out with warm water.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t impressed with how it made my hair feel in the shower, but I used my normal hair products &amp; styled it as normal &amp; when my hair was dry</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing special about it..</li>
            <li> Smells great, but not sure what it is.</li>
            <li> but with long hair i kind of have to use a lot</li>
            <li> My hair seemed kind of dry while using this.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a slight waxy feeling to it when I try to rinse it out, but I blow dry my hair and it looks awesome.</li>
            <li> First found it Australia but couldn&#x27;t find it in any retail shops here.</li>
            <li> Love this entire line of products.  </li>
            <li> Actually leaves my hair feeling like I&#x27;ve used hair conditioner...smells fantastic !</li>
            <li> so i only see 3-4 more uses max.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think so</li>
            <li> It might be me because Awapuhi has never been a big favorite for me; I hoped it was improved or changed.</li>
            <li> It funny detangle or leave my hair shiny either.</li>
            <li> I actually use it as a leave-in to keep my curls nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once and the fragrance is fresh and light.  </li>
            <li> This cream rinse is light, seems to help detangle and keep hair from becoming frizzy without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Anyways - this conditioner was pretty much gone in a week.  </li>
            <li> The rinse doesn&#x27;t have an odour I am aware of but it does make my hair very manageable after a wash.</li>
            <li> The product itself worked fairly well, but for the price and the small amount of product received, I decided not to repurchase.</li>
            <li> looks cool and professional</li>
            <li> Glad I found this...one of the many African American females transitioning from a relaxer perm to natural hair.</li>
            <li> Great for fine, limp hair without leaving a gummy feeling or making hair limp.</li>
            <li> I used to use Ojon products but now use this whole line.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and what this does for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be real, here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter than some might like but it leaves hair shiny and very manageable.</li>
            <li> I get the rinse part...But not so much the cream part.</li>
            <li> it actually feels like straw now and has a heavier bizarre texture to it.  </li>
            <li> Even with using that much conditioner, I still had to use a leave-in spray on conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The smell</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I would hope next time the dealer takes the time to properly secure things before shipping them.</li>
            <li> the smell is really the selling point .</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It really does smell yummy (and I&#x27;m a dude!)&lt;br /&gt;-Container</li>
            <li> My hair has NEVER felt this soft before unless it&#x27;s right after a visit to the salon.  </li>
            <li> This is the most I have ever spent on conditioner, particularly paired with its sister shampoo.</li>
            <li> I only took away a star because as much as I love this stuff, it&#x27;s not as natural and chemical-free as I normally like my beauty products to be.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, very dry, naturally frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small squirt for medium-long hair, and it&#x27;s a great detangler.</li>
            <li> fabulous conditioner for grey, dyed and highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li> have fine, moderately dry hair and after using the shampoo, I applied the crème rinse.</li>
            <li> Was introduced to Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Cream Rinse by my hairdresser after my first Keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> But since more than 3/4 of the bottle was in the box it was not worth the $$</li>
            <li> The top of the bottle was not taped down even though the rest of the bottle was secured in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> We got lives to live, and people to see!</li>
            <li> It also smells SO good - a little sweet and a little spicy.</li>
            <li> more than half of the cream rinse had came out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my long thick blonde wavy / curly hair.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this rinse after using Awapui moisturizing lather shampoo.  </li>
            <li> so I need to use a little more than I do of the shampoo</li>
            <li> I use several of the Paul Mitchell Wild Ginger products and they keep my colored, blow dry and flat iron fine hair looking healthy.  </li>
            <li> the product is a bit slippery not thick n creamy.</li>
            <li> , it is worth EVERY second and EVERY</li>
            <li> &amp; I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking 3X the amount that I normally put in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Love this line, the shampoo is amazing but this cream rinse is not like regular conditioner, it is very thin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a very light cream rinse similar to Tame which is sadly no longer made.  </li>
            <li> I double shampoo my hair, but I still ran out of this cream rinse first.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> It leaves hair silky smooth and workable without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This combined with the Awapuhi Wild Ginger shampoo makes me hair silky soft!  </li>
            <li> I will certainly come back to this over and over again.</li>
            <li> but it really helps with winter weather by adding moisture back to my hair.</li>
            <li> Has taken the frizz out of my naturally curly, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product in combination with the Awapuhi Wild Ginger Hydrocream Whip.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and leaves my hair feeling silky.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and it made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> This made my hair incredibly soft...</li>
            <li> and I use it after shampooing with its mate the wild ginger shampoo.</li>
            <li> Frizzy all year round, flips out at the bottom on one side, and is wavy—but only at the top.</li>
            <li> There was some leakage of the conditioner due to the top not being taped closed.</li>
            <li> (somewhat tropical, a bit floral) and the key point is, it simply didn&#x27;t seem to condition my hair very much.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight, highlighted, and very fine/limp, and this conditioner makes it shiny, soft, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> and I was running out of what I normally use and just wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thin, this does not make my hair thicker in any way</li>
            <li> I have very curly dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super moisturizing and my hair has been a lot softer since I started using it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth at least one extra star to what would have been a pretty bummer review.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell it!</li>
            <li> and while this product isn&#x27;t cheap it does tame down frizz and one bottle lasts me 2 weeks as long as I use it with Paul Mitchell Super Shine Spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this line after hearing great reviews &amp; after using the shampoo, I was a bit skeptical since I didn&#x27;t like that it was a moisturizing one, but left my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little lricey, but it&#x27;s Paul Mitchell, and I think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that this would make my hair feel wonderful as it did for other reviewers but my hair feels much healthier by using other much less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, very unruly hair, that is dry and heat stressed daily.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;just heavenly\\&quot; on other reviews I&#x27;ve read is a bit much.</li>
            <li> Does not have much &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; like other conditioners but if left on for a bit will detangle when you rinse.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is good, but it&#x27;s very expensive</li>
            <li> There is still a fine line between using just enough of this product to condition my hair versus too much which then weighs my thin hair down and makes it go &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; by the next day (that&#x27;s why 4 stars instead of 5).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a failure of expectations or a failure of the product, but it smelled really amazingly great</li>
            <li> The one I received does not and I&#x27;m really not sure if it&#x27;s the real Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to flat iron my hair every day—this stuff makes it look presentable</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use it along with the shampoo so long as I have a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> I worry about parabens and other nasty ingredients, and this product definitely isn&#x27;t perfect (though Paul Mitchell doesn&#x27;t test on animals, which is a total must for me).</li>
            <li> You know how with normal conditioners, you&#x27;re left with a slick feeling even after you&#x27;ve rinsed it out?</li>
            <li> Because I have heavy high lights my hair tends to get dry, BUT this conditioner saves my hair!</li>
            <li> I was willing to overlook the fact that at least a quarter of the bottle was empty, but this can&#x27;t be Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li> Will keep using as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased and used a lot of shampoos and rinses for a long time</li>
            <li> My hair is not soft since using this product, as a matter of fact</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not kinky or thick but it does get very frizzy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive!</li>
            <li> I use this every other day along with the entire line.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry, damaged, curly hair and while nothing bad came from using it nothing great happened either.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try after a review from AndreasChoice on YouTube, and it&#x27;s been nothing short of fantastic for my wavy (read: crazy) and color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> Helps my dry hair  to be softer.</li>
            <li> Might work for some one else with thicker hair that is on the dry side.</li>
            <li> and it didnt feel as soft as it usually does when I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> and you only need a little.  </li>
            <li> I have tried lots of products and treatments, expensive and cheap, even a few salon keratin treatments.</li>
            <li> order to even attempt to get a comb through my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I will never use any other conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I love Paul Mitchel products, but was disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> My hair was a little dry</li>
            <li> My hair looks dull with regular conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time believing that what I received us actually a Paul Mitchell product.</li>
            <li> So care must be taken to use less conditioner if you wash your hair frequently or there will be a residue buildup that flattens thin hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down while fighting the frizzies from the Houston humidity.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Smooths hair after shampoo but does not weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li> When I received this product, it seemed like it was half gone already.</li>
            <li> and I lost half the bottle of conditioner.</li>
            <li> It was tangled, hard to brush (I have long hair) and my hair felt course and lifeless after I dried</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product because I do like Paul Mitchell, but unfortunately, I hated it.  </li>
            <li> I used this Cream Rinse with the shampoo and it just ended up being too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> This time it just made my hair heavy and with a greasy feeling to it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, I do have it colored as well so sometimes on the dry side.  </li>
            <li> i LOVE this cream rinse but was very disappointed when it arrived in the mail to find it wasnt secured before it was shipped and</li>
            <li> This helps me conquer the tangles with very little effort.</li>
            <li> Not sure that this is the legitimate product; arrived without the tell-tale seal.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this for the second time &amp; the bottle cap was twisted off, which resulted in there being conditioner all over inside the box</li>
            <li> I prefer a thick condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s curly, thick, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m annoyed I just wasted money.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and it works well.  </li>
            <li> The cream is a very thin cream, I was expecting it to be dense or heavy, and there is no lather to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveda Color Conserve for years, but got tired of the steep price tag.</li>
            <li> I also had a hard time &#x27;feeling&#x27; like there was conditioner in my hair, since this is a very thin consistency.</li>
            <li> Not much shine- disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, but this has been nothing but a waste of money for me!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird.</li>
            <li> Considering it&#x27;s just a cream rinse, not a deep conditioner, it&#x27;s awfully pricey.</li>
            <li> but i just hate that things like this are never completely full!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look crazy</li>
            <li> was a pricey disappointment and I will not use this product again.</li>
            <li> We also have TERRIBLE water - lots of iron :(  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product and can buy it cheaper online that in the stores</li>
            <li> love the cream rinse.  I will buy again. Also got the shampoo and loved it. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this.</li>
            <li> I use several of the Paul Mitchell Wild Ginger products and they keep my colored, blow dry and flat iron fine hair looking healthy.  Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> This combined with the Awapuhi Wild Ginger shampoo makes me hair silky soft!  My hair has NEVER felt this soft before unless it&#x27;s right after a visit to the salon.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down while fighting the frizzies from the Houston humidity. The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t impressed with how it made my hair feel in the shower, but I used my normal hair products &amp; styled it as normal &amp; when my hair was dry I was amazed at how it felt.  I would recomend this product to everyone &amp; will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Nothing else needs to be said, except maybe buy the shampoo as well - my hair has never felt this fantastic.  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I just love this product the smell is so good and makes your hair feel fantastic!</li>
            <li> Great hair product. Left my hair shiny and soft. First found it Australia but couldn&#x27;t find it in any retail shops here. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair conditioner because heard a lot of good things about it. I wasn&#x27;t impressed though. Absolutely nothing special about it..</li>
            <li> Glad I found this...one of the many African American females transitioning from a relaxer perm to natural hair. This helps me conquer the tangles with very little effort.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  My hair looks dull with regular conditioners.  This product makes my hair shiny and gives it a brighter appearance.</li>
            <li> I am latin and have pretty spiral curls that tend to be unruly in the humidity, this mousse is amazing! I have tried just about everything that is out there and while this product isn&#x27;t cheap it does tame down frizz and one bottle lasts me 2 weeks as long as I use it with Paul Mitchell Super Shine Spray. I recommend this product as I use it in DC weather which can be humid in the summers.</li>
            <li> Purchased from j&amp;b - authentic product! Very happy! Excellent for keratin treated hair. Does not have much &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; like other conditioners but if left on for a bit will detangle when you rinse. I have fine hair and need more de tangling so I follow after with a keratin conditioner with more slip. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells so good &amp; leaves my hair so soft. I used to use Ojon products but now use this whole line. Will keep using as long as they make it. I hope they don&#x27;t stop.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is a great one. The speed in which i received it was also good. The top of the bottle was not taped down even though the rest of the bottle was secured in bubble wrap. There was some leakage of the conditioner due to the top not being taped closed. Overall its a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been growing my hair out from a pixie cut for months now and this conditioner (and the ginger shampoo) have been life savers!!  Having to straighten/blowdry my hair daily so it doesn&#x27;t look crazy was really taking it&#x27;s toll on it, but since using this my hair feels SOOOO much better and I can see a drastic improvement in it&#x27;s health and looks.</li>
            <li> I remember this shampoo made my hair feel amazing in the salon. The one I received does not and I&#x27;m really not sure if it&#x27;s the real Paul Mitchell. Smells good But probably won&#x27;t buy again on here.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair. I actually use it as a leave-in to keep my curls nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Was introduced to Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Cream Rinse by my hairdresser after my first Keratin treatment.  This conditioner is amazing.  I have very fine, very dry, naturally frizzy hair.  This conditioner has kept my hair looking healthy, soft, and amazingly easy to control.  I will never use any other conditioner.  I would give it ten stars if that was possible!!  Thank goodness Amazon carries this conditioner.  I love being able to purchase whenever I want.</li>
            <li> this conditioner smells so good with great nutrition.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner. I decided to give it a try after a review from AndreasChoice on YouTube, and it&#x27;s been nothing short of fantastic for my wavy (read: crazy) and color-treated hair. It&#x27;s super moisturizing and my hair has been a lot softer since I started using it a few weeks ago. You only need a small squirt for medium-long hair, and it&#x27;s a great detangler. It also smells SO good - a little sweet and a little spicy. I only took away a star because as much as I love this stuff, it&#x27;s not as natural and chemical-free as I normally like my beauty products to be. I worry about parabens and other nasty ingredients, and this product definitely isn&#x27;t perfect (though Paul Mitchell doesn&#x27;t test on animals, which is a total must for me). If that&#x27;s something that matters to you a lot, you should probably steer clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricy so I&#x27;d try to pick up a sample from a salon before you purchase, and if you love it Amazon sells the 1-liter size which is definitely more economical than the 8.5-oz.</li>
            <li> Good product and smells great. I have thick, dry, damaged, curly hair and while nothing bad came from using it nothing great happened either. I prefer a thick condition.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive! I&#x27;ve bee using this product since it was recommended to me from my stylist.  However, I have to say the press on Amazon is a lot of cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and what this does for my hair. My hair is very fine and thin, this does not make my hair thicker in any way but it really helps with winter weather by adding moisture back to my hair. The static that comes with brushing or just touching my hair has reduced drastically. The cream is a very thin cream, I was expecting it to be dense or heavy, and there is no lather to it.</li>
            <li> I am so picky anout hair products.  I have wavy, very unruly hair, that is dry and heat stressed daily.  This cream rinse not only smells great, but also makes my hair silky and soft.  I LOVE this product!  The entire Awapuhi line is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love this entire line of products.  Has taken the frizz out of my naturally curly, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.  Nice light scent too.  Works well in conjunction with the shampoo.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be real, here. This is the most I have ever spent on conditioner, particularly paired with its sister shampoo. When you order this stuff, it takes FOREVER to get here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let me tell you, my friends, it is worth EVERY second and EVERY cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a nightmare. Frizzy all year round, flips out at the bottom on one side, and is wavy—but only at the top. It&#x27;s weird. I don&#x27;t understand it. And this rinse and shampoo has been the only thing that has made it manageable. I no longer have to flat iron my hair every day—this stuff makes it look presentable if not downright good right out of bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this doesn&#x27;t leave residue on my hair in the shower. You know how with normal conditioners, you&#x27;re left with a slick feeling even after you&#x27;ve rinsed it out? This cream rinse is having none of that, but your hair is still silky smooth when it dries (which it does faster now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer it if it shipped faster, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. I will certainly come back to this over and over again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants great smelling, healthy hair! My hair is straight, highlighted, and very fine/limp, and this conditioner makes it shiny, soft, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all. I&#x27;ve tried other Paul Mitchell ones, Bumble &amp; Bumble, Nexxus, Pantene, and Tresemme, and this Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Ginger is by far the best on my hair! Smells divine!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent for my long thick blonde wavy / curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure that this is the legitimate product; arrived without the tell-tale seal. Smells great, but not sure what it is.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the shampoo. Considering it&#x27;s just a cream rinse, not a deep conditioner, it&#x27;s awfully pricey. It, like the shampoo, smells fantastic. I find, I have processed hair, that I have to use quite a bit of this after I shampoo for it to be effective. I expect to run out way before the shampoo is gone. I like the smell, but I think the price is too unreasonable to repurchase. One star off for price.</li>
            <li> Not much shine- disappointed.</li>
            <li> The Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Cream Rinse is a really nice product (and I have tried dozens of products for my thinning, colored treated hair).  The smell is great and it conditions my hair nicely (did I say the smell is great!). There is still a fine line between using just enough of this product to condition my hair versus too much which then weighs my thin hair down and makes it go &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; by the next day (that&#x27;s why 4 stars instead of 5).  I use this product in combination with the Awapuhi Wild Ginger Hydrocream Whip.  The combination provides great body and allows me a couple of days between hair washes without my hair going too limp.  Also, the effects of this conditioner are noticeable with subsequent hair washing unless I use a shampoo that is specifically targeted for removing hair product residue.  So care must be taken to use less conditioner if you wash your hair frequently or there will be a residue buildup that flattens thin hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cream rinse. Actually leaves my hair feeling like I&#x27;ve used hair conditioner...smells fantastic !</li>
            <li> I will not be ordering from here, what was left of the product was Awesome.  But since more than 3/4 of the bottle was in the box it was not worth the $$</li>
            <li> When I received this product, it seemed like it was half gone already. I double shampoo my hair, but I still ran out of this cream rinse first. I also had a hard time &#x27;feeling&#x27; like there was conditioner in my hair, since this is a very thin consistency. The product itself worked fairly well, but for the price and the small amount of product received, I decided not to repurchase. I switched to Matrix biolage and am very satisfied with it. It is cheaper and I think works just as well.</li>
            <li> One word: smooth operator! I soak my hair in this. It&#x27;s so soft and leaves my hair feeling silky. Love this product and this whole line!</li>
            <li> I have used most of the products in this line and really like them.  They help damaged hair look better and softer.  I have curly hair and these products have helped me keep it in control.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair. I have been using both the shampoo and rinse for about 6 months. Love it. It leaves hair silky smooth and workable without weighing it down. I will continue to pay the price for a great product.</li>
            <li> fabulous conditioner for grey, dyed and highlighted hair.  anything that has this Allure award is wonderful</li>
            <li> Depending on how often you wash your hair, you would use this conditioner for the majority of your week. It&#x27;s lighter than some might like but it leaves hair shiny and very manageable. I alternate between it and the intensive conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this shampoo.  My hair seemed kind of dry while using this.  However, my hair stylist swears by this.</li>
            <li> My hair type is 3c-3b. It&#x27;s curly, thick, and frizzy. I used it as a cream rinse and went through it after about 5-6 washings. I had to go through a LOT of it to be able to detangle it. It didnt de tangle my hair well and it didnt feel as soft as it usually does when I rinsed it out. It also didnt smell that great, more like men&#x27;s cologne. Like Chi products, kind of. It didnt work for me, but it worked for my sister. So good conditioner, just not for me. Or the money.</li>
            <li> I use this cream rinse once a week to make my hair smell good and more managable.  Helps my dry hair  to be softer.</li>
            <li> I love the Awapuhi products that were recommended to me by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner with a natural, light scent.</li>
            <li> I get the rinse part...But not so much the cream part. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a failure of expectations or a failure of the product, but it smelled really amazingly great (somewhat tropical, a bit floral) and the key point is, it simply didn&#x27;t seem to condition my hair very much. That&#x27;s what I bought it for, so not delish smell will fix the fundamental problem...but it&#x27;s worth at least one extra star to what would have been a pretty bummer review.</li>
            <li> Fabulous conditioner for my over processed hair. It leaves my hair smelling wonderful and looking healthy. My daughter and granddaughter also love this product.</li>
            <li> i love this conditioner it makes my hair smooth and silky it the best in the market.i recommend this product</li>
            <li> I was looking for a very light cream rinse similar to Tame which is sadly no longer made.  This cream rinse is light, seems to help detangle and keep hair from becoming frizzy without weighing it down.  I have only used it once and the fragrance is fresh and light.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner along with the Awapuhi Wild Ginger Moisturizing Lather Shampoo.  It makes my hair so soft! Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Product fine. Overpriced compared to wholesale outlets.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was great and made my hair super soft and manageable. I definitely plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased and used a lot of shampoos and rinses for a long time but I have never found a produce like this that has done wonders for my hair.  I was amazed after all these years how manageble my hair is now.  Had both my daughters try it and they love it a well.  We all have different  texture hair.</li>
            <li> Because I have heavy high lights my hair tends to get dry, BUT this conditioner saves my hair! It makes it silky and smooth in no time. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, but this has been nothing but a waste of money for me!  My hair is not soft since using this product, as a matter of fact it actually feels like straw now and has a heavier bizarre texture to it.  I&#x27;ve tried for 2 weeks now so that I could give a honest chance and now I am done.  I had hoped that this would make my hair feel wonderful as it did for other reviewers but my hair feels much healthier by using other much less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveda Color Conserve for years, but got tired of the steep price tag. My hair person suggested this, both the shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s about a third of the cost of Aveda and leaves my hair more more silky. Glad I switched!</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this and i love these products but i just hate that things like this are never completely full! the product, once settled, was about an inch from the top i guess not that big of a deal but with long hair i kind of have to use a lot so i only see 3-4 more uses max. it also doesn&#x27;t say how often to use this and if to use before or after a conditioner or not even use a conditioner. otherwise, its great.</li>
            <li> This is my go to hair care product. Yes, it&#x27;s a little lricey, but it&#x27;s Paul Mitchell, and I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product lathers up great, you don&#x27;t have to use much, smells nice and leaves hair shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Love Paul Mitchell Awapuhi cream rinse. Beautiful scent and my hair looks healthy strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this line after hearing great reviews &amp; after using the shampoo, I was a bit skeptical since I didn&#x27;t like that it was a moisturizing one, but left my hair dry. This conditioner is good, but it&#x27;s very expensive &amp; I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money. It&#x27;s a good conditioner, but not so good that I&#x27;ll have to have it again. The ginger smell that some have said is \\&quot;just heavenly\\&quot; on other reviews I&#x27;ve read is a bit much. I can barely smell it! Give it a try for your self, I think the Chi lice of hair care products is much better at making good shampoo&#x27;s, conditioners &amp; hair repair products.</li>
            <li> I have fine textured hair, and I love the softness and shine of this product.  I have color treated hair and it made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product. I have longer hair so I need to use a little more than I do of the shampoo but it&#x27;s luxurious and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product because I do like Paul Mitchell, but unfortunately, I hated it.  I have very thick hair, I do have it colored as well so sometimes on the dry side.  We also have TERRIBLE water - lots of iron :(  Having a water softener helps, but I still look forward to vacations sometimes to take a shower in normal water and have beautiful soft again!!  Anyways - this conditioner was pretty much gone in a week.  I had to use A LOT of it in order to even attempt to get a comb through my wet hair.  I&#x27;m talking 3X the amount that I normally put in my hair.  Even with using that much conditioner, I still had to use a leave-in spray on conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The smell - you have to like Ginger.  LOVED the smell....this is why I brought it up to 2 stars.  But if you&#x27;re not a ginger fan - you won&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal/good water, it may work, I don&#x27;t know.  But for my hair and my water situation, I definitely will not be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> This cream rinse was originally recommended by the stylist who does my Brazilian Blowout.  Of course, the product was more costly in the salon than through Amazon.  Love the scent and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is runny compared to the one I purchased at the salon.  It was literally scotch taped shut.  And doesn&#x27;t feel anything like the Paul Mitchell products I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYERS BEWARE.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product. I love Paul Mitchel products, but was disappointed in this one. It did not de-tangle my hair and I did not care for the fragrance. It did arrive quickly and was priced well.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful and really works to keep tangles and static electricity at bay!</li>
            <li> Pretty nice would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I got a sample and I really loved it. When I got this and used it, it didnt give me the same results that the sample did. It works, but not as well as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Works great on dyed hair, conditions very well and you only need a little.  Would recommend to a friend. thanks</li>
            <li> I use this every other day along with the entire line. Great for fine, limp hair without leaving a gummy feeling or making hair limp. I love the smell! Arrived way before it was supposed to</li>
            <li> Love this line, the shampoo is amazing but this cream rinse is not like regular conditioner, it is very thin. Do not buy this if you need a moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> My product showed up in just two days! Super impressed with the service and I already love the product. :-)</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Keratin Creme Rinse is the perfect compliment to a salon keratin treatment. Easy to use, it stands up to all types of weather, keeping the hair nice and straight. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Love it leaves my hair feeling and smelling great!</li>
            <li> This made my hair incredibly soft... In afro american with 4ac hair... Fast delivery.. At first I didn&#x27;t think so bc the product is a bit slippery not thick n creamy.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal.  Came intact and was exactly what I was looking for!  Love this brand!  It does wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li> i LOVE this cream rinse but was very disappointed when it arrived in the mail to find it wasnt secured before it was shipped and more than half of the cream rinse had came out of the bottle.I would hope next time the dealer takes the time to properly secure things before shipping them.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and I love these products.</li>
            <li> Need to improve packaging. I just ordered this for the second time &amp; the bottle cap was twisted off, which resulted in there being conditioner all over inside the box and I lost half the bottle of conditioner. Good product but I&#x27;m annoyed I just wasted money.</li>
            <li> This rinse is excellent.</li>
            <li> this product smells wonderful, but it doesn&#x27;t detangle, nor does it make your hair soft and manageable.  it&#x27;s a lot of hype for a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Makes hair smell good &amp; very soft. Perfect finish for winter static but the smell is really the selling point .</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look and feel great. Leaves a slight waxy feeling to it when I try to rinse it out, but I blow dry my hair and it looks awesome.</li>
            <li> I have very curly dry hair. It&#x27;s not kinky or thick but it does get very frizzy and unmanageable. I have tried lots of products and treatments, expensive and cheap, even a few salon keratin treatments. Some worked okay, but this product is by far the best. My hair is dramatically softer, shiner and smells great! It&#x27;s pricey, but I can&#x27;t wait to try all products on this line.</li>
            <li> It has creamy texture and nice fragance!!  I love all lines of  awapuhi products which makes my hair keep silky and heathy.</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair smooth and shiny. The fragrance is very light and fresh. My hairdresser recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li> I swear by the Awapuhi line. Love the way it smells and the way it makes my hair look. Could never see myself using a different line anytime soon!!!!</li>
            <li> This conditions smells really good. I will definitely continue to use it along with the shampoo so long as I have a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> We got lives to live, and people to see! So here is my quick but hopefully helpful review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It really does smell yummy (and I&#x27;m a dude!)&lt;br /&gt;-Container looks cool and professional&lt;br /&gt;-Is creamy/conditioner-y&lt;br /&gt;-Seems to work, hair does feel moisturized and seems to be healthier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Expensive for quantity given&lt;br /&gt;-Does not make me a sandwich in the morning</li>
            <li> I decided to try the cream rinse after trying the shampoo. I loved the shampoo and figured if the shampoo produced such good results, why not try another product in the line?&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, moderately dry hair and after using the shampoo, I applied the crème rinse. I left the rinse on for about 3 minutes and then rinsed it out with warm water. My hair felt like it feels when I don&#x27;t use a conditioner. It was tangled, hard to brush (I have long hair) and my hair felt course and lifeless after I dried it.&lt;br /&gt;This was a pricey disappointment and I will not use this product again.</li>
            <li> Favorite conditioner of all time.  It smells great and helps my hair stay smooth without weighing it down... not an easy feat in hot/ humid Atlanta summers!</li>
            <li> I loved the scent of this shampoo and just wanted to try it since I saw it at the salon I go to. I went out on my own and just tried it. My hair was a little dry and I was running out of what I normally use and just wanted to try something different. I used this Cream Rinse with the shampoo and it just ended up being too heavy for my hair. Might work for some one else with thicker hair that is on the dry side. Other than that it seems like a great product.</li>
            <li> It might be me because Awapuhi has never been a big favorite for me; I hoped it was improved or changed. I have tried it before when it was in a white bottle. I think for my straight(ish) and fine hair the Paul Mitchell products that work better are the volume products that are in the white bottle with purple tops.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money for me. I have thick wavy hair and it works well.  It shipped quickly and arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving this product since the very first moment that appeared in my shower... The combination of ginger parfume and the quality of this conditioner, make it my fav of the 2013!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this rinse and I use it after shampooing with its mate the wild ginger shampoo. The rinse doesn&#x27;t have an odour I am aware of but it does make my hair very manageable after a wash. I never have any tangles, but there seems to be more of a shine when I use the rinse than when I do not. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell line of hair and skin care products having always been pleasing to the wallet and to the scalp, hair and skin! They all do what they state they will do and with a special pleasing smell. Love Paul Mitchell products!</li>
            <li> Smooths hair after shampoo but does not weigh hair down.  Highly recommend this rinse after using Awapui moisturizing lather shampoo.  Great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Love this hair product!!!  Highly recommend to all recipients!!!  Please offer me a free travel package for all the times I have purchased this and La Brasiliana Uno Keratin and Collagen Shampoo!!!  I would really appreciate a free package of any of these two products for my continual purchases and as gratitude of my purchases!!!  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time believing that what I received us actually a Paul Mitchell product. I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell Awapuhi products before and was left amazed at how my hair felt. This time it just made my hair heavy and with a greasy feeling to it. And yes, I rinsed enough. It also smells like lemons - like a cleaning product. I was willing to overlook the fact that at least a quarter of the bottle was empty, but this can&#x27;t be Paul Mitchell. It funny detangle or leave my hair shiny either.</li>
