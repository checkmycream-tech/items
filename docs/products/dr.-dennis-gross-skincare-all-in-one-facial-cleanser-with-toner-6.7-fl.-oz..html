    <ol>
            <li>in a word: AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>Best in years!</li>
            <li>As someone with combination oily skin that is prone to blackheads it sounded like the perfect cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Good luck!!</li>
            <li>smells great.</li>
            <li>This is a great cleanser, a great toner, and it is</li>
            <li>Great Product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a great deal of difference in my skin</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t give it great stars</li>
            <li>The products arrived yesterday, which was just 3 days after I placed my order and 6 days sooner than the estimated arrival date, which was really nice!  </li>
            <li>but I would balance it with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is so good, and never dries your face out, regardless of the season.</li>
            <li>Good for combination skin.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>but if they do the trick I will gladly pay the price!</li>
            <li>great face cleanser all in one for guys, too... wont over-dry your skin but good for oily skin, leaves it nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I honestly wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I hadn&#x27;t seen the results myself.  </li>
            <li>I liked this face wash</li>
            <li>Love it Love it!</li>
            <li>They changed the formula and it is not as good as the original.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with a $6 drugstore cleanser.  </li>
            <li>And I like this one better.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li>Love it and the chemical peel pads</li>
            <li>A lot to love about this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a minimalist in many ways...</li>
            <li>I love the glow and healthful radiance</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;m 16...except my skin looked better at 16</li>
            <li>I just ordered the all over blemish solution to add to the mix as well, since I&#x27;m so pleased with these two products.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>but then I started to breakout more than ever.  </li>
            <li>and I break out if I don&#x27;t cleanse thoroughly as well as sensitivity to most cleansers or soaps.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, It&#x27;ll just get better and better with continued use.</li>
            <li>so I rinsed thoroughly with warm water while massaging my skin until it felt clean.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser makes my face feel clean and tighter, and it smells like I am at the spa!</li>
            <li>good price, cost twice as much in store</li>
            <li>no fragrance.. easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This stuff is FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li>It seems to lightly exfoliate too.  </li>
            <li>, I have tried several and all are great.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to see what my skin will look like after I&#x27;ve used these products for a month.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not work in the same, wonderful manner as the old formulation.</li>
            <li>My skin never felt clean after I used it and the blackheads I was so hoping to be rid of grew in number.  </li>
            <li>but it definately leaves my face clean and glowing.</li>
            <li>All of Dr. Gross products have been superior.  </li>
            <li>but WOW, this stuff has taken my skin to a new level of great.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Love most of Dr. Gross&#x27; products, however, not this one.</li>
            <li>This cleanser does not use water, which freaked me out at first, but now I am hooked!</li>
            <li>Excellent cleanser for extra dry skin like mine or oily skin like my boys.</li>
            <li>THE OLD PRODUCT WAS A MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li>Well worth the time and money.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>so when I found out that this is an all-in-one cleanser/toner, I tried it right away.</li>
            <li>After years of trouble and not having any luck, I stumbled across this amazing product!</li>
            <li>The products are not irritating to my skin, in comparison with other brands that sting and burn, this is a nice change!</li>
            <li>good one has kept my skin clear for the last 2 years or so.</li>
            <li>Tried tons of different products but love that this cleanser includes toner.</li>
            <li>But after trying a sample .. decided to go above and beyond my budget! :)</li>
            <li>My boyfriend could tell a difference after the first week, I hadn&#x27;t told him I changed my products.</li>
            <li>originally gave this product 5-stars, but that was for the old formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li>soft clean skin...</li>
            <li>Paired it with the acne clearing complex, and left my skin beautiful!</li>
            <li>removes all makeup and skin feels clean but not tight.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use this at first but the instructions say to put it on your dry face, then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered the All in One Facial Cleanser with Toner and the Hydra Pure Oil Free Moisture with Chelating Complex through Amazon since it was on sale for a great price, even though the two were over $60 on sale.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and satisfies multiple needs - wash, exfoliate, tone.  </li>
            <li>I followed up with the Hydra Pure moisturizer and went to bed, hoping that I wasn&#x27;t allergic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Dr.  Gross fan, I&#x27;ve been using the cleanser/ with toner for over a year</li>
            <li>It leaves my face, soft, fresh and oil free..effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased the Dr. Gross Alpha Beta Daily Face Peels prior to this purchase and was really happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Really like this.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser removes ALL makeup including waterproof mascara and is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>And, it works really well for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It is really embarrassing to be this age</li>
            <li>This is definetely the real thing.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I do have somewhat sensitive skin, but I normally love Dr. Gross skincare products.  </li>
            <li>After moving into a new home with well water my shin started breaking out for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>I have been using Dr. Gross&#x27; cleanser/toner for about six weeks and while it leaves my face feeling clean, there is no flaky dryness or peeling around my nose.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure, I do follow it with the Dr. Dennis Gross moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed a more even skin tone, I have a somewhat ruddy complexion that has disappeared since using the All in One Face Cleanser in combination with the  Dr. Dennis Gross Extra Strength Alpha Beta Peel.</li>
            <li>All in One Facial Cleanser with Toner and Dr Gross&#x27; Extra Strength Alpha Beta Daily Face Peel for almost a month now and am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>and it has really helped to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I have never paid more than a few dollars for cleansers..</li>
            <li>I then wet a cotton pad and went over my face really well to make sure I removed the last bit of make-up and cleanser in case I had missed any...</li>
            <li>I JUST TRIED THE NEW PRODUCT &amp;  </li>
            <li>companies seem to be cheapening the new reformulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I do not like the new formulation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After seeking a new face regiment since my Proactive regiment stopped working, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  </li>
            <li>apply it to dry face with dry hands and massage in, rinse off love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the past few weeks and it works great.</li>
            <li>I  had problems with fine little bumps on my forehead or cheeks sometimes</li>
            <li>The amount of breakouts I have along with the recovery time is much less and the pores around nose have diminished significantly.</li>
            <li>I thought I had clear skin before this</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin prone to allergy and acne.  </li>
            <li>and I imagine that with a few more weeks of daily use they&#x27;ll be history.</li>
            <li>products are very expensive when compared to products from the drugstore and even a lot of high end designer products and/or prescription products that I&#x27;ve used through the years, but these are the best results I&#x27;ve ever had, especially overnight, even with products that have been a lot more expensive.  </li>
            <li>It also caused several breakouts, something that I&#x27;m not prone to normally.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels much more supple and soft; no more dry, flaky skin!</li>
            <li>There are apparently 2 different all in one facial cleansers with toner with the exact same name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone with trouble finding the right balance of facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>I have not broke out in acne in a long time I am 34 years old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from all natural products like homemade goat milk and lye soaps and lotions, to diet changes, and hormone balancing teas, etc., but my skin is constantly irritated, full of blemishes, dry and itchy, and very dull looking.  </li>

            <li> I have not broke out in acne in a long time I am 34 years old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from all natural products like homemade goat milk and lye soaps and lotions, to diet changes, and hormone balancing teas, etc., but my skin is constantly irritated, full of blemishes, dry and itchy, and very dull looking.  </li>
            <li> good one: 6 oz, shorter fatter bottler, pale green tinge and thick consistency&lt;</li>
            <li> Also, it takes a very small amount of product so unless I use much more product than I need, this facial cleanser should last me at least 6 months with daily morning and evening use.  </li>
            <li> Last night I applied the milky cleanser to my dry face and massaged it in for about 2 minutes</li>
            <li> Plus, I am putting in a quality shower filter to help remove chlorine and other impurities since other members of my family have developed psoriasis and eczema since moving into this house too.  </li>
            <li> My previous facial cleanser/toner left me with flaky dryness around my nose.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensative skin and this product caused my skin to get a few raw red spots.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially confusing because I thought I ordered the good one, I was sent the bad one, the review picture is of the good one, but my product picture on my orders page is the bad one.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews on Dr Gross products I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This product caused my face to feel and look dry as well as break out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to put it on a dry face-</li>
            <li> I have dry combination skin</li>
            <li> taller with different pump head, pale blue tinge and thinner consistency&lt;</li>
            <li> that is not normal.  </li>
            <li> I knew we had hard water problems, but I thought our water softener corrected the problem, but now I am realizing that hard water has minerals that water softeners don&#x27;t remove, but the chelating complex in Dr. Gross&#x27; products target those impurities so they aren&#x27;t able to clog pores and damage your skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is always very dry feeling</li>
            <li> I took a closer look at my trouble spots like around my jawline where lately I&#x27;ve been having cyst like blemishes, my nose where my pores are way too large and I get blackheads no matter what I do, and between my bottom lip and chin</li>
            <li> When you are tired at night, there is so much cleaning and toning that you can handle. .</li>
            <li> My moderate acne has slowly gotten worse over the past couple years and I tried so many products with no success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s and over the past few years I&#x27;ve starting having acne and facial dermatitis issues like never before, and NOTHING helped.  </li>
            <li> and there was a very small amount of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on the cotton pad when I was finished, but less than with my normal foaming cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Tried this after trying a gazillion other cleansers and combos.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it anyone who has felt let down by other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried very expensive special cleansers, toners, moisturizers, etc.  </li>
            <li> I was absolutely shocked that it actually removed my mascara and left my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> HOPING that between Dr. Gross&#x27; products with chelating complex and our water softener and water filter I can eliminate all of our skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, if you have problem skin and nothing seems work, even your dermatologist, then give Dr. Gross&#x27; products with chelating complex a try since it might be your water and not your skin.  </li>
            <li> it can be a little drying if you are using other products with sacylic acid in them</li>
            <li> I bought the cleanser &amp; literally in less than a week my skin was 100% cleared up.</li>
            <li> After cleansing the amount still left on my face was ridiculous</li>
            <li> If you have some slight acne, just keep the cleanser on longer and it will be gone by morning.</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; with Dr. Gross products is that they are expensive, all three items cost over $80</li>
            <li> but it is super shiny and oily at the same time, which drives me insane.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the crappy one for 1-2 months and now I&#x27;ve broken out again with patches of dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The combination is a God send for those of us with oily skin who don&#x27;t like to be dried out!</li>
            <li> and when I started I had small bumps on my forehead,</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about putting this product on my face dry</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to see any difference at all for at least a week</li>
            <li> Been using this wash for years..removes makeup and even eye makeup without irritating eyes..</li>
            <li> I use it in the mornings, at night a use a makeup removing cleanser because I don&#x27;t feel like this product takes all of my make-up off (not great with eye make-up).</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> I assumed that the reason I was breaking out was because I was unable to get all of my makeup off at night.  </li>
            <li> I used this cleanser for almost a month and my Acne continued to get worse!  </li>
            <li> the pores are clogged and unhealthy looking, and I can already see an 80-90% improvement IN JUST ONE USE!!  </li>
            <li> and I was SHOCKED at the difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I never had bad skin but this stuff works wonders!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is FABULOUS.  And this comes from someone who has tried every cleanser known to man.  I have off the charts oily skin and this cleanser is just...in a word: AWESOME.  It leaves my face, soft, fresh and oil free..effortlessly.  I thought I had clear skin before this but WOW, this stuff has taken my skin to a new level of great.  Full disclosure, I do follow it with the Dr. Dennis Gross moisturizer. The combination is a God send for those of us with oily skin who don&#x27;t like to be dried out!</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;VE NOTICED THAT THEY CHANGED THE FORMULA ON THIS PRODUCT RECENTLY.  I JUST TRIED THE NEW PRODUCT &amp;  THE OLD PRODUCT WAS A MUCH BETTER QUALITY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All companies seem to be cheapening the new reformulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally gave this product 5-stars, but that was for the old formula.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I do not like the new formulation.&lt;br /&gt;It does not work in the same, wonderful manner as the old formulation.</li>
            <li> Love this! Paired it with the acne clearing complex, and left my skin beautiful! Best in years! Tried tons of different products but love that this cleanser includes toner. Pores are minimized! Love it Love it!</li>
            <li> After moving into a new home with well water my shin started breaking out for the first time in my life. I racked up to hormones until I talked to someone at Nordstroms who explained that the minerals in water can react to the oils in your skin &amp; create wax that clogs pores. I bought the cleanser &amp; literally in less than a week my skin was 100% cleared up. I have tried this cleaners on my teenage boys with the same results. Excellent cleanser for extra dry skin like mine or oily skin like my boys.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about putting this product on my face dry but boy was I wrong.  You work it into your face as directed and wash it off.  My feels smoothe and my makeup is gone too.  Well worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My previous facial cleanser/toner left me with flaky dryness around my nose.  I had to use a scrub several times a week.  I have been using Dr. Gross&#x27; cleanser/toner for about six weeks and while it leaves my face feeling clean, there is no flaky dryness or peeling around my nose.  I highly recommend this product for anyone with trouble finding the right balance of facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> I purchased Dr. Dennis Gross&#x27;s All-In-One Cleanser with Toner on the recommendation of a friend.  She swore by its effectiveness at cleansing and toning and \\&quot;dissolving\\&quot; her blackheads.  As someone with combination oily skin that is prone to blackheads it sounded like the perfect cleanser.  I remove my make-up each evening with make-up remover but when I purchase a product that claims to remove make-up, I like to do a test run.  The result of this test run?  After cleansing the amount still left on my face was ridiculous and I don&#x27;t wear a lot to begin with.  My mascara was still in place as was my eye shadow and the cotton ball took on the color of my foundation after swiping with a toner.  I continued to use the face wash for a month before giving the remaining amount to a friend.  My skin never felt clean after I used it and the blackheads I was so hoping to be rid of grew in number.  It also caused several breakouts, something that I&#x27;m not prone to normally.  I&#x27;ve had better results with a $6 drugstore cleanser.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, as is the way it reacts to facial products, but this one did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use this at first but the instructions say to put it on your dry face, then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t foam which means it isn&#x27;t drying and it has really helped to clear up my skin. I  had problems with fine little bumps on my forehead or cheeks sometimes but this helps to combat it. it can be a little drying if you are using other products with sacylic acid in them but I would balance it with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> There are apparently 2 different all in one facial cleansers with toner with the exact same name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good one: 6 oz, shorter fatter bottler, pale green tinge and thick consistency&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crappy one that was sent to me: 6.7 oz, taller with different pump head, pale blue tinge and thinner consistency&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good one has kept my skin clear for the last 2 years or so. I&#x27;ve used the crappy one for 1-2 months and now I&#x27;ve broken out again with patches of dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially confusing because I thought I ordered the good one, I was sent the bad one, the review picture is of the good one, but my product picture on my orders page is the bad one.  I hope they haven&#x27;t changed their basic formulation.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so good, and never dries your face out, regardless of the season. If you have some slight acne, just keep the cleanser on longer and it will be gone by morning. I keep buying it, because it works.</li>
            <li> removes all makeup and skin feels clean but not tight. smells great. apply it to dry face with dry hands and massage in, rinse off love it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser does not use water, which freaked me out at first, but now I am hooked! The cleanser makes my face feel clean and tighter, and it smells like I am at the spa!</li>
            <li> I had purchased the Dr. Gross Alpha Beta Daily Face Peels prior to this purchase and was really happy with the results.  After seeking a new face regiment since my Proactive regiment stopped working, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I assumed that the reason I was breaking out was because I was unable to get all of my makeup off at night.  After reading the reviews, it was stated that this product would do just that.  I used this cleanser for almost a month and my Acne continued to get worse!  It indeed took off all of my makeup but contained no additional ingredients to heal and prevent acne.</li>
            <li> This is a different formulation then I used before.  And I like this one better.  It seems to lightly exfoliate too.  Really like this.  Easy to use and satisfies multiple needs - wash, exfoliate, tone.  All of Dr. Gross products have been superior.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I like any product by Dennis Gross, I have tried several and all are great.  This cleanser removes ALL makeup including waterproof mascara and is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> They changed the formula and it is not as good as the original.</li>
            <li> Dr. Gross seems to hit the nail on the head, this time around. . This is a great cleanser, a great toner, and it is&lt;br /&gt;fast. . When you are tired at night, there is so much cleaning and toning that you can handle. . This line does it&lt;br /&gt;beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee Evers</li>
            <li> great face cleanser all in one for guys, too... wont over-dry your skin but good for oily skin, leaves it nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Tried this after trying a gazillion other cleansers and combos. My search is over. I absolutely love this product and I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  I use it twice a day and when I started I had small bumps on my forehead, almost like they were underneath my skin.  After one week of use they are almost gone and I imagine that with a few more weeks of daily use they&#x27;ll be history.</li>
            <li> I use this once daily (in the morning) even though it says to use it twice. I use this as a combination application to maintain my skin. I never had bad skin but this stuff works wonders!</li>
            <li> I have used Dr. Dennis Gross skincare for years but had never tried the facial cleanser until last month.  It is all in ONE and will be a staple in my house now.</li>
            <li> After years of trouble and not having any luck, I stumbled across this amazing product! Love it and the chemical peel pads</li>
            <li> I do have somewhat sensitive skin, but I normally love Dr. Gross skincare products.  This product caused my face to feel and look dry as well as break out.</li>
            <li> A lot to love about this product. The texture.. no fragrance.. easy to apply. Absorbs quickly. I have never paid more than a few dollars for cleansers.. But after trying a sample .. decided to go above and beyond my budget! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a minimalist in many ways... I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of skincare products so when I found out that this is an all-in-one cleanser/toner, I tried it right away. And, it works really well for my oily skin. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have very sensative skin and this product caused my skin to get a few raw red spots.  Love most of Dr. Gross&#x27; products, however, not this one.</li>
            <li> I use the cleanser in the morning and before bed. It thoroughly cleans my skin without any over drying. I have also noticed a more even skin tone, I have a somewhat ruddy complexion that has disappeared since using the All in One Face Cleanser in combination with the  Dr. Dennis Gross Extra Strength Alpha Beta Peel. Using the Peel only 3 or 4 nights a week. I love the glow and healthful radiance my skin has now.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin prone to allergy and acne.  My skin is always very dry feeling but it is super shiny and oily at the same time, which drives me insane.  I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s and over the past few years I&#x27;ve starting having acne and facial dermatitis issues like never before, and NOTHING helped.  Even prescriptions that worked when I was in my teens have done nothing.  I&#x27;ve tried very expensive special cleansers, toners, moisturizers, etc.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from all natural products like homemade goat milk and lye soaps and lotions, to diet changes, and hormone balancing teas, etc., but my skin is constantly irritated, full of blemishes, dry and itchy, and very dull looking.  It is really embarrassing to be this age and my skin looks like I&#x27;m 16...except my skin looked better at 16 than it does now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of desperation I have been scouring the Internet trying to find something else to try when I stumbled across Dr. Gross&#x27; products and after reading about the chelating ingredients I decided to try it since the approach was different-aimed at water impurities causing issues rather than at skin issues.  I ordered the All in One Facial Cleanser with Toner and the Hydra Pure Oil Free Moisture with Chelating Complex through Amazon since it was on sale for a great price, even though the two were over $60 on sale.  The products arrived yesterday, which was just 3 days after I placed my order and 6 days sooner than the estimated arrival date, which was really nice!  Last night I applied the milky cleanser to my dry face and massaged it in for about 2 minutes and then it started itching so I rinsed thoroughly with warm water while massaging my skin until it felt clean.  I was absolutely shocked that it actually removed my mascara and left my skin so soft.  I then wet a cotton pad and went over my face really well to make sure I removed the last bit of make-up and cleanser in case I had missed any...and there was a very small amount of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on the cotton pad when I was finished, but less than with my normal foaming cleanser.  I followed up with the Hydra Pure moisturizer and went to bed, hoping that I wasn&#x27;t allergic this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up this morning I happened to glance in the mirror and I was SHOCKED at the difference in my skin.  I called my husband over and the look on his face said it all; he commented that my skin looked healthier than it has for years.  I could tell he was just as amazed as I was at the difference in the appearance in my skin.  I asked him on a scale of 1-10 what he thought the improvement was and he didn&#x27;t hesitate and said a 10...and I might have to agree!  My skin is looks brighter, smoother, and healthier already-and it is softer than it has felt in 20 years.  I took a closer look at my trouble spots like around my jawline where lately I&#x27;ve been having cyst like blemishes, my nose where my pores are way too large and I get blackheads no matter what I do, and between my bottom lip and chin where I don&#x27;t actually have any blemishes but the pores are clogged and unhealthy looking, and I can already see an 80-90% improvement IN JUST ONE USE!!  I honestly wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I hadn&#x27;t seen the results myself.  I am so excited to see what my skin will look like after I&#x27;ve used these products for a month.  I can&#x27;t stop smiling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products are very expensive when compared to products from the drugstore and even a lot of high end designer products and/or prescription products that I&#x27;ve used through the years, but these are the best results I&#x27;ve ever had, especially overnight, even with products that have been a lot more expensive.  Also, it takes a very small amount of product so unless I use much more product than I need, this facial cleanser should last me at least 6 months with daily morning and evening use.  I can&#x27;t comment on long-term results yet, but I will come back and update my review if anything changes-but for now the results seem miraculous!  I didn&#x27;t expect to see any difference at all for at least a week and I&#x27;ve only used it one time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After thinking about this, I can link my skin issues to about a month after we moved into this house.  I just never connected moving into a different house to my skin issues since I never thought my water could be the problem.  I knew we had hard water problems, but I thought our water softener corrected the problem, but now I am realizing that hard water has minerals that water softeners don&#x27;t remove, but the chelating complex in Dr. Gross&#x27; products target those impurities so they aren&#x27;t able to clog pores and damage your skin.  I just ordered the all over blemish solution to add to the mix as well, since I&#x27;m so pleased with these two products.  Plus, I am putting in a quality shower filter to help remove chlorine and other impurities since other members of my family have developed psoriasis and eczema since moving into this house too.  I can&#x27;t believe I never linked all of our skin issues to our water because it seems so obvious now that we never had these specific issues before moving here.  HOPING that between Dr. Gross&#x27; products with chelating complex and our water softener and water filter I can eliminate all of our skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you have problem skin and nothing seems work, even your dermatologist, then give Dr. Gross&#x27; products with chelating complex a try since it might be your water and not your skin.  Good luck!!</li>
            <li> My daily cleanser. Don&#x27;t forget to put it on a dry face- otherwise it won&#x27;t work well. Good for combination skin.</li>
            <li> Been using this wash for years..removes makeup and even eye makeup without irritating eyes..soft clean skin...good price, cost twice as much in store</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I will order it again when I am finished with the bottle I bought.  Great Product</li>
            <li> I liked this face wash but then I started to breakout more than ever.  I have not broke out in acne in a long time I am 34 years old that is not normal.  I don&#x27;t know if it is attributed to this wash but it is the only thing I have changed.  I don&#x27;t notice a great deal of difference in my skin so I can&#x27;t give it great stars, I want to see results not wonder ?is this working?</li>
            <li> I have dry combination skin and I break out if I don&#x27;t cleanse thoroughly as well as sensitivity to most cleansers or soaps. This Dr. Dennis Gross cleanser helps with the sensitivity, oiliness and dryness !!! I would recommend it anyone who has felt let down by other brands.</li>
            <li> I have been using a daily regimen of the All Over Blemish Solution, Dr Gross&#x27; All in One Facial Cleanser with Toner and Dr Gross&#x27; Extra Strength Alpha Beta Daily Face Peel for almost a month now and am really happy with the results. My moderate acne has slowly gotten worse over the past couple years and I tried so many products with no success. After reading other reviews on Dr Gross products I decided to give it a try. The products are not irritating to my skin, in comparison with other brands that sting and burn, this is a nice change! My skin feels much more supple and soft; no more dry, flaky skin! The amount of breakouts I have along with the recovery time is much less and the pores around nose have diminished significantly. My boyfriend could tell a difference after the first week, I hadn&#x27;t told him I changed my products. Hopefully, It&#x27;ll just get better and better with continued use. The only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; with Dr. Gross products is that they are expensive, all three items cost over $80 but if they do the trick I will gladly pay the price!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this stuff is a miracle worker but it definately leaves my face clean and glowing. I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past few weeks and it works great. No complaints at all! This is definetely the real thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Dr.  Gross fan, I&#x27;ve been using the cleanser/ with toner for over a year and I really like it.  I use it in the mornings, at night a use a makeup removing cleanser because I don&#x27;t feel like this product takes all of my make-up off (not great with eye make-up).</li>
