            <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen is the best bar none and</li>
            <li>This line is the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>It soaks in after a while, as does the sealant (which I love!!!).</li>
            <li>Amazing skin product!!</li>
            <li>On the up side: my face feels awesome, and I love using these products!</li>
            <li>The face polisher that you use 2-3 times a week in place of the face wash is great.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great scent.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this!!   </li>
            <li>It has also cleared my face up very nicely.</li>
            <li>It has my skin behaving very nicely.</li>
            <li>These products are amazing!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled with my skin!</li>
            <li>I also have rosacia, and this has made a remarkable difference with that as well.</li>
            <li>The products feel great on, and they make my skin feel nice.  </li>
            <li>My forehead lines are fairly pronounced</li>
            <li>After about an hour, I did my makeup, but instead of using foundation, I used Mary Kay tinted moisturizer and was amazed at how good my skin looked.</li>
            <li>Maybe all of the good reviews were by people who were paid.</li>
            <li>Feels great :)</li>
            <li>It smells so good - its kind of citrusy.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is definately a better investment!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I did like the smell of each product in the kit - the citrus is refreshing and pleasant to smell.  </li>
            <li>It is an amazing difference.</li>
            <li>My skin has also cleared up and feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is working nicely for me.</li>
            <li>Honestly, even if it doesn&#x27;t dramamtically reduce my lines, I would still use the stuff.</li>
            <li>It removes all my make-up and dirt effectively without stripping my skin.  </li>
            <li>the nightcream is spectacular.  </li>
            <li>it feels amazing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Within the first week I had fellow employees commenting on how great I was looking.</li>
            <li>(I also have fair, sensative skin and have had no bad reaction)</li>
            <li>I noticed that those lines didn&#x27;t seem as prominent within a week</li>
            <li>I look in the mirror amazed and feel more confident for it.</li>
            <li>The Accelerating Booster pen is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Use the Accelerating Booster Wrinkle Corrector on top of the moisturizer and it creates a seal to keep the moisture in.</li>
            <li>but I can tell that my skin has more of a glow.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the cleanser because of the tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>I am thinking about signing up to receive it automatically every so many months.</li>
            <li>The day cream is only sliiiighty greasy, which is impressive since it has spf.</li>
            <li>I love the grapefruit sent too.</li>
            <li>Both so light but so effective.</li>
            <li>Hope this review helps!! :)</li>
            <li>I have been using this product now for over a month and have found no difference in my skin except more oil.</li>
            <li>Every morning and night, I look forward to using the Face Wash because I am so drawn to the refreshing citrus scent and fizzling effect.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, smells nice  and makes my skin feel healthy.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that worked on deminishing my increasingly prominent wrinklage.</li>
            <li>After two weeks the lines around my eyes were more noticeable than when I started using the product.  </li>
            <li>Mostly I want to get away from liquid foundation products that are no longer flattering.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use what I have and see if the results continue before I order more.</li>
            <li>I do find I put more on at night than maybe i should.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years.</li>
            <li>The cleanser and mask have to be the two most unique products I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It did improve the brightness of my skin, which was certainly noticeable to me, but I do not think these products are ideal for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and it has already made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>With my regular eye makeup, mascara and cream blush, it all looked great.    </li>
            <li>My skin was so dry that it even hurt, now my skin is so smooth and feels great.</li>
            <li>First of all, it smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with the promptness of the delivery and had no problems, with the exception that when I took the cap off the booster, it pretty much went all over everyplace - contents must have been under pressure - no way to know that would happen.  </li>
            <li>My skin no longer has dry patches and it feels great.</li>
            <li>I would have liked the night moisturizer to have a more lasting effect.  </li>
            <li>I assumed my skin was adjusting, so I gave it the full 30 days before I wrote this review.  </li>
            <li>And it foams up and tingles tremendously.</li>
            <li>The wrinkle treatment is super silky, I use it at night after I moisturize.</li>
            <li>The night cream is rich, soft and silky yet it&#x27;s very light, it doesn&#x27;t make you feel like your re-clogging your face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally like having any scent on my face, but this is a refreshing scent that I look forward to.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and most products in the \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; realm caused quite a bit of irritation and drying.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is very silky and light.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just more comfortable overall.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly suprised with the cleanser which turns into a million little bubbles after you rub it into your skin, then you just leave it on until all the bubbles pop and eliminate dirt, oil, ect..</li>
            <li>Smart!</li>
            <li>But I love the products, personally.  </li>
            <li>Once I hit the age of 30, I understand how important to start using a skincare line that offers anti-aging benefits.  </li>
            <li>but I sure feel like I have younger skin - on my face anyway.</li>
            <li>First I used the foaming cleanser, then the day moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Having been a skin freak since I was 15 and making egg white facials, I can truly say I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>lol I let it sit and dry, and then do a last bit of scrubbing on my spots that tend to get blackheads.</li>
            <li>I can really see a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the citrus is too intense.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the PM creme feels a bit greasy but at night it doesn&#x27;t bother me since I don&#x27;t plan on impressing anyone when I am getting ready for bed.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, I really look forward to using this stuff every night.     </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product to add to your daily face routine.</li>
            <li>The winkles are so much noticeable.</li>
            <li>that say, \\&quot;You may put this on your body,\\&quot; only to find out that most products are no where near as</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I am 70 years old, have good skin with very few wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>The dry spots have disappeared, my skin looks and feels hydrated, soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>so I never worried about looking older</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an issue with acne - only the occasional blemish but this stuff has my face looking and feeling so smooth!</li>
            <li>I put the Wrinkle corrector on some fine lines above my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>the mindset that most of the anti wrinkle products are not very effective..</li>
            <li>I developed several under the skin-type acne bumps, something I rarely, rarely get.  </li>
            <li>I bought Timeless Secrets the first week in July and got it the second week.</li>
            <li>As far as delivering on the anti aging promises, I&#x27;m not sure;  I&#x27;m 42, but don&#x27;t have many signs of aging at all.  </li>
            <li>It does smell nice but my skin actually got drier than it usually is.</li>
            <li>The product felt very good when first applied, but in a couple of hours, my face begin to feel very tight and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>That being said, the pros far outweight the cons &amp; I</li>
            <li>For someone with very oily skin like mine, finding non-greasy, water based products is crucial.</li>
            <li>I will probably post another review after a month but based off of what I&#x27;ve seen so far, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected without that greasy feeling like other products leave on your skin when applying.</li>
            <li>So, that particular product, being such a tiny tube, really didn&#x27;t last but 4 or 5 days</li>
            <li>At 49 years, almost 50, I noticed fine lines around my eyes and mouth plus a few fairly deep lines on my forehead and neck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Timeless Secret for several months now and find the Accelerating Booster Wrinkle Corrector simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I had college students and were amazed that I was old enough to have children that old.</li>
            <li>My skin produces MAJOR oil.</li>
            <li>Timeless Secret has restored for me that youthful glow that we all long to keep and just has my skin looking more radiant and clearer than ever!  </li>
            <li>I think citrus every day is simply too drying for sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>but I am definitely liking what I am seeing so far.</li>
            <li>It was as if it dried and evaporated right away</li>
            <li>Just as a point of reference, I am a 29 yr old african american woman.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the smell of Timeless Secret, but that&#x27;s easy to get past if the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>The Day Moisturizer and Night Treatment have balanced my skin from extremely oily T-zones to normal combination skin type.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and I am actually finding that it is producing less oil as well.     </li>
            <li>acne prone skin &amp; I have seen a huge improvement since I began using Timeless Secret.  </li>

            <li> So, that particular product, being such a tiny tube, really didn&#x27;t last but 4 or 5 days</li>
            <li> At 49 years, almost 50, I noticed fine lines around my eyes and mouth plus a few fairly deep lines on my forehead and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Timeless Secret for several months now and find the Accelerating Booster Wrinkle Corrector simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I had college students and were amazed that I was old enough to have children that old.</li>
            <li> My skin produces MAJOR oil.</li>
            <li> Timeless Secret has restored for me that youthful glow that we all long to keep and just has my skin looking more radiant and clearer than ever!  </li>
            <li> I think citrus every day is simply too drying for sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> but I am definitely liking what I am seeing so far.</li>
            <li> It was as if it dried and evaporated right away</li>
            <li> Just as a point of reference, I am a 29 yr old african american woman.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell of Timeless Secret, but that&#x27;s easy to get past if the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li> The Day Moisturizer and Night Treatment have balanced my skin from extremely oily T-zones to normal combination skin type.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and I am actually finding that it is producing less oil as well.     </li>
            <li> acne prone skin &amp; I have seen a huge improvement since I began using Timeless Secret.  </li>
            <li> If you want a decent skin care product, cheaper with some results, go with Aveeno natural shiiitake complex.</li>
            <li> However, Timeless Secret is a rare exception, it does just what the advertisment states that it does!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that there&#x27;s any non prescription cream that will do what it says it will do if it works for you and is worth the money other than purchase it</li>
            <li> , instead I&#x27;ll use my old standby Pond&#x27;s Original Cold Cream.    </li>
            <li> I love that you can feel it working if you opt to let it sit, although I can barely stand it because it foams up so much that it tickles like crazy!!</li>
            <li> There is a strange chemical smell &amp; I find jar packaging unsanitary.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Miraculous\\&quot; as what they are advertised to be and a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> My goal is to keep my youth looking skin for as long as I can.  </li>
            <li> I saw the infomercial on Timeless Secret and thought it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> but let me tell you, this company is NOT the right place to purchase Time Secret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 40 with dry skin and Winter</li>
            <li> My face never looks or feels dry after using this stuff.</li>
            <li> As far as outcome I see very little in the way of reducing find wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Team that with the dry patches it left and the acne, and my skin was a mess.  </li>
            <li> If you go to time secrets website you can get these product (the wrinkle corrector being much bigger) plus the scrubbing cream for LESS than you can buy it here.</li>
            <li> The AM creme is less greasy and actually helps my under-eye concealer glide on easier.</li>
            <li> I also developed several dry patches that were uncomfortable and would burn any time I applied the lotion.  </li>
            <li> I carry it around all day and just apply it when I feel a little dry.  </li>
            <li> Slightly greasy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably spent a small fortune on lotions and potions, gels and everything in between (on and off infomercials)</li>
            <li> I noticed little lines on my forehead this past Winter and needed something that works since I prefer to wear minimal makeup - sometimes eyeliner and maybe a lip gloss.    </li>
            <li> My skin was looking dull and dry.</li>
            <li> My skin was still a little oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I have no qualms with the stuff and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference in my forehead lines.</li>
            <li> Plus, with all of the products, a little goes a loooong way!</li>
            <li> The down side: products are very small.</li>
            <li> Before, after washing my face, it would look dull, as well as look AND feel dried out.</li>
            <li> is hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> The day cream has SPF 20 yet it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re putting on thick, stinky sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I spend days on end inside my house working on renovation projects and my skin was having a bad reaction to dust, chemicals, not enough sunshine-vitamin D.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Timeless Secret for a about a month</li>
            <li> My skin is oily to begin with and this just makes it worse.</li>
            <li> I am a skincare junkie, but nothing works as well as Timeless Secret.</li>
            <li> I believe Timeless Secret can help me with that.</li>
            <li> I may continue to use Revlon Eterna 20 periodically along with the Timeless Secret.</li>
            <li> They never went away during my use of these products, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> My bad.  </li>
            <li> Completely worthless!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE this!!   First of all, it smells fantastic!  I don&#x27;t normally like having any scent on my face, but this is a refreshing scent that I look forward to.  The products feel great on, and they make my skin feel nice.  As far as delivering on the anti aging promises, I&#x27;m not sure;  I&#x27;m 42, but don&#x27;t have many signs of aging at all.  I&#x27;ve only had the products about a week, and I think my skin looks plumper, but it could be my imagination.  But I love the products, personally.  (I also have fair, sensative skin and have had no bad reaction)</li>
            <li> I saw this on an infomercial for 29.95 and thought why not? IQ Derma Skinceuticals didn&#x27;t work for me. The RestorEyes did and I&#x27;m not giving it up. I&#x27;m over 40 with dry skin and Winter is hard on my skin. I noticed little lines on my forehead this past Winter and needed something that works since I prefer to wear minimal makeup - sometimes eyeliner and maybe a lip gloss.    I bought Timeless Secrets the first week in July and got it the second week. I noticed that those lines didn&#x27;t seem as prominent within a week and it advertises itself as working in 14 days. When I look in the mirror my eyes were&#x27;t drawn to my forehead. I think the AM/PM face wash with salycilic acid is a key. The face polisher that you use 2-3 times a week in place of the face wash is great. In the package was also a day cream with SPF 20, night cream and wrinkle booster.    The prime key is the wrinkle booster that you use to lock in the day cream over known wrinkles. It keeps your face hydrated where you need it and it minimizes the wrinkles throughout the day. It doesn&#x27;t wear of. I had to minimize the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; by rubbing it into my skin. I use it on my forehead, under my eyes, and around my mouth once in the AM and once in the PM after washing and putting on the day or night cream.     I&#x27;ve had several compliments that my skin looks \\&quot;dewey\\&quot; and that I don&#x27;t have wrinkles. I know I do, but I think they have been minimized by the various ingredients in Timeless Secrets. I&#x27;ll be reordering. You can order whatever number of products you like when you want for a set package fee whenever you like - every 3, 6, 9 months, etc. I&#x27;ll definitely be reordering and that&#x27;s saying something.    Like everything else, I didn&#x27;t expect it to work, but now in retrospect, I wish I&#x27;d have taken before and after pictures. I look in the mirror amazed and feel more confident for it. I&#x27;ve found myself \\&quot;forgetting\\&quot; to put on even my eyeliner and I&#x27;m just more comfortable overall. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I like this product but buying it from this merchant was a mistake. If you go to time secrets website you can get these product (the wrinkle corrector being much bigger) plus the scrubbing cream for LESS than you can buy it here. I got this as a gift for x-mas so i didn&#x27;t bother returning it but let me tell you, this company is NOT the right place to purchase Time Secret.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the promptness of the delivery and had no problems, with the exception that when I took the cap off the booster, it pretty much went all over everyplace - contents must have been under pressure - no way to know that would happen.  So, that particular product, being such a tiny tube, really didn&#x27;t last but 4 or 5 days and it should have lasted 30.  Not the fault of the shipper.  I did like the product enuf to call the company and get on the auto ship program.  This seller is A+ in my book.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Timeless Secret for a about a month and I&#x27;m thrilled with my skin! It smells so good - its kind of citrusy. My friends keep complimenting my skin.  The Accelerating Booster pen is my favorite. I carry it around all day and just apply it when I feel a little dry.  I can really see a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Timeless Secret for several months now and find the Accelerating Booster Wrinkle Corrector simply amazing. This product that keeps in the moisturizer has made a big difference in the way the skin on my face and neck looks and feels! The concept makes sense. Use the Accelerating Booster Wrinkle Corrector on top of the moisturizer and it creates a seal to keep the moisture in. Smart!</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit and I have mixed feelings about it.  It did improve the brightness of my skin, which was certainly noticeable to me, but I do not think these products are ideal for people with sensitive skin.  Maybe the citrus is too intense.  I developed several under the skin-type acne bumps, something I rarely, rarely get.  I assumed my skin was adjusting, so I gave it the full 30 days before I wrote this review.  They never went away during my use of these products, unfortunately.  I also developed several dry patches that were uncomfortable and would burn any time I applied the lotion.  I think citrus every day is simply too drying for sensitive skin.    I did like the smell of each product in the kit - the citrus is refreshing and pleasant to smell.  The Wrinkle Booster, however was greasy and where ever I applied it, it left my skin oily.  Team that with the dry patches it left and the acne, and my skin was a mess.  It has since recovered since I switched to Eclos products.</li>
            <li> I still have have 4 days until the 14 days but I can tell that my skin has more of a glow. I don&#x27;t know about 10 years younger but definitely a glow. I have always looked younger than my age so I never worried about looking older but I thought I should start using something to protect and preserve the skin I have so I thought I would try this since it seems to take the place of multiple products. Yes, the PM creme feels a bit greasy but at night it doesn&#x27;t bother me since I don&#x27;t plan on impressing anyone when I am getting ready for bed. The AM creme is less greasy and actually helps my under-eye concealer glide on easier. My favorite is the cleanser because of the tingling sensation. You not only see if fizz but you feel it too. Now that I have tried it I am thinking about signing up to receive it automatically every so many months.</li>
            <li> On the up side: my face feels awesome, and I love using these products! I have oiily, acne prone skin &amp; I have seen a huge improvement since I began using Timeless Secret.  The down side: products are very small. There is a strange chemical smell &amp; I find jar packaging unsanitary.  That being said, the pros far outweight the cons &amp; I will purchase this product again and again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably spent a small fortune on lotions and potions, gels and everything in between (on and off infomercials) that say, \\&quot;You may put this on your body,\\&quot; only to find out that most products are no where near as \\&quot;Miraculous\\&quot; as what they are advertised to be and a complete waste of money.  However, Timeless Secret is a rare exception, it does just what the advertisment states that it does!  Timeless Secret has restored for me that youthful glow that we all long to keep and just has my skin looking more radiant and clearer than ever!  I&#x27;ve been using the product for only a week and it has already made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Well they claim you&#x27;ll look younger in 14 days. It hasn&#x27;t quite been fourteen days but I am definitely liking what I am seeing so far. My skin is noticeably brighter. Before, after washing my face, it would look dull, as well as look AND feel dried out. My face never looks or feels dry after using this stuff. It has also cleared my face up very nicely. I don&#x27;t have an issue with acne - only the occasional blemish but this stuff has my face looking and feeling so smooth! My skin is very oily and I am actually finding that it is producing less oil as well.     For someone with very oily skin like mine, finding non-greasy, water based products is crucial. This stuff is working nicely for me. The day cream is only sliiiighty greasy, which is impressive since it has spf. Doesn&#x27;t leave a ghostly film at all on my face either. It soaks in after a while, as does the sealant (which I love!!!). The same for the night cream. Slightly greasy but if my skin can handle it I think anyone&#x27;s can! lol My skin produces MAJOR oil. I love the grapefruit sent too. The cleanser and mask have to be the two most unique products I&#x27;ve ever tried. Both so light but so effective. The cleanser is very silky and light. It foams and suds up only a bit. However it leaves my skin feeling great!! The mask is awesome! Not too abrasive. Great scent. And it foams up and tingles tremendously. I love that you can feel it working if you opt to let it sit, although I can barely stand it because it foams up so much that it tickles like crazy!! lol I let it sit and dry, and then do a last bit of scrubbing on my spots that tend to get blackheads. Rinse and whew!! Feels great :) Plus, with all of the products, a little goes a loooong way! Like others have said, I really look forward to using this stuff every night.     I have no qualms with the stuff and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference in my forehead lines. However!! I have seen a noticeable difference and it hasn&#x27;t even been 2 weeks. Plus, I give any product a month to dramatically reduce lines - unless it breaks me out. Honestly, even if it doesn&#x27;t dramamtically reduce my lines, I would still use the stuff. It has my skin behaving very nicely. I will probably post another review after a month but based off of what I&#x27;ve seen so far, I&#x27;d recommend it. Especially for us oily skin folks. Just as a point of reference, I am a 29 yr old african american woman. My forehead lines are fairly pronounced but I don&#x27;t have wrinkles anywhere else. Hope this review helps!! :)</li>
            <li> Do not spend your money on this item! Completely worthless! I have been using this product now for over a month and have found no difference in my skin except more oil. My skin is oily to begin with and this just makes it worse. If you want a decent skin care product, cheaper with some results, go with Aveeno natural shiiitake complex. I would invest in this skin care line again. When I was using this product I did find a difference. My skin was still a little oily but I had a smoother,fresher look with fading age spots. This is definately a better investment!</li>
            <li> I am a skincare junkie, but nothing works as well as Timeless Secret. Every morning and night, I look forward to using the Face Wash because I am so drawn to the refreshing citrus scent and fizzling effect.  It removes all my make-up and dirt effectively without stripping my skin.  The Day Moisturizer and Night Treatment have balanced my skin from extremely oily T-zones to normal combination skin type.  The Booster seals in the moisture to areas that need an extra boost. Once I hit the age of 30, I understand how important to start using a skincare line that offers anti-aging benefits.  My goal is to keep my youth looking skin for as long as I can.  I believe Timeless Secret can help me with that.</li>
            <li> My skin was looking dull and dry. I spend days on end inside my house working on renovation projects and my skin was having a bad reaction to dust, chemicals, not enough sunshine-vitamin D. So I did some research and decided to give this product a try. I was pleasantly suprised with the cleanser which turns into a million little bubbles after you rub it into your skin, then you just leave it on until all the bubbles pop and eliminate dirt, oil, ect.. it feels amazing and refreshing. The night cream is rich, soft and silky yet it&#x27;s very light, it doesn&#x27;t make you feel like your re-clogging your face. It smells refreshing and feels amazing. The wrinkle treatment is super silky, I use it at night after I moisturize. The day cream has SPF 20 yet it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re putting on thick, stinky sunscreen. It goes on smooth, smells nice  and makes my skin feel healthy. It&#x27;s been one week and I have seen a visable difference. The dry spots have disappeared, my skin looks and feels hydrated, soft and healthy. This is a fantastic product to add to your daily face routine.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that worked on deminishing my increasingly prominent wrinklage. At 49 years, almost 50, I noticed fine lines around my eyes and mouth plus a few fairly deep lines on my forehead and neck. YUK! My skin is very sensitive and most products in the \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; realm caused quite a bit of irritation and drying. I saw the infomercial on Timeless Secret and thought it was worth a shot. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week and I love it! My skin no longer has dry patches and it feels great. I don&#x27;t know if I look younger but I sure feel like I have younger skin - on my face anyway. When will they come out with a total body care system? LOL!!!</li>
            <li> The product felt very good when first applied, but in a couple of hours, my face begin to feel very tight and uncomfortable.  After two weeks the lines around my eyes were more noticeable than when I started using the product.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Within the first week I had fellow employees commenting on how great I was looking. Customers that I was chatting with found out I had college students and were amazed that I was old enough to have children that old. It is an amazing difference. Very happy with this purchase. I also have rosacia, and this has made a remarkable difference with that as well.</li>
            <li> I received my order yesterday.  First I used the foaming cleanser, then the day moisturizer.  I put the Wrinkle corrector on some fine lines above my upper lip.  After about an hour, I did my makeup, but instead of using foundation, I used Mary Kay tinted moisturizer and was amazed at how good my skin looked. With my regular eye makeup, mascara and cream blush, it all looked great.    I am 70 years old, have good skin with very few wrinkles.  Mostly I want to get away from liquid foundation products that are no longer flattering.  I don&#x27;t care for the smell of Timeless Secret, but that&#x27;s easy to get past if the results are worth it.  I&#x27;ll use what I have and see if the results continue before I order more. I don&#x27;t think I will reorder the Foam Cleanser, instead I&#x27;ll use my old standby Pond&#x27;s Original Cold Cream.    I would have liked the night moisturizer to have a more lasting effect.  It was as if it dried and evaporated right away and my face didn&#x27;t feel moisturized.  I may continue to use Revlon Eterna 20 periodically along with the Timeless Secret.</li>
            <li> Amazing skin product!! Better than I expected without that greasy feeling like other products leave on your skin when applying.</li>
            <li> Having been a skin freak since I was 15 and making egg white facials, I can truly say I LOVE this product.  It works with my skin type and I see a big difference in my skin.  The sunscreen is the best bar none and the nightcream is spectacular.  I do find I put more on at night than maybe i should.  I seem to run out before the 30 day supply is up. My bad.  Thanks for asking I highly recommend this product.  Company discontinued product, but was overjoyed to find it on Amazon. Just for the record my biological age is 65.  Nobody believes me.</li>
            <li> These products are amazing! I have tried many products over the years. This line is the best I have ever tried. My skin has also cleared up and feels amazing.  Even my husband noticed the differance too.  I look forward to using the products.  My skin was so dry that it even hurt, now my skin is so smooth and feels great. The winkles are so much noticeable. Love it!</li>
            <li> Im of. the mindset that most of the anti wrinkle products are not very effective.. I believe that this product falls in that category. It is 50 dollars 4 a 2 week supply. As far as outcome I see very little in the way of reducing find wrinkles. I&#x27;m not sure that there&#x27;s any non prescription cream that will do what it says it will do if it works for you and is worth the money other than purchase it</li>
            <li> I cannot see a bit of difference. Maybe all of the good reviews were by people who were paid. It does smell nice but my skin actually got drier than it usually is.</li>
