            <li>but for now I think I need a waterproof mascara or eyeliner LOL.</li>
            <li>Recommend this to my friends &amp; family &amp; they thank me for sharing this great find.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great solution</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>One of the best products I have ever used .. Love it</li>
            <li>Stays on for a good time as well.</li>
            <li>try another brand, the quality is just as good.</li>
            <li>It does a fairly good job in covering my &amp;#34;skunk stripe&amp;#34; in between colorings, but I&#x27;ve noticed that by day&#x27;s end, the gray is somewhat visible again.  </li>
            <li>It has the best coverage, the color is perfect and it doesn&#x27;t cause a problem when you go to get your actual permanent color done.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Covers nicely.</li>
            <li>An excellent product, quick &amp; easy touch-up for in between my visits to the beauty salon.</li>
            <li>After trying alot of hair dyes and touch up products I find this is the most effective for inbetween coloring.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; solutions and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>So glad I discovered it at Sephora.</li>
            <li>I would always order more .</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use this product unless something newer and more user-friendly comes on the market to try.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I think the spray idea will work better with those that have a lot of gray hairs all over the head</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff saves me a bundle</li>
            <li>Just make sure to hold it about 5 or 6 inches from your head when you spray.</li>
            <li>I would have been better off using mascara as a touch up.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I used to cover grey.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use ans stays on longer until shampood out.</li>
            <li>Does the trick and so easily.  </li>
            <li>Plus you can smell the strong chemicals in this product.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be very useful for the couple of weeks before return to the hairdresser.</li>
            <li>The color was fine, however it rubbed off onto any material it came into contact with and the product ran out quickly.</li>
            <li>Just purchased this at Sephora and I was so excited about this.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I bought 3 different root concealers and this was by far the best  </li>
            <li>I find it best to use if you style your hair as normal and then just spray the grey bits that show ie at a parting and temples.</li>
            <li>it would be good if it were more brown than black.  </li>
            <li>A little spray on the roots, and I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
            <li>Best color spray out there&amp;#62; does not leak on to your face if you sweat or touch it, will stay for a few days even if you wash your hair gently.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it when you haven&#x27;t got time to get the regrowth</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll be washing your hair more frequently.</li>
            <li>Love this root concealer, easy to use, and covers grey regrowth.</li>
            <li>Just spray it right on, and that is it.</li>
            <li>the shipping was Lighting fast!</li>
            <li>Would love if they sell it in a larger quantity.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it is quite expensive, although effective - after a bit of practice - first attempt I thought it was rubbish, but after a bit of practice its very good, certainly better than seeing grey roots.  </li>
            <li>so greys show up, this covers them very well</li>
            <li>When used that way, the color comes out too fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>This does the trick and not thick &amp; tacky like Bumble &amp; Bumble.</li>
            <li>There is this that I might try and I think will work better for my needs:  Touchback instant grey root touch.  </li>
            <li>Allergic to hair dye, henna, natural products.</li>
            <li>Traveling and in between salon visits, I unfortunately ran out of Style Edit (a far superior product) and picked up Rita Hazan at a drugstore.</li>
            <li>This one is a lot more expensive but it works really really well.</li>
            <li>The overspray can ruin clothes if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>Just wish the bottle was bigger and it was less expensive but great product for my hair.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li>Not only does my hair grow fast, but I have plenty of white, and my natural color is dark brown.  </li>
            <li>I am only 36 years old but started noticing some gray hairs just along the hairline above my temples and above the ears.  </li>
            <li>If you scratch your head, it may come off with a little shade on your fingers or fingernails, but will not come off on your clothing (unlike a certain well-known brand of powder color).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Just wish the bottle was bigger and it was less expensive but great product for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li> Not only does my hair grow fast, but I have plenty of white, and my natural color is dark brown.  </li>
            <li> I am only 36 years old but started noticing some gray hairs just along the hairline above my temples and above the ears.  </li>
            <li> If you scratch your head, it may come off with a little shade on your fingers or fingernails, but will not come off on your clothing (unlike a certain well-known brand of powder color).</li>
            <li> Also note that one bottle does not last very long.  </li>
            <li> so I still had grey after I got my color.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty obvious and just not a great look</li>
            <li> Looks natural - just be aware of not spraying to close to your hairline - it can look weird.</li>
            <li> I have Asian black hair and this covers all my white!</li>
            <li> Can go a few extra days before next hair color.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to spray to close or for too long</li>
            <li> small bottle will last me several months.</li>
            <li> I give it three stars because it matches my hair color very well, which (as any brunette knows), can be tough.</li>
            <li> only say that it&#x27;s very very dark</li>
            <li> It only works on very dark hair.</li>
            <li> However, when I used it for the first (and last time), I was shocked to find that it spray painted my scalp an barely got my hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge on bed linen or run if your hair gets wet.  </li>
            <li> One also has to be careful when spraying because it can get everwhere.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t cover the gray that well, it makes your hair feel stiff and gross, and it doesn&#x27;t come out with shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the finish matte dull and dry looking, the color rubs off on everything!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if the can was bigger at least twice the size for the price.</li>
            <li> Also, as with any spray, it is difficult to concentrate the spray to only the area needing coverage, even with the thin nozzle provided, unless you hold the can very very close to your hair.  </li>
            <li> Literally about less than 48 hours to my door, which is a miracle by Amazon standards.</li>
            <li> One less star for the price.</li>
            <li> It hid the grey and let me go at least another week before I had to dye my hair.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair look dull and dry.</li>
            <li> A little spritz does the trick.  </li>
            <li> so I can stall a little longer from getting my grays done.</li>
            <li> I read the directions carefully and it turned my hair hard</li>
            <li> I thought this was for my few grays in between colored glaze treatments.  </li>
            <li> It can make your hair feel a bit stiff, but if you comb it the stiffness softens without removing the dye.  </li>
            <li> For the price , there is very little product in the spray container.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is expensive for just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Being a spray, it&#x27;s hard to keep from spraying onto skin, the forehead and temple areas.</li>
            <li> It looks fake but it does cover the gray.</li>
            <li> Its VERY difficult to spray WITHOUT getting your scalp sprayed as well.  </li>
            <li> Very awkward to use.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Work well on hiding my grays in the front.  Stays on for a good time as well.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have ever used .. Love it</li>
            <li> it makes my hair look dull and dry. It looks fake but it does cover the gray. Being a spray, it&#x27;s hard to keep from spraying onto skin, the forehead and temple areas. I&#x27;m back to using mascara to cover my grays.</li>
            <li> For the price , there is very little product in the spray container.  try another brand, the quality is just as good.</li>
            <li> After trying alot of hair dyes and touch up products I find this is the most effective for inbetween coloring.  The only drawback is that it is quite expensive, although effective - after a bit of practice - first attempt I thought it was rubbish, but after a bit of practice its very good, certainly better than seeing grey roots.  I have dark brown hair so greys show up, this covers them very well and I find I can postpone colouring my hair for about two weeks if I wash my hair every three days or so.  I find it best to use if you style your hair as normal and then just spray the grey bits that show ie at a parting and temples. I don&#x27;t bother with the underneath greys.  It can make your hair feel a bit stiff, but if you comb it the stiffness softens without removing the dye.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge on bed linen or run if your hair gets wet.  Washes out with ease when you wash your hair. I would have given it 5 stars if the can was bigger at least twice the size for the price.</li>
            <li> Ladies you don&#x27;t need to think twice. This is your answer for covering your roots between coloring. Easy to apply. Will last until you wash your hair. So glad I discovered it at Sephora. Just reordered from amazon. I can&#x27;t live with it!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very useful for the couple of weeks before return to the hairdresser. Great for my confidence.</li>
            <li> Love this root concealer, easy to use, and covers grey regrowth. Can go a few extra days before next hair color.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well.</li>
            <li> I was very happy. It worked and did the job . I would always order more . It was great</li>
            <li> Perfect coverage for my roots. Covers nicely. Just wish the bottle was bigger and it was less expensive but great product for my hair.</li>
            <li> i read review...best one I have tried.  I reccommend. It&#x27;s easy to use ans stays on longer until shampood out. great product&lt;br /&gt;\all i can say.</li>
            <li> Allergic to hair dye, henna, natural products. This does the trick and not thick &amp; tacky like Bumble &amp; Bumble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spray root concealer for about 3 years.  It does a fairly good job in covering my &amp;#34;skunk stripe&amp;#34; in between colorings, but I&#x27;ve noticed that by day&#x27;s end, the gray is somewhat visible again.  Also, as with any spray, it is difficult to concentrate the spray to only the area needing coverage, even with the thin nozzle provided, unless you hold the can very very close to your hair.  When used that way, the color comes out too fast.  Holding the can further away, as per directions, can lead to color being sprayed where you don&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use this product unless something newer and more user-friendly comes on the market to try.  Also note that one bottle does not last very long.  I order two at at time.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t cover the gray that well, it makes your hair feel stiff and gross, and it doesn&#x27;t come out with shampoo.  I&#x27;ve washed my hair twice vigorously and I can still feel it in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of these and most look fake and don&#x27;t match. This one is a lot more expensive but it works really really well. Totally worth it when you haven&#x27;t got time to get the regrowth done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d only say that it&#x27;s very very dark it would be good if it were more brown than black.  It only works on very dark hair.</li>
            <li> Works great in a hurry. This is one of the best products I used to cover grey. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I loved Rita Hazan Root Concealer!  I bought 3 different root concealers and this was by far the best  It&#x27;s perfect!  Looks great!!!!</li>
            <li> Best color spray out there&amp;#62; does not leak on to your face if you sweat or touch it, will stay for a few days even if you wash your hair gently. If you scratch your head, it may come off with a little shade on your fingers or fingernails, but will not come off on your clothing (unlike a certain well-known brand of powder color). the shipping was Lighting fast! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Literally about less than 48 hours to my door, which is a miracle by Amazon standards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; solutions and this is by far the best. It has the best coverage, the color is perfect and it doesn&#x27;t cause a problem when you go to get your actual permanent color done. I used one of those marker type concealers and it didn&#x27;t allow the dye to get in so I still had grey after I got my color. But this one does not do that. It is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> A little spritz does the trick.  Applicator allows you to get product where you need it. Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The color was fine, however it rubbed off onto any material it came into contact with and the product ran out quickly.</li>
            <li> This concealer has saved me from coloring my hair every two weeks.  Not only does my hair grow fast, but I have plenty of white, and my natural color is dark brown.  A little spray on the roots, and I&#x27;m good to go!  This will wash out with each shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small bottle will last me several months.</li>
            <li> The overspray can ruin clothes if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this at Sephora and I was so excited about this.  I am only 36 years old but started noticing some gray hairs just along the hairline above my temples and above the ears.  Its VERY difficult to spray WITHOUT getting your scalp sprayed as well.  Looks pretty obvious and just not a great look LOL.  I think the spray idea will work better with those that have a lot of gray hairs all over the head but for now I think I need a waterproof mascara or eyeliner LOL. There is this that I might try and I think will work better for my needs:  Touchback instant grey root touch.  It looks like a marker and its waterproof.</li>
            <li> An excellent product, quick &amp; easy touch-up for in between my visits to the beauty salon. Definitely worth every penny! Recommend this to my friends &amp; family &amp; they thank me for sharing this great find.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Definitely works in a pinch but you&#x27;ll be washing your hair more frequently.</li>
            <li> Does the trick and so easily.  Just spray it right on, and that is it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for &amp;#34;getting by&amp;#34; until the next color. Be careful not to spray to close or for too long</li>
            <li> I love this stuff saves me a bundle</li>
            <li> This product covers my gray hair perfectly until I can get to the salon.  My only complaint is that it is expensive for just a small amount.  One less star for the price.</li>
            <li> I thought this was for my few grays in between colored glaze treatments.  However, when I used it for the first (and last time), I was shocked to find that it spray painted my scalp an barely got my hair.  The paint was all over my hands and forehead.  Although it has a straw/pointer to guide the paint, it still got over everything.  Very awkward to use.  I would not recommend it.  I&#x27;ll go back to my &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34; for hair.</li>
            <li> I use this a couple weeks before I color my hair so I can stall a little longer from getting my grays done. Would love if they sell it in a larger quantity.</li>
            <li> I give it three stars because it matches my hair color very well, which (as any brunette knows), can be tough. What I don&#x27;t care for is how sticky it can feel...almost matted. One also has to be careful when spraying because it can get everwhere.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It hid the grey and let me go at least another week before I had to dye my hair. Just make sure to hold it about 5 or 6 inches from your head when you spray.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes or anything else. Lasts until next hair washing.</li>
            <li> It works very well. ordered again.</li>
            <li> AWESOME root concealer.  I have Asian black hair and this covers all my white!</li>
            <li> Works very well. Just wish, like all spray on root concealer, wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Traveling and in between salon visits, I unfortunately ran out of Style Edit (a far superior product) and picked up Rita Hazan at a drugstore. Not only is the finish matte dull and dry looking, the color rubs off on everything! I would have been better off using mascara as a touch up. Don&#x27;t bother with this product. I purchased Style Edit from my hairdresser and now here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> this gives me another week or 2 before redoing my roots. Looks natural - just be aware of not spraying to close to your hairline - it can look weird. Bought for me and my sisters. Great solution</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair. I read the directions carefully and it turned my hair hard And it does not stay in until shampooed out. Plus you can smell the strong chemicals in this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Timely delivery. Will definitely order again!</li>
