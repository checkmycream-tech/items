            <li>This was a nice starter kit.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even use it twice to see if I liked it.</li>
            <li>These trial kits are a great bang for your buck, and a great opportunity to try new things.</li>
            <li>I liked most of the products in this kit</li>
            <li>It has been a nice break for my skin, and the generous sample size has lasted me seven applications with about seven more to go.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the primer, and may buy more of it.</li>
            <li>It was turned out to be a great travel size and for the price it was worth it.</li>

            <li>I feel it is a nice light daytime eye protection.</li>

            <li>This kit lasted a long time and was a great value.</li>
            <li>If you want travel sized, or to try out products, it is not bad for the price.</li>

            <li>The eye cream is nice, and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The other products were nice and it was fun to try them -</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a powder exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s you try new products without committing to a full size bottle.</li>
            <li>The kit comes with a sample of Skin Hydrating Booster (just enough for two applications in the packet) and I had to go out and buy the full size of it because I woke up with the most comfortable level of hydration after being tight and flaky before.  </li>
            <li>Nice little helpers.</li>
            <li>nice  little  group  of  samples</li>

            <li>Lastly, the Total Eye Care (.1oz) is lovely to apply and with spf15</li>
            <li>Purchased this for the primer mainly to use on vacation.</li>
            <li>Its okay- kinda small</li>
            <li>These are professional products.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really like in this bag is the micro-exfoliator.</li>
            <li>My daughter is so excited and loves this little bag with products.  </li>
            <li>The last product was new to my repertoire, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I am hooked!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb too quickly but does make a nice base for applying eye makeup.  </li>

            <li> I look less tired &amp; more refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have bought these trial kits just BECAUSE they last so long.</li>
            <li> I have since bought the Special Cleansing Gel, Multi Active Toner, Skin Hydrating Booster, and AgeSmart Renewal Lip Complex</li>
            <li> They go a long way!</li>
            <li> The primer and the eye care product are not for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This little facial glow skin kit worked well for me.</li>
            <li> These are sample sizes and I will use them but there are absolutely no directions on how to use them.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the Total Eye Care looks small, but use it after your toner ( toner is a must, it keeps your face from sucking up product)and moisturizer, it lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Your skin will never feel as well polished with any other exfoliant.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchace Total Eye Care before I sample</li>
            <li> With spf 30 and a slight tint, I have been wearing it without additional coverage.  </li>
            <li> if it starts losing &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; on your face, add a few drops of water and it seems to &amp;#34;reactivate&amp;#34; and &amp;#34; spread&amp;#34; for days.</li>
            <li> id say if youre under 30 this may be a waste of $.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops of water if it starts losing suds in your hand, whamo!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a steal for even a small amount of the microderm powder.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, and it is small amounts.</li>
            <li> Too small for the price</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is in a foil packet, there were about 2 drops, and no good way to save it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but it will take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Its okay- kinda small</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m seeing people complain about the size of samples. These are professional products. They go a long way! The microfoliant is the best! Add a few drops of water if it starts losing suds in your hand, whamo! Back in business. Same thing if it starts losing &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; on your face, add a few drops of water and it seems to &amp;#34;reactivate&amp;#34; and &amp;#34; spread&amp;#34; for days. I have bought these trial kits just BECAUSE they last so long. Yes, the Total Eye Care looks small, but use it after your toner ( toner is a must, it keeps your face from sucking up product)and moisturizer, it lasts for a very long time. I&#x27;d say a month. The last product was new to my repertoire, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I am hooked! I cut it into my treatment foundation, and love it way it works! I mix up Jan Marini, Obagi and Andalou products, and absolutely love Dermalogica in that front line. These trial kits are a great bang for your buck, and a great opportunity to try new things.</li>
            <li> great as a travel kit.</li>
            <li> This bag is an awesome value.  While these are travel sized items, they will last a while since Dermalogica products are so concentrated.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A great value for amount of items you get to try. Let&#x27;s you try new products without committing to a full size bottle.</li>
            <li> Awesome kit. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price!!</li>
            <li> Love the products in this kit.  It&#x27;s great for travel or to try out the items that I hadn&#x27;t used before.</li>
            <li> I liked most of the products in this kit but, the rest of it I didn&#x27;t use and through it away It was kind of a waste</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a steal for even a small amount of the microderm powder. The other products were nice and it was fun to try them - but the microderm powder is just wonderful. Your skin will never feel as well polished with any other exfoliant.</li>
            <li> These are sample sizes and I will use them but there are absolutely no directions on how to use them.  But I did not pay much for this and Dermalogica is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I feel like this was a give away sample that wasn&#x27;t supposed to be sold. The only thing I really like in this bag is the micro-exfoliator. The primer and the eye care product are not for people with dry skin. It left me flaky looking.</li>
            <li> today was the first time I tried it and the feeling on the face was really nice. I have big hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> Great price for this kit!</li>
            <li> I love this kit! The skin &amp; eye primer is perfect for my skin color. I look less tired &amp; more refreshed. It goes on smoothly and feels great. This is my first time using a powder exfoliator. I don&#x27;t hate it, but it will take a little getting used to. The bag is cute to carry essentials with you too!</li>
            <li> This little facial glow skin kit worked well for me. Dermalogica is the best product around. I have tried everything and Dermalogica always delivers the best skin and complexion.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using them. Nice little helpers.</li>
            <li> After doing some research on the Dermalogica line, I got excited about trying it out.  This was a nice starter kit.  The Daily Microfoliant (.45oz) claimed to be a staple product in the line and I can see why. It is a product that lives up to its hype.  The kit comes with a sample of Skin Hydrating Booster (just enough for two applications in the packet) and I had to go out and buy the full size of it because I woke up with the most comfortable level of hydration after being tight and flaky before.  Only after one night of using these two products my face was ACTUALLY brighter and overall happier-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Skin Perfect Primer (.24oz) is another product that I&#x27;ll be buying the full size of.  I have sampled many primers but I wasn&#x27;t impressed until now.  With spf 30 and a slight tint, I have been wearing it without additional coverage.  It has been a nice break for my skin, and the generous sample size has lasted me seven applications with about seven more to go.  Lastly, the Total Eye Care (.1oz) is lovely to apply and with spf15 I feel it is a nice light daytime eye protection. It doesn&#x27;t absorb too quickly but does make a nice base for applying eye makeup.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchace Total Eye Care before I sample Powerfirm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great kit to start sampling Dermalogica.  I have since bought the Special Cleansing Gel, Multi Active Toner, Skin Hydrating Booster, and AgeSmart Renewal Lip Complex and they are all wonderful products worth trying.</li>
            <li> the microfoliant Alone is worth buying this kit! if your on the fence, DO IT! the primer is so so, eye cream awesome, hydra fluid is Great ill be ordering full size as well as the microfoliant. the price for this is fantastic considering the size of microfoliant. id say if youre under 30 this may be a waste of $. but over, you will fall in love</li>
            <li> My daughter is so excited and loves this little bag with products.  We are both in love with Dermalogica and thank you for offering this.</li>
            <li> nice  little  group  of  samples</li>
            <li> Love Dermalogica. Purchased this for the primer mainly to use on vacation. Great product.</li>
            <li> daughter loves it...ordered more</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, and it is small amounts. The eye cream is nice, and goes a long way. I really liked the primer, and may buy more of it. The moisturizer is in a foil packet, there were about 2 drops, and no good way to save it. I couldn&#x27;t even use it twice to see if I liked it. If you want travel sized, or to try out products, it is not bad for the price. I have sensitive/adult acne prone skin and it did not irritate at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great combo for the price point. I enjoy dermalogica very much and the microfoliant is my favorite for sure.</li>
            <li> This little bag is an amazing deal! It has some of the best products and I love that it will be perfect for travel! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica! Great product. Can&#x27;t go wrong with it. I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and this is my line of choice for skin care.</li>
            <li> Everything in the kit was great👍Loved it. Would buy again . The cleaner is perfect and has cleaned a lot of my acne</li>
            <li> It was turned out to be a great travel size and for the price it was worth it. I have used the microfoliant every day for two weeks and there&#x27;s still plenty left!</li>
            <li> great little sample kit.  I love the eye crème.  I buy multiples of these,</li>
            <li> Too small for the price</li>
            <li> Wonderful for travel!</li>
            <li> The samples are almost non existent.  Can&#x27;t even tell how the product is.</li>
            <li> This kit lasted a long time and was a great value.</li>
