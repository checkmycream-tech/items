            <li>Great size for traveling.  </li>

            <li>Easy to carry and very handy to have.</li>
            <li>i am satisfied with this product, and the price is good.</li>
            <li>Handy to have</li>
            <li>As a solution I put it in it&#x27;s own snack sized zip lock bag</li>
            <li>Works great, just like the original bottle.  </li>
            <li>because they worked great at first!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using a product that&#x27;s thicker, you must dilute it so this works appropriately.</li>
            <li>What it is ideal for is chair-side tables or next to invalid beds.</li>
            <li>I thought it would dispense liquids like shampoo, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a good job at that.</li>
            <li>If you manually lift the pump and press it, it works fine.</li>
            <li>highly recommend, just as good as the Aveda full size dispenser</li>
            <li>Filled to max and lasted for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Great for my foaming facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Works great and hasn&#x27;t had a single issue!</li>
            <li>works great, just as expected.</li>
            <li>This little bottle works great for traveling.  </li>
            <li>this foamer bottle pump foams just as much the original one used by aveda for their &amp;#34;phomollient&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my homemade soap.</li>
            <li>This bottle is EXACTLY what I was looking for to bring some foaming facewash in my carry-on luggage.  </li>
            <li>This is great, although not quite as thick of plastic as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>in its favor it doesn&#x27;t leak as much while travelling, in part to its more secure cap that snaps on hard.  </li>
            <li>Collar feels secure enough that I didn&#x27;t worry about leaking in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li>It foams well and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Really does foam</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Much handier than bar soap.</li>
            <li>in travel, both can leak a little, but this bottle keeps the leak at a minimum and contained ... mostly.  </li>
            <li>I packed this, it didn&#x27;t leak the soap, and it held enough for a week&#x27;s worth of frequent handwashing for three people.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fewer than 3 fl oz, so you can carry as a carry on, and so far hasn&#x27;t shown any sign of leakage.  </li>
            <li>So far, no leaks either.</li>
            <li>I get about 2-3 days worth of product by using this little dude.</li>

            <li> Last trip I noticed that when I pressed the button to hard it popped right off the bottle off.</li>
            <li> The pump handle makes it a little difficult to fit into your ziplock baggie, but that&#x27;s a function of the foaming action.  </li>
            <li> Depress the nozzle and foam comes out.  </li>

            <li> The &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; that draws up the liquid is very narrow and then the liquid goes intoâ€‹ a second chamber.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what else I can say other than that.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is for.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the original packaging of a very expensive hair product whose foaming container continued to fail.</li>
            <li> Slowly leaks where the cap meets the bottle.  </li>
            <li> As crazy as it sounds, I have ridiculously sensitive skin and am forced to carry soap with me, or risk serious irritation when I use random soap.</li>
            <li> They would either start squirting poorly, without foaming...</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find a foam pump in a travel size.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It held enough face wash to last me two weeks!  It seems well made, not flimsy at all.  Collar feels secure enough that I didn&#x27;t worry about leaking in my suitcase.  Not sure what else I can say other than that.</li>
            <li> this foamer bottle pump foams just as much the original one used by aveda for their &amp;#34;phomollient&amp;#34; product.  in its favor it doesn&#x27;t leak as much while travelling, in part to its more secure cap that snaps on hard.  in travel, both can leak a little, but this bottle keeps the leak at a minimum and contained ... mostly.  as a precaution, i do put the travel size in a ziplock bag while travelling.)  i am satisfied with this product, and the price is good.</li>
            <li> This little bottle works great for traveling.  It&#x27;s fewer than 3 fl oz, so you can carry as a carry on, and so far hasn&#x27;t shown any sign of leakage.

            <li> Works great so far...haven&#x27;t traveled with it yet, though.</li>
            <li> Slowly leaks where the cap meets the bottle.  Also, the spring stopped working after about 2 weeks.  If you manually lift the pump and press it, it works fine.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to take for my homemade face wash on vacation.</li>
            <li> Works great,use it with for Aveeno Foaming Cleanser</li>
            <li> used for my Aveda foaming cleanser during travel, no leakage.  Filled to max and lasted for 2 weeks.  perfect travel size! highly recommend, just as good as the Aveda full size dispenser</li>
            <li> So glad to find this! As crazy as it sounds, I have ridiculously sensitive skin and am forced to carry soap with me, or risk serious irritation when I use random soap. This dispenser is small and discreet enough for me to bring along the soap I need. Hooray! It foams well and is very sturdy. So far, no leaks either. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Great for my foaming facial cleanser. Perfect size for travel.</li>
            <li> Stopped pumping after a couple times using, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Exactly what I needed for my homemade soap. Easy to carry and very handy to have.</li>
            <li> This bottle is EXACTLY what I was looking for to bring some foaming facewash in my carry-on luggage.  Only complaint was a bit of leakage on the flight back.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the original packaging of a very expensive hair product whose foaming container continued to fail. Not knowing if it was the manufacturers delivery system that was failing or the product itself so tested product with this foamer. Works great and hasn&#x27;t had a single issue!</li>
            <li> works great, just as expected. I use it for my Deva curl volume foam when I travel. I get about 2-3 days worth of product by using this little dude.</li>
            <li> It works.  I use it for hair mousse.  Place the liquid in the bottle.  Depress the nozzle and foam comes out.  That&#x27;s what I wanted, that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li> Great travel accessory.  Really does foam whatever liquid you put in it.</li>
            <li> These all stopped working for me...They would either start squirting poorly, without foaming...then the pump would go down but not come back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost like the piston needs to be lubricated but I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on. Bummer because they worked great at first!</li>
            <li> When you need a foamer bottle nothing else will suffice.  This bottle was priced fairly, arrived in a timely fashion, works and is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my tea tree oil face wash.  If you&#x27;re using a product that&#x27;s thicker, you must dilute it so this works appropriately.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and great for travel!</li>
            <li> I thought it would dispense liquids like shampoo, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a good job at that.The &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; that draws up the liquid is very narrow and then the liquid goes intoâ€‹ a second chamber.  Not sure what it is for.  But it is well made and has a cover which is grat for travel.</li>
            <li> Works great, just like the original bottle.  Great size for traveling.  Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Works great for my foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> It does what one expects. Handy to have but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d risk sticking it in a purse or suitcase. What it is ideal for is chair-side tables or next to invalid beds. That sort of thing.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find a foam pump in a travel size. This is great, although not quite as thick of plastic as I was expecting. It does not seem to leak.</li>
            <li> I packed this, it didn&#x27;t leak the soap, and it held enough for a week&#x27;s worth of frequent handwashing for three people. Much handier than bar soap.</li>
            <li> Bought this for foaming face wash and it leaked all over my travel liquids bag. As a solution I put it in it&#x27;s own snack sized zip lock bag so the leaking would be isolated. Last trip I noticed that when I pressed the button to hard it popped right off the bottle off. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
