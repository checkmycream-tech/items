    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My conclusion is that Wen works best with heat damaged or \\&quot;lather damaged\\&quot; hair types... as he put it.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more--Amazon has some of the best prices--WATCH OUT for sites that try to get you into an automatic billing type of arrangement, where they keep sending the product on a schedule.  </li>
            <li>but this one is great!</li>
            <li>Chaz, thank you for sharing your awesome product with the hair-impaired.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Wen is the best..</li>

            <li>I love it!!!  </li>
            <li>Keep fighting the good fight! :D</li>
            <li>Their hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy and feels incredible -</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work Chaz!</li>
            <li>beautiful, shiny hair with no need of mousse or root lift for body, no need for hair spray.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product with a great deal of skepticism.</li>
            <li>Yes, great product, but not affordable to everyone.</li>
            <li>and I bought the FIG mask hoping it will really do a great job.</li>
            <li>Again, it might work great for someone with thicker, coarser hair than mine.  </li>
            <li>And - oh joy,</li>
            <li>Wen is great product to use.</li>
            <li>Great texture, manageable, plenty of volume, great smell.  </li>
            <li>All three are great smelling.  </li>
            <li>Wen makes your hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li>That worked great</li>
            <li>This stuff is really really great</li>
            <li>They are great for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with Wen after using it for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>They all smell great</li>
            <li>, I do like the product; it&#x27;s great for any hair type and</li>
            <li>The product is great~</li>
            <li>Have been extremely happy with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>I have ordered more!!</li>
            <li>Oh, and I love the minty sensation on my head!!</li>
            <li>I bought the product on Chaz&#x27;s assurance that all hair types can use the product successfully.</li>
            <li>This is a most awesome product.</li>
            <li>His scalp never had a chance to recover it&#x27;s own protective sheath!</li>
            <li>Your hair is remarkable when it is washed</li>
            <li>she tried mine and really liked it too!  </li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s a fair trade off.  </li>
            <li>but still did a good job,</li>
            <li>Her hair was always gorgeous before, but we joked that it felt like horse hair.  </li>
            <li>The ends of my hair that were drier than the scalp area look excellent now - smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I hoped Wen would be as good as they claim,being it was a gift for someone.</li>
            <li>I still loved what it did and am going to try the hydrating mask to see what results I get.  </li>
            <li>I heard good things about WEN and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I have used these two and loved them both  </li>
            <li>so I could determine which one fit my hairstyle best.  </li>
            <li>Good luck to all who read this.  </li>
            <li>This is so good for your hair that it will thank you.  </li>
            <li>I was just hoping for a superior product and my daughters wanted to try Wen as well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my mother and she absolutly loved it.</li>
            <li>It smeels sooooo good.</li>
            <li>When I seem to try another shampoo in between they never seem to be as good as Wen.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>--perhaps my ideal type any quantity may yield even better results.    </li>
            <li>My hair always feels clean and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and I think I like the sweet almond mint the best.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthier, shinier and more attractive than it has ever been.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, all I need is the Wen shampoo and my hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>She loves the Cucumber, and I love all the rest of them!  </li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>I have been using WEN for almost a month now and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love the way my hair looks and feels!  </li>
            <li>My hair had never  been so shiny or healthy looking as it did after just one washing!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>it shall be interesting!  </li>
            <li>I can tell you that I LOVE this product and have since cleaned out my shower!</li>
            <li>If you decide to try it, I hope you have better luck with this product than I did!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>LOVE my results with this product!    </li>
            <li>It looks so healthy!</li>
            <li>I also converted some family members and friends to Wen, everyone is pleased!</li>
            <li>My hair looks great and feels fantastic until about lunchtime, when it returns to being greasy.</li>
            <li>WEN is amazing.</li>
            <li>is amazing.  </li>
            <li>My friend let me try the Almond hair re-moist mask and it is a wonderful product and really brought the shine</li>
            <li>I really recommend this excellent hair product.</li>
            <li>you have to use kind of a lot, and scrub your scalp for a bit.</li>
            <li>WEN is well worth the price for the quality and Amazon has the best prices and variety of sets to choose from - enjoy!</li>
            <li>Looks like I&#x27;m the exception, but it is my honest opinion and review.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li>I think the Sweet Almond Mint is the perfect fit for just about anyone.     </li>
            <li>I have also used the styling creme and the wax stick - both good products if you are not looking for a strong hold - because they are conditioning as well.</li>
            <li>I used the Cucumber first and loved it!  </li>
            <li>and it certainly didn&#x27;t give me a good hair day!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, color treated hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine, somewhat oily hair.  </li>
            <li>I have about shoulder length very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions, and after the first use I could not believe how great my hair looked and felt.    </li>
            <li>I also have (naturally) very light hair.  </li>
            <li>You can add hairspray, gels, any styling products that are even non Wen products to you hair and it will shape and hold perfectly but never get stiff, it&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li>I loved the crisp, tingling I felt throughout my hair!</li>
            <li>But I was hoping for better.    </li>
            <li>I started using it after shampooing, and that seems to work well, but it still doesn&#x27;t follow through with what the product claims to provide : a one step cleansing routine for better looking hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I just love the way it makes my hair feel and look.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m using one of the more conditioning ones (Fig, Tea Tree)</li>
            <li>the cucumber one worked better on my hair type.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I switch through the types daily but have decided that I like the cucumber aloe and the lavendar the best for my hair..</li>
            <li>but it is still ok.</li>
            <li>and it feels like it did when you were about 20 :-)  </li>
            <li>I love the Wen cleansing conditioner as well as all of the products.</li>
            <li>Plus, as we work with this product more, we may find ways to eliminate the straightener all together.  </li>
            <li>I have been enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>(my hair has more body and curl in warmer months, straighter in the winter).    </li>
            <li>Ordered Wen Healthy hair cair system.</li>
            <li>I used it for a month to be sure these effects weren&#x27;t transitory.</li>
            <li>The product is just ok.  </li>
            <li>We have all been convinced one hair product or another is going to be the next best thing to make our morning easier</li>
            <li>WEN looks, feels, smells like my organic Trader Joe&#x27;s (or most any) conditioner.  </li>
            <li>If you are satisfied that your hair condition is getting better and you want to continue, consider buying the WEN to try it.  </li>
            <li>I just love it and can&#x27;t wait to try the Cucumber</li>
            <li>My hair has never been softer or more shiny.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It works ok.  </li>
            <li>I will admit it is refreshing to use, it wakes me up ...</li>
            <li>I just love the feel of my hair, which makes me want to condition my hair more.  </li>
            <li>Pretty amazing compared to the detergent out there!</li>
            <li>The lavender variety seems to remove the most oiliness.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these products.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>love how my hair feels and smells.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>:)      </li>
            <li>My hair did look \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; but looked more oily than shiny.</li>
            <li>Just got more oily with each use.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad Chaz created this.  </li>
            <li>I hope it works better for you if you decide to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li>I would have to say these products are just OK.  </li>
            <li>I will never use another conditioner again and I have no stock in WEN :)</li>
            <li>Well, it did an okay job.  </li>
            <li>I have had better products much better.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I think I&#x27;ve got more frizz with it.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to so many friends.  </li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t like the scents of any of the bottles, I&#x27;m going to buy more of the lavender.</li>
            <li>I have family and friends that I have given WEN to as gifts that love</li>
            <li>With Wen, my color lasts 2-3 weeks longer, the overall condition of my hair is excellent and it has a growth rate 10 times what it used to be!!</li>
            <li>the more product you use, the better the results..</li>
            <li>I tried many conditioners</li>
            <li>I am glad to say I was not dissappointed.</li>
            <li>The home site claims that it gets better with use</li>
            <li>It has also taken away the frizz and static cling also.</li>
            <li>I really love the way my hair is since I started using WEN.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It works better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Guthey Reinker is THE MOST unprofessional company to ever deal with.  </li>
            <li>Even head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner have made my hair feel softer and give it more volume than this shampoo did.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the cucumber aloe smell, although it&#x27;s not horrible.  </li>
            <li>I love the Almond Mint; they both work for me.  </li>
            <li>Better than ever company with top notch customer</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even tell you how many clumps of hair was falling in my hand.</li>
            <li>After every use my hair felt like straw and was even more frizzy.</li>
            <li>Should have done more research.</li>
            <li>The hair dresser noticed a difference right away, but not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>So, having now very fine hair I opted for the 3 variety pack for fine to medium hair.    </li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, super rich and creamy, does indeed clean your scalp and hair without lather,</li>
            <li>I can literally wait the three days and still have soft beautiful</li>
            <li>I work in the hospitality field and was surprised they did&#x27;nt want me to be happy or satisfied.</li>
            <li>so I have alot of fine, naturally wavy hair that looks like a \\&quot;beautiful body perm\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I thought this would eliminate the need to smooth fuzzies and help bottoms of their hair, which were drier than the top.    </li>
            <li>- I just know that I wanted something that made my hair healthy, light and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li>so it really is a matter of cleaning the skin while leaving the hair looking good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have found Amazon because there is much more to choose from and the reviews are terrific.  </li>
            <li>My hair is incredibly easy to comb through after cleansing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t wanted to commit to a product that easily.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, set that aside as it is easily remedied..</li>
            <li>I find that the 15-20 pumps of the Sweet Almond Mint works better than the others Wen makes for medium hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the results I received using the Sweet Almond Mint and decided to try something else and purchased the Fig.  </li>
            <li>p.s my favorite is sweet almond mint</li>
            <li>What I have never been able to achieve though, is shiny, bouncy hair that looks full.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair that has been getting finer (not thinning) since I had my baby 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>It smells fine.  </li>
            <li>pump bottles for fine, medium hair.  </li>
            <li>I have semi-oily, fine hair, and this product does not work for me.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I use shampoo first, which I know defeats the purpose of using Chaz&#x27;s products, but using his conditioner as an actual conditioner has been awesome.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine, colored hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, colored/highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t bother trying it if you have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>Even though it is supposed to be for fine hair which my hair couldn&#x27;t get any finer</li>
            <li>My hair felt better from the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>I tried to use as little of the product and followed the directions perfectly and even bought the comb you are supposed to run through your hair while in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to rinse thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>, I have tried to be as detailed as I could be.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for his everyday use in the almond and lavender.</li>
            <li>It smells great, feels gentle, and leaves my hair healthy, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely a FANTASTIC product.</li>
            <li>Shampooing also used to make my scalp very irritated and itchy on the top, but it&#x27;s improved a lot since then, and I expect it&#x27;ll keep getting better.    </li>
            <li>For some people I am sure this works great - however baby fine hair gets weighed down so easy.</li>
            <li>I was excited about getting some of the free products that came with it.</li>
            <li>If you find your hair not smelling as fresh as you like, spray your favorite perfume or Bath and Body Works mist, anything into your hair while it is damp and it will smell great when it&#x27;s dry..</li>
            <li>The first time or two that I shampooed, I really noticed a difference and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The price is perfect, especially when you compare it against salon products that don&#x27;t do half as good a job.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a walking hair shampoo commercial -- strangers don&#x27;t stop me on the street -- but my best friend noticed and thought it was a new cut.</li>
            <li>I think my hair feels great, appears smoother and just looks more styled/groomed and less split endy or fly-away.</li>
            <li>After the first use I saw much more control and shine to her hair.</li>
            <li>I must say, I was completely excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>But well worth it I suppose!</li>
            <li>If you do not cancel enrollment by the 29th day of your original ORDER, you will be shipped a 90-day replenishment supply at a cost of over $38.00 automatically billed to your credit card.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while (a month with me) before I noticed significant improvement.  </li>
            <li>The infomercials got me excited on WEN, that it would work for all hair textures including Asians.</li>
            <li>Her hair was always gorgeous, but now it is smooth and looks like she just left the salon.  </li>
            <li>Using these products, my hair feels clean without the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; feeling</li>
            <li>Does it clean hair?  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a product that would do some good for my hair for so many years that I couldn&#x27;t even begin to tell you the amount of money I have spent on hair products and shampoos.  </li>
            <li>With the large bottles more is pumped out.    </li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback i found was that someone with medium length hair, like myself, has to use a good amount of the product to cover all of the hair.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve used wen my hair is shiny, not frizzy and has full volume.  </li>
            <li>Some people really need to read better..</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B001D4FF66 WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner - 16 oz]][[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Maybe they need to not use as much of the product or rinse more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I have tried the fig, the sweet almond mint and the cucumber aloe now</li>
            <li>They all are slightly different but equally as good.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 3 pack variety of lavendar, cucumber/melon and sweet almond mint about 2 months ago in the 6 ounce size.    </li>
            <li>For me, my hair is much softer and feels healthier and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is SO true..</li>
            <li>It takes 8-9 full pumps of the cleansing conditioner to fully cover my hair.</li>
            <li>Meaningful Beauty (REALLY JUNK)</li>
            <li>I really thought Chaz would of created a better product than this.</li>
            <li>There is nothing super special about this product that would cause me to continue to use it despite the trickery of the business model.  </li>
            <li>I am usually a pretty easy person to please.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and live in a humid climate.  </li>
            <li>Now I am concerned if one day you stop selling this product and I will not be able to have such healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>We still think it is a super product and will re-purchase the almond and</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair had a lot more body, especially evident in the back, where it tends to be thicker.    </li>
            <li>Although I still had to use my straightener on my hair, the texture of my hair was improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li>someone who is not looking for any styling and likes the super \\&quot;slick\\</li>
            <li>I have now been using the products loyally for three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read many reviews about the Wen products on many different sites and couldn&#x27;t help but</li>
            <li>i had purchased this product directly from wen once before,  i have very fine, thinning hair and thought this product would help me obtain volume but it does not.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine shoulder legnth hair that is frequently highlighted.  </li>
            <li>I have access to great products at half the price of retail.  </li>
            <li>this is the first hair product that I have really felt and noticed the results immediately, I love it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Cucumber was DEFINITELY the favorite!    </li>
            <li>Ever since I ordered this first Wen product, I have been a Wen convert!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and very curly.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not thin, just each strand is fine.</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to the way your hair feels, but it looks great</li>
            <li>particularly so I can more accurately gage what my clients might prefer for their hair type with out having to do as much trial and error as I am willing do.  </li>
            <li>This is a simple every day step that just makes me feel a little girlier -- in the best kind of soft way.</li>
            <li>Soft, sure, but super-greasy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Best money I&#x27;ve spent since I bought those cherry bombs off that kid back in sixth grade and blew up the...</li>
            <li>It appears some people have had success with this product, but I would not recommend for my hair type.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a keeper for us and worth the expense at this point because of the quality of ingredients.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth it:  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and light my hair felt!  </li>
            <li>If you are wanting the exact results that you see on T.V., then my guess is you will need to buy the full product line.  </li>
            <li>They require you to provide your credit or bank card information, and then they bill you more frequently than you expect, EVEN AFTER YOU CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.</li>
            <li>Now regarding the not so fresh smell of your hair..</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but to me, well worth it..</li>
            <li>Of all the scents available, I am leaning towards the Lavender to be my favorite, but they all work the same, no matter which scent you choose.</li>
            <li>Now I know it was just stripping way the natural oil that give shine and a healthy look to the hair.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a product that was more natural and that did not contain any sodium laurXX compounds.  </li>
            <li>, it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>However, I think this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Every hairdresser recomended natural products as I am allergic to most soaps.</li>
            <li>Once I received the items (quickly too), I first tried the cucumber/melon.</li>
            <li>This is an example of sharp consumer practices that turn people off to infomercial products that might actually be good products.  </li>
            <li>I started out with the sample pack of all five cleansers in the 6 oz size, to decide which are right for my daughter and I.  </li>
            <li>So she was used (her salon version of) a non-sulfate clarifying shampoo and washed it twice to remove the build up before she would cut it, because she was concerned about the way it was laying and not getting the cut right.      </li>
            <li>Yep, my hair would&#x27;ve been right at home sticking out of the collar and sleeves of the Scarecrow from Wizard of Oz.    </li>
            <li>One of my friends mentioned my hair looked oily right after I washed it.</li>
            <li>The others are less pleasant.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;mint\\&quot; is very strong and could easily double as a sinus unblocker.  </li>
            <li>The service was great as usual</li>
            <li>It smells great, but made my hair even flatter than usual.</li>
            <li>but the difference was so much more apparent on her.     </li>
            <li>Feels like I have real hair full of life, and this is after 7 weeks from having my hair cut and colored (you know how it gets lifeless after that time).  </li>
            <li>The only thing that&#x27;s nice is that hair feels soft and light.</li>
            <li>Great way to waste your money!</li>
            <li>I went back to using Enjoy products again, because they have such good moisture.</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks clean, shiny, full and alive.  </li>
            <li>and then I will order the large bottle!  </li>
            <li>I think the deal with three might be a great start for someone interested in Wen but not sure what they need.    </li>
            <li>If you want shine, light and frizz/tangle free hair, then maybe use it as a daily conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I gave it to a friend who had super thick hair and not at all baby fine.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly fine hair.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I have oily hair.</li>
            <li>From the first time I tried these products I was amazed at how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Give it a shot and enjoy soft, youthful bounce and shine.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I told her and explained that I was hoping it would help my hair from the breakage and loss problems that I have, and how the commercial said this would be better because it was a non-sulfate.  </li>
            <li>The first time I shampooed using WEN</li>
            <li>I used the fig version, so perhaps a different flavor would work better.</li>
            <li>My advice would be to try &#x27;shampooing&#x27; with just your conditioner first</li>
            <li>After the first use my hair was transformed.  </li>
            <li>When I first received the Chaz Wen kit from his website I used it as directed.  </li>
            <li>The smaller bottles require more pumps.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in trying the Cucumber and Lavendar,</li>
            <li>I love the product and the fact that I get 3 different scent</li>
            <li>We have only ever used salon haircare products to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>When a bottle of shampoo costs $30.00 and only lasts through 3 washes, you better deliver what you claim.</li>
            <li>I just used 12-15 for the first couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I used the almond first and thought I could get used to the smell.  </li>
            <li>It is healthy, has movement, the color lasts longer and above all - the SHINE!!</li>
            <li>I used one entire bottle to make sure I gave it a chance to do what it claims.  </li>
            <li>really!</li>
            <li>I called their automated system and cancelled my account; they charged me even more the following month.</li>
            <li>Regular \\&quot;Extra-volume\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners work much better.</li>
            <li>But then again, it was pretty soft and light before.</li>
            <li>They only reimbursed part of my money saying S&amp;P is not included on top of the $20</li>
            <li>Doing these two things, I was able to stretch the three bottles to last about two months.    </li>
            <li>Thanks for the education!    </li>
            <li>Thanks for the screwing over!</li>
            <li>However, I really like the product and plan to continue using it for both the health benefits and for the way my hair feels, looks, and behaves while using it!</li>
            <li>It also has made my hair so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Now, after a month, it is really smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll never use regular shampoo again.</li>
            <li>I love everything pumpkin, but the next month after that I had been charged again</li>
            <li>My hair tends to dry out easily, and I was excited to try this product in hopes that it would deliver results like they claim.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean, soft and silky but with a lot of body, and by the end of the day, it still feels that way!</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product due to the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>The instructions leave you wondering about getting clean hair, but it really does leave my rather oily scalp clean, but not dry.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, dry, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>Soft hair isn&#x27;t worth the aggravation!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d need thick, very curly hair for this product to look great.</li>
            <li>I only use about 4 pumps tho - and don&#x27;t really need any more after I&#x27;ve rinsed for conditioning.  </li>
            <li>- people (both strangers and folks whom I&#x27;ve known my whole life) are actually complimenting me on how lustrous and healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>When I use my regular shampoo I can really tell just how much more drying it is on my hair.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like Wen and will buy more.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the cost though, and I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely long and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I saw this product advertised on one of the TV shopping channels and thought at first \\&quot;I can&#x27;t pay that much for something that might not work.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>First use, I was amazed that it really cleaned my hair like shampoo does.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to post this review, we used Wen Sweet Almond Conditioner Cleanser on my 11 and 16 year old daughters.  </li>
            <li>While I concider my hair easy to manipulate, I find when I use Wen my hair is super shiny, managable, and much much healthier than when I have used any of the other professional products on the market available to me.    </li>
            <li>Initially I purchased the Sweet Almond Mint through the infomercial ... then researched through Amazon!  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and such a time saver if you shower in the a.m.  </li>
            <li>; never got past a certain length before breaking off; started to fry nice and crispy at the merest glimpse of a blow-dryer or a day of fun in the sun.</li>
            <li>The product is pure junk.</li>
            <li>And I still use the coconut oil in certain areas to \\&quot;lock in\\&quot; the softness and add shine.</li>
            <li>an occasional shampoo with it seems fine</li>
            <li>The cucumber is the only one for my longer, fine oil prone hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly and bleached blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>12 pumps was still enough to sufficiently coat my hair, so I think this was fine.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair</li>
            <li>These work great on dry &amp; active hair (workouts, swimming</li>
            <li>it works very well..</li>
            <li>I really like the way my hair feels and shines...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a CEO and, whether I like it or not, appearance really matters in business.</li>
            <li>and my hair is much thicker.</li>
            <li>I just bought the FIG and it was much thicker then the others</li>
            <li>She wears it both curly and straight.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hair care product</li>
            <li>I really do like this product though I find it a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>I have chest-length hair, and I didn&#x27;t use nearly as much as the WEN bottle recommended.  </li>
            <li>Thanks CHAZ for this product  </li>
            <li>My hair has kept it&#x27;s color longer and it&#x27;s still very shiny, and I can style it.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t see much of a drastic result like they over emphasis in the commerical.  </li>
            <li>my hair still felt fresh and soft.    </li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll figure out how much you need...</li>
            <li>Wen really does all of that.</li>
            <li>like I ratted my hair, that Just to wash my hair and go is very freeing.</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I agree this is the best thing we have ever found for our crazy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now and really like it.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels much healthier.  </li>
            <li>and this stuff really balances it all out.  </li>
            <li>product is pricey and you need to use more than I expected.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know about that</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that Wen would meet the advertised promises, but...</li>
            <li>It does help to use it as a leave-in conditioner, but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>Also - no need to use as much as the bottle states -</li>
            <li>I really like the Wen Hair Care items.  </li>
            <li>But I followed the instructions and it did the job very well.  </li>
            <li>You know I really like it...</li>
            <li>Since I am a \\&quot;addict\\&quot; I do enjoy have the 3 different varieties of WEN to switch around.  </li>
            <li>I have medium thickness shoulder length straight hair.</li>
            <li>It still has some poof, but not as much.</li>
            <li>This really works -</li>
            <li>your hair is so much softer and voluminous.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the reviews, but was not holding out much hope.   </li>
            <li>It really cleanses my hair and leaves it</li>
            <li>the instructions are very thorough.</li>
            <li>And later recieved a bill for $139.00 for a \\&quot;free ship\\&quot; package.</li>
            <li>I ordered the cucumber aloe after much procrastination.  </li>
            <li>My habit was to always be sending off for free samples, so I was always trying different brands.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how it can be both silky and have so much body.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t done much experimenting</li>
            <li>I specifically told the girl taking the order that I ABSOLUTELY UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE wanted to sign-up for reoccurring shipments.</li>
            <li>Thanks from a gingerkid.</li>
            <li>Too much maintenance to use.</li>
            <li>I honestly wondered if all the cleansing conditioners were the same with different scents...  </li>
            <li>if I don&#x27;t have the right amount of hydration to hold soft curls with out any sort of product feeling.     </li>
            <li>After several weeks of using all three of the fine to normal types the difference that I see in both of our hair amazes me.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to finally use WEN</li>
            <li>I must try yet some other product that she recommends to the tune of so much more money than this product costs.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 3 pack starter set of WEN because (like so many other people) I have been enchanted by the infomercials for some time.  </li>
            <li>All they did was try to sell me more Wen &amp; other Gunthy-Renker products.</li>
            <li>I called back, turns out you do need an RA number, the original package &amp; invoice to return product for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both have a TON of long fine hair.</li>
            <li>I think you have to actually wash your hair with shampoo for it to be clean.  </li>
            <li>Honestly it made me feel as if I needed to wash it everyday to make it look normal.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every day because I want it clean and hate oily hair, this product safely let&#x27;s me wash every day and the hair stays in very healthy condition.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, fine hair and have always wished for more shine.  </li>
            <li>With the Sweet Almond Mint it still felt bouncy, even on the third day!     </li>
            <li>I found with the Sweet Almond Mint even on the third day</li>
            <li>I have soft, manageable hair for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, limp hair, so I ordered the set of three for fine-medium hair.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is sulfate free and all natural, and I perceive that my color lasts longer than when using regular shampoo, but that would be true with any of the numerous sulfate-free shampoos on the market.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer, has more body, and although it is still very thin on top, I no longer have to endure comments about how damaged my hair is.    </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first but let me tell you, this product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>This is similar to the co-shampooing I was already doing to my african-american NATURAL chemical free hair.  </li>
            <li>The main problem is Wen&#x27;s business model.</li>
            <li>Sure, you can send the replenishment back and wait 4-6 weeks for your refund, but do you want all that hassle while all you were trying to do was use the entire 60-day period to determine if the product works for you or not?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Creme Curl Shampoo &amp; Quick Curls Leave-In.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick strawberry blonde hair that&#x27;s in the middle of curly and straight with a nice layer of frizz on top.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave a 1 star is because I only love the lavendar spell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wen for the past few days now and WOW, my hair looks great!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so I bought it and had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>I love these little bottles.  </li>
            <li>At first I found it to be overly heavy for my hair which is of medium density, but fine strands which can tend to frizz</li>
            <li>She blow dried it right away and her hair feels like soft fine hair</li>
            <li>Great, just too expensive</li>
            <li>Just a normal couple of pumps does it.</li>
            <li>I normally use the shampoo, conditioner for colored hair with a root lift.  </li>
            <li>However, Wen did not ever make it bouncy or normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try a normal shampoo maybe once a week and see if that helps clarify it.</li>
            <li>This product is the biggest waste of time &amp; most of all money.  </li>
            <li>because yet again they have took money I call in for the fourth time to see why I got charged and just now find out the shipment I had decided to keep was 3 months worth supply</li>
            <li>I rarely get enthusiastic about a product, least of all a hair care product, but this is different.</li>
            <li>The product smells strongly of ammonia, doesn&#x27;t rinse well in the local water, and left an unsafe slippery film on the tub basin.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to use this product and now I have been using it for 10 days,  too much wax weight my hair down,</li>
            <li>However, after trying Wen just once, I immediately noticed my hair clean, shiny, FULL and thick.</li>
            <li>I am sold and I am a new WEN customer.  </li>
            <li>I gave each of the three samples ample opportunity (used each completely) to live up to the promised results</li>
            <li>Really helps my natural hair and leaves it soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser had recommended many types of shampoos, conditioners, leave in treatments, etc (very costly stuff to say the least) and still every time I would go in to the salon she would talk about how damaged my hair was.    </li>
            <li>I gave it 2 more tries and same results.</li>
            <li>I have very thin and fine hair and hoping the product would give me more volume and shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for 10 months now and was so excited that my hair felt soft and was shiny just after my first few uses.  </li>
            <li>one is because my hair does seem shiny and healthier, and it feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is still frizzy, but it is very soft.  </li>
            <li>I could feel a difference - my hair felt very soft.</li>
            <li>Many of the new shampoos market \\&quot;sulfate-free,\\&quot; only to find that they have sodium laureth chloride or some other version that acts as the lathering agent.  </li>
            <li>I found if I use much less of the product for leave in, and as well a small amount of styling cream just before I get out of the shower the results are great, beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>This product, plus a volumizer, makes my hair fuller, very soft (not limp!)</li>
            <li>I find that I have to wash my hair more often than I did with regular shampoo - probably every day rather than every other day</li>
            <li>But when I use my Trader Joes conditioner (just conditioner, no shampoo), I get the exact same results as with the WEN shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Last thing - if you are interested in leading a chemical-free lifestyle, visit [...] for toxicity ratings on health and personal-care products.  </li>
            <li>BUT, after my first use of WEN I became a total believer!  </li>
            <li>My hair looks so shiny and is unbelievably soft!  </li>
            <li>I actually think I am going to be able to grow my hair past my shoulders with this product for the first time in 15 years.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>If you dont have natural curly hair, or \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot; hair, this product is NOT for you!</li>
            <li>but after the first wash, you will never go back to shampoo..</li>
            <li>The first time i used it, it left my hair feeling like straw.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a lot longer than what I&#x27;d expected; how cool is that?</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think that this heavy cream \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; would get it clean.  </li>
            <li>I actually have used conditioners to clean my hair for several years after reading a book called \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; where the author quit using shampoo and cleaned her hair with conditioner instead.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, colored, graying hair that is wavy and straight...a mess.</li>
            <li>With the Sweet Almond Mint I wasn&#x27;t worried about using &#x27;too much&#x27;, it was far less of a learning curve.    </li>
            <li>I always let it air dry and rarely style it, but I do put coconut oil in it to add some moisture and shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny; your old shampoo will feel sorta gross after you&#x27;ve been using the Wen for a while.</li>
            <li>I first considered this product for my 16 year old daughter who has blonde straw looking hair.</li>
            <li>When I first tried Wen, I purchased it direct from the official sight and got turned off instantly because of the repeat refill program.</li>
            <li>your hair feels so different, it is soft and silky, yet full, not flat.</li>
            <li>My hair was silky and shiny, but the problem was that it was to fine and limp.  </li>
            <li>It made my fine hair greasy and limp.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t feel clean or that it would feel weighed down</li>
            <li>I think we will use a little more on the ends next time.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s hard to imagine that it can get even better</li>
            <li>old wants to try one of the Wen products for coarse hair, as she didn&#x27;t think her hair was manageable after repeated use of the almond.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair frizzy when I used it and when I got home and went back to my old Paul Mitchell leave in conditioner, I was much happier.      </li>
            <li>A friend told me about this product only she had much thicker hair</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say that for as long as I can remember, my hair and I have been deadlocked in mutual hatred.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair very manageable, with a scent that is reminiscent of being at a spa.</li>
            <li>, etc)to keep the hair soft &amp; conditioned.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional hairstylist.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair which I color and heat-style on a regualr basis.    </li>
            <li>(The old days.)</li>
            <li>I have had to spend so much time putting product into my hair at different stages of drying to keep it from looking like</li>
            <li>I have medium length naturally curly hair that is also color treated.</li>
            <li>If I dont wash it completely out then it will look greasy.  </li>
            <li>I may try the fig because I really do like the convience of using one product over several and my hair has never been softer.</li>
            <li>I have been using it currently as just a conditioner - not putting it on my whole head.  </li>
            <li>and they all leave my hair feeling soft &amp; manageable.    </li>
            <li>While my hair was soft, it was frizzy, fly-away, out of control with no curl definition at all.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Trust me, do no waste your money and your time.  </li>
            <li>As a redhair it goes without saying I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I have only opened one bottle from that whole package.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and a larger size would not only be more economical for all of us who use it daily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing this shampoo is more for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li>Because using alot of any product weighs my hair down, I didn&#x27;t use the full recommended pumps -</li>
            <li>A few months ago I was experiencing some hair issues; dry; losing more hair than normal.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see the shine come back right away but have been using it for 3wks now and its back.</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe i didn&#x27;t leave it in long enough, so i left it in for more than 5 minutes the next time.</li>
            <li>it made my hair very greasy and flat.</li>
            <li>I am pretty low maintenance and was hesitant to get into a prolonged daily shower routine -- with working in 20 pumps of product and then having to leave it in for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>One other thing I noticed was that as more time went by, I think my hair got used to the products and the cleanness of my hair didn&#x27;t last as long as it had in the beginning.</li>
            <li>I tried cutting back on how many pumps I used to see if it made a difference, and it most definitely did!</li>
            <li>&quot; I was surprised when I received another order soon after(wasn&#x27;t aware of auto delivery)When I contacted customer service,they were not interested.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have normal untreated hair, this shampoo left both of us with greasy hair and it looked like we needed to wash our hair.</li>
            <li>I have no split ends developing when normally I would by now (its been 6 months since my last trim</li>
            <li>so I went back to the normal shampoo/conditioner I used before Wen and the knots</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and limp, and Wen like brought my hair back to life 3 pumps first thing after getting my hair wet in ths shower...</li>
            <li>Used for a month, followed instructions, did not work, it left my fine hair limp, no fullness or body at all.</li>
            <li>old has fine but thick hair to her mid-back.  </li>
            <li>I must warn you though, no matter which fragrance you choose, I highly recommend purchasing the coordinating oil, as your hair does smell different, unlike the fresh scents of your favorite conditioner, it is almost a dirty smell.</li>
            <li>It uses specific essential oils that target certain hair</li>
            <li>I had taken the cucumber aloe with me on vacation before trying it and actually went out and bought a new conditioner at a drugstore.  </li>
            <li>The next day I went back to work and everyone thought I had highlighted my hair because it appeared so much lighter than the day before.      </li>
            <li>So overall, although I really like the WEN product, I can get the same result with a store-bought organic, sodium-laureth-sulfate-free conditioner.     </li>
            <li>I thought maybe I put too much on an tried it a total of 5 times following the directions.</li>
            <li>I just tried it today and my hair actually felt soft!  </li>
            <li>There was a major difference in the shine of my hair by increasing the pump #.      </li>
            <li>I do have a lot of baby fine hair, however it weighted it down so much it look like an oil slick.</li>
            <li>All this, with one simple change from my old ineffective hair care routine to Wen.     </li>
            <li>In tiny print on your invoice it tells you that you are set up for automatic delivery unless you call customer service and adjust the number of shipments or cancel completely.</li>
            <li>Over the decades I have become an expert with styling tools and products, tried and spent so much money on shampoos etc in an effort to make my hair look fuller.  </li>
            <li>I never really noticed much difference.</li>
            <li>I have only used the lavendar thus far, and I use about 7 - 8 pumps in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly no miracle product, and I doubt you&#x27;ll get exactly what you see on the commercial or website.</li>
            <li>Even so, my hair is dry and poofy, so I was really attracted to Wen after seeing the commercial a couple months ago.    </li>
            <li>I have short, fine, color-processed hair, and these should last me awhile, as I don&#x27;t need to use as much as someone with long, thick hair.      </li>
            <li>As far as the \\&quot;build-up\\&quot; feeling that some people have mentioned, all I have to do is go back to my regular shampoo for one day, every couple of weeks, using the Wen like a conditioner instead of just by itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty busy (and a touch lazy)</li>
            <li>My hair became more limp and lifeless, and when my hair dried, they looked like straw and there were fly-aways..</li>
            <li>I can only imagine this product would work even better on thick, coarse, dry hair.     </li>
            <li>old has to-the-shoulder length medium coarse thick hair with large natural curls on the ends of her hair.  </li>
            <li>For me, it was really a let down.</li>
            <li>$50.&lt;br /&gt;I was really let down by this product.</li>
            <li>and I am very cautious about layering products because it tends to weigh down my hair</li>
            <li>It weights it down, I really wanted this product to work for me.</li>
            <li>I have dry, stringy, straight long hair and have tried numerous shampoos.</li>
            <li>: :(&lt;br /&gt;Routine takes too long: for me, rinsing with cool water, then applying 24-32 pumps of this stuff to my hair, massaging for 2-3 minutes, combing through, clipping up, leaving on for 5-15 minutes, and rinsing for 5 minutes with cool water is just too much a hassle.  </li>
            <li>After the first wash, it seemed like it worked well, but by the third day of washing, my hair felt weighed down, flat, with no life.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice that it made my hair any less frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have color treated hair(base, high and low lights) and am a red head to boot, which is a tough color to keep fresh and shining..</li>
            <li>Using Wen has added volume to the top of my head --- where with regular shampoo and conditioner it usually laid limp.</li>
            <li>No way.. I have super thick, coarse and curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>This product does not work for fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>Price is a little much</li>
            <li>, I find that is a little too much for my hair.</li>
            <li>I use so little of this product that expense isn&#x27;t really a factor.</li>
            <li>I do not use this as a shampoo on a daily basis due to my fine, heavy hair - but I have used it as a conditioner everyday for the past 3 months and my hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine, thin, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>To make it last, I washed my hair only every other day (which I used to do with normal shampoo to help with the dryness), and I used only about 12 pumps instead of the suggested number.</li>
            <li>I recommend asking a friend that has some instead of buying, I had recently tried this and called to cancel a little over a month after having it absolutely did nothing to my hair but shortly after I had tried to cancel I got billed, so I then tried to call and cancel again</li>
            <li>Another thing I really like about it is that unlike other conditioners, which can be really difficult washing out of your hair, Wen washes out easily.    </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> My conclusion is that Wen works best with heat damaged or \\&quot;lather damaged\\&quot; hair types... as he put it.</li>
            <li> I just ordered more--Amazon has some of the best prices--WATCH OUT for sites that try to get you into an automatic billing type of arrangement, where they keep sending the product on a schedule.  </li>
            <li> but this one is great!</li>
            <li> Chaz, thank you for sharing your awesome product with the hair-impaired.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Wen is the best..</li>

            <li> Wonderful stuff.</li>

            <li> I love it!!!  </li>
            <li> Keep fighting the good fight! :D</li>
            <li> Their hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy and feels incredible -</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work Chaz!</li>
            <li> beautiful, shiny hair with no need of mousse or root lift for body, no need for hair spray.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product with a great deal of skepticism.</li>
            <li> Yes, great product, but not affordable to everyone.</li>
            <li> and I bought the FIG mask hoping it will really do a great job.</li>
            <li> Again, it might work great for someone with thicker, coarser hair than mine.  </li>
            <li> And - oh joy,</li>
            <li> Wen is great product to use.</li>
            <li> Great texture, manageable, plenty of volume, great smell.  </li>
            <li> All three are great smelling.  </li>
            <li> Wen makes your hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li> That worked great</li>
            <li> This stuff is really really great</li>
            <li> They are great for traveling.  </li>
            <li> I was happy with Wen after using it for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> They all smell great</li>
            <li> , I do like the product; it&#x27;s great for any hair type and</li>
            <li> The product is great~</li>
            <li> Have been extremely happy with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered more!!</li>
            <li> Oh, and I love the minty sensation on my head!!</li>
            <li> I bought the product on Chaz&#x27;s assurance that all hair types can use the product successfully.</li>
            <li> This is a most awesome product.</li>
            <li> His scalp never had a chance to recover it&#x27;s own protective sheath!</li>
            <li> Your hair is remarkable when it is washed</li>
            <li> she tried mine and really liked it too!  </li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s a fair trade off.  </li>
            <li> but still did a good job,</li>
            <li> Her hair was always gorgeous before, but we joked that it felt like horse hair.  </li>
            <li> The ends of my hair that were drier than the scalp area look excellent now - smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> I hoped Wen would be as good as they claim,being it was a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> I still loved what it did and am going to try the hydrating mask to see what results I get.  </li>
            <li> I heard good things about WEN and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I have used these two and loved them both  </li>
            <li> so I could determine which one fit my hairstyle best.  </li>
            <li> Good luck to all who read this.  </li>
            <li> This is so good for your hair that it will thank you.  </li>
            <li> I was just hoping for a superior product and my daughters wanted to try Wen as well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother and she absolutly loved it.</li>
            <li> It smeels sooooo good.</li>
            <li> When I seem to try another shampoo in between they never seem to be as good as Wen.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> --perhaps my ideal type any quantity may yield even better results.    </li>
            <li> My hair always feels clean and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> and I think I like the sweet almond mint the best.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthier, shinier and more attractive than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, all I need is the Wen shampoo and my hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> She loves the Cucumber, and I love all the rest of them!  </li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN for almost a month now and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair looks and feels!  </li>
            <li> My hair had never  been so shiny or healthy looking as it did after just one washing!  </li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> it shall be interesting!  </li>
            <li> I can tell you that I LOVE this product and have since cleaned out my shower!</li>
            <li> If you decide to try it, I hope you have better luck with this product than I did!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> LOVE my results with this product!    </li>
            <li> It looks so healthy!</li>
            <li> I also converted some family members and friends to Wen, everyone is pleased!</li>
            <li> My hair looks great and feels fantastic until about lunchtime, when it returns to being greasy.</li>
            <li> WEN is amazing.</li>
            <li> is amazing.  </li>
            <li> My friend let me try the Almond hair re-moist mask and it is a wonderful product and really brought the shine</li>
            <li> I really recommend this excellent hair product.</li>
            <li> you have to use kind of a lot, and scrub your scalp for a bit.</li>
            <li> WEN is well worth the price for the quality and Amazon has the best prices and variety of sets to choose from - enjoy!</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;m the exception, but it is my honest opinion and review.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> I think the Sweet Almond Mint is the perfect fit for just about anyone.     </li>
            <li> I have also used the styling creme and the wax stick - both good products if you are not looking for a strong hold - because they are conditioning as well.</li>
            <li> I used the Cucumber first and loved it!  </li>
            <li> and it certainly didn&#x27;t give me a good hair day!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, color treated hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine, somewhat oily hair.  </li>
            <li> I have about shoulder length very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions, and after the first use I could not believe how great my hair looked and felt.    </li>
            <li> I also have (naturally) very light hair.  </li>
            <li> You can add hairspray, gels, any styling products that are even non Wen products to you hair and it will shape and hold perfectly but never get stiff, it&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li> I loved the crisp, tingling I felt throughout my hair!</li>
            <li> But I was hoping for better.    </li>
            <li> I started using it after shampooing, and that seems to work well, but it still doesn&#x27;t follow through with what the product claims to provide : a one step cleansing routine for better looking hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I just love the way it makes my hair feel and look.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m using one of the more conditioning ones (Fig, Tea Tree)</li>
            <li> the cucumber one worked better on my hair type.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I switch through the types daily but have decided that I like the cucumber aloe and the lavendar the best for my hair..</li>
            <li> but it is still ok.</li>
            <li> and it feels like it did when you were about 20 :-)  </li>
            <li> I love the Wen cleansing conditioner as well as all of the products.</li>
            <li> Plus, as we work with this product more, we may find ways to eliminate the straightener all together.  </li>
            <li> I have been enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> (my hair has more body and curl in warmer months, straighter in the winter).    </li>
            <li> Ordered Wen Healthy hair cair system.</li>
            <li> I used it for a month to be sure these effects weren&#x27;t transitory.</li>
            <li> The product is just ok.  </li>
            <li> We have all been convinced one hair product or another is going to be the next best thing to make our morning easier</li>
            <li> WEN looks, feels, smells like my organic Trader Joe&#x27;s (or most any) conditioner.  </li>
            <li> If you are satisfied that your hair condition is getting better and you want to continue, consider buying the WEN to try it.  </li>
            <li> I just love it and can&#x27;t wait to try the Cucumber</li>
            <li> My hair has never been softer or more shiny.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It works ok.  </li>
            <li> I will admit it is refreshing to use, it wakes me up ...</li>
            <li> I just love the feel of my hair, which makes me want to condition my hair more.  </li>
            <li> Pretty amazing compared to the detergent out there!</li>
            <li> The lavender variety seems to remove the most oiliness.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> love how my hair feels and smells.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> :)      </li>
            <li> My hair did look \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; but looked more oily than shiny.</li>
            <li> Just got more oily with each use.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad Chaz created this.  </li>
            <li> I hope it works better for you if you decide to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> I would have to say these products are just OK.  </li>
            <li> I will never use another conditioner again and I have no stock in WEN :)</li>
            <li> Well, it did an okay job.  </li>
            <li> I have had better products much better.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I think I&#x27;ve got more frizz with it.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to so many friends.  </li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t like the scents of any of the bottles, I&#x27;m going to buy more of the lavender.</li>
            <li> I have family and friends that I have given WEN to as gifts that love</li>
            <li> With Wen, my color lasts 2-3 weeks longer, the overall condition of my hair is excellent and it has a growth rate 10 times what it used to be!!</li>
            <li> the more product you use, the better the results..</li>
            <li> I tried many conditioners</li>
            <li> I am glad to say I was not dissappointed.</li>
            <li> The home site claims that it gets better with use</li>
            <li> It has also taken away the frizz and static cling also.</li>
            <li> I really love the way my hair is since I started using WEN.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It works better</li>
            <li> /&gt;Guthey Reinker is THE MOST unprofessional company to ever deal with.  </li>
            <li> Even head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner have made my hair feel softer and give it more volume than this shampoo did.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the cucumber aloe smell, although it&#x27;s not horrible.  </li>
            <li> I love the Almond Mint; they both work for me.  </li>
            <li> Better than ever company with top notch customer</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how many clumps of hair was falling in my hand.</li>
            <li> After every use my hair felt like straw and was even more frizzy.</li>
            <li> Should have done more research.</li>
            <li> The hair dresser noticed a difference right away, but not in a good way.  </li>
            <li> So, having now very fine hair I opted for the 3 variety pack for fine to medium hair.    </li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, super rich and creamy, does indeed clean your scalp and hair without lather,</li>
            <li> I can literally wait the three days and still have soft beautiful</li>
            <li> I work in the hospitality field and was surprised they did&#x27;nt want me to be happy or satisfied.</li>
            <li> so I have alot of fine, naturally wavy hair that looks like a \\&quot;beautiful body perm\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I thought this would eliminate the need to smooth fuzzies and help bottoms of their hair, which were drier than the top.    </li>
            <li> - I just know that I wanted something that made my hair healthy, light and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li> so it really is a matter of cleaning the skin while leaving the hair looking good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have found Amazon because there is much more to choose from and the reviews are terrific.  </li>
            <li> My hair is incredibly easy to comb through after cleansing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t wanted to commit to a product that easily.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, set that aside as it is easily remedied..</li>
            <li> I find that the 15-20 pumps of the Sweet Almond Mint works better than the others Wen makes for medium hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the results I received using the Sweet Almond Mint and decided to try something else and purchased the Fig.  </li>
            <li> p.s my favorite is sweet almond mint</li>
            <li> What I have never been able to achieve though, is shiny, bouncy hair that looks full.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair that has been getting finer (not thinning) since I had my baby 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> It smells fine.  </li>
            <li> pump bottles for fine, medium hair.  </li>
            <li> I have semi-oily, fine hair, and this product does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I use shampoo first, which I know defeats the purpose of using Chaz&#x27;s products, but using his conditioner as an actual conditioner has been awesome.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine, colored hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, colored/highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t bother trying it if you have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> Even though it is supposed to be for fine hair which my hair couldn&#x27;t get any finer</li>
            <li> My hair felt better from the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> I tried to use as little of the product and followed the directions perfectly and even bought the comb you are supposed to run through your hair while in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to rinse thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> , I have tried to be as detailed as I could be.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for his everyday use in the almond and lavender.</li>
            <li> It smells great, feels gentle, and leaves my hair healthy, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely a FANTASTIC product.</li>
            <li> Shampooing also used to make my scalp very irritated and itchy on the top, but it&#x27;s improved a lot since then, and I expect it&#x27;ll keep getting better.    </li>
            <li> For some people I am sure this works great - however baby fine hair gets weighed down so easy.</li>
            <li> I was excited about getting some of the free products that came with it.</li>
            <li> If you find your hair not smelling as fresh as you like, spray your favorite perfume or Bath and Body Works mist, anything into your hair while it is damp and it will smell great when it&#x27;s dry..</li>
            <li> The first time or two that I shampooed, I really noticed a difference and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The price is perfect, especially when you compare it against salon products that don&#x27;t do half as good a job.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a walking hair shampoo commercial -- strangers don&#x27;t stop me on the street -- but my best friend noticed and thought it was a new cut.</li>
            <li> I think my hair feels great, appears smoother and just looks more styled/groomed and less split endy or fly-away.</li>
            <li> After the first use I saw much more control and shine to her hair.</li>
            <li> I must say, I was completely excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> But well worth it I suppose!</li>
            <li> If you do not cancel enrollment by the 29th day of your original ORDER, you will be shipped a 90-day replenishment supply at a cost of over $38.00 automatically billed to your credit card.  </li>
            <li> It takes a while (a month with me) before I noticed significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> The infomercials got me excited on WEN, that it would work for all hair textures including Asians.</li>
            <li> Her hair was always gorgeous, but now it is smooth and looks like she just left the salon.  </li>
            <li> Using these products, my hair feels clean without the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; feeling</li>
            <li> Does it clean hair?  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that would do some good for my hair for so many years that I couldn&#x27;t even begin to tell you the amount of money I have spent on hair products and shampoos.  </li>
            <li> With the large bottles more is pumped out.    </li>
            <li> Nothing special.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback i found was that someone with medium length hair, like myself, has to use a good amount of the product to cover all of the hair.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used wen my hair is shiny, not frizzy and has full volume.  </li>
            <li> Some people really need to read better..</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001D4FF66 WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner - 16 oz]][[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Maybe they need to not use as much of the product or rinse more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I have tried the fig, the sweet almond mint and the cucumber aloe now</li>
            <li> They all are slightly different but equally as good.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 3 pack variety of lavendar, cucumber/melon and sweet almond mint about 2 months ago in the 6 ounce size.    </li>
            <li> For me, my hair is much softer and feels healthier and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is SO true..</li>
            <li> It takes 8-9 full pumps of the cleansing conditioner to fully cover my hair.</li>
            <li> Meaningful Beauty (REALLY JUNK)</li>
            <li> I really thought Chaz would of created a better product than this.</li>
            <li> There is nothing super special about this product that would cause me to continue to use it despite the trickery of the business model.  </li>
            <li> I am usually a pretty easy person to please.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and live in a humid climate.  </li>
            <li> Now I am concerned if one day you stop selling this product and I will not be able to have such healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li> We still think it is a super product and will re-purchase the almond and</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair had a lot more body, especially evident in the back, where it tends to be thicker.    </li>
            <li> Although I still had to use my straightener on my hair, the texture of my hair was improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li> someone who is not looking for any styling and likes the super \\&quot;slick\\</li>
            <li> I have now been using the products loyally for three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about the Wen products on many different sites and couldn&#x27;t help but</li>
            <li> i had purchased this product directly from wen once before,  i have very fine, thinning hair and thought this product would help me obtain volume but it does not.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine shoulder legnth hair that is frequently highlighted.  </li>
            <li> I have access to great products at half the price of retail.  </li>
            <li> this is the first hair product that I have really felt and noticed the results immediately, I love it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Cucumber was DEFINITELY the favorite!    </li>
            <li> Ever since I ordered this first Wen product, I have been a Wen convert!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and very curly.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not thin, just each strand is fine.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to the way your hair feels, but it looks great</li>
            <li> particularly so I can more accurately gage what my clients might prefer for their hair type with out having to do as much trial and error as I am willing do.  </li>
            <li> This is a simple every day step that just makes me feel a little girlier -- in the best kind of soft way.</li>
            <li> Soft, sure, but super-greasy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Best money I&#x27;ve spent since I bought those cherry bombs off that kid back in sixth grade and blew up the...</li>
            <li> It appears some people have had success with this product, but I would not recommend for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a keeper for us and worth the expense at this point because of the quality of ingredients.</li>
            <li> but it is well worth it:  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and light my hair felt!  </li>
            <li> If you are wanting the exact results that you see on T.V., then my guess is you will need to buy the full product line.  </li>
            <li> They require you to provide your credit or bank card information, and then they bill you more frequently than you expect, EVEN AFTER YOU CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.</li>
            <li> Now regarding the not so fresh smell of your hair..</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but to me, well worth it..</li>
            <li> Of all the scents available, I am leaning towards the Lavender to be my favorite, but they all work the same, no matter which scent you choose.</li>
            <li> Now I know it was just stripping way the natural oil that give shine and a healthy look to the hair.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that was more natural and that did not contain any sodium laurXX compounds.  </li>
            <li> , it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> However, I think this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Every hairdresser recomended natural products as I am allergic to most soaps.</li>
            <li> Once I received the items (quickly too), I first tried the cucumber/melon.</li>
            <li> This is an example of sharp consumer practices that turn people off to infomercial products that might actually be good products.  </li>
            <li> I started out with the sample pack of all five cleansers in the 6 oz size, to decide which are right for my daughter and I.  </li>
            <li> So she was used (her salon version of) a non-sulfate clarifying shampoo and washed it twice to remove the build up before she would cut it, because she was concerned about the way it was laying and not getting the cut right.      </li>
            <li> Yep, my hair would&#x27;ve been right at home sticking out of the collar and sleeves of the Scarecrow from Wizard of Oz.    </li>
            <li> One of my friends mentioned my hair looked oily right after I washed it.</li>
            <li> The others are less pleasant.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;mint\\&quot; is very strong and could easily double as a sinus unblocker.  </li>
            <li> The service was great as usual</li>
            <li> It smells great, but made my hair even flatter than usual.</li>
            <li> but the difference was so much more apparent on her.     </li>
            <li> Feels like I have real hair full of life, and this is after 7 weeks from having my hair cut and colored (you know how it gets lifeless after that time).  </li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s nice is that hair feels soft and light.</li>
            <li> Great way to waste your money!</li>
            <li> I went back to using Enjoy products again, because they have such good moisture.</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks clean, shiny, full and alive.  </li>
            <li> and then I will order the large bottle!  </li>
            <li> I think the deal with three might be a great start for someone interested in Wen but not sure what they need.    </li>
            <li> If you want shine, light and frizz/tangle free hair, then maybe use it as a daily conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I gave it to a friend who had super thick hair and not at all baby fine.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly fine hair.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I have oily hair.</li>
            <li> From the first time I tried these products I was amazed at how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Give it a shot and enjoy soft, youthful bounce and shine.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I told her and explained that I was hoping it would help my hair from the breakage and loss problems that I have, and how the commercial said this would be better because it was a non-sulfate.  </li>
            <li> The first time I shampooed using WEN</li>
            <li> I used the fig version, so perhaps a different flavor would work better.</li>
            <li> My advice would be to try &#x27;shampooing&#x27; with just your conditioner first</li>
            <li> After the first use my hair was transformed.  </li>
            <li> When I first received the Chaz Wen kit from his website I used it as directed.  </li>
            <li> The smaller bottles require more pumps.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in trying the Cucumber and Lavendar,</li>
            <li> I love the product and the fact that I get 3 different scent</li>
            <li> We have only ever used salon haircare products to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> When a bottle of shampoo costs $30.00 and only lasts through 3 washes, you better deliver what you claim.</li>
            <li> I just used 12-15 for the first couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I used the almond first and thought I could get used to the smell.  </li>
            <li> It is healthy, has movement, the color lasts longer and above all - the SHINE!!</li>
            <li> I used one entire bottle to make sure I gave it a chance to do what it claims.  </li>
            <li> really!</li>
            <li> I called their automated system and cancelled my account; they charged me even more the following month.</li>
            <li> Regular \\&quot;Extra-volume\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners work much better.</li>
            <li> But then again, it was pretty soft and light before.</li>
            <li> They only reimbursed part of my money saying S&amp;P is not included on top of the $20</li>
            <li> Doing these two things, I was able to stretch the three bottles to last about two months.    </li>
            <li> Thanks for the education!    </li>
            <li> Thanks for the screwing over!</li>
            <li> However, I really like the product and plan to continue using it for both the health benefits and for the way my hair feels, looks, and behaves while using it!</li>
            <li> It also has made my hair so smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Now, after a month, it is really smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll never use regular shampoo again.</li>
            <li> I love everything pumpkin, but the next month after that I had been charged again</li>
            <li> My hair tends to dry out easily, and I was excited to try this product in hopes that it would deliver results like they claim.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean, soft and silky but with a lot of body, and by the end of the day, it still feels that way!</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product due to the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> The instructions leave you wondering about getting clean hair, but it really does leave my rather oily scalp clean, but not dry.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, dry, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> Soft hair isn&#x27;t worth the aggravation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d need thick, very curly hair for this product to look great.</li>
            <li> I only use about 4 pumps tho - and don&#x27;t really need any more after I&#x27;ve rinsed for conditioning.  </li>
            <li> - people (both strangers and folks whom I&#x27;ve known my whole life) are actually complimenting me on how lustrous and healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li> When I use my regular shampoo I can really tell just how much more drying it is on my hair.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like Wen and will buy more.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the cost though, and I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely long and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I saw this product advertised on one of the TV shopping channels and thought at first \\&quot;I can&#x27;t pay that much for something that might not work.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> First use, I was amazed that it really cleaned my hair like shampoo does.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to post this review, we used Wen Sweet Almond Conditioner Cleanser on my 11 and 16 year old daughters.  </li>
            <li> While I concider my hair easy to manipulate, I find when I use Wen my hair is super shiny, managable, and much much healthier than when I have used any of the other professional products on the market available to me.    </li>
            <li> Initially I purchased the Sweet Almond Mint through the infomercial ... then researched through Amazon!  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and such a time saver if you shower in the a.m.  </li>
            <li> ; never got past a certain length before breaking off; started to fry nice and crispy at the merest glimpse of a blow-dryer or a day of fun in the sun.</li>
            <li> The product is pure junk.</li>
            <li> And I still use the coconut oil in certain areas to \\&quot;lock in\\&quot; the softness and add shine.</li>
            <li> an occasional shampoo with it seems fine</li>
            <li> The cucumber is the only one for my longer, fine oil prone hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly and bleached blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> 12 pumps was still enough to sufficiently coat my hair, so I think this was fine.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair</li>
            <li> These work great on dry &amp; active hair (workouts, swimming</li>
            <li> it works very well..</li>
            <li> I really like the way my hair feels and shines...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a CEO and, whether I like it or not, appearance really matters in business.</li>
            <li> and my hair is much thicker.</li>
            <li> I just bought the FIG and it was much thicker then the others</li>
            <li> She wears it both curly and straight.  </li>
            <li> I really like this hair care product</li>
            <li> I really do like this product though I find it a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I have chest-length hair, and I didn&#x27;t use nearly as much as the WEN bottle recommended.  </li>
            <li> Thanks CHAZ for this product  </li>
            <li> My hair has kept it&#x27;s color longer and it&#x27;s still very shiny, and I can style it.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t see much of a drastic result like they over emphasis in the commerical.  </li>
            <li> my hair still felt fresh and soft.    </li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll figure out how much you need...</li>
            <li> Wen really does all of that.</li>
            <li> like I ratted my hair, that Just to wash my hair and go is very freeing.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I agree this is the best thing we have ever found for our crazy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now and really like it.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels much healthier.  </li>
            <li> and this stuff really balances it all out.  </li>
            <li> product is pricey and you need to use more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know about that</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that Wen would meet the advertised promises, but...</li>
            <li> It does help to use it as a leave-in conditioner, but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> Also - no need to use as much as the bottle states -</li>
            <li> I really like the Wen Hair Care items.  </li>
            <li> But I followed the instructions and it did the job very well.  </li>
            <li> You know I really like it...</li>
            <li> Since I am a \\&quot;addict\\&quot; I do enjoy have the 3 different varieties of WEN to switch around.  </li>
            <li> I have medium thickness shoulder length straight hair.</li>
            <li> It still has some poof, but not as much.</li>
            <li> This really works -</li>
            <li> your hair is so much softer and voluminous.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews, but was not holding out much hope.   </li>
            <li> It really cleanses my hair and leaves it</li>
            <li> the instructions are very thorough.</li>
            <li> And later recieved a bill for $139.00 for a \\&quot;free ship\\&quot; package.</li>
            <li> I ordered the cucumber aloe after much procrastination.  </li>
            <li> My habit was to always be sending off for free samples, so I was always trying different brands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how it can be both silky and have so much body.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t done much experimenting</li>
            <li> I specifically told the girl taking the order that I ABSOLUTELY UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE wanted to sign-up for reoccurring shipments.</li>
            <li> Thanks from a gingerkid.</li>
            <li> Too much maintenance to use.</li>
            <li> I honestly wondered if all the cleansing conditioners were the same with different scents...  </li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t have the right amount of hydration to hold soft curls with out any sort of product feeling.     </li>
            <li> After several weeks of using all three of the fine to normal types the difference that I see in both of our hair amazes me.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to finally use WEN</li>
            <li> I must try yet some other product that she recommends to the tune of so much more money than this product costs.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3 pack starter set of WEN because (like so many other people) I have been enchanted by the infomercials for some time.  </li>
            <li> All they did was try to sell me more Wen &amp; other Gunthy-Renker products.</li>
            <li> I called back, turns out you do need an RA number, the original package &amp; invoice to return product for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have a TON of long fine hair.</li>
            <li> I think you have to actually wash your hair with shampoo for it to be clean.  </li>
            <li> Honestly it made me feel as if I needed to wash it everyday to make it look normal.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every day because I want it clean and hate oily hair, this product safely let&#x27;s me wash every day and the hair stays in very healthy condition.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, fine hair and have always wished for more shine.  </li>
            <li> With the Sweet Almond Mint it still felt bouncy, even on the third day!     </li>
            <li> I found with the Sweet Almond Mint even on the third day</li>
            <li> I have soft, manageable hair for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, limp hair, so I ordered the set of three for fine-medium hair.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is sulfate free and all natural, and I perceive that my color lasts longer than when using regular shampoo, but that would be true with any of the numerous sulfate-free shampoos on the market.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer, has more body, and although it is still very thin on top, I no longer have to endure comments about how damaged my hair is.    </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but let me tell you, this product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> This is similar to the co-shampooing I was already doing to my african-american NATURAL chemical free hair.  </li>
            <li> The main problem is Wen&#x27;s business model.</li>
            <li> Sure, you can send the replenishment back and wait 4-6 weeks for your refund, but do you want all that hassle while all you were trying to do was use the entire 60-day period to determine if the product works for you or not?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Creme Curl Shampoo &amp; Quick Curls Leave-In.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick strawberry blonde hair that&#x27;s in the middle of curly and straight with a nice layer of frizz on top.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave a 1 star is because I only love the lavendar spell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen for the past few days now and WOW, my hair looks great!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so I bought it and had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> I love these little bottles.  </li>
            <li> At first I found it to be overly heavy for my hair which is of medium density, but fine strands which can tend to frizz</li>
            <li> She blow dried it right away and her hair feels like soft fine hair</li>
            <li> Great, just too expensive</li>
            <li> Just a normal couple of pumps does it.</li>
            <li> I normally use the shampoo, conditioner for colored hair with a root lift.  </li>
            <li> However, Wen did not ever make it bouncy or normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try a normal shampoo maybe once a week and see if that helps clarify it.</li>
            <li> This product is the biggest waste of time &amp; most of all money.  </li>
            <li> because yet again they have took money I call in for the fourth time to see why I got charged and just now find out the shipment I had decided to keep was 3 months worth supply</li>
            <li> I rarely get enthusiastic about a product, least of all a hair care product, but this is different.</li>
            <li> The product smells strongly of ammonia, doesn&#x27;t rinse well in the local water, and left an unsafe slippery film on the tub basin.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product and now I have been using it for 10 days,  too much wax weight my hair down,</li>
            <li> However, after trying Wen just once, I immediately noticed my hair clean, shiny, FULL and thick.</li>
            <li> I am sold and I am a new WEN customer.  </li>
            <li> I gave each of the three samples ample opportunity (used each completely) to live up to the promised results</li>
            <li> Really helps my natural hair and leaves it soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser had recommended many types of shampoos, conditioners, leave in treatments, etc (very costly stuff to say the least) and still every time I would go in to the salon she would talk about how damaged my hair was.    </li>
            <li> I gave it 2 more tries and same results.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair and hoping the product would give me more volume and shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 10 months now and was so excited that my hair felt soft and was shiny just after my first few uses.  </li>
            <li> one is because my hair does seem shiny and healthier, and it feels very soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair is still frizzy, but it is very soft.  </li>
            <li> I could feel a difference - my hair felt very soft.</li>
            <li> Many of the new shampoos market \\&quot;sulfate-free,\\&quot; only to find that they have sodium laureth chloride or some other version that acts as the lathering agent.  </li>
            <li> I found if I use much less of the product for leave in, and as well a small amount of styling cream just before I get out of the shower the results are great, beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> This product, plus a volumizer, makes my hair fuller, very soft (not limp!)</li>
            <li> I find that I have to wash my hair more often than I did with regular shampoo - probably every day rather than every other day</li>
            <li> But when I use my Trader Joes conditioner (just conditioner, no shampoo), I get the exact same results as with the WEN shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Last thing - if you are interested in leading a chemical-free lifestyle, visit [...] for toxicity ratings on health and personal-care products.  </li>
            <li> BUT, after my first use of WEN I became a total believer!  </li>
            <li> My hair looks so shiny and is unbelievably soft!  </li>
            <li> I actually think I am going to be able to grow my hair past my shoulders with this product for the first time in 15 years.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> If you dont have natural curly hair, or \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot; hair, this product is NOT for you!</li>
            <li> but after the first wash, you will never go back to shampoo..</li>
            <li> The first time i used it, it left my hair feeling like straw.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a lot longer than what I&#x27;d expected; how cool is that?</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think that this heavy cream \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; would get it clean.  </li>
            <li> I actually have used conditioners to clean my hair for several years after reading a book called \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; where the author quit using shampoo and cleaned her hair with conditioner instead.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, colored, graying hair that is wavy and straight...a mess.</li>
            <li> With the Sweet Almond Mint I wasn&#x27;t worried about using &#x27;too much&#x27;, it was far less of a learning curve.    </li>
            <li> I always let it air dry and rarely style it, but I do put coconut oil in it to add some moisture and shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny; your old shampoo will feel sorta gross after you&#x27;ve been using the Wen for a while.</li>
            <li> I first considered this product for my 16 year old daughter who has blonde straw looking hair.</li>
            <li> When I first tried Wen, I purchased it direct from the official sight and got turned off instantly because of the repeat refill program.</li>
            <li> your hair feels so different, it is soft and silky, yet full, not flat.</li>
            <li> My hair was silky and shiny, but the problem was that it was to fine and limp.  </li>
            <li> It made my fine hair greasy and limp.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t feel clean or that it would feel weighed down</li>
            <li> I think we will use a little more on the ends next time.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to imagine that it can get even better</li>
            <li> old wants to try one of the Wen products for coarse hair, as she didn&#x27;t think her hair was manageable after repeated use of the almond.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair frizzy when I used it and when I got home and went back to my old Paul Mitchell leave in conditioner, I was much happier.      </li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product only she had much thicker hair</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that for as long as I can remember, my hair and I have been deadlocked in mutual hatred.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair very manageable, with a scent that is reminiscent of being at a spa.</li>
            <li> , etc)to keep the hair soft &amp; conditioned.  </li>
            <li> I am a professional hairstylist.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which I color and heat-style on a regualr basis.    </li>
            <li> (The old days.)</li>
            <li> I have had to spend so much time putting product into my hair at different stages of drying to keep it from looking like</li>
            <li> I have medium length naturally curly hair that is also color treated.</li>
            <li> If I dont wash it completely out then it will look greasy.  </li>
            <li> I may try the fig because I really do like the convience of using one product over several and my hair has never been softer.</li>
            <li> I have been using it currently as just a conditioner - not putting it on my whole head.  </li>
            <li> and they all leave my hair feeling soft &amp; manageable.    </li>
            <li> While my hair was soft, it was frizzy, fly-away, out of control with no curl definition at all.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Trust me, do no waste your money and your time.  </li>
            <li> As a redhair it goes without saying I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I have only opened one bottle from that whole package.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and a larger size would not only be more economical for all of us who use it daily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this shampoo is more for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Because using alot of any product weighs my hair down, I didn&#x27;t use the full recommended pumps -</li>
            <li> A few months ago I was experiencing some hair issues; dry; losing more hair than normal.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the shine come back right away but have been using it for 3wks now and its back.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe i didn&#x27;t leave it in long enough, so i left it in for more than 5 minutes the next time.</li>
            <li> it made my hair very greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> I am pretty low maintenance and was hesitant to get into a prolonged daily shower routine -- with working in 20 pumps of product and then having to leave it in for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> One other thing I noticed was that as more time went by, I think my hair got used to the products and the cleanness of my hair didn&#x27;t last as long as it had in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I tried cutting back on how many pumps I used to see if it made a difference, and it most definitely did!</li>
            <li> &quot; I was surprised when I received another order soon after(wasn&#x27;t aware of auto delivery)When I contacted customer service,they were not interested.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have normal untreated hair, this shampoo left both of us with greasy hair and it looked like we needed to wash our hair.</li>
            <li> I have no split ends developing when normally I would by now (its been 6 months since my last trim</li>
            <li> so I went back to the normal shampoo/conditioner I used before Wen and the knots</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and limp, and Wen like brought my hair back to life 3 pumps first thing after getting my hair wet in ths shower...</li>
            <li> Used for a month, followed instructions, did not work, it left my fine hair limp, no fullness or body at all.</li>
            <li> old has fine but thick hair to her mid-back.  </li>
            <li> I must warn you though, no matter which fragrance you choose, I highly recommend purchasing the coordinating oil, as your hair does smell different, unlike the fresh scents of your favorite conditioner, it is almost a dirty smell.</li>
            <li> It uses specific essential oils that target certain hair</li>
            <li> I had taken the cucumber aloe with me on vacation before trying it and actually went out and bought a new conditioner at a drugstore.  </li>
            <li> The next day I went back to work and everyone thought I had highlighted my hair because it appeared so much lighter than the day before.      </li>
            <li> So overall, although I really like the WEN product, I can get the same result with a store-bought organic, sodium-laureth-sulfate-free conditioner.     </li>
            <li> I thought maybe I put too much on an tried it a total of 5 times following the directions.</li>
            <li> I just tried it today and my hair actually felt soft!  </li>
            <li> There was a major difference in the shine of my hair by increasing the pump #.      </li>
            <li> I do have a lot of baby fine hair, however it weighted it down so much it look like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> All this, with one simple change from my old ineffective hair care routine to Wen.     </li>
            <li> In tiny print on your invoice it tells you that you are set up for automatic delivery unless you call customer service and adjust the number of shipments or cancel completely.</li>
            <li> Over the decades I have become an expert with styling tools and products, tried and spent so much money on shampoos etc in an effort to make my hair look fuller.  </li>
            <li> I never really noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> I have only used the lavendar thus far, and I use about 7 - 8 pumps in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly no miracle product, and I doubt you&#x27;ll get exactly what you see on the commercial or website.</li>
            <li> Even so, my hair is dry and poofy, so I was really attracted to Wen after seeing the commercial a couple months ago.    </li>
            <li> I have short, fine, color-processed hair, and these should last me awhile, as I don&#x27;t need to use as much as someone with long, thick hair.      </li>
            <li> As far as the \\&quot;build-up\\&quot; feeling that some people have mentioned, all I have to do is go back to my regular shampoo for one day, every couple of weeks, using the Wen like a conditioner instead of just by itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty busy (and a touch lazy)</li>
            <li> My hair became more limp and lifeless, and when my hair dried, they looked like straw and there were fly-aways..</li>
            <li> I can only imagine this product would work even better on thick, coarse, dry hair.     </li>
            <li> old has to-the-shoulder length medium coarse thick hair with large natural curls on the ends of her hair.  </li>
            <li> For me, it was really a let down.</li>
            <li> $50.&lt;br /&gt;I was really let down by this product.</li>
            <li> and I am very cautious about layering products because it tends to weigh down my hair</li>
            <li> It weights it down, I really wanted this product to work for me.</li>
            <li> I have dry, stringy, straight long hair and have tried numerous shampoos.</li>
            <li> : :(&lt;br /&gt;Routine takes too long: for me, rinsing with cool water, then applying 24-32 pumps of this stuff to my hair, massaging for 2-3 minutes, combing through, clipping up, leaving on for 5-15 minutes, and rinsing for 5 minutes with cool water is just too much a hassle.  </li>
            <li> After the first wash, it seemed like it worked well, but by the third day of washing, my hair felt weighed down, flat, with no life.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice that it made my hair any less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have color treated hair(base, high and low lights) and am a red head to boot, which is a tough color to keep fresh and shining..</li>
            <li> Using Wen has added volume to the top of my head --- where with regular shampoo and conditioner it usually laid limp.</li>
            <li> No way.. I have super thick, coarse and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> This product does not work for fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Price is a little much</li>
            <li> , I find that is a little too much for my hair.</li>
            <li> I use so little of this product that expense isn&#x27;t really a factor.</li>
            <li> I do not use this as a shampoo on a daily basis due to my fine, heavy hair - but I have used it as a conditioner everyday for the past 3 months and my hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine, thin, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> To make it last, I washed my hair only every other day (which I used to do with normal shampoo to help with the dryness), and I used only about 12 pumps instead of the suggested number.</li>
            <li> I recommend asking a friend that has some instead of buying, I had recently tried this and called to cancel a little over a month after having it absolutely did nothing to my hair but shortly after I had tried to cancel I got billed, so I then tried to call and cancel again</li>
            <li> Another thing I really like about it is that unlike other conditioners, which can be really difficult washing out of your hair, Wen washes out easily.    </li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY THIN HAIR AND HAVE TRIED MANY PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you order the variety three-pack, try just switching up to one of the other formulas and that also seems to take care of a lot of the buildup without having to resort to your old shampoo.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the amount in a bottle (if used daily on medium to long lengths) is such a ripoff.</li>
            <li> and it could never grow past a certain length.  </li>
            <li> the more i use the worse it weighs down my hair.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get out of the habit of needing the shampoo first, so I use WEN as a daily deep conditioning, and a very small amount of the creme as a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY thin, fine lightened hair - and many products are just too thick or heavy and make my hair flat and stringy - not WEN - beatiful body AND shine and it looks healthier than it has in years.  </li>
            <li> First of all, my daughter complained about the smell of the cucumber aloe conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My sister gave me hers to try and it really made a difference in the condition of my hair, softer, and my hairloss has improved, not sure</li>
            <li> It would usually go flat and frizzy within an hour.  </li>
            <li> I did experience build-up after a few days, but simply shampooed with my old shampoo and then went back to the Wen.  </li>
            <li> have long blonde hair that has curl to it</li>
            <li> Way over priced, makes hair flat, and feels OVER conditioned.</li>
            <li> I had been a decades long Aveda user and will not go back.</li>
            <li> I defnitely did not use the full amount requested as I have chin length hair, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> A little background -- 2 years ago I had major surgery which left my once fairly thick hair very thin, especially on top, and very dried out.</li>
            <li> i have very thick full long hair</li>
            <li> do the reast of my regiem and lastly rinse my hair, and towel dry, and a so far I have used about a pump and half for a leave in conditionar...</li>
            <li> I get it colored bi-monthly and blow dry it daily.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days my hair went from good to greasy and dirty.  </li>
            <li> With WEN I only use the single product.</li>
            <li> Lots of people complained that they couldn&#x27;t get it to stop, even when they had too much product or decided it didn&#x27;t work for them.  </li>
            <li> You have to use this for at least 2 months before you really notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> not soft at all.</li>
            <li> I have been trying for years to find a shampoo that left me with some volume, but didn&#x27;t leave hair feeling rough.  </li>
            <li> I tried this a long time ago maybe it&#x27;s changed.</li>
            <li> I have medium long hair, it was dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> But for a woman with light blond, thin, naturally oily hair, it is not great for daily use.</li>
            <li> I now use it spaced out with my regular shampoo like every other time or so.</li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone atleast try it once (from amazon its easier then getting setup on the other website for trial anyway, just my personal opinion).</li>
            <li> I know other postings mention playing around with the different types and the amount of product used.</li>
            <li> , I will hand it to them, it definitely works on other hair</li>
            <li> but I have found I leave it on longer than suggested and rince for a very long time.</li>
            <li> We waited until it was 3/4 dry before blow drying it and brushing it occassionally throughout the blowdry.  </li>
            <li> If I feel like my hair is a bit dry</li>
            <li> It has been a problem all my life- dry ends, oily roots.</li>
            <li> I have greasy roots with dry split ends...</li>
            <li> so it is dry too.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I recommend it for dry and damaged hair, just don&#x27;t expect to come out looking like their ads.</li>
            <li> I towel dried my hair &amp; applied some styling cream, the same amount I would use of my regular product.</li>
            <li> It is not a new concept to do this.  </li>
            <li> My hair was somewhat stiff, making it more difficult to style without additional products.  </li>
            <li> Wen might work on curly, thick, normal and \\&quot;thick\\&quot; dry hair.</li>
            <li> Quite frankly my typical shower doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> This does not eliminate other products unless you like completely flat listless hair.</li>
            <li> The Wen conditioners have my hair looking shinier and healthier than all the other shampoos, conditioners and flat irons combined.  </li>
            <li> First of all the pump was broken from the start.</li>
            <li> However,my hopes are not high.  </li>
            <li> After only 3 days of use I noticed less hair fall out</li>
            <li> Your hair should definitely be getting less greasy/shiny/dirty than it was before.  </li>
            <li> Although I was not impressed with the first use, I continued to use it until the bottle was gone (this only took 3 shampoos) but never received any results at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;MEH: :|&lt;br /&gt;The only difference I can see is that my hair is slightly softer.  </li>
            <li> No sooner did I buy it, less than 30 days later, they attempted to charge my card for another 3 month supply, which by the way, THEY DO NOT TELL you anywhere about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went on vacation and forgot my bottle at one hotel and customer service drop shipped an extra small bottle to my next destination at no charge!!!</li>
            <li> i have thin and sometimes frizzy hair, so when i saw the product on commercials and positive reviews i ordered the conditioner.</li>
            <li> my hair has change and became very dry, lost its shine,no bounce what so ever</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have very dry hair, it works like advertised.</li>
            <li> I have A LOT of shoulder-length, very dry, curly, but not course, hair.</li>
            <li> All in all it still works out to be less than the time spent shampooing, conditioning, and applying various products.</li>
            <li> but still it only lasted a little over a week.</li>
            <li> I especially did not like the cucumber one, because the smell stung my eyes a little.</li>
            <li> I do find the Fig too heavy when I straighten my hair, particularly if I am not going to do my hair the next day.</li>
            <li> And, sorry dear, he does not have much hair left anyway</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that you have to use ~16-20 pumps for one wash, and it&#x27;s a tiny bottle!</li>
            <li> I also use it weekly as a deep conditioner/mask and leave it on for a few hours or overnight.</li>
            <li> BEWARE if you buy this, the alleged \\&quot;60-day guarantee\\&quot; is a fallacy.  </li>
            <li> Then, I started adding up what I had already spent on products that didn&#x27;t work and thought \\&quot;What the heck; let&#x27;s give it a try.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> NO THANKS, twice.</li>
            <li> I was amazed after blow drying it, how manageable it was and with absolutely no use of gels, mousse, or any product.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews on a number of different internet sites and people either seemed to either love this product or hate it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and curly, and this made it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy cool water pouring down my body in the shower, especially on cold mornings.  </li>
            <li> After watching infomercials, I had hopes that this product would tame my unruly curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I will wash my hair with only conditioner or detangler</li>
            <li> The first time is a little difficult, since you do have to make some extra effort to use the product</li>
            <li> I have noticed a change in that I am losing less hair in the shower and my hair doesn&#x27;t look as dry.  </li>
            <li> Less than half way through the day my hair was flat and listless and looked thinner - not what I intended.</li>
            <li> I have tried endless shampoo, conditioner combinations and was still searching.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but my hair is often the first thing people see</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the other reviewer commented on the smell.  </li>
            <li> I often get when using other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I don&#x27;t feel any greasy feeling when using the Wen products.  </li>
            <li> Was I wrong, even after the first time I could feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> * Depending on the length of your hair, it takes quite a few pumps (around 40 pumps for my long hair),which can be costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BEFORE IT WAS EXTREMELY FRIZZY.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that on weekends when I didn&#x27;t wash my hair that it would be greasy due to being so conditioned, that hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started with the fig and am now trying these 3 other flavors.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other type of shampoos out there that made my hair like that.</li>
            <li> I am still using the same 6 ounce bottle of cucumber/melon, so needless to say this product last a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely damaged over the summer, actually much of it had broken off!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because my hair is just naturally thick and so in between everything, but it made my hair EXTREMELY frizzy (and that&#x27;s saying something when I naturally have a bit of frizz to begin with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry, I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it for me.  </li>
            <li> not worth the try.</li>
            <li> Up late I saw a Wen commercial and thought hmm no soap shampoo.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not worth</li>
            <li> Also all the other product that were pushed on you at the time of the sale were useless for thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> think that this concept on thin, fine hair will make it look greasy, dirty and flat.  </li>
            <li> I even use this on my 2 and half year old granddaughter after we&#x27;ve been in the swimming pool to comb out her hair which is very thick.</li>
            <li> My hair looked terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs down from me Chaz.</li>
            <li> It weighs it down and looks like you took an oil bath.  </li>
            <li> This has restored the sheen to my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> She mentioned it also weighed her hair down &amp; would not use it on</li>
            <li> I use it every other day!</li>
            <li> We live in Minnesota, and its dry and bitter cold....</li>
            <li> Using it as a shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling kinda heavy and a little dirty after a few straight days.  </li>
            <li> I just use less.  </li>
            <li> There is MUCH less hair in the shower drain</li>
            <li> and it started looking like straw in less than two months.  </li>
            <li> We both use less than the number of pumps recommended for our hair length</li>
            <li> and it even gets the oil and funky odor out of black hair that has grease/oil in it.  </li>
            <li> When I wash and comb my hair, noticeably less gets pulled out.</li>
            <li> so I use a lot less than the recommended number of pumps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend trying a small bottle and giving it a try, I don&#x27;t think most would be disappointed in its performance.</li>
            <li> Then you have to use 15 pumps, which is almost half the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have to use other conditioning products to tame it.</li>
            <li> This product was a huge disappointment!</li>
            <li> I am pretty cynical about hair care products</li>
            <li> have decided to embrace my Helena Bonham Carter hair and just leave it a mess forever.</li>
            <li> I have long (medium coarseness) thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks dull and dry.</li>
            <li> She still had to straighten it a little, but maybe 5 minutes instead of 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The price could be a little cheaper for the 6oz bottles, too.</li>
            <li> No more other products me for...</li>
            <li> I did try a pump of Wen as a styling cream, but it made my hair a little sticky.</li>
            <li> It can get a little fried.</li>
            <li> Overly dry and lifeless but no more!</li>
            <li> Who wants to take a cold shower at 5:30 in the morning?</li>
            <li> I had my hair colored, cut, and styled a few days ago</li>
            <li> (I did keep it to use after swimming, since chlorine is so harsh.  </li>
            <li> One thing it tells you don&#x27;t use everyday,  so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry Chaz that it didn&#x27;t work for me completely, but in the end, I still use your product.  </li>
            <li> It feels limp and heavy compared to the &#x27;just blown out&#x27; fullness of the day before.  </li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t heavy or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I followed directions to a T and have used this already a few times.</li>
            <li> All in all - wasted money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN for a few years now off and on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve towel dried.</li>
            <li> importantly I never have to put burning itchy soap on my head ever again.</li>
            <li> As a self-proclaimed Shampoo addict (seriously had at least 15 varieties in my shower prior to trying WEN)</li>
            <li> The basic treatment doesn&#x27;t leave any buildup and the smell is very subtle.</li>
            <li> The only way you can have any of these crazy nightmares stop, is to completely CANCEL your credit card and reopen with a new one down the road, otherwise they will continually charge your c.c. with their stupid products.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small and i would run out in 2 weeks max if i used this everyday.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair and am a minimalist when it comes to it.</li>
            <li> I have never delt with such rude &amp; irritating customer service people.</li>
            <li> I finally demanded to speak to a manager; she said she would cancel the account right away, but I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll have to cancel my credit card to be rid of this horrible company.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally limp and dull and now its boucey but not \\&quot;puffy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> No more than that.    </li>
            <li> I used it on a damp, rainy day - which is usually the ruination of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I find that the small bottles I went through quicker</li>
            <li> I never dreamed that snarly tangles and split ends could be part of my past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big spender when it comes to hair products, so buying a product this expensive was a jump for me.</li>
            <li> Then I add a small pump to the ends after</li>
            <li> No way..my scalp usually itches and burns by the end of day one.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I tried them and used pro active (junk!!!)</li>
            <li> The real medical benefit is to my husbands scalp which was getting ravaged by harsh soaps and chlorine that stripped the acid mantle leaving bumps and vulnerable skin!</li>
            <li> It was hard to get used to using a creamy conditioner type cleanser instead of sudsing up.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to the fact that there is  no lather, no bubbles!!</li>
            <li> have never had a late shipment.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hair LOOKS so bad that I can&#x27;t continue to really use it.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of getting hooked on an expensive product that only made a marginal difference.</li>
            <li> Baby-fine with a weird little wave (the hair, that is, not me)</li>
            <li> First off, my hair is HORRIBLE!!  </li>
            <li> Upon using it first time, I was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is that it is so expensive.  </li>
            <li> never realizing that the same company does all those stupid informercials you fall for on t.v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I chose these 3 products because of research for thin hair types..</li>
            <li> Listened to the hype- tried Wen, paid way to much for the worst shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m trying out the healthly lifestyle thing, and I&#x27;m completely addicted.  </li>
            <li> (I know, it sounds CRAZY, but your hair and scalp will thank you for it after a few weeks).  </li>
            <li> I particularly hate that slept on next day hair smell and don&#x27;t have it when I use Wen.    </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and use the cucumber aloe formula.  </li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t unhealthy before I started this product; maybe that&#x27;s why it wasn&#x27;t the miracle product for me that they advertise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so I get charged 3 times, absolute bull worst company ever</li>
            <li> I spent sending the worthless product back.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> BAD, BAD commercial practice.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s to expensive</li>
            <li> then I did, so I was skeptical as to what it would do for mine.</li>
            <li> I never dared hope that my hair would actually grow without snapping off like birch twigs after a cruel frost.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical...  </li>
            <li> I see this product advertized on the television all of the time, but it was to expensive for me to try.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the wen products did absoultely nothing to my hair.</li>
            <li> That is the worst I can say about Wen and the overall experience of it.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am allergic to everything outdoors as well as man made \\&quot;chemicals\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but after one use, it makes my hair looking dirty again.  </li>

            <li> I tried this product from another place, starts with a q and ends with a c. I have fine thin hair. Used for a month, followed instructions, did not work, it left my fine hair limp, no fullness or body at all. My hair looked terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs down from me Chaz.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I have oily hair. I bought the product on Chaz&#x27;s assurance that all hair types can use the product successfully. This is not so. I use Wen in the morning shower. My hair looks great and feels fantastic until about lunchtime, when it returns to being greasy. Perhaps this is because I don&#x27;t blowdry, but blowdrying is damaging... and the reason I purchased this product was to *prevent* damage. My conclusion is that Wen works best with heat damaged or \\&quot;lather damaged\\&quot; hair types... as he put it. But I was hoping for better.    Secondly, the amount in a bottle (if used daily on medium to long lengths) is such a ripoff. The directions advise 10-20 pumps of the product. I went through 1 bottle in a week, following the directions on the bottle. No more than that.    I started using it after shampooing, and that seems to work well, but it still doesn&#x27;t follow through with what the product claims to provide : a one step cleansing routine for better looking hair. Might as well just buy a fancy post-shampoo conditioner at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this product.  I have had compliments on my hair since using this and I just love the way it makes my hair feel and look.  I started out with the sample pack of all five cleansers in the 6 oz size, to decide which are right for my daughter and I.  She loves the Cucumber, and I love all the rest of them!  I mix and match them with no problems.  If I&#x27;m using one of the more conditioning ones (Fig, Tea Tree) I just use less.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> I tried this product with a great deal of skepticism. I was amazed at the reality. My hair feels clean, soft and silky but with a lot of body, and by the end of the day, it still feels that way! I wash my hair every day because I want it clean and hate oily hair, this product safely let&#x27;s me wash every day and the hair stays in very healthy condition. I used to use four products to deal with my hair, shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner and gel. With WEN I only use the single product. My hair is healthier, shinier and more attractive than it has ever been. I rarely get enthusiastic about a product, least of all a hair care product, but this is different. WEN is amazing.</li>
            <li> No matter how thoroughly I rinse my hair, it remains greasy. Soft, sure, but super-greasy. I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d need thick, very curly hair for this product to look great.</li>
            <li> I tried these 3... the cucumber one worked better on my hair type. I was thinking on buying a big bottle but it&#x27;s to expensive and I have to use a lot of product, because I have a lot of hair. A big bottle wouldn&#x27;t last a month, considering I would have to use it 2 or 3 times a week, 12 pumps per section (4 sections)... Yes, great product, but not affordable to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have tried endless shampoo, conditioner combinations and was still searching.  I have very fine, dry, damaged hair.  I thought I&#x27;d give this a try and it&#x27;s really different.  I used it on a damp, rainy day - which is usually the ruination of my hair.  It would usually go flat and frizzy within an hour.  After using the wen in the morning - my hair actually stayed styled all day.  It leaves my hair soft and healthy looking.  I find that I have to wash my hair more often than I did with regular shampoo - probably every day rather than every other day but I think that&#x27;s a fair trade off.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Saw the advertisment and thought how can this work well..it works very well..I really like the way my hair feels and shines... I don&#x27;t like using the regular shampoo now it too soapy...</li>
            <li> I was really excited to finally use WEN but I used it and it made my hair greasy the fist time. I used it again my hair wasnnt greasy the second time but not soft at all. I will stick with my Suave Professionals.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on a number of different internet sites and people either seemed to either love this product or hate it.  I love it.  I have extremely fine hair that has been getting finer (not thinning) since I had my baby 10 years ago. This product, plus a volumizer, makes my hair fuller, very soft (not limp!), shiny and it holds curl/style. It&#x27;s important to rinse thoroughly.  I did experience build-up after a few days, but simply shampooed with my old shampoo and then went back to the Wen.  I just ordered more--Amazon has some of the best prices--WATCH OUT for sites that try to get you into an automatic billing type of arrangement, where they keep sending the product on a schedule.  Lots of people complained that they couldn&#x27;t get it to stop, even when they had too much product or decided it didn&#x27;t work for them.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but my hair is often the first thing people see and they see it every day.  I&#x27;m a CEO and, whether I like it or not, appearance really matters in business.

            <li> I found that it did help flyaway hair but by the end of the day my hair was oily. I now use it spaced out with my regular shampoo like every other time or so. I may try to put it in a spray bottle mixed with water and see if that helps.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN for almost a month now and LOVE IT! My hair is fuller, softer, shinier. There is MUCH less hair in the shower drain and my hair is much thicker. I had my hair colored, cut, and styled a few days ago and my hair dresser wanted to know what was up and what I was doing. When I told him, he was amazed. This is all I use on my hair and I have given all of my salon shampoos and conditioners to my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Chaz!</li>
            <li> i had purchased this product directly from wen once before,  i have very fine, thinning hair and thought this product would help me obtain volume but it does not.  the more i use the worse it weighs down my hair.  an occasional shampoo with it seems fine but after one use, it makes my hair looking dirty again.  overall i do not like this product.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product only she had much thicker hair then I did, so I was skeptical as to what it would do for mine. I have very fine, color treated hair and I am located in a windy area. Since I have been here(upper midwest) my hair has change and became very dry, lost its shine,no bounce what so ever and I have been losing some hair for the past several years but not scary amounts and then I was starting to see fistfuls in the bottom of the tub after every shower. From the first time I tried these products I was amazed at how it made my hair feel. I didn&#x27;t see the shine come back right away but have been using it for 3wks now and its back. After only 3 days of use I noticed less hair fall out and now I have NO HAIR IN THE DRAIN!!! YEAH!!.. My friend let me try the Almond hair re-moist mask and it is a wonderful product and really brought the shine out(use once every 2 wks or so she said)..  I chose these 3 products because of research for thin hair types.. I switch through the types daily but have decided that I like the cucumber aloe and the lavendar the best for my hair.. I just bought the FIG and it was much thicker then the others but still did a good job, will use that probably once a week.. and I bought the FIG mask hoping it will really do a great job. I find that the small bottles I went through quicker then I thought I would but it is still ok. I will continue to use this product if nothing else because of the fall out factor and the shear pleasure you feel when you run your fingers through it and it feels like it did when you were about 20 :-)  I would recommend anyone atleast try it once (from amazon its easier then getting setup on the other website for trial anyway, just my personal opinion). Give it a shot and enjoy soft, youthful bounce and shine. I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and it could never grow past a certain length.  I ordered the Cucumber Aloe for my hair type.  I don&#x27;t know why the other reviewer commented on the smell.  It smells fine.  You have to use this for at least 2 months before you really notice a difference.  All of a sudden, my hair was healthier, growing and my stylist asked me what I was using because she noticed the difference.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I love the Wen cleansing conditioner as well as all of the products. The service was great as usual but I do have a couple of suggestions... Make a larger size in the styling creme. I use it everyday and a larger size would not only be more economical for all of us who use it daily but I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping so often. Also, I think the label needs to have larger print as to what it is. I ordered the cleansing conditioner  by mistake. I was trying to order the styling creme and for the life of me I thought that&#x27;s what it was until I went to use it.One last question... Are you ever going to be in Sephora or Ulta so I don&#x27;t have to pay shipping all of the time?? Thanks!</li>
            <li> this is the first hair product that I have really felt and noticed the results immediately, I love it. Now I am concerned if one day you stop selling this product and I will not be able to have such healthy looking hair. I really recommend this excellent hair product.</li>
            <li> The first time or two that I shampooed, I really noticed a difference and loved it.  I defnitely did not use the full amount requested as I have chin length hair, thin hair.  I was using the product for approx 10 days before I went in to my next scheduled hair cut appt.      The hair dresser noticed a difference right away, but not in a good way.  She said it felt like I had a ton of build up on my hair and asked what I was using.  I told her and explained that I was hoping it would help my hair from the breakage and loss problems that I have, and how the commercial said this would be better because it was a non-sulfate.  So she was used (her salon version of) a non-sulfate clarifying shampoo and washed it twice to remove the build up before she would cut it, because she was concerned about the way it was laying and not getting the cut right.      I also have (naturally) very light hair.  The next day I went back to work and everyone thought I had highlighted my hair because it appeared so much lighter than the day before.      I do still use the Wen once or twice a week for the conditioning aspects.  But for a woman with light blond, thin, naturally oily hair, it is not great for daily use.</li>
            <li> I bought this set hoping to see if it lived up to it&#x27;s claims.  I am pretty cynical about hair care products but this one is great! Price is a little much but it does work fantastically! My hair felt better from the first time I used it! I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t feel clean or that it would feel weighed down but it doesn&#x27;t.  I have ordered more!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to post this review, we used Wen Sweet Almond Conditioner Cleanser on my 11 and 16 year old daughters.  I thought this would eliminate the need to smooth fuzzies and help bottoms of their hair, which were drier than the top.    My 11 yr. old has fine but thick hair to her mid-back.  We used six pumps and didn&#x27;t have any problems rinsing it out.  I think we will use a little more on the ends next time.  Her hair was always gorgeous, but now it is smooth and looks like she just left the salon.  We waited until it was 3/4 dry before blow drying it and brushing it occassionally throughout the blowdry.  My 16 yr. old has to-the-shoulder length medium coarse thick hair with large natural curls on the ends of her hair.  She wears it both curly and straight.  She had to use 20 pumps.  She blow dried it right away and her hair feels like soft fine hair and like she just left the salon.  Her hair was always gorgeous before, but we joked that it felt like horse hair.  She still had to straighten it a little, but maybe 5 minutes instead of 20 minutes.  Plus, as we work with this product more, we may find ways to eliminate the straightener all together.  Their hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy and feels incredible - even my husband could see the difference and when I suggested he try it, he agreed.    I have long (medium coarseness) thick hair.  I find that the 15-20 pumps of the Sweet Almond Mint works better than the others Wen makes for medium hair.  The ends of my hair that were drier than the scalp area look excellent now - smooth and silky.  None of us have had luck with the cucumber or lavendar.  My 16 yr. old wants to try one of the Wen products for coarse hair, as she didn&#x27;t think her hair was manageable after repeated use of the almond.  We still think it is a super product and will re-purchase the almond and maybe one for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This might work for someone with dry/damaged hair.  I have babyfine hair and this product leaves it even limper!  :(   There is no bounce at all in my hair.  The only reason i gave it 2 stars rather than one is because my hair does seem shiny and healthier, and it feels very soft.  Unfortunately, my hair LOOKS so bad that I can&#x27;t continue to really use it.  (I did keep it to use after swimming, since chlorine is so harsh.  But I can&#x27;t use it if I actually plan on leaving the house.) Again, it might work great for someone with thicker, coarser hair than mine.  For me, it was really a let down.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair care product - I got the Wen Set of Three for Fine-Medium Hair - and I&#x27;ve been using it since I received it.  I only use about 4 pumps tho - and don&#x27;t really need any more after I&#x27;ve rinsed for conditioning.  My hair is soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is a most awesome product. It actually changed my hair.  I will never go back to shampoo again.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that for as long as I can remember, my hair and I have been deadlocked in mutual hatred. Baby-fine with a weird little wave (the hair, that is, not me); never got past a certain length before breaking off; started to fry nice and crispy at the merest glimpse of a blow-dryer or a day of fun in the sun. Yep, my hair would&#x27;ve been right at home sticking out of the collar and sleeves of the Scarecrow from Wizard of Oz.    Enter Chaz Dean, and his WEN-derful product. I never knew that hair could be so silky... so shiny... with - gasp! - body and bounce! I never dreamed that snarly tangles and split ends could be part of my past. I never dared hope that my hair would actually grow without snapping off like birch twigs after a cruel frost. And - oh joy, oh rapture! - people (both strangers and folks whom I&#x27;ve known my whole life) are actually complimenting me on how lustrous and healthy my hair looks. All this, with one simple change from my old ineffective hair care routine to Wen.     As far as the \\&quot;build-up\\&quot; feeling that some people have mentioned, all I have to do is go back to my regular shampoo for one day, every couple of weeks, using the Wen like a conditioner instead of just by itself. It does the trick every time! Also, if you order the variety three-pack, try just switching up to one of the other formulas and that also seems to take care of a lot of the buildup without having to resort to your old shampoo. It&#x27;s funny; your old shampoo will feel sorta gross after you&#x27;ve been using the Wen for a while. Quite a wake-up call; what waaaaaas I doing to my hair all those years?    I just re-ordered my second three-pack; seems like each bottle lasts almost a month, washing my shoulder-length hair every day. That&#x27;s a lot longer than what I&#x27;d expected; how cool is that? Best money I&#x27;ve spent since I bought those cherry bombs off that kid back in sixth grade and blew up the... but that&#x27;s another story.    Chaz, thank you for sharing your awesome product with the hair-impaired. You&#x27;ve made a stark-raving convert out of me, and literally spun straw into gold. Keep fighting the good fight! :D</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying this product. It makes your hair very manageable, with a scent that is reminiscent of being at a spa. The only drawback i found was that someone with medium length hair, like myself, has to use a good amount of the product to cover all of the hair. The price could be a little cheaper for the 6oz bottles, too.</li>
            <li> I ordered the set of three 6 oz. pump bottles for fine, medium hair.  I have short, fine, color-processed hair, and these should last me awhile, as I don&#x27;t need to use as much as someone with long, thick hair.      In the past, I have tried using only conditioner to wash my hair, to give it a rest between shampooing, and that seemed to work for me pretty well.  Also, I have needed to switch brands from time to time, as they seem to lose their effectiveness for me over time, and depending on the season (my hair has more body and curl in warmer months, straighter in the winter).    Using these products, my hair feels clean without the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; feeling I often get when using other shampoos.  The first time I shampooed using WEN I noticed my hair had a lot more body, especially evident in the back, where it tends to be thicker.    Time will tell if these products will continue to work for me, or if I need to occasionally switch to something else.  I would recommend these products to anyone dissatisfied with their current shampoo/conditioner, and looking for a change.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I tried this from a friend and did not buy it.  I have semi-oily, fine hair, and this product does not work for me.  After the first wash, it seemed like it worked well, but by the third day of washing, my hair felt weighed down, flat, with no life.  All frizzies were gone, but they were replaced by hair that felt smeared against my scalp. I rinsed and rinsed, hoping that would help.  I skipped days of washing, as instructed, but that made my hair even oilier.  It appears some people have had success with this product, but I would not recommend for my hair type.  I used the fig version, so perhaps a different flavor would work better.</li>
            <li> Ordered Wen Healthy hair cair system.I hoped Wen would be as good as they claim,being it was a gift for someone.Its OK\\&quot; I was surprised when I received another order soon after(wasn&#x27;t aware of auto delivery)When I contacted customer service,they were not interested.I work in the hospitality field and was surprised they did&#x27;nt want me to be happy or satisfied.Even blamed me.I order online from time to time and this has to be the worst customer service. disappointed.</li>
            <li> The product smells strongly of ammonia, doesn&#x27;t rinse well in the local water, and left an unsafe slippery film on the tub basin.  My hair fell out in big amounts each time I used it. My hair was somewhat stiff, making it more difficult to style without additional products.  I used it for a month to be sure these effects weren&#x27;t transitory. They weren&#x27;t.  I then switched shampoos to see if the effects disappeared.  They did.  I would not use this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> The product is just ok.  I tried to cancel but they keep sending it to me and charging me. I wish it were some thing you could buy in a store when you need it.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy it.  We have all been convinced one hair product or another is going to be the next best thing to make our morning easier but this is not the item!!  After using it for a few days my hair went from good to greasy and dirty.  It weighs it down and looks like you took an oil bath.  I later found out friends of mine also gave it a chance and had the same experience.  They also continue to charge you every month and when you call to cancel they say you are not in the system or try back another time.  I have been getting it and now I cant even give this stuff away!</li>
            <li> Wen is great product to use. I have medium long hair, it was dry and frizzy. Since I&#x27;ve used wen my hair is shiny, not frizzy and has full volume.  One thing it tells you don&#x27;t use everyday,  so if it didn&#x27;t work for you that&#x27;s why. Some people really need to read better..&lt;br /&gt;Wen is the best..</li>
            <li> I really do like this product though I find it a bit pricey. My hair always feels clean and smells wonderful.  I have noticed a change in that I am losing less hair in the shower and my hair doesn&#x27;t look as dry.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Listened to the hype- tried Wen, paid way to much for the worst shampoo I have ever used. My husband and I have normal untreated hair, this shampoo left both of us with greasy hair and it looked like we needed to wash our hair. Maybe if you have very dry hair, it works like advertised.</li>
            <li> First off, my hair is HORRIBLE!!  I have been looking for a product that would do some good for my hair for so many years that I couldn&#x27;t even begin to tell you the amount of money I have spent on hair products and shampoos.  I just tried it today and my hair actually felt soft!  I have fine, colored, graying hair that is wavy and straight...a mess. Although I still had to use my straightener on my hair, the texture of my hair was improved tremendously.  The only thing I must say is that my hair did not look like what you see happening on the infomercial (thus the need for the straightener).  I still loved what it did and am going to try the hydrating mask to see what results I get.  All in all...it gets an excellent from me.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m trying out the healthly lifestyle thing, and I&#x27;m completely addicted.  Eliminating chemicals is next on my list, so I decided to start with hair care.  I heard good things about WEN and decided to try it.  WEN looks, feels, smells like my organic Trader Joe&#x27;s (or most any) conditioner.  I have chest-length hair, and I didn&#x27;t use nearly as much as the WEN bottle recommended.  But when I use my Trader Joes conditioner (just conditioner, no shampoo), I get the exact same results as with the WEN shampoo.  Great texture, manageable, plenty of volume, great smell.  So overall, although I really like the WEN product, I can get the same result with a store-bought organic, sodium-laureth-sulfate-free conditioner.     My advice would be to try &#x27;shampooing&#x27; with just your conditioner first (I know, it sounds CRAZY, but your hair and scalp will thank you for it after a few weeks).  Try and go 2-3 days between &#x27;washing&#x27; your hair (again, it sounds CRAZY) with conditioner, for 2 weeks or so.  Your hair should definitely be getting less greasy/shiny/dirty than it was before.  If you are satisfied that your hair condition is getting better and you want to continue, consider buying the WEN to try it.  There are 3 bottles that come in this package; I know prior reviews have said there were differences between them, but I only noticed a change in the scent).    Last thing - if you are interested in leading a chemical-free lifestyle, visit [...] for toxicity ratings on health and personal-care products.  And congratulations on taking the next step towards a healthly lifestyle and planet!</li>
            <li> This product does not work for fine thin hair. Less than half way through the day my hair was flat and listless and looked thinner - not what I intended. Also they make you think that the product will last a month. It is a 16 oz bottle of shampoo for $30. I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair so I only needed a couple of pumps but still it only lasted a little over a week. I kept using it thinking my hair would improve over time, but it did not. Also all the other product that were pushed on you at the time of the sale were useless for thin fine hair. This does not eliminate other products unless you like completely flat listless hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Wen Cucumber Aloe, Lavender, and Almond Mint cleansing conditioners.  After the first use my hair was transformed.  Each time I use the product my hair becomes softer.  After reading the other reviews I don&#x27;t feel any greasy feeling when using the Wen products.  I was diagnosed with a thyroid disorder and since being on medication my hair has been brittle and falling out.  This is a miracle product!  I had my hair stylist color my gray last week and she could not believe how health my hair was.  You have got to try this, you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, limp hair, so I ordered the set of three for fine-medium hair. It smells great, but made my hair even flatter than usual. I would not recommend it for fine hair. Also, the pump only works on one of the bottles.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001D4FF66 WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner - 16 oz]][[ASIN:B00188IFHS WEN Lavender Cleansing Conditioner - 16oz]]   I have used these two and loved them both  I will use the Cucumber Aloe next. This product has me spoiled. It is so easy to use and such a time saver if you shower in the a.m.  I also serves as a shaving lotion!  I have read where some say it leaves their hair oily. Maybe they need to not use as much of the product or rinse more thoroughly. Since my hair also tends to be a bit oily with some products, try again and see if these tips help. I just love it and can&#x27;t wait to try the Cucumber and then I will order the large bottle!  Love the way my hair looks and feels!  Thanks CHAZ for this product  Kathy S</li>
            <li> All three are great smelling.  These work great on dry &amp; active hair (workouts, swimming, etc)to keep the hair soft &amp; conditioned.  Chlorine wrecks my hair but as soon as I use the WEN, you can&#x27;t tell my hair was just in the pool.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like washing my hair with Wen because I felt like I was washing it with condiioner.  So I wash my hair with Shampoo and then put the Wen on.  My hair has never been softer or more shiny.  Wen makes your hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li> When I first received the Chaz Wen kit from his website I used it as directed.  My hair was silky and shiny, but the problem was that it was to fine and limp.  I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it.  So I started using it as a conditioner only and let me tell you...I love it!!!  I use shampoo first, which I know defeats the purpose of using Chaz&#x27;s products, but using his conditioner as an actual conditioner has been awesome.  My hair has kept it&#x27;s color longer and it&#x27;s still very shiny, and I can style it.  Prior to using this product for a conditioner my color faded and it started looking like straw in less than two months.  Now my color is lasting longer and it no longer looks like straw.  I&#x27;m sorry Chaz that it didn&#x27;t work for me completely, but in the end, I still use your product.  I love it.  Oh, and I love the minty sensation on my head!!</li>
            <li> MUST READ!!!!!  I ordered the product online during the infomerical I saw on TV.  I received my order about 7 business days after I ordered it.  I read all in the information inside of the box.  In tiny print on your invoice it tells you that you are set up for automatic delivery unless you call customer service and adjust the number of shipments or cancel completely. THE KEY IS TO CALL BEFORE 30 DAYS TO CANCEL....BEFORE THEY SEND OUT THE 2ND SHIPMENT.  YES THEY DO HAVE A 60 DAYS RETURN POLICY, BUT IF YOU WANT TO THE 60TH DAY TO CANCEL, THEN THE 2 SHIPMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN MAILED. YOU NEED TO CALL AND CANCEL BEFORE THEY SHIP THE 2ND BOX TO YOU.  I called and was hold for about 2 minutes and the lady did try to sell me another scent of the product.  I told her I just wanted to cancel and she said I would receive a conformation e-mail confirming.  About 3 days later I received the conformation cancelling any and all delieveries.  HAIR: i ordered the almond scented one they show in the infomerical.  It works ok.  My hair is extremely long and healthy.  so I didn&#x27;t see much of a drastic result like they over emphasis in the commerical.  My hair was softer.  I have not used the overnight hair mask yet.  I think that is where I will see my results.  The bottle is small and i would run out in 2 weeks max if i used this everyday.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical...  BUT, after my first use of WEN I became a total believer!  My hair had never  been so shiny or healthy looking as it did after just one washing!  I have VERY thin, fine lightened hair - and many products are just too thick or heavy and make my hair flat and stringy - not WEN - beatiful body AND shine and it looks healthier than it has in years.  Thank you WEN.  I TOTALLY reccomend this product!  Patti Negri</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairstylist.  I have access to great products at half the price of retail.  I have naturally curly hair which I color and heat-style on a regualr basis.    While I concider my hair easy to manipulate, I find when I use Wen my hair is super shiny, managable, and much much healthier than when I have used any of the other professional products on the market available to me.    Initially I purchased the Sweet Almond Mint through the infomercial ... then researched through Amazon!  I&#x27;m happy to have found Amazon because there is much more to choose from and the reviews are terrific.  I simply called and cancelled my &#x27;membership&#x27; before my next shipment with out any problems.    I love the results I received using the Sweet Almond Mint and decided to try something else and purchased the Fig.  At first I found it to be overly heavy for my hair which is of medium density, but fine strands which can tend to frizz if I don&#x27;t have the right amount of hydration to hold soft curls with out any sort of product feeling.     I found if I use much less of the product for leave in, and as well a small amount of styling cream just before I get out of the shower the results are great, beyond my expectations. With the Sweet Almond Mint I wasn&#x27;t worried about using &#x27;too much&#x27;, it was far less of a learning curve.    I do find the Fig too heavy when I straighten my hair, particularly if I am not going to do my hair the next day. It feels limp and heavy compared to the &#x27;just blown out&#x27; fullness of the day before.  With the Sweet Almond Mint it still felt bouncy, even on the third day!     I honestly wondered if all the cleansing conditioners were the same with different scents...  They do vary!    I found with the Sweet Almond Mint even on the third day my hair still felt fresh and soft.    I particularly hate that slept on next day hair smell and don&#x27;t have it when I use Wen.    The smaller bottles require more pumps.  I have a mid length cut and use 4 for the crown, 4for the sides, and 4 for the back.  With the large bottles more is pumped out.    I read one review that simply stated, you&#x27;ll figure out how much you need... you will.    I&#x27;m interested in trying the Cucumber and Lavendar, particularly so I can more accurately gage what my clients might prefer for their hair type with out having to do as much trial and error as I am willing do.  And I HAVE recommended Wen to my clients.    I think the deal with three might be a great start for someone interested in Wen but not sure what they need.    Over-all I think the Sweet Almond Mint is the perfect fit for just about anyone.     I will admit it is refreshing to use, it wakes me up ... however, it does smell ... different ... minty, maybe even a bit medicinal. Though smell is subjective from one person to another.  However, it doesn&#x27;t linger and won&#x27;t compete with whatever perfume or scent someone would wear.    Hope this helps, I have tried to be as detailed as I could be.</li>
            <li> I see this product advertized on the television all of the time, but it was to expensive for me to try.  However, when I noticed the \\&quot;WEN Set of Three\\&quot;, I decided to give it a try... THREE-FOR-THE-PRICE-OF-ONE.  I love the product and the fact that I get 3 different scent is amazing.  Since trying this product, WEN cleansing conditioner, it&#x27;s my hair&#x27;s best friend. I just love the feel of my hair, which makes me want to condition my hair more.  No more other products me for... p.s my favorite is sweet almond mint</li>
            <li> The cucumber is the only one for my longer, fine oil prone hair. I use it occasionally. The real medical benefit is to my husbands scalp which was getting ravaged by harsh soaps and chlorine that stripped the acid mantle leaving bumps and vulnerable skin! His scalp never had a chance to recover it&#x27;s own protective sheath! This product is perfect for his everyday use in the almond and lavender. I don&#x27;t think there is another non-laurel sulfate equal. I grew up with lanolin base shampoos and Breck coconut oil. (The old days.) And, sorry dear, he does not have much hair left anyway so it really is a matter of cleaning the skin while leaving the hair looking good. Wen really does all of that. Forget about the \\&quot;20 pumps\\&quot; thing on the label too. Just a normal couple of pumps does it. Just rinse well and maybe run it through twice if needed and you can leave some in. It&#x27;s a keeper for us and worth the expense at this point because of the quality of ingredients. Read the label. Pretty amazing compared to the detergent out there!</li>
            <li> Keep your money. The product is pure junk. It made my fine hair greasy and limp. Who wants to take a cold shower at 5:30 in the morning? If that&#x27;s what it takes to use this crap-forget it.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have a TON of long fine hair. We have only ever used salon haircare products to keep it healthy. Our hair gets really big and frizzy after washing. I first considered this product for my 16 year old daughter who has blonde straw looking hair. After the first use I saw much more control and shine to her hair. Mine was also softer as well but the difference was so much more apparent on her.     After several weeks of using all three of the fine to normal types the difference that I see in both of our hair amazes me. I have had to spend so much time putting product into my hair at different stages of drying to keep it from looking like like I ratted my hair, that Just to wash my hair and go is very freeing. If I feel like my hair is a bit dry I use the tiniest bit of styling creme.     Both my daughter and I agree this is the best thing we have ever found for our crazy hair. We both use less than the number of pumps recommended for our hair length but I have found I leave it on longer than suggested and rince for a very long time. All in all it still works out to be less than the time spent shampooing, conditioning, and applying various products. I won&#x27;t go back That&#x27;s a Fact!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now and really like it.  My hair feels much healthier.  After about a week of use I have to use my regular shampoo because I feel like a get a build up.  When I use my regular shampoo I can really tell just how much more drying it is on my hair.</li>
            <li> I must say, I was completely excited to try this product. I have medium length naturally curly hair that is also color treated. My hair tends to dry out easily, and I was excited to try this product in hopes that it would deliver results like they claim. Unfortunately, the wen products did absoultely nothing to my hair. It did not feel softer, look shiner and it certainly didn&#x27;t give me a good hair day! Although I was not impressed with the first use, I continued to use it until the bottle was gone (this only took 3 shampoos) but never received any results at all. When a bottle of shampoo costs $30.00 and only lasts through 3 washes, you better deliver what you claim. This product was a huge disappointment!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a week and I love it!  I have very fine shoulder legnth hair that is frequently highlighted.  This has restored the sheen to my hair without weighing it down.  My hair looks so shiny and is unbelievably soft!  I am very impressed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen for the past few days now and WOW, my hair looks great! I have shoulder-length, fine-textured wavy, flyaway hair. I can now throw away the anti-frizz serum, stop buying overpriced Kerastase shampoo and stop using traditional conditioner that leaves my hair slimy. With Wen, my hair is bouncy, shiny and takes styling like never before.     The instructions leave you wondering about getting clean hair, but it really does leave my rather oily scalp clean, but not dry. The lavender variety seems to remove the most oiliness. Because of my oily scalp, I haven&#x27;t yet done the version where you leave the product in your hair after towel-drying, but I&#x27;ll give it a try.  The basic treatment doesn&#x27;t leave any buildup and the smell is very subtle. The price is perfect, especially when you compare it against salon products that don&#x27;t do half as good a job.     Wen simplifies and improves haircare, especially for color-treated hair. Once you get over notions from a lifetime of traditional shampooing and try it, you won&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products.  I have very thick, fine hair and have always wished for more shine.  The Wen conditioners have my hair looking shinier and healthier than all the other shampoos, conditioners and flat irons combined.  Five stars!</li>
            <li> Wen has made my hair shiny and it does wonders for tangles.  The only bad thing about it is that it is so expensive.  It is well worth the cost though, and I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, colored hair. It has been a problem all my life- dry ends, oily roots. Basically looks like feathers. Wen has totally changed the texture of my hair. It took me a second to get the hang of it- you have to use kind of a lot, and scrub your scalp for a bit. I use the cucumber now but I&#x27;m trying the lavender next. I don&#x27;t use it as a leave in, I find that is a little too much for my hair. I actually think I am going to be able to grow my hair past my shoulders with this product for the first time in 15 years.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Your hair is remarkable when it is washed you will not believe the difference, but a bit pricey</li>
            <li> I have greasy roots with dry split ends...and this stuff really balances it all out.  I have no split ends developing when normally I would by now (its been 6 months since my last trim and I dont even need one yet).  I cheat and use a applicator bottle to get it to the scalp or my hair will look greasy.  If I dont wash it completely out then it will look greasy.  So the trick is to get it to the roots and rinse rinse rinse.  My hair is normally limp and dull and now its boucey but not \\&quot;puffy\\&quot;.  I tell eveyone about it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after I had read all of the reviews.  I read the instructions, and after the first use I could not believe how great my hair looked and felt.    I have fine, colored/highlighted hair.  I&#x27;m 62 so my hair is thinning a bit.  I normally use the shampoo, conditioner for colored hair with a root lift.  I can throw away those products, since all I need is the WEN.    The first time is a little difficult, since you do have to make some extra effort to use the product but it is well worth it:  beautiful, shiny hair with no need of mousse or root lift for body, no need for hair spray.  Feels like I have real hair full of life, and this is after 7 weeks from having my hair cut and colored (you know how it gets lifeless after that time).  And you can actually still see my highlights.    Wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> love how my hair feels and smells. product is pricey and you need to use more than I expected.</li>
            <li> After watching infomercials, I had hopes that this product would tame my unruly curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I will wash my hair with only conditioner or detangler (Biolage works great!) and the outcome is about the same, except it doesn&#x27;t cost $50.&lt;br /&gt;I was really let down by this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells great, feels gentle, and leaves my hair healthy, shiny, and soft. Only complaint is that you have to use ~16-20 pumps for one wash, and it&#x27;s a tiny bottle! But well worth it I suppose!</li>
            <li> I finally caved in and purchased the WEN product after seeing it month after month on infomercials.  I researched the product online and realized I didn&#x27;t want to order via their website as they do the monthly recurring charge, which was NOT the route I wanted to take, I decided to go the Amazon.com way.    I ordered the 3 smaller bottles so I could determine which one fit my hairstyle best.  I am 1/4 Native American so I have alot of fine, naturally wavy hair that looks like a \\&quot;beautiful body perm\\&quot; (or so I&#x27;ve been told).  I don&#x27;t really know about that - I just know that I wanted something that made my hair healthy, light and frizz-free.  :)  I have never had any chemical treatments or color done to my hair and I am very cautious about layering products because it tends to weigh down my hair and I end up feeling like I&#x27;m walking around with a grease head.  :)      I used the Cucumber first and loved it!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and light my hair felt!  I divided up all 3 bottles to share with my twin sister so we could do an assessment of all 3 cremes:  cucumber, almond and tea tree.  Cucumber was DEFINITELY the favorite!    Because using alot of any product weighs my hair down, I didn&#x27;t use the full recommended pumps - I just used 12-15 for the first couple of days.  I loved the crisp, tingling I felt throughout my hair! That worked great and so I thought I would up the pumps to 30 a day.  There was a major difference in the shine of my hair by increasing the pump #.      I WILL SAY THAT I DO NOT SOLELY USE WEN FOR SHAMPOO.  I couldn&#x27;t get out of the habit of needing the shampoo first, so I use WEN as a daily deep conditioning, and a very small amount of the creme as a leave-in conditioner.  My hair and scalp type do not allow for that process.    Here is my best feedback:  Know your hair and your scalp and what works and doesn&#x27;t work for you.  If you are wanting the exact results that you see on T.V., then my guess is you will need to buy the full product line.  If you want shine, light and frizz/tangle free hair, then maybe use it as a daily conditioner.  I tried going back to my shampoo/conditioner just as a test and the difference is night and day.</li>
            <li> Wen might work on curly, thick, normal and \\&quot;thick\\&quot; dry hair. However, don&#x27;t bother trying it if you have baby fine hair. It weights it down, I really wanted this product to work for me. I do have a lot of baby fine hair, however it weighted it down so much it look like an oil slick. It was so bad I thought maybe I put too much on an tried it a total of 5 times following the directions. Honestly, I gave it to a friend who had super thick hair and not at all baby fine. She mentioned it also weighed her hair down &amp; would not use it on her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone who is not looking for any styling and likes the super \\&quot;slick\\&quot; look and does not mind \\&quot;flat\\&quot; this will work for you. Sorry, I really wanted this product to work. For some people I am sure this works great - however baby fine hair gets weighed down so easy. One of my friends mentioned my hair looked oily right after I washed it. That was the last straw and gave it to my friend to try. My hair did look \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; but looked more oily than shiny. Honestly it made me feel as if I needed to wash it everyday to make it look normal. However, Wen did not ever make it bouncy or normal. Just got more oily with each use.</li>
            <li> This is similar to the co-shampooing I was already doing to my african-american NATURAL chemical free hair.  I love this product.  Really helps my natural hair and leaves it soft and moisturized. I am so glad Chaz created this.  I am sold and I am a new WEN customer.  I just ordered the set for Ethnic african american hair.  Can&#x27;t wait for it to get here.  This stuff is really really great and it even gets the oil and funky odor out of black hair that has grease/oil in it.  Simply wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product due to the good reviews.  I am usually a pretty easy person to please.  I was so disappointed with this stuff.  I tried it again and again with different amounts/times left on different formulas, etc,.. but each time my hair at the roots looked greasy.  The advertisement said you don&#x27;t need to wash your hair but once every 2-3 days when you use wen.  As soon as I washed it, I felt it looked like it needed washing again.  Wished I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly and bleached blonde hair.  I was really hoping that Wen would meet the advertised promises, but... well, it just doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve tried all three of these and it is o.k., but for the cost I will go back to regular shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is fine and very curly.  I (vainly) bleach it blonde so it is dry too.  I gave each of the three samples ample opportunity (used each completely) to live up to the promised results and they are just not there.  It does help to use it as a leave-in conditioner, but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.  My hair is still frizzy, but it is very soft.  The lavendar relaxed my curls somewhat, which is not what I wanted.  The \\&quot;mint\\&quot; is very strong and could easily double as a sinus unblocker.  I used the almond first and thought I could get used to the smell.  The others are less pleasant.  I may try the fig because I really do like the convience of using one product over several and my hair has never been softer. However,my hopes are not high.  Good luck to all who read this.  I hope it works better for you if you decide to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> I would have to say these products are just OK.  Using it as a shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling kinda heavy and a little dirty after a few straight days.  I didn&#x27;t really notice that it made my hair any less frizzy.  I have been using it currently as just a conditioner - not putting it on my whole head.  My hair is defintely softer, but not silky-looking like the ad states.  I may try the set that is for coarse hair next.</li>
            <li> I will never use another conditioner again and I have no stock in WEN :) I do not use this as a shampoo on a daily basis due to my fine, heavy hair - but I have used it as a conditioner everyday for the past 3 months and my hair looks fantastic. It is healthy, has movement, the color lasts longer and above all - the SHINE!! I have tried the fig, the sweet almond mint and the cucumber aloe now and I think I like the sweet almond mint the best. I have also used the styling creme and the wax stick - both good products if you are not looking for a strong hold - because they are conditioning as well. Also - no need to use as much as the bottle states - I use 2-3 pumps on my below shoulder length hair and it is plenty. I also use it weekly as a deep conditioner/mask and leave it on for a few hours or overnight. And can you believe the list of ingredients? This is so good for your hair that it will thank you.  I can only imagine this product would work even better on thick, coarse, dry hair.     WEN is well worth the price for the quality and Amazon has the best prices and variety of sets to choose from - enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love these little bottles.  They are great for traveling.  I really like the Wen Hair Care items.  My scalp is oily so I have to use regular shampoo every so often.  Most of the time, all I need is the Wen shampoo and my hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, somewhat oily hair.  I really didn&#x27;t think that this heavy cream \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; would get it clean.  But I followed the instructions and it did the job very well.  My hair wasn&#x27;t heavy or greasy at all. I used one entire bottle to make sure I gave it a chance to do what it claims.  Well, it did an okay job.  Nothing special.  I&#x27;m guessing this shampoo is more for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li> You know I really like it... I use it every other day! and in between, I use one pump, as a pick me up!  My hair is fine and limp, and Wen like brought my hair back to life 3 pumps first thing after getting my hair wet in ths shower... do the reast of my regiem and lastly rinse my hair, and towel dry, and a so far I have used about a pump and half for a leave in conditionar... gave me volume and shine! really! I&#x27;m buying a bottle of the almond for my mom for her birthday! she tried mine and really liked it too!  We live in Minnesota, and its dry and bitter cold.... I have yet to use this in the summer here with the humidity? it shall be interesting!  I willl let you know! I hope this helps you, oh my hair length is a shoulder bob.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 10 months now and was so excited that my hair felt soft and was shiny just after my first few uses.  I have thin hair and use the cucumber aloe formula.  However, within the last month or 2 I&#x27;ve had unbelieveable knots in my hair.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem before so I went back to the normal shampoo/conditioner I used before Wen and the knots are gone.  Very weird!</li>
            <li> I was happy with Wen after using it for a couple weeks. My hair is thick and curly, and this made it soft and manageable. It does create a gunky build-up, so I needed to alternate with regular shampoo. The main problem is Wen&#x27;s business model. They require you to provide your credit or bank card information, and then they bill you more frequently than you expect, EVEN AFTER YOU CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT. I called their automated system and cancelled my account; they charged me even more the following month. I called and spoke with a \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; representative; she refused to cancel my account, trying instead to redirect me to a different product. I finally demanded to speak to a manager; she said she would cancel the account right away, but I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll have to cancel my credit card to be rid of this horrible company. DO NOT BUY WEN. Soft hair isn&#x27;t worth the aggravation!</li>
            <li> As a self-proclaimed Shampoo addict (seriously had at least 15 varieties in my shower prior to trying WEN) I can tell you that I LOVE this product and have since cleaned out my shower! I was skeptical at first but let me tell you, this product is amazing!  Since I am a \\&quot;addict\\&quot; I do enjoy have the 3 different varieties of WEN to switch around.  They all are slightly different but equally as good. They all smell great (Lavender is the best!) and they all leave my hair feeling soft &amp; manageable.    Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial for Wen and, of course, hoped that the product would do wonders for me. I actually have used conditioners to clean my hair for several years after reading a book called \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; where the author quit using shampoo and cleaned her hair with conditioner instead.  It is not a new concept to do this.  I was just hoping for a superior product and my daughters wanted to try Wen as well.  First of all, my daughter complained about the smell of the cucumber aloe conditioner.  I thought it couldn&#x27;t be that bad, and then I tried it and understood immediately what she meant.  It smells like menthol in cough drops or Vicks Vaporub. Yuck! I had taken the cucumber aloe with me on vacation before trying it and actually went out and bought a new conditioner at a drugstore.  It made my hair frizzy when I used it and when I got home and went back to my old Paul Mitchell leave in conditioner, I was much happier.      Looks like I&#x27;m the exception, but it is my honest opinion and review. If you decide to try it, I hope you have better luck with this product than I did!</li>
            <li> BEWARE if you buy this, the alleged \\&quot;60-day guarantee\\&quot; is a fallacy.  If you do not cancel enrollment by the 29th day of your original ORDER, you will be shipped a 90-day replenishment supply at a cost of over $38.00 automatically billed to your credit card.  Now you tell me, is that a 60-day money back guarantee?  Sure, you can send the replenishment back and wait 4-6 weeks for your refund, but do you want all that hassle while all you were trying to do was use the entire 60-day period to determine if the product works for you or not?  This is an example of sharp consumer practices that turn people off to infomercial products that might actually be good products.  The literature that comes with the shipment is riddled with references to the \\&quot;60-day guarantee\\&quot; and \\&quot;90-day\\&quot; future replenishments.  NO WHERE ON THE INITIAL SHIPMENT LITERATURE DOES IT SAY THAT IF YOU DON&#x27;T CANCEL BY THE 29TH DAY AFTER YOUR ORDER, YOU WILL BE REPLENISHED, AND YOU WILL RECEIVE A 90-DAY SHIPMENT AT ALMOST $40.  BAD, BAD commercial practice.  And by the way, I did not find the product to be the miracle it is touted as.  Does it clean hair?  Yes.  But my hair looks the same after styling as it ever did.  I like the fact that it is sulfate free and all natural, and I perceive that my color lasts longer than when using regular shampoo, but that would be true with any of the numerous sulfate-free shampoos on the market.  There is nothing super special about this product that would cause me to continue to use it despite the trickery of the business model.  Had I not been totally turned off by the sneaky 30-day replenishment in contravention of the 60-day guarantee, I probably would have stayed on as a customer for the benefits of the all-natural ingredients, but if a company challenges your trust in its business practices, how can you trust its product claims?</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother and she absolutly loved it. Will be buying again. Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product and now I have been using it for 10 days,  too much wax weight my hair down, no shine, my scalp feels dirty and my hair is falling.  I have had better products much better.  This is not at all what it says in the infomercial</li>
            <li> 5.0 out of 5 stars It does work!, July 5, 2008  By  A believer (Arizona) - See all my reviews  I have read all the reviews posted on these products. I purchased the 3 pack variety of lavendar, cucumber/melon and sweet almond mint about 2 months ago in the 6 ounce size.    A little background -- 2 years ago I had major surgery which left my once fairly thick hair very thin, especially on top, and very dried out. My hairdresser had recommended many types of shampoos, conditioners, leave in treatments, etc (very costly stuff to say the least) and still every time I would go in to the salon she would talk about how damaged my hair was.    I saw this product advertised on one of the TV shopping channels and thought at first \\&quot;I can&#x27;t pay that much for something that might not work.\\&quot; Then, I started adding up what I had already spent on products that didn&#x27;t work and thought \\&quot;What the heck; let&#x27;s give it a try.\\&quot; So, having now very fine hair I opted for the 3 variety pack for fine to medium hair.    Once I received the items (quickly too), I first tried the cucumber/melon. I followed the directions that come with the product to the letter. Two months later, I no longer hear from the hairdresser that my hair is so damaged I must try yet some other product that she recommends to the tune of so much more money than this product costs. I am still using the same 6 ounce bottle of cucumber/melon, so needless to say this product last a long time. I also put about 5 pumps of the lavender in a spray bottle with water for touchups between shampoos. I even use this on my 2 and half year old granddaughter after we&#x27;ve been in the swimming pool to comb out her hair which is very thick. She likes the way it smells and doesn&#x27;t mind \\&quot;nani\\&quot; combing her hair out anymore since \\&quot;it doesn&#x27;t hurt.\\&quot;    My hair is so much softer, has more body, and although it is still very thin on top, I no longer have to endure comments about how damaged my hair is.    I am a believer! I can&#x27;t wait to try theSweet Almond Mint and Lavendar. Keep up the good work Chaz!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I have medium thickness shoulder length straight hair. My two hair issues that I&#x27;m always trying to resolve are lack of volume and frizz. This product claimed to take care of both. It didn&#x27;t. I followed directions to a T and have used this already a few times. No extra volume, no reduction in frizz. In fact, I think I&#x27;ve got more frizz with it. Regular \\&quot;Extra-volume\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners work much better. The only thing that&#x27;s nice is that hair feels soft and light. But then again, it was pretty soft and light before. All in all - wasted money.</li>
            <li> The product made my hair fall out! AND, they signed me up for THREE shipments I didn&#x27;t want and charged my credit card! I contacted the company and my credit card company to block them. They only reimbursed part of my money saying S&amp;P is not included on top of the $20 I spent sending the worthless product back.&lt;br /&gt;Save your time, money, and hair! Avoid this product and company!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have recommended it to so many friends.  I should be on a commission basis with Chaz!</li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair and am a minimalist when it comes to it. I always let it air dry and rarely style it, but I do put coconut oil in it to add some moisture and shine. Even so, my hair is dry and poofy, so I was really attracted to Wen after seeing the commercial a couple months ago.    I&#x27;m not a big spender when it comes to hair products, so buying a product this expensive was a jump for me. To make it last, I washed my hair only every other day (which I used to do with normal shampoo to help with the dryness), and I used only about 12 pumps instead of the suggested number. 12 pumps was still enough to sufficiently coat my hair, so I think this was fine. Doing these two things, I was able to stretch the three bottles to last about two months.    Overall I really like Wen and will buy more. It&#x27;s certainly no miracle product, and I doubt you&#x27;ll get exactly what you see on the commercial or website. For me, my hair is much softer and feels healthier and more moisturized. It still has some poof, but not as much. And I still use the coconut oil in certain areas to \\&quot;lock in\\&quot; the softness and add shine. I did try a pump of Wen as a styling cream, but it made my hair a little sticky. Another thing I really like about it is that unlike other conditioners, which can be really difficult washing out of your hair, Wen washes out easily.    Besides having softer, healthier hair, I found some smaller benefits from using Wen. When I wash and comb my hair, noticeably less gets pulled out. Shampooing also used to make my scalp very irritated and itchy on the top, but it&#x27;s improved a lot since then, and I expect it&#x27;ll keep getting better.    Although I didn&#x27;t like the scents of any of the bottles, I&#x27;m going to buy more of the lavender. I especially did not like the cucumber one, because the smell stung my eyes a little. One other thing I noticed was that as more time went by, I think my hair got used to the products and the cleanness of my hair didn&#x27;t last as long as it had in the beginning. I&#x27;m going to try a normal shampoo maybe once a week and see if that helps clarify it. And one thing I did not like about the packaging is that by the bottom of each bottle, the pump stopped working well and I had to scoop out the last of it with my fingers.    All in all, I recommend it for dry and damaged hair, just don&#x27;t expect to come out looking like their ads.</li>
            <li> This really works - your hair is so much softer and voluminous. I dont want to go back to regular shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and live in a humid climate.  I have been trying for years to find a shampoo that left me with some volume, but didn&#x27;t leave hair feeling rough.  I bought this based on the reviews, but was not holding out much hope.   Wow! Was I wrong, even after the first time I could feel the difference.  I am sold!  Best hair product I have used.  I have short, fine hair so I use a lot less than the recommended number of pumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN for a few years now off and on. It&#x27;s a cleanser/conditioner for your hair that replaces traditional shampooing and conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long blonde hair that has curl to it and it is terrible comb out after washing; I mean, terrible! So, I so some information on WEN and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It really cleanses my hair and leaves it shiny.&lt;br /&gt;* My hair is incredibly easy to comb through after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;* It uses specific essential oils that target certain hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The cost.&lt;br /&gt;* It was hard to get used to using a creamy conditioner type cleanser instead of sudsing up. (I got used to it, though)&lt;br /&gt;* Depending on the length of your hair, it takes quite a few pumps (around 40 pumps for my long hair),which can be costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I do like the product; it&#x27;s great for any hair type and the instructions are very thorough. I don&#x27;t care for some of the scents but that&#x27;s a personal preference. I have family and friends that I have given WEN to as gifts that love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend trying a small bottle and giving it a try, I don&#x27;t think most would be disappointed in its performance.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the product. I ordered the 3 pack, of 6oz. each. Way over priced, makes hair flat, and feels OVER conditioned. Great way to waste your money! If you dont have natural curly hair, or \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot; hair, this product is NOT for you! I will be giving away two of the three I purchased. Thanks for the education!    I also was directed to a \\&quot;deal\\&quot; to save money on shipping. I clicke don NO THANKS, twice. And later recieved a bill for $139.00 for a \\&quot;free ship\\&quot; package. Makes no sense at all. And, I will never shop Amazon again! Thanks for the screwing over!</li>
            <li> Thought I would try this but did not like it.  I think you have to actually wash your hair with shampoo for it to be clean.  I don&#x27;t even wash my hair every day.</li>
            <li> When I first tried Wen, I purchased it direct from the official sight and got turned off instantly because of the repeat refill program. I hadn&#x27;t wanted to commit to a product that easily. Then I purchased through Amazon, with no reoccurring costs. That is the worst I can say about Wen and the overall experience of it.     This is absolutely a FANTASTIC product. It takes a little getting used to the fact that there is  no lather, no bubbles!! but after the first wash, you will never go back to shampoo.. I must warn you though, no matter which fragrance you choose, I highly recommend purchasing the coordinating oil, as your hair does smell different, unlike the fresh scents of your favorite conditioner, it is almost a dirty smell. HOWEVER, set that aside as it is easily remedied.. The product is great~ your hair feels so different, it is soft and silky, yet full, not flat. I was amazed after blow drying it, how manageable it was and with absolutely no use of gels, mousse, or any product.  I have color treated hair(base, high and low lights) and am a red head to boot, which is a tough color to keep fresh and shining..With Wen, my color lasts 2-3 weeks longer, the overall condition of my hair is excellent and it has a growth rate 10 times what it used to be!! You can add hairspray, gels, any styling products that are even non Wen products to you hair and it will shape and hold perfectly but never get stiff, it&#x27;s amazing!  I bring it to my stylist every time I get my hair done..I could never go back to regular shampoo.. Even the \\&quot;sulphate free\\&quot; shampoos can not hold a candle to WEN.. It&#x27;s great! but you must follow the instructions.. It is SO true.. the more product you use, the better the results.. I tried cutting back on how many pumps I used to see if it made a difference, and it most definitely did! Now regarding the not so fresh smell of your hair.. It may just be my hair, so please, don&#x27;t use that as a reason not to try Wen. It is a bit pricey, but to me, well worth it.. If you can&#x27;t afford the coordinating oils, don&#x27;t worry about it.. If you find your hair not smelling as fresh as you like, spray your favorite perfume or Bath and Body Works mist, anything into your hair while it is damp and it will smell great when it&#x27;s dry.. Of all the scents available, I am leaning towards the Lavender to be my favorite, but they all work the same, no matter which scent you choose. I purchase through Amazon, the 3 scent variety pack. Great product!! Kudo&#x27;s to inventor, Chaz Dean...</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo ever. My hair always used to look fried after I shampooed. Overly dry and lifeless but no more! I tried many conditioners an they never took care of the problem. Now I know it was just stripping way the natural oil that give shine and a healthy look to the hair. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3 pack starter set of WEN because (like so many other people) I have been enchanted by the infomercials for some time.  I have now been using the products loyally for three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: :)&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, super rich and creamy, does indeed clean your scalp and hair without lather, made my hair softer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: :(&lt;br /&gt;Routine takes too long: for me, rinsing with cool water, then applying 24-32 pumps of this stuff to my hair, massaging for 2-3 minutes, combing through, clipping up, leaving on for 5-15 minutes, and rinsing for 5 minutes with cool water is just too much a hassle.  I don&#x27;t enjoy cool water pouring down my body in the shower, especially on cold mornings.  It takes a while to fully rinse because it is so thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEH: :|&lt;br /&gt;The only difference I can see is that my hair is slightly softer.  But my shine and manageability hasn&#x27;t had a noticeable increase.My hair wasn&#x27;t unhealthy before I started this product; maybe that&#x27;s why it wasn&#x27;t the miracle product for me that they advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive.  It&#x27;s a hassle.  It&#x27;s not worth it for me.  I won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I have seen the infomercials and wondered about this shampoo. so I bought it and had high hopes for it. I am glad to say I was not dissappointed. It smeels sooooo good. It works just like it advertised.</li>
            <li> Have been extremely happy with this shampoo.  A few months ago I was experiencing some hair issues; dry; losing more hair than normal.  My sister gave me hers to try and it really made a difference in the condition of my hair, softer, and my hairloss has improved, not sure if a result of this shampoo or if it was actually stress related.  When I seem to try another shampoo in between they never seem to be as good as Wen.</li>
            <li> LOVE my results with this product!    I have short, fine, thin, color treated hair.  Over the decades I have become an expert with styling tools and products, tried and spent so much money on shampoos etc in an effort to make my hair look fuller.  I have always figured that one out.  What I have never been able to achieve though, is shiny, bouncy hair that looks full.  Well, until now that is.      I ordered the cucumber aloe after much procrastination.  I read many reviews about the Wen products on many different sites and couldn&#x27;t help but think that this concept on thin, fine hair will make it look greasy, dirty and flat.  NOT!!!  I have found the answer to everything I have been looking for.  My hair feels and looks clean, shiny, full and alive.  The home site claims that it gets better with use, it&#x27;s hard to imagine that it can get even better but if it does I&#x27;ll take it.    If you&#x27;ve been considering this product, buy it.  Follow the instructions to the letter (rinse, rinse, rinse) and I hope that you will be as thrilled as I am!!!  Good Luck!!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that was more natural and that did not contain any sodium laurXX compounds.  Many of the new shampoos market \\&quot;sulfate-free,\\&quot; only to find that they have sodium laureth chloride or some other version that acts as the lathering agent.  From a couple of different sources that I have read, these compounds are on the human carcinogenic list.  I was ecstatic to see that Wen has none of these compounds. It was a lifestyle change in order to reduce my exposure to chemicals that brought me to Wen.    Having said that, it was an adjustment not having any lather while cleansing my hair, especially after a workout.  However, I really like the product and plan to continue using it for both the health benefits and for the way my hair feels, looks, and behaves while using it!</li>
            <li> i STARTED USING WEN A WEEK AGO AND I HAVE NOTICED A GRADUAL CHANGE IN MY HAIR.  IT IS LOOKING SOFTER AFTER EVERY WASH. BEFORE IT WAS EXTREMELY FRIZZY.  I HAVE VERY THIN HAIR AND HAVE TRIED MANY PRODUCTS.  FOR NOW, I WILL CONTINUE USING WEN. I HAVE HEARD THAT AFTER 3 WEEKS YOU NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE.. I NOTICED IT IN ONE WEEK.</li>
            <li> Ever since I ordered this first Wen product, I have been a Wen convert! I have dry, stringy, straight long hair and have tried numerous shampoos. My habit was to always be sending off for free samples, so I was always trying different brands. I never really noticed much difference. However, after trying Wen just once, I immediately noticed my hair clean, shiny, FULL and thick. It looks so healthy! I don&#x27;t understand how it can be both silky and have so much body. It has also taken away the frizz and static cling also. I have ONLY used Wen since then, it is well worth the cost. I also converted some family members and friends to Wen, everyone is pleased!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of getting hooked on an expensive product that only made a marginal difference. However, I think this product is worth the money. I am pretty low maintenance and was hesitant to get into a prolonged daily shower routine -- with working in 20 pumps of product and then having to leave it in for 5 minutes. Quite frankly my typical shower doesn&#x27;t last that long. I was worried this would add too much to my daily prep time to be feasible. It doesn&#x27;t. I have about shoulder length very fine hair. I get it colored bi-monthly and blow dry it daily. It can get a little fried. Using Wen has added volume to the top of my head --- where with regular shampoo and conditioner it usually laid limp. It also has made my hair so smooth and soft I like to run my fingers threw it. I&#x27;m not a walking hair shampoo commercial -- strangers don&#x27;t stop me on the street -- but my best friend noticed and thought it was a new cut. She commented on the volume and and body. I have only used the lavendar thus far, and I use about 7 - 8 pumps in the shower. Then I add a small pump to the ends after I&#x27;ve towel dried. I know other postings mention playing around with the different types and the amount of product used. I&#x27;m pretty busy (and a touch lazy) so I haven&#x27;t done much experimenting --perhaps my ideal type any quantity may yield even better results.    I like this product and will continue to use it. I had been a decades long Aveda user and will not go back. I use so little of this product that expense isn&#x27;t really a factor. I was worried that on weekends when I didn&#x27;t wash my hair that it would be greasy due to being so conditioned, that hasn&#x27;t been a problem. I think my hair feels great, appears smoother and just looks more styled/groomed and less split endy or fly-away. This is a simple every day step that just makes me feel a little girlier -- in the best kind of soft way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started with the fig and am now trying these 3 other flavors. I really love the way my hair is since I started using WEN. It takes a little getting used to the way your hair feels, but it looks great and I love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product at the end of May. I specifically told the girl taking the order that I ABSOLUTELY UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE wanted to sign-up for reoccurring shipments. She said no problem. They emailed me the invoice - no mention of reoccurring shipments. Great! The product arrived in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Wen products exclusively for a month. I have A LOT of shoulder-length, very dry, curly, but not course, hair. It takes 8-9 full pumps of the cleansing conditioner to fully cover my hair. I could feel a difference - my hair felt very soft. I towel dried my hair &amp; applied some styling cream, the same amount I would use of my regular product. While my hair was soft, it was frizzy, fly-away, out of control with no curl definition at all. I have tried all different amounts of the styling cream, texture balm and finally resorted to using the remoist intensive hair treatment as a leave-in conditioner, but its really too heavy for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 5 weeks &amp; I decided to take advantage of the 60-Day Money Back Guarantee. Today a 2nd, unauthorized shipment showed up. I called to find out about cancelling &amp; returning the product. I have never delt with such rude &amp; irritating customer service people. All they did was try to sell me more Wen &amp; other Gunthy-Renker products. I finally had to tell the guy to \\&quot;shut-up &amp; listen\\&quot; to me. I asked if I needed a return authorization number. He said no but said he could give me a confirmation number \\&quot;if I wanted.\\&quot; Yes please. Then he hung up. I called back, turns out you do need an RA number, the original package &amp; invoice to return product for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wen might work for some people but not for me. I&#x27;m going back to using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Creme Curl Shampoo &amp; Quick Curls Leave-In. It works better and I don&#x27;t have to order it online anymore. I can now buy it at my local Target.</li>
            <li> This product is the biggest waste of time &amp; most of all money.  You WILL HATE IT!!  Trust me.  I have naturally curly hair.  I used it for one week (ALL I COULD stand) and then threw it away.  They DO NOT guarantee it for 60 days either.  No sooner did I buy it, less than 30 days later, they attempted to charge my card for another 3 month supply, which by the way, THEY DO NOT TELL you anywhere about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guthey Reinker is THE MOST unprofessional company to ever deal with.  I tried them and used pro active (junk!!!) Meaningful Beauty (REALLY JUNK) and then stupid me tried it again with Wen, never realizing that the same company does all those stupid informercials you fall for on t.v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, do no waste your money and your time.  The only way you can have any of these crazy nightmares stop, is to completely CANCEL your credit card and reopen with a new one down the road, otherwise they will continually charge your c.c. with their stupid products.</li>
            <li> Even though it is supposed to be for fine hair which my hair couldn&#x27;t get any finer it made my hair very greasy and flat. I tried to use as little of the product and followed the directions perfectly and even bought the comb you are supposed to run through your hair while in the shower. I ended up switching back to Nexus and Dove shampoo. Even head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner have made my hair feel softer and give it more volume than this shampoo did.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick strawberry blonde hair that&#x27;s in the middle of curly and straight with a nice layer of frizz on top.  Well I used Wen because everyone who I know that uses it has said it&#x27;s a miracle worker, but not for me.  Not sure if it&#x27;s because my hair is just naturally thick and so in between everything, but it made my hair EXTREMELY frizzy (and that&#x27;s saying something when I naturally have a bit of frizz to begin with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never use this stuff again, and it smells strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I will hand it to them, it definitely works on other hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to embrace my Helena Bonham Carter hair and just leave it a mess forever.</li>
            <li> First use, I was amazed that it really cleaned my hair like shampoo does.  It takes a while (a month with me) before I noticed significant improvement.  My hair was extremely damaged over the summer, actually much of it had broken off!  Now, after a month, it is really smooth and soft.  I don&#x27;t care for the cucumber aloe smell, although it&#x27;s not horrible.  I love the Almond Mint; they both work for me.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll never use regular shampoo again.</li>
            <li> With 40 pumps a shower the 3 mini bottles lasted about 2weeks.  not worth the try.</li>
            <li> As a redhair it goes without saying I have sensitive skin. As I entered my thirties I noticed I was having severe headaches often. After allegy testing, I learned that I am allergic to everything. Every hairdresser recomended natural products as I am allergic to most soaps. Unfortunately I am allergic to everything outdoors as well as man made \\&quot;chemicals\\&quot;. I had no hope! Up late I saw a Wen commercial and thought hmm no soap shampoo. No way.. I have super thick, coarse and curly hair. Frizz lots of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I get this conditioner and one use later I have soft, manageable hair for the first time in my life. Now they say you can go 2-3 days before needing to wash your hair again. No way..my scalp usually itches and burns by the end of day one. I can literally wait the three days and still have soft beautiful hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a late shipment. I have never run out waiting on a scheduled delivery. I went on vacation and forgot my bottle at one hotel and customer service drop shipped an extra small bottle to my next destination at no charge!!! Better than ever company with top notch customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly I never have to put burning itchy soap on my head ever again. Thanks from a gingerkid.</li>
            <li> if you are just trying this out  I recommend asking a friend that has some instead of buying, I had recently tried this and called to cancel a little over a month after having it absolutely did nothing to my hair but shortly after I had tried to cancel I got billed, so I then tried to call and cancel again the lady said there&#x27;s nothing she could do the shipment was already sent out before I had called well shipment arrives she says I&#x27;ll have to send the box back to them and then in about 3-4 weeks I will receive my money back, I decide to just keep it since they had already took the money and it was pumpkin I love everything pumpkin, but the next month after that I had been charged again I had then called in for the third time to cancel and the lady said my account had never been canceled and that I was charged for the shipment that I decided to keep so I have been charged twice for one package, today I wake up to find out my bank account is -$30 because yet again they have took money I call in for the fourth time to see why I got charged and just now find out the shipment I had decided to keep was 3 months worth supply and so I get charged 3 times, absolute bull worst company ever and I have only opened one bottle from that whole package. Absolutely not worth anyones money DONT DO IT!!!</li>
            <li> i have thin and sometimes frizzy hair, so when i saw the product on commercials and positive reviews i ordered the conditioner. I was excited about getting some of the free products that came with it. I was extremely disappointed in the conditioner. First of all the pump was broken from the start. Then you have to use 15 pumps, which is almost half the bottle. The first time i used it, it left my hair feeling like straw. I thought that maybe i didn&#x27;t leave it in long enough, so i left it in for more than 5 minutes the next time. Hair was falling out like crazy in the shower. I can&#x27;t even tell you how many clumps of hair was falling in my hand. It doesn&#x27;t de-tangle your hair at all. I had to use de-tangler just to comb it after my shower. After every use my hair felt like straw and was even more frizzy. I feel like even suave doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel or look like wren did. I was so disappointed and felt ripped off. I really thought Chaz would of created a better product than this.</li>
            <li> Should have done more research. Too much maintenance to use. I tried this a long time ago maybe it&#x27;s changed. Didn&#x27;t get the benefit it claims it can do for hair</li>
            <li> the WORST thing i ever purchased. i have very thick full long hair and it made my hair SOOOOOO  greasy its disgusting and my hair NEVER gets that gross.. DONT BUY WHEB WHATEVER YOU DO!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great, just too expensive</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work! I have naturally curly fine hair. My hair is not thin, just each strand is fine. I bought the lavender, because this is what is recommended for my hair type. My hair looks dull and dry. I was worried it was going to be greasy, but it is just the opposite. I have to use a leave in conditioner after using Wen, because my hair has no shine. I tried leaving a pump of Wen in, but still doesn&#x27;t leave my hair shinny. I went back to using Enjoy products again, because they have such good moisture. I will use Wen until it is gone, but not all the time. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The infomercials got me excited on WEN, that it would work for all hair textures including Asians. I have very thin and fine hair and hoping the product would give me more volume and shine. Upon using it first time, I was very disappointed! My hair became more limp and lifeless, and when my hair dried, they looked like straw and there were fly-aways..I have to use other conditioning products to tame it. I haven&#x27;t tried any other type of shampoos out there that made my hair like that. I gave it 2 more tries and same results. Waste of money! The only reason I gave a 1 star is because I only love the lavendar spell.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair</li>
