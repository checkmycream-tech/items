            <li>Coverage is not as good</li>
            <li>I loved the dispenser of this product when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Mixing them together gave a good effect</li>
            <li>It stays put and by the end of the day I&#x27;d say it looks 95% as good as the minute I put it on.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;wearability\\&quot; (that it doesn&#x27;t shift on your face) is great, I love that it has SPF</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find one I liked, let alone loved.</li>
            <li>BUT, they do carry very nice brushes which can be used to apply this product, got one... :)</li>
            <li>As you can tell by the title of my review - I LOVE this product!</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>The coverage is amazing, and it lasts through the day.</li>
            <li>Philosophy products are amazing.</li>
            <li>all on my own - this product did not disintegrate all over my face ---&gt;</li>
            <li>I tap it and the product is on the pad, goes on really nicely.</li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S HOW MUCH I REALLY LIKED THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>The powder foundation offered a beautiful build able coverage that didn&#x27;t fall into fine lines.</li>
            <li>I ordered the RICH and have been so happy.</li>
            <li>works great  - quick shipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on VERY easy, is buildable and matches my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It is very light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and covers imperfections well.</li>
            <li>It Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause breakouts which is another huge plus!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the simplicity/convenience of this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this foundation, sephora does not carry it anymore</li>
            <li>so being able to find it online had become difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>but I love how it feels and their color options.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t cake or feel like you are wearing a mask.</li>
            <li>The sponge is okay, but I prefer brushes when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>My favorite foundation.  </li>
            <li>Just like I remember and way better than that</li>
            <li>love this powder, been buying for years.  </li>
            <li>I love the ability to control the amount of product I use.</li>
            <li>I love that  it lasts all day and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out or itch.</li>
            <li>After not being able to find this foundation and it being eliminated from retail cosmetic stores I bought it on line.</li>
            <li>You are much better shopping elsewhere for this product.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this.</li>
            <li>This product does a better job than my combination of using a concealer, a foundation, and a correcting powder.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite makeup...</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my makeup wearing this.</li>
            <li>Was hoping to love this</li>
            <li>The best part was it did not make my pores look bigger</li>
            <li>If not I may have to switch from this foundation that I love and have used for years.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>If you have an area that you need more coverage, just tap the sponge on your face to get more powder to come out.  </li>
            <li>This product actually disguises them more than anything and my skin looks the best it has ever looked.</li>
            <li>Maybe I will post a pic if I think about it :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even remember what led me to purchase this product, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Ordering was easy and without any problem.</li>
            <li>the nifty applicator makes it so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>AND THAT HASN&#x27;T BEEN AN EASY TASK,</li>
            <li>I can use this safely on my oily eyelids and as a concealor - so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Brand new, never used or tampered with, good price.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The most amazing makeup product I would be completely lost without.</li>
            <li>I can get a great look with no bother in an instant of  application with the powder sponge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li>Philosophy stopped making this fantastic product that I have used on my skin for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>The mineral foundation goes on so smoothly though.</li>
            <li>and I was happy enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cheap</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>It offers good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I was originally given this product as a gift in August 2011.</li>
            <li>(yes, all day) and covers redness, blemishes, huge pores, dark undereye circles, and those huge blemishes that pop up out of nowhere - all while giving you SPF and a beautiful finish - not too matte but not too dewey.</li>
            <li>the coverage is perfect...whether I need light or full coverage...would recommend this to friend.</li>
            <li>Was still good make up especially in the summer or when you want light coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a full foundation process in one travel friendly container.  </li>
            <li>No wonder they were for $15 special price.  </li>
            <li>I could not wear the natural shade had to choose warm beige.  </li>
            <li>When my husband kisses me on the cheek he says it feels like my face and not a mouth full of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this makeup so much.</li>
            <li>I paid for a full product, didn&#x27;t get the full product?????</li>
            <li>It seems to me that would eat up a good deal of makeup that you will never get back.</li>
            <li>Great product easy to apply and firmly adhere to the skin.</li>
            <li>Throw it in your bag and take anywhere with you for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal and devoted fan and consumer of philosophy products for a number of years.</li>
            <li>Luckily Sephora still had it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to put on and really turns around any skin issue you may be having at the time (acne, blotchy-ness, redness, etc.).</li>
            <li>Makes getting ready in the morning so easy and touch ups can happen right at your desk without a mirror.</li>
            <li>- you tap it on your hand or gently on your face to prime it, and then smooth it all over.</li>
            <li>You can apply with a brush if you desire, but it&#x27;s so messy - use the sponge, it works great.  </li>
            <li>It provides a natural flawless look without looking too heavy.  </li>
            <li>Supernatural is definitely one of the superior mineral  foundations.</li>
            <li>I should also say that I am extremely fair skinned, don&#x27;t get breakouts, and my skin tone is pretty even except for some sun damage to the left side of my face, (years of doing home care and spending too much time in the car)</li>
            <li>They have changed the product package and I don&#x27;t care for it as much as I did for the original.</li>
            <li>It was a sponge that automatically gave you just the right amount of powder.</li>
            <li>You can use it as a quick brush up over your already applied makeup, or apply several  coats for more coverage.  </li>
            <li>I know many people have compared it with Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>The sales girl recommended applying it with a nice soft natural bristle make-up brush (philosophy&#x27;s is the one I bought).  </li>
            <li>So easy to use and no messy powder everywhere.  </li>
            <li>It is also great for travelling because unlike Bare Minerals powder, which is loose and spills, this powder is contained under the sponge, so you can throw it in your bag, take it on the plane, etc.</li>
            <li>Being a &#x27;seasoned&#x27; woman, who can \\&quot;make it rain\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I bought this in a department store - it is the first mineral-powder foundation I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Not even in the hot Florida sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure hope philosophy goes back to the sponge applicator instead of the truly aweful brush applicator design.</li>
            <li>If you are used to using a foundation and powder, you probably won&#x27;t get enough coverage from this powder, but if you were used to using mineral makeup or powder, I think you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li>I first bought it at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I love LOVE love the product and the service, however the last one shipped to me seemed to only be half full??</li>
            <li>For best results, especially if you have dry or combination skin like myself, wear moisturizer prior to applying this powder.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin (be sure to moisturize first, or yes, your skin will still look dry), and</li>
            <li>My favorite is Philosophy Hope in a Jar for Dry Skin.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The foundation is very sheer/powder form.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>The product price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and I have always fought with it all day.</li>
            <li>along the line, I really don&#x27;t remember when, Philosophy changed their colors for this product.</li>
            <li>This product shipped fast and was just as described.</li>
            <li>I love it - replaced my liquid foundation, concealer, and powder all with one \\&quot;TSA-friendly\\&quot; product - essential for frequent fliers.  </li>
            <li>I can only hope its a fluke and that their new line returns us to a true ivory color!</li>
            <li>I want to love this, but it just doesn&#x27;t look the same on my face as the exact same shade when I used to get it at Sephora.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a little more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I bought this and had to return because it was the new version with the brush!</li>
            <li>B0007WBTBU philosophy the supernatural powder airbrushed canvas spf 15]]</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing heavy makeup - this is really the #1 reason why I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love that it is contained and keeps the mess of mineral makeup inside, but the coverage was lacking.  </li>
            <li>Got the discontinued version with the highly sought after sponge applicator.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this product, though.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It covers my little &#x27;imperfections&#x27;, but is a BREATHABLE FOUNDATION, and if you sweat - you know that is important !</li>
            <li>I use Philosophy products all the time because they are gentle to my skin and give me the natural look I want to have-</li>
            <li>I either use it by itself on a fresh face, or I use it over a foundation as a finishing/buffer powder for extra coverage.</li>
            <li>my skin normally \\&quot;eats\\&quot; liquid foundation</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple different types of powders and this one seemed like it brushed on nicely and stayed on all day.</li>
            <li>and they didnt stand out anymore than they normally do.</li>
            <li>I look just like me only a little better!</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best make up product I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and the one I received still has the old &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; applicator (they recently made it a small kabuki brush in the lid I guess, which looks really messy).  </li>
            <li>So hard to get in Australia so super excited</li>
            <li>new container Philosophy is trying to pawn off on us.  </li>
            <li>so I have little wrinkles around my eyes and this stuff does NOT make them look more pronounced like Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>The Natural Ivory is the EXACT same shade as my skin!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product but kind of hate the application system.  </li>
            <li>My old standby.</li>
            <li>It may be different for you, depending how much of it you wear at one time.  </li>
            <li>Wish they had the &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; color, was a bit darker than the Natural Ivory.</li>
            <li>It says its natural ivory</li>
            <li>I wanted to cover imperfections while remaining natural looking.  </li>
            <li>Porcelain no longer existed, they had replaced it with Natural Ivory and my fears were soon gone.</li>
            <li>I also inadvertently tested the SPF 15, caught outside on a sunny day without sunscreen - my shoulders burned but my face looked the same the next day - it blocked the sun better than I would have expected.</li>
            <li>I have a cool undertone, and there is a little too much yellow in this.</li>
            <li>I end up using my old Bare Minerals containers and brushed instead.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve always, from day one, dumped the powder into a washed, old Bare Minerals container and just use a concealer brush and a big foundation brush to apply it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they often don&#x27;t go light enough, or are too yellow, too pink, or too grey.</li>
            <li>I prefer this product over Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I do use the bare minerals brushes though to apply the product.</li>
            <li>This powder doesn&#x27;t quite have the coverage that you would get with bare minerals, however it is build-able and</li>
            <li>and when they finally shipped they were only half full.  </li>
            <li>When you clean the puff, it takes awhile to dry - about a day and a half.  </li>
            <li>but it wears nothing like the same named color and model I used to wear-its down right orangey-brown.</li>
            <li>I like it, but it hardly provides coverage and also, you have to clean the puff yourself, you can&#x27;t buy replacements.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews complaining that there isn&#x27;t much product.</li>
            <li>I am 42 and have combination skin and am blonde with blue eyes, I use the beige because it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I have a red tone on several spots of my face, and this powder completely conceals that for hours.</li>
            <li>Product is exceptional as usual but what is with the decreased quantity?  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> THAT&#x27;S HOW MUCH I REALLY LIKED THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> The powder foundation offered a beautiful build able coverage that didn&#x27;t fall into fine lines.</li>
            <li> I ordered the RICH and have been so happy.</li>
            <li> works great  - quick shipping</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on VERY easy, is buildable and matches my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It is very light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and covers imperfections well.</li>
            <li> It Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause breakouts which is another huge plus!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the simplicity/convenience of this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this foundation, sephora does not carry it anymore</li>
            <li> so being able to find it online had become difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> but I love how it feels and their color options.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t cake or feel like you are wearing a mask.</li>
            <li> The sponge is okay, but I prefer brushes when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation.  </li>
            <li> Just like I remember and way better than that</li>
            <li> love this powder, been buying for years.  </li>
            <li> I love the ability to control the amount of product I use.</li>
            <li> I love that  it lasts all day and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out or itch.</li>
            <li> After not being able to find this foundation and it being eliminated from retail cosmetic stores I bought it on line.</li>
            <li> You are much better shopping elsewhere for this product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this.</li>
            <li> This product does a better job than my combination of using a concealer, a foundation, and a correcting powder.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup...</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on my makeup wearing this.</li>
            <li> Was hoping to love this</li>
            <li> The best part was it did not make my pores look bigger</li>
            <li> If not I may have to switch from this foundation that I love and have used for years.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> If you have an area that you need more coverage, just tap the sponge on your face to get more powder to come out.  </li>
            <li> This product actually disguises them more than anything and my skin looks the best it has ever looked.</li>
            <li> Maybe I will post a pic if I think about it :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even remember what led me to purchase this product, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Ordering was easy and without any problem.</li>
            <li> the nifty applicator makes it so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> AND THAT HASN&#x27;T BEEN AN EASY TASK,</li>
            <li> I can use this safely on my oily eyelids and as a concealor - so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Brand new, never used or tampered with, good price.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The most amazing makeup product I would be completely lost without.</li>
            <li> I can get a great look with no bother in an instant of  application with the powder sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li> Philosophy stopped making this fantastic product that I have used on my skin for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> The mineral foundation goes on so smoothly though.</li>
            <li> and I was happy enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cheap</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> It offers good coverage.  </li>
            <li> I was originally given this product as a gift in August 2011.</li>
            <li> (yes, all day) and covers redness, blemishes, huge pores, dark undereye circles, and those huge blemishes that pop up out of nowhere - all while giving you SPF and a beautiful finish - not too matte but not too dewey.</li>
            <li> the coverage is perfect...whether I need light or full coverage...would recommend this to friend.</li>
            <li> Was still good make up especially in the summer or when you want light coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a full foundation process in one travel friendly container.  </li>
            <li> No wonder they were for $15 special price.  </li>
            <li> I could not wear the natural shade had to choose warm beige.  </li>
            <li> When my husband kisses me on the cheek he says it feels like my face and not a mouth full of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this makeup so much.</li>
            <li> I paid for a full product, didn&#x27;t get the full product?????</li>
            <li> It seems to me that would eat up a good deal of makeup that you will never get back.</li>
            <li> Great product easy to apply and firmly adhere to the skin.</li>
            <li> Throw it in your bag and take anywhere with you for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal and devoted fan and consumer of philosophy products for a number of years.</li>
            <li> Luckily Sephora still had it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to put on and really turns around any skin issue you may be having at the time (acne, blotchy-ness, redness, etc.).</li>
            <li> Makes getting ready in the morning so easy and touch ups can happen right at your desk without a mirror.</li>
            <li> - you tap it on your hand or gently on your face to prime it, and then smooth it all over.</li>
            <li> You can apply with a brush if you desire, but it&#x27;s so messy - use the sponge, it works great.  </li>
            <li> It provides a natural flawless look without looking too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Supernatural is definitely one of the superior mineral  foundations.</li>
            <li> I should also say that I am extremely fair skinned, don&#x27;t get breakouts, and my skin tone is pretty even except for some sun damage to the left side of my face, (years of doing home care and spending too much time in the car)</li>
            <li> They have changed the product package and I don&#x27;t care for it as much as I did for the original.</li>
            <li> It was a sponge that automatically gave you just the right amount of powder.</li>
            <li> You can use it as a quick brush up over your already applied makeup, or apply several  coats for more coverage.  </li>
            <li> I know many people have compared it with Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> The sales girl recommended applying it with a nice soft natural bristle make-up brush (philosophy&#x27;s is the one I bought).  </li>
            <li> So easy to use and no messy powder everywhere.  </li>
            <li> It is also great for travelling because unlike Bare Minerals powder, which is loose and spills, this powder is contained under the sponge, so you can throw it in your bag, take it on the plane, etc.</li>
            <li> Being a &#x27;seasoned&#x27; woman, who can \\&quot;make it rain\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this in a department store - it is the first mineral-powder foundation I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Not even in the hot Florida sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure hope philosophy goes back to the sponge applicator instead of the truly aweful brush applicator design.</li>
            <li> If you are used to using a foundation and powder, you probably won&#x27;t get enough coverage from this powder, but if you were used to using mineral makeup or powder, I think you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li> I first bought it at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I love LOVE love the product and the service, however the last one shipped to me seemed to only be half full??</li>
            <li> For best results, especially if you have dry or combination skin like myself, wear moisturizer prior to applying this powder.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (be sure to moisturize first, or yes, your skin will still look dry), and</li>
            <li> My favorite is Philosophy Hope in a Jar for Dry Skin.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The foundation is very sheer/powder form.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> The product price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and I have always fought with it all day.</li>
            <li> along the line, I really don&#x27;t remember when, Philosophy changed their colors for this product.</li>
            <li> This product shipped fast and was just as described.</li>
            <li> I love it - replaced my liquid foundation, concealer, and powder all with one \\&quot;TSA-friendly\\&quot; product - essential for frequent fliers.  </li>
            <li> I can only hope its a fluke and that their new line returns us to a true ivory color!</li>
            <li> I want to love this, but it just doesn&#x27;t look the same on my face as the exact same shade when I used to get it at Sephora.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I bought this and had to return because it was the new version with the brush!</li>
            <li> B0007WBTBU philosophy the supernatural powder airbrushed canvas spf 15]]</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing heavy makeup - this is really the #1 reason why I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love that it is contained and keeps the mess of mineral makeup inside, but the coverage was lacking.  </li>
            <li> Got the discontinued version with the highly sought after sponge applicator.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this product, though.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It covers my little &#x27;imperfections&#x27;, but is a BREATHABLE FOUNDATION, and if you sweat - you know that is important !</li>
            <li> I use Philosophy products all the time because they are gentle to my skin and give me the natural look I want to have-</li>
            <li> I either use it by itself on a fresh face, or I use it over a foundation as a finishing/buffer powder for extra coverage.</li>
            <li> my skin normally \\&quot;eats\\&quot; liquid foundation</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple different types of powders and this one seemed like it brushed on nicely and stayed on all day.</li>
            <li> and they didnt stand out anymore than they normally do.</li>
            <li> I look just like me only a little better!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best make up product I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and the one I received still has the old &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; applicator (they recently made it a small kabuki brush in the lid I guess, which looks really messy).  </li>
            <li> So hard to get in Australia so super excited</li>
            <li> new container Philosophy is trying to pawn off on us.  </li>
            <li> so I have little wrinkles around my eyes and this stuff does NOT make them look more pronounced like Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> The Natural Ivory is the EXACT same shade as my skin!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product but kind of hate the application system.  </li>
            <li> My old standby.</li>
            <li> It may be different for you, depending how much of it you wear at one time.  </li>
            <li> Wish they had the &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; color, was a bit darker than the Natural Ivory.</li>
            <li> It says its natural ivory</li>
            <li> I wanted to cover imperfections while remaining natural looking.  </li>
            <li> Porcelain no longer existed, they had replaced it with Natural Ivory and my fears were soon gone.</li>
            <li> I also inadvertently tested the SPF 15, caught outside on a sunny day without sunscreen - my shoulders burned but my face looked the same the next day - it blocked the sun better than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> I have a cool undertone, and there is a little too much yellow in this.</li>
            <li> I end up using my old Bare Minerals containers and brushed instead.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve always, from day one, dumped the powder into a washed, old Bare Minerals container and just use a concealer brush and a big foundation brush to apply it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they often don&#x27;t go light enough, or are too yellow, too pink, or too grey.</li>
            <li> I prefer this product over Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I do use the bare minerals brushes though to apply the product.</li>
            <li> This powder doesn&#x27;t quite have the coverage that you would get with bare minerals, however it is build-able and</li>
            <li> and when they finally shipped they were only half full.  </li>
            <li> When you clean the puff, it takes awhile to dry - about a day and a half.  </li>
            <li> but it wears nothing like the same named color and model I used to wear-its down right orangey-brown.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it hardly provides coverage and also, you have to clean the puff yourself, you can&#x27;t buy replacements.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews complaining that there isn&#x27;t much product.</li>
            <li> I am 42 and have combination skin and am blonde with blue eyes, I use the beige because it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> I have a red tone on several spots of my face, and this powder completely conceals that for hours.</li>
            <li> Product is exceptional as usual but what is with the decreased quantity?  </li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals in theory but after several years, was frustrated with the color match and overall finish so decided to look for a new mineral powder foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so this works well for my skin, but because I don&#x27;t want to use the same used puff daily and it takes too long to dry</li>
            <li> I use Supernatural everyday and have for several years.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product about 5 months ago, (it lasted that long with daily use before purchasing second .32 oz bottle)</li>
            <li> and it did not last as long as I like.  </li>
            <li> The natural Ivory color seems to be a warm base color.</li>
            <li> It offers a little bit of SPF.&lt;br</li>
            <li> get up at 5 am for work, and as a nurse working 12 hour shifts, I don&#x27;t care a whole lot about how I look but do like to at least make an effort to not look like I just crept out of a box under the expressway, which is how I feel at 5 am.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too!  </li>
            <li> I will be very careful next time to look at my purchases when they come in.  </li>
            <li> and it does not make me break out or dry out at all.</li>
            <li> I bought two of the beige Airbrushed when Amazon had them for $15 each for a limited time.  </li>
            <li> I think what is happening here is that the seal between the power and the applicator comes loose and some of the product is transferred through the sponge in transit.  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion is to purchase a little darker than you think.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until I was almost done with my first jar (lasted about 4 months) that the sponge-puff was removable (which I really  hated at first)</li>
            <li> I would get both because the porcelain was almost greyish on my skin, but the buff (beige?) was WAY too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why Philosophy doesn&#x27;t sell this like any other loose powder, without the horribly designed applicator.</li>
            <li> I am a pale red head (auburn) with dark brown eyes and have a hard time with foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;9- A bottle typically lasts me 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For less oily skin, I would guess that you wouldn&#x27;t need to reapply at all during the day.</li>
            <li> I purchased the lightest color I could get, and it&#x27;s still a little dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very large pores and hate wearing any type of foundation because I feel like the foundation just sits in my pores and makes them look even larger.</li>
            <li> and have no worries you will be opening a mess when you get to your destination.  </li>
            <li> I purposely splashed my face with a little water to see what would happen and it didn&#x27;t run away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just add a little bronzer to add color.  </li>
            <li> the color and the coverage I get without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> Around mid-day I use blotting papers to remove excess oil, and I reapply the powder just a touch in trouble areas.</li>
            <li> No strong makeup</li>
            <li> I hate the feeling of having makeup on, especially in the summer, but this doesn&#x27;t feel like anything other than regular face powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not applying  it with  a kubuki brush, I notice I&#x27;m using very little product when i apply it.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday!  </li>
            <li> I love the product, but the applicator is dreadful.  </li>
            <li> very little cover-up and hard to get the powder out on brush.</li>
            <li> Especially my dark undereye</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard, ordering a foundation over the internet, but - that didn&#x27;t stop me!</li>
            <li> Color was off too orange, not great coverage.  </li>
            <li> This product is a serious life-saver!</li>
            <li> I used the Bare Minerals and think it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> It has lasted me approximately 6 months!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to get the powder on the sponge to put on your face</li>
            <li> Getting to powder was a pain container/applicator useless.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid I was going to be out of luck.</li>
            <li> I am completely obsessed with it!</li>
            <li> I AM SO SORRY THAT THIS IS DISCONTINUED!  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t they use a test market for that crap?</li>
            <li> I have since tried the applicator it came with, and it was terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals in theory but after several years, was frustrated with the color match and overall finish so decided to look for a new mineral powder foundation.  I love this product but kind of hate the application system.  I end up using my old Bare Minerals containers and brushed instead.</li>
            <li> I can get a great look with no bother in an instant of  application with the powder sponge. My old standby.</li>
            <li> As you can tell by the title of my review - I LOVE this product! It&#x27;s hard, ordering a foundation over the internet, but - that didn&#x27;t stop me! I ordered the RICH and have been so happy. Being a &#x27;seasoned&#x27; woman, who can \\&quot;make it rain\\&quot; [meaning I sweat!!] all on my own - this product did not disintegrate all over my face ---&gt; YEAH! I purposely splashed my face with a little water to see what would happen and it didn&#x27;t run away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is genius - you tap it on your hand or gently on your face to prime it, and then smooth it all over. I can use this safely on my oily eyelids and as a concealor - so far, so good. It covers my little &#x27;imperfections&#x27;, but is a BREATHABLE FOUNDATION, and if you sweat - you know that is important ! Also, it seems to last all day and in the Wash DC area, we&#x27;ve had some 98degree days - so I&#x27;ve put it thru some tests ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on VERY easy, is buildable and matches my skin tone. My only caveat, A to Z does not carry replacement sponges for it...BUT, they do carry very nice brushes which can be used to apply this product, got one... :)</li>
            <li> I was originally given this product as a gift in August 2011. I am finally running out of it in January 2012, so I ordered a 2nd one from Amazon. It has lasted me approximately 6 months! It may be different for you, depending how much of it you wear at one time.  I absolutely love the simplicity/convenience of this product. Throw it in your bag and take anywhere with you for a quick touch up. No pads or brushes necessary, just glide onto your face. You can use it as a quick brush up over your already applied makeup, or apply several  coats for more coverage.  For best results, especially if you have dry or combination skin like myself, wear moisturizer prior to applying this powder. My favorite is Philosophy Hope in a Jar for Dry Skin.</li>
            <li> The foundation is very sheer/powder form.  I like it, but it hardly provides coverage and also, you have to clean the puff yourself, you can&#x27;t buy replacements.  When you clean the puff, it takes awhile to dry - about a day and a half.  So then you can&#x27;t use it or have to put it on with your hands or a throw-away sponge.  I have sensitive skin, so this works well for my skin, but because I don&#x27;t want to use the same used puff daily and it takes too long to dry and it&#x27;s difficult to get the powder on the sponge to put on your face, I give it a 3.</li>
            <li> I bought two of the beige Airbrushed when Amazon had them for $15 each for a limited time.  I had to wait for the stock to come in and when they finally shipped they were only half full.  No wonder they were for $15 special price.  Nothing was noted on the descripton saying they would be a lesser amount of product.  I will be very careful next time to look at my purchases when they come in.  I did not open until this week to use and I received in January so could not return.  Product is exceptional as usual but what is with the decreased quantity?  Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this foundation, sephora does not carry it anymore so being able to find it online had become difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Love the color and the coverage I get without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> This goes on flawlessly and has great coverage.  Obviously since you tap it all over you have to move the powder around with a different sponge but I love how it feels and their color options.  I wish they werent going to be discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product about 5 months ago, (it lasted that long with daily use before purchasing second .32 oz bottle)&gt; I love this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t cake or feel like you are wearing a mask. I either use it by itself on a fresh face, or I use it over a foundation as a finishing/buffer powder for extra coverage.It Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause breakouts which is another huge plus! I definitely agree with the name it was given- \\&quot;airbrushed\\&quot;. I prefer this product over Bare Minerals. I do use the bare minerals brushes though to apply the product. hhehe. The sponge is okay, but I prefer brushes when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Color was off too orange, not great coverage.  Getting to powder was a pain container/applicator useless.  The powder was clumpy as well</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 15 years. It&#x27;s light. The color is great and I don&#x27;t break out.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for Arizona.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product......so easy to apply your makeup.  Goes on easy and smooth.  I could not wear the natural shade had to choose warm beige.  I would highly recommend this product!  Lasts a long time too!  Makes getting ready in the morning so easy and touch ups can happen right at your desk without a mirror. Like applying power and really good coverage!</li>
            <li> Ladies - scoop this stuff up NOW before they run out! Philosophy stopped making this fantastic product that I have used on my skin for over 10 years. It is literally the PERFECT foundation and I have worn all brands from Chanel and Dior to MAC and Lorac.  This powder is perfcect, buildable coverage that stays on ALL DAY (yes, all day) and covers redness, blemishes, huge pores, dark undereye circles, and those huge blemishes that pop up out of nowhere - all while giving you SPF and a beautiful finish - not too matte but not too dewey. You can apply with a brush if you desire, but it&#x27;s so messy - use the sponge, it works great.  I am 42 and have combination skin and am blonde with blue eyes, I use the beige because it looks so natural. I just bought three of these because I do not know what I will do without it!&lt;br /&gt;Can we appeal to the powers that be at Philosophy and beg them to continue to make this product? Who&#x27;s with me??!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0007WBTBU philosophy the supernatural powder airbrushed canvas spf 15]]</li>
            <li> I bought this in a department store - it is the first mineral-powder foundation I have tried.  The sales girl recommended applying it with a nice soft natural bristle make-up brush (philosophy&#x27;s is the one I bought).  It goes on perfectly with the brush - I have since tried the applicator it came with, and it was terrible.  I have combination skin (be sure to moisturize first, or yes, your skin will still look dry), and my skin normally \\&quot;eats\\&quot; liquid foundation - I find that this lasts a lot longer.  I love it - replaced my liquid foundation, concealer, and powder all with one \\&quot;TSA-friendly\\&quot; product - essential for frequent fliers.  I also inadvertently tested the SPF 15, caught outside on a sunny day without sunscreen - my shoulders burned but my face looked the same the next day - it blocked the sun better than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> Just like I remember and way better than that new container Philosophy is trying to pawn off on us.  Didn&#x27;t they use a test market for that crap?</li>
            <li> love this powder, been buying for years.  Wish they had the &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; color, was a bit darker than the Natural Ivory.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday!  It has all the lightness and convenience of a mineral with the coverage of a liquid. Never looks like a mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews complaining that there isn&#x27;t much product. I don&#x27;t care. This has the very best applicator pad in the lid that I have ever found. I tap it and the product is on the pad, goes on really nicely. I purchased the lightest color I could get, and it&#x27;s still a little dark for my skin. The natural Ivory color seems to be a warm base color. I have a cool undertone, and there is a little too much yellow in this. The mineral foundation goes on so smoothly though. I love the ability to control the amount of product I use. Since I&#x27;m not applying  it with  a kubuki brush, I notice I&#x27;m using very little product when i apply it. I love that  it lasts all day and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out or itch.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal and devoted fan and consumer of philosophy products for a number of years. After not being able to find this foundation and it being eliminated from retail cosmetic stores I bought it on line. It says its natural ivory but it wears nothing like the same named color and model I used to wear-its down right orangey-brown. I can only hope its a fluke and that their new line returns us to a true ivory color!</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was already used.  This is unacceptable.  Now I have to pay to return.  You are much better shopping elsewhere for this product.</li>
            <li> This product is a serious life-saver! I cannot rave about it enough! It makes your skin looks absolutely flawless and smooth without making it seem like you are wearing any makeup at all! It&#x27;s quick and easy to put on and really turns around any skin issue you may be having at the time (acne, blotchy-ness, redness, etc.). I am completely obsessed with it! Order today if you want to change your makeup routine for the better!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best make up product I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and the one I received still has the old &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; applicator (they recently made it a small kabuki brush in the lid I guess, which looks really messy).  It&#x27;s like a full foundation process in one travel friendly container.  30 seconds in your car looks like 15 minutes of work at home... Love, love, love this.</li>
            <li> Great product easy to apply and firmly adhere to the skin. Ordering was easy and without any problem. The product price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for years and I love it!  Here&#x27;s what I love:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- It doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I have super sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t have a reaction to it. Not even in the hot Florida sun.&lt;br /&gt;2- It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing heavy makeup - this is really the #1 reason why I love this product. I hate the feeling of having makeup on, especially in the summer, but this doesn&#x27;t feel like anything other than regular face powder.&lt;br /&gt;3- It doesn&#x27;t look like I have makeup on.  It gives me that flawless completion look.&lt;br /&gt;4- Eventhough it is lightweight, it covers up my flaws well. Especially my dark undereye circles.&lt;br /&gt;5- No strong makeup odor.&lt;br /&gt;6- When my husband kisses me on the cheek he says it feels like my face and not a mouth full of product.&lt;br /&gt;7- It doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;8- It offers a little bit of SPF.&lt;br /&gt;9- A bottle typically lasts me 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I all over just love this product!</li>
            <li> This gave me a flawless looking finish to my makeup ritual. I use Philosophy products all the time because they are gentle to my skin and give me the natural look I want to have- I look just like me only a little better!</li>
            <li> This product does a better job than my combination of using a concealer, a foundation, and a correcting powder. It goes on in seconds instead of minutes, and it leaves a flawless look. I have very oily skin, and I have always fought with it all day. Not anymore! I have a red tone on several spots of my face, and this powder completely conceals that for hours. Around mid-day I use blotting papers to remove excess oil, and I reapply the powder just a touch in trouble areas. For less oily skin, I would guess that you wouldn&#x27;t need to reapply at all during the day.</li>
            <li> Supernatural is definitely one of the superior mineral  foundations. They have increased the price 40% in a matter of months.&lt;br /&gt; I won&#x27;t pay $50  for 0.32 ounces of powder.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup...the coverage is perfect...whether I need light or full coverage...would recommend this to friend. I get many compliments on my makeup wearing this.</li>
            <li> The most amazing makeup product I would be completely lost without. So hard to get in Australia so super excited I can still get it shipped out from US. Stays out all day makes skin perfect over foundation or even on its own on the weekend. I have got lots of my friends onto this product it&#x27;s a must buy</li>
            <li> Unfortunetly..this product did not meet my expectations...very little cover-up and hard to get the powder out on brush. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This foundation is perfect! I&#x27;m allergic to practically every foundation I&#x27;ve used.  So far, so good.  Not one issue.  I wanted to cover imperfections while remaining natural looking.  This is it!  My only suggestion is to purchase a little darker than you think.  I just add a little bronzer to add color.  I hope Philosophy never discontinues this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love the product, but the applicator is dreadful.  I use a kabuki brush to apply it.  There are a lot of reviews that say the product arrives with a used sponge.  I think what is happening here is that the seal between the power and the applicator comes loose and some of the product is transferred through the sponge in transit.  I honestly don&#x27;t know why Philosophy doesn&#x27;t sell this like any other loose powder, without the horribly designed applicator. I would give it 4 stars if they sold it like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder itself gives excellent coverage.  It does have a sheen to it; if you are looking for a matte powder you should look elsewhere.  I also wish the would offer a translucent or 1 shade lighter.  Their lightest color only works for me during summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.</li>
            <li> Was hoping to love this but it fell short.  I love that it is contained and keeps the mess of mineral makeup inside, but the coverage was lacking.  Also I felt you had to replace the applicator often to and it did not last as long as I like.  Was still good make up especially in the summer or when you want light coverage. Also great for you purse to freshen up.</li>
            <li> I love this powder!!! I have very large pores and hate wearing any type of foundation because I feel like the foundation just sits in my pores and makes them look even larger. I have tried multiple different types of powders and this one seemed like it brushed on nicely and stayed on all day. The best part was it did not make my pores look bigger and they didnt stand out anymore than they normally do.</li>
            <li> Got the discontinued version with the highly sought after sponge applicator. Sure hope philosophy goes back to the sponge applicator instead of the truly aweful brush applicator design. If not I may have to switch from this foundation that I love and have used for years. Bummer.</li>
            <li> works great  - quick shipping</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  So easy to use and no messy powder everywhere.  The coverage is wonderful and flawless!</li>
            <li> Used to buy from Sephora until Philosophy discontinued. I want to love this, but it just doesn&#x27;t look the same on my face as the exact same shade when I used to get it at Sephora. Coverage is not as good and it looks cakier. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup so much. It literally takes 25 seconds to put on and covers great.  It provides a natural flawless look without looking too heavy.  It also lasts all day, which is great.  If you are used to using a foundation and powder, you probably won&#x27;t get enough coverage from this powder, but if you were used to using mineral makeup or powder, I think you&#x27;ll love this.  It is also great for travelling because unlike Bare Minerals powder, which is loose and spills, this powder is contained under the sponge, so you can throw it in your bag, take it on the plane, etc. and have no worries you will be opening a mess when you get to your destination.  Another bonus is that you don&#x27;t need a make-up brush.  The applicator works great.  If you have an area that you need more coverage, just tap the sponge on your face to get more powder to come out.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this powder.  It is my all time favorite!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! The coverage is amazing, and it lasts through the day. I didn&#x27;t realize until I was almost done with my first jar (lasted about 4 months) that the sponge-puff was removable (which I really  hated at first) so I just used that and it works great in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I get up at 5 am for work, and as a nurse working 12 hour shifts, I don&#x27;t care a whole lot about how I look but do like to at least make an effort to not look like I just crept out of a box under the expressway, which is how I feel at 5 am. The puffy sponge thing allowed me to apply this foundation in a few seconds without having to get out my brushes or worry too much over any makeup issues, as I am as foul a morning person as they come. I don&#x27;t use primer or anything (when going to work anyway) because I either don&#x27;t think of it or just don&#x27;t give a s***, and it looks great every time anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I am 42 so I have little wrinkles around my eyes and this stuff does NOT make them look more pronounced like Bare Minerals does, maybe because of the sponge applicator or maybe it&#x27;s just great stuff. This product actually disguises them more than anything and my skin looks the best it has ever looked. Maybe I will post a pic if I think about it :) I should also say that I am extremely fair skinned, don&#x27;t get breakouts, and my skin tone is pretty even except for some sun damage to the left side of my face, (years of doing home care and spending too much time in the car) so maybe skin type/condition affects the performance. I do highly recommend this product, though. Great stuff. Get used to the puff sponge applicator thing and it works the BEST!&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck, beauties!!</li>
            <li> I do like this product.  It offers good coverage.  Wish it was a little more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I loved the dispenser of this product when I ordered it. It was a sponge that automatically gave you just the right amount of powder. The powder foundation offered a beautiful build able coverage that didn&#x27;t fall into fine lines. They have changed the product package and I don&#x27;t care for it as much as I did for the original. The product is the same but I miss the ease of not having to break out the application brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this and had to return because it was the new version with the brush!</li>
            <li> I automatically order this item so that it is sent to me every two months.  I love LOVE love the product and the service, however the last one shipped to me seemed to only be half full??? I&#x27;m going to have to put in an order in now for another one and I have not had this one a month yet. ??? I paid for a full product, didn&#x27;t get the full product?????</li>
            <li> I use Supernatural everyday and have for several years. It is very light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and covers imperfections well. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this foundation/powder for maybe 6 years. Before that I used to switch foundation all the time. I couldn&#x27;t find one I liked, let alone loved. I don&#x27;t even remember what led me to purchase this product, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. I first bought it at Macy&#x27;s. Then, I would buy two of them. Porcelain and buff?? I think it was called. It was the two lightest shades. I would get both because the porcelain was almost greyish on my skin, but the buff (beige?) was WAY too dark for me. Mixing them together gave a good effect and I was happy enough. I put up with the lack of a perfect color because the makeup was SO great! I know many people have compared it with Bare Minerals. There is ZERO comparison. I used the Bare Minerals and think it&#x27;s terrible. My face would get shiny throughout the day and the makeup would also shift all over the place. This does neither. It stays put and by the end of the day I&#x27;d say it looks 95% as good as the minute I put it on. I think that&#x27;s awesome. I have never used it as you&#x27;re supposed to, with that puff applicator. It seems to me that would eat up a good deal of makeup that you will never get back. I&#x27;m cheap ;) So I&#x27;ve always, from day one, dumped the powder into a washed, old Bare Minerals container and just use a concealer brush and a big foundation brush to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;One day, Macy&#x27;s stopped carrying it. !!!!!!!!!!!!! What!? Luckily Sephora still had it. Then, Sephora stopped carrying it!!!!! Nordstrom&#x27;s still has it if you&#x27;re ever in a pinch and forgot to order it in time.&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere along the line, I really don&#x27;t remember when, Philosophy changed their colors for this product. I was so scared. The mixing of the two worked beautifully for me and I was afraid I was going to be out of luck. I am a pale red head (auburn) with dark brown eyes and have a hard time with foundation. they often don&#x27;t go light enough, or are too yellow, too pink, or too grey. Porcelain no longer existed, they had replaced it with Natural Ivory and my fears were soon gone. I no longer have to buy two colors and mix. The Natural Ivory is the EXACT same shade as my skin!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I think the coverage is great, the color is great, the \\&quot;wearability\\&quot; (that it doesn&#x27;t shift on your face) is great, I love that it has SPF and it does not make me break out or dry out at all. The only reason I would ever stop using this product is if they stopped making it.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to tell you, I don&#x27;t wear it alone, I wear it over Benefit&#x27;s You Rebel Lite tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product shipped fast and was just as described. Brand new, never used or tampered with, good price. This powder doesn&#x27;t quite have the coverage that you would get with bare minerals, however it is build-able and the nifty applicator makes it so easy to apply. Philosophy products are amazing.</li>
            <li> I AM SO SORRY THAT THIS IS DISCONTINUED!  I HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER PRODUCT NOW TO REPLACE THIS AND THAT HASN&#x27;T BEEN AN EASY TASK, THAT&#x27;S HOW MUCH I REALLY LIKED THIS PRODUCT.</li>
