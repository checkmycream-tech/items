            <li>But, oh the impact on chapped lips is HUGE!  </li>

            <li>These are so cute.  </li>
            <li>This is supposed to be safe.  </li>
            <li>This tiny size of Vaseline is perfect for the purse, the pocket</li>
            <li>It is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have tried many chap sticks</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this stuff and I am psyched to be able to get it on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love vaseline products.</li>
            <li>I love the this lip therapy and when I saw that they had them for under $1</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Love this for my lips.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted the tiny container, which is the perfect size for carrying in a backpack.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it, and I don&#x27;t dislike it.</li>
            <li>and I find myself applying it one to two times a day at most.</li>
            <li>For a $2 lip balm in a cute container that works, five star.</li>
            <li>glad Amazon saved me and</li>
            <li>Very handy and effective in our dry climate.</li>
            <li>It is easy to keep on the bedside table &amp; put on my lips every night.</li>
            <li>very good for winter dry weather</li>
            <li>They will probably do fine.  </li>
            <li>They work well and are the perfect little size to even put in pockets.</li>
            <li>When the original container runs out, I&#x27;ll just refill it.</li>
            <li>Love these they work far better for me then any chapstick</li>
            <li>Luckily I found them here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, and makes a decent lip protector.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>Could not recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li>I said to my tiny jar, &amp;#34;Where have you been all my life?&amp;#34; I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually allergic to most lip balms, but this does the trick!</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Well worth every cent that you&#x27;ll spend.</li>
            <li>I get dry skin under my nose, and these little things are perfect to fit in my pocket.</li>
            <li>This is the first lip balm that has actually worked, it is sticky but it doesn&#x27;t get gooped up and cakey like most others do after applying them every hour.</li>
            <li>my kids!&lt;br /&gt;We are ready for the winter!</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that stops my lips from stripping and leaves it smooth.</li>
            <li>No one wants to carry around a 4 oz jar of Vaseline, aside from my grandma?</li>
            <li>i really like this consistency for lips...</li>
            <li>Tiny container, nice thicker Vaseline that actually stays on.</li>
            <li>When I bought it from a different vendor, they were all still in the original packaging.</li>
            <li>Nice convenient small size fits in a pocket.</li>
            <li>The package is really small and handy-</li>
            <li>I think this little lip therapy jar is so cute, I had to buy it just for that reason.  </li>
            <li>the cute little tub is just bonus.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and Im glad Amazon has a multipack because I can&#x27;t find these every where.  </li>
            <li>it is a little thicker than the regular stuff, which i liked because it stays on for hours without having to reapply.</li>
            <li>The glue-like consistency is very thick and seems to sit on top of your lips rather than being absorbed.</li>
            <li>Makes cute little stocking stuffers for Christmas!  </li>
            <li>The PJ vaseline supplies in this package is definitely stickier than I expected it to be, but not annoyingly so.</li>
            <li>They sold out at the Rite-Aid near me in two days, so that is why I am getting mine</li>
            <li>Keeps lips soft.  </li>
            <li>Not gluten free enough for me and a different color altogether than regular container of Vaseline, so assuming there are undeclared ingredients.</li>
            <li>far as I know there isn&#x27;t any difference in formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li>small and easy to carry with.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s clear from the ounces that this is tiny, so I don&#x27;t understand why people are complaining.</li>
            <li>This stuff stays on your lips much longer than regular chapstick, and doesn&#x27;t melt into a greasy mess while it&#x27;s there.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Unfortunately, i have burned through them very quickly.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned that it would be the same consistency that a regular sized vaseline has, but it is the thicker lip balm.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need reapplying constantly like other products.</li>
            <li> No medication to dry them out.</li>
            <li> I cycle 16 miles from work everyday and the outside corners of my eyes get very red and dry, so I apply a bit of petroleum jelly to the affected areas with a cotton swab, and voila!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big for a pocket but can be managed.</li>
            <li> just uploaded a photo of it in my hand, so you can see how tiny this little container is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it on my lips when I don&#x27;t have anything else around, and sometimes mix it with my lipstick for a little extra shine.</li>
            <li> Carmex, Blistix, Chapstick, Beeswax, other Vaseline balms all caused issues for me.</li>
            <li> I like the Vaseline Lip Therapy because it does not burn my lips like other name brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people say to me since purchasing these tiny lip therapy tubs that they did not know they came this small.</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips and skin and this little tub of vaseline</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather continue to buy a larger tub of ordinary vaseline and put it into small containers with twist tops</li>
            <li> Too much trouble.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few to give away, and carry one in every one of my purses as well as in the car.  </li>
            <li> I read that a lot of lip balms have ingredients that are not good for you or that dry your skin.  </li>
            <li> THE FORMULATION OF THIS PORDUCT HAS A THICKER THAN ORDINARY VASELINE FROM THE BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why is all came with the packaging, but out of it.</li>
            <li> This size is just too small.  </li>
            <li> Its vaseline, I mean you have probably seen it before.  </li>
            <li> WOW disappointed</li>
            <li> I knew it was odd when I opened the box because it came in a plastic bag opened !!!</li>
            <li> It is very thick.  </li>
            <li> If feels a little greasy at times but works fantastically when I had bad dryness and the doctor recommended it.</li>
            <li> The tops are sort of awkward to remove.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I thought this was the tubes of Vaseline for lips which you squeeze onto your lips or finger. This is miniature jars instead. The tops are sort of awkward to remove. I think Amazon should have a picture to prevent misordering. However, I will not send it back. Too much trouble.</li>
            <li> I was expecting regular Vaseline but didn&#x27;t realize it was their &amp;#34;lip therapy&amp;#34; product until after I opened up the package.  The glue-like consistency is very thick and seems to sit on top of your lips rather than being absorbed.</li>
            <li> I have to start out by saying that I only use vaseline on my lips because I am allergic to lip balms and lipstick. I thought this was great originally. The petite size fits perfectly in my purse, but this stuff is just so sticky. I&#x27;d rather continue to buy a larger tub of ordinary vaseline and put it into small containers with twist tops (so it doesn&#x27;t melt out everywhere).</li>
            <li> THE FORMULATION OF THIS PORDUCT HAS A THICKER THAN ORDINARY VASELINE FROM THE BOTTLE. WHEN APPLIED TO MY LIPS, IT STAYS THERE AND SEEMS TO BE OF A MORE DENSE FORMUYLATION AND THAT&#x27;S WHY I LOVE IT, CARRY IT IN PURSE, POCKET, CAR, WORK, TRAVEL &#x3D;BAG, ETC. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Love these they work far better for me then any chapstick</li>
            <li> Its vaseline, I mean you have probably seen it before.  Nice convenient small size fits in a pocket.</li>
            <li> I have 6 of these around the house and this is the only thing that works (tried chapstick, burts bees, etc.) for me. I use these every day.</li>
            <li> This stuff stays on your lips much longer than regular chapstick, and doesn&#x27;t melt into a greasy mess while it&#x27;s there. The package is really small and handy- dust and pocket sand can&#x27;t get in. I give it an A+.</li>
            <li> These are so cute.  I read that a lot of lip balms have ingredients that are not good for you or that dry your skin.  This is supposed to be safe.  It is very thick.  I put it on every night.  I gave one to my daughter &amp; she likes it to.  It is easy to keep on the bedside table &amp; put on my lips every night.</li>
            <li> This tiny size of Vaseline is perfect for the purse, the pocket and/or to have sitting out on the kitchen table. It is fantastic! I said to my tiny jar, &amp;#34;Where have you been all my life?&amp;#34; I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this size. I always threw out the larger jars of vaseline. People would use it for different reasons from coating equipment parts to chapped lips. I refused to use it not knowing who had dipped what into the jar to remove some. These were inexpensive and convenient.</li>
            <li> I ordered lots to have for convenience, one in every purse and make-up bag I use.  They work well and are the perfect little size to even put in pockets.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that stops my lips from stripping and leaves it smooth. Chop sticks do not help at all. Works wonders.</li>
            <li> These might seem a bit pricey, but they are excellent for carrying in your purse.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, I started having allergic reactions to a lot of things, including lip balms. All balms caused bumps on my lips except this. Carmex, Blistix, Chapstick, Beeswax, other Vaseline balms all caused issues for me. I use this everyday and Im glad Amazon has a multipack because I can&#x27;t find these every where.  The picture is from the 2nd time I bought the pack. It came from Shop Gear and I&#x27;m not sure why is all came with the packaging, but out of it. When I bought it from a different vendor, they were all still in the original packaging.</li>
            <li> I have tried many chap sticks but my lips are sensitive and this Vaseline moisturizer is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these at the store anymore and I thought they stopped making them. Luckily I found them here. These are the best thing for my lips and I&#x27;m so glad I got them!!!</li>
            <li> This size is just too small.  They send you lots of them. So that&#x27;s pretty cool. If you don&#x27;t use it constantly (like I do). They will probably do fine.  Unfortunately, i have burned through them very quickly. They are perfect purse size.</li>
            <li> I think this little lip therapy jar is so cute, I had to buy it just for that reason.  I was a little concerned that it would be the same consistency that a regular sized vaseline has, but it is the thicker lip balm.  Makes cute little stocking stuffers for Christmas!  They sold out at the Rite-Aid near me in two days, so that is why I am getting mine online.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good price, also.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff and I am psyched to be able to get it on amazon. I think it&#x27;s clear from the ounces that this is tiny, so I don&#x27;t understand why people are complaining. As for filling it from the larger tubs, I was hoping to, but the consistency is a bit different, so...</li>
            <li> wife has them everywhere - perfect for purses, cars, travel......anywhere</li>
            <li> This stuff is just like lip balm, except it&#x27;s vaseline. I&#x27;m actually allergic to most lip balms, but this does the trick! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price on Amazon!  I like the Vaseline Lip Therapy because it does not burn my lips like other name brands.</li>
            <li> Vaseline is always guarantee</li>
            <li> This lip moisturizer is amazing. I have very dry lips and skin and this little tub of vaseline is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that brings me comfort for my lips. It doesn&#x27;t need reapplying constantly like other products. I love this stuff. Could not recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people say to me since purchasing these tiny lip therapy tubs that they did not know they came this small. It is the perfect size to carry in a purse. It&#x27;s a little big for a pocket but can be managed.</li>
            <li> I love vaseline products. I get dry skin under my nose, and these little things are perfect to fit in my pocket. Wanted to stock up. Great investment!</li>
            <li> I love the this lip therapy and when I saw that they had them for under $1 I jumped on it! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Addicting and convenient size. No one wants to carry around a 4 oz jar of Vaseline, aside from my grandma? NOBODY.</li>
            <li> saves you 1 if you buy a whoel pack.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I have purchased a few to give away, and carry one in every one of my purses as well as in the car.  Keeps lips soft.  It is a great product!</li>
            <li> Love them. Tiny container, nice thicker Vaseline that actually stays on.</li>
            <li> Love this for my lips.  No medication to dry them out.</li>
            <li> You got to be kidding me I recieved this today and I ordered a pack of 6 ! I knew it was odd when I opened the box because it came in a plastic bag opened !!! There are only four vasoline in here missin two WOW disappointed&lt;br /&gt;No JOKE twice before ordering .</li>
            <li> If feels a little greasy at times but works fantastically when I had bad dryness and the doctor recommended it. I wish there are larger sizes though.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted the tiny container, which is the perfect size for carrying in a backpack. I cycle 16 miles from work everyday and the outside corners of my eyes get very red and dry, so I apply a bit of petroleum jelly to the affected areas with a cotton swab, and voila! The redness and itching is gone. The PJ vaseline supplies in this package is definitely stickier than I expected it to be, but not annoyingly so. When the original container runs out, I&#x27;ll just refill it.</li>
            <li> Not gluten free enough for me and a different color altogether than regular container of Vaseline, so assuming there are undeclared ingredients.</li>
            <li> I keep one in each purse and in the kitchen.  Very handy and effective in our dry climate.</li>
            <li> This is a tiny sized container of vaseline (the shape and colors mock the larger, well known containers). It&#x27;s cute, and makes a decent lip protector.&lt;br /&gt;We bought it because it&#x27;s basically a travel sized container of Vaseline -as far as I know there isn&#x27;t any difference in formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just uploaded a photo of it in my hand, so you can see how tiny this little container is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s OK. I don&#x27;t love it, and I don&#x27;t dislike it. I use it on my lips when I don&#x27;t have anything else around, and sometimes mix it with my lipstick for a little extra shine.</li>
            <li> These Vaseline Lip Therapy containers are TINY.  But, oh the impact on chapped lips is HUGE!  Well worth every cent that you&#x27;ll spend.</li>
            <li> Awesome lip balm, like the smell and I find myself applying it one to two times a day at most. This is the first lip balm that has actually worked, it is sticky but it doesn&#x27;t get gooped up and cakey like most others do after applying them every hour. For a $2 lip balm in a cute container that works, five star.</li>
            <li> Excelent product!&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for it all over.&lt;br /&gt;Love this size to take along in the purse and backpacks!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad Amazon saved me and my kids!&lt;br /&gt;We are ready for the winter!</li>
            <li> small and easy to carry with.  very good for winter dry weather</li>
            <li> i have been using vaseline/ petroleum jelly for my lips for years. i really like this consistency for lips... it is a little thicker than the regular stuff, which i liked because it stays on for hours without having to reapply. the cute little tub is just bonus.</li>
            <li> These are the prefect pocket-size Vaseline and it&#x27;s awesome at moisturizing your lips! I love it and would recommend!</li>
