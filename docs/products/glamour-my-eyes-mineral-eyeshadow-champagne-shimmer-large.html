            <li>Really liked product.</li>
            <li>The product blends well and shimmers nicely.</li>
            <li>The color is a nice light bright tone.</li>
            <li>They even gave me a free gift!</li>
            <li>Love the eye shadow and the shimmery effect.  </li>
            <li>No doubt done on purpose to make the customer buy more sooner.  </li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just absolutely perfect and such a deal!</li>
            <li>They even gave me a free gift which I also really love too.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and the color is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a light shade of eyeshadow....</li>
            <li>When I opened the package, I though, &amp;#34;Well, its free, I&#x27;ll give it a try.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Very nice light color especially for corners of the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Thi would be perfect for a young teen for highlights and fun!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>It was a nice bonus to get an extra mineral shade (smaller size) in my shipment to experiment with :).  </li>
            <li>All natural and healthy, I will definitely buy more from this company.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Very affordable price!</li>
            <li>Worth the price and very pretty for those who like natural looks.</li>
            <li>My Eyes Mineral Eyeshadow is seriously my go-to all-over shadow and has great shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Then use a large angled brush to apply this all over.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely gives your eyes the lightening your looking for.</li>
            <li>I needed a light shadow that would last longer than Almay</li>
            <li>There is nothing intense about it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say</li>
            <li>Best part is Champagne is lasting me a long time unlike the Almay verison where the champagne-like color is the smallest section on the palette whereas the dark shade is the largest.  </li>
            <li>I use this first and then apply a slightly darker shimmer on top of the lid.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty without looking like I&#x27;m heading to a nightclub in the middle of the day!  </li>
            <li>this product is a light shade of pink with shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Intense i-Color Smoky-i Powder Shadow Palette, for Greens (I have about 10 of those sets in my medicine cabinet from the lightest shade being used up completely) - Glamour</li>
            <li>This product disappears on my eyelids instantly unless I dampen the applicator first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and did I mention you get the awesome eyeshadow base?  </li>
            <li>Very simple but a perfect base color.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting Bare Minerals brand.</li>
            <li>had been using Bare Minerals - and still do -</li>
            <li>I am fair-skinned, do not have deep-set eyes and my eyes are small, so then I use the left over Almay palettes I previously purchased to create more definition with the darker colors.  </li>

            <li> It was not what I expected and I did not like the product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Also bought two other colors.</li>
            <li> The trick I use personlly is to apply my skin tone foundation from my browline to the top of my eyelid (not on eyelid itself because I use a darker color there that doesn&#x27;t need a base).  </li>

            <li> Absolutely gives your eyes the lightening your looking for.</li>
            <li> Will buy again. Really nice color for your eyes. Had a little problem opening.  Very small container. Really liked product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the color is very pretty.  I use this color in the corners of my eyes and just below the brow bone.  Very pretty without looking like I&#x27;m heading to a nightclub in the middle of the day!  Great seller, too!  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> So shimmery and beautiful. A little goes a LONG way. Color shows up great. Also bought two other colors.</li>
            <li> I love make-up &amp; this has to be an all time favorite product of mine!!! I wear it on my eyes or even my face when I go out to soften my complexion &amp; add a little glitz. Must have!!!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting Bare Minerals brand. It was not what I expected and I did not like the product. Would not purchase from this eye shadow again</li>
            <li> I needed a light shadow that would last longer than Almay Intense i-Color Smoky-i Powder Shadow Palette, for Greens (I have about 10 of those sets in my medicine cabinet from the lightest shade being used up completely) - Glamour My Eyes Mineral Eyeshadow is seriously my go-to all-over shadow and has great shimmer.  The trick I use personlly is to apply my skin tone foundation from my browline to the top of my eyelid (not on eyelid itself because I use a darker color there that doesn&#x27;t need a base).  So I pour the shadow into the underside of the cap and tap it on the counter to make it spread evenly for brush dipping.  Then use a large angled brush to apply this all over.  I am fair-skinned, do not have deep-set eyes and my eyes are small, so then I use the left over Almay palettes I previously purchased to create more definition with the darker colors.  Finish with falsies mascara, a brow pencil, white eyeliner, and run a darker shadow along my lower lashes.  It was a nice bonus to get an extra mineral shade (smaller size) in my shipment to experiment with :).  Best part is Champagne is lasting me a long time unlike the Almay verison where the champagne-like color is the smallest section on the palette whereas the dark shade is the largest.  No doubt done on purpose to make the customer buy more sooner.  This is really freeing me from having to waste money on Almay&#x27;s palette combinations.</li>
            <li> This product disappears on my eyelids instantly unless I dampen the applicator first. There is nothing intense about it. Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> I did not even realize that this product came with a base.  When I opened the package, I though, &amp;#34;Well, its free, I&#x27;ll give it a try.&amp;#34;  It was AWESOME!

            <li> This shadow stays put and lasts forever! It&#x27;s just absolutely perfect and such a deal! I am a super happy customer! A++++++ seller! We&#x27;ll be doing business again &amp; again! Happy day to you!</li>
            <li> Very nice light color especially for corners of the eyes.  I use this first and then apply a slightly darker shimmer on top of the lid.  Brightens and wakes up the eyes.</li>
            <li> The product blends well and shimmers nicely. The color is a nice light bright tone. Very satisfied! All natural and healthy, I will definitely buy more from this company. Very affordable price!</li>
            <li> I like this eyeshadow.  The helpful hints that came with it were great.  I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
