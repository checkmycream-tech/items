    <ol>
            <li>Combine it with the liquid soap and shampoo and you are good to go!!!  </li>
            <li>Very happy with thus purchase.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>A very pleasant, not-overpowering scent with hints of chocolate, a formulation that doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, and a value pack from Amazon: what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a quality product that works well and smells great.</li>
            <li>Did I mention that the price was great.</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave the sticky feeling under my arms which an antiperspirant does (not going to get into that discussion here, though).</li>
            <li>Great product great price.</li>
            <li>Subscription was a great idea for this product, now I always have them for the man in my life.</li>
            <li>Product is usually great.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>The stuff smells good and lasts.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used and loved this product for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always good, I buy it through amazon because we can&#x27;t find it to buy anywhere in Tucson Az</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a good thing in my mind.</li>
            <li>this worked out good for me.</li>
            <li>It was great to still be able to get this product through Amazon, which, I hope, continues to be manufactured.  </li>
            <li>They really do Love Chocolate!</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite scent through pregnancies!-)</li>
            <li>Deodorant works fine, good aroma and no irritation.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick, and the price was good.</li>
            <li>No sticky residue, a nice odor that doesn&#x27;t overpower, glides on easily...</li>
            <li>I prefer not to use an antiperspirant, fears of prolonged aluminum exposure, and so I love Axe Deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Why would you change the best deodorant ever into something that smells completely different?</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the deodorant works as well as any.</li>
            <li>I too love the smell of it</li>
            <li>I love this scent--hard to beat anywhere</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his favorite.</li>
            <li>i cant find these in stores any more.</li>
            <li>Well, perhaps it&#x27;s mostly just that sort of deodorant-spice, but those finer things do come to mind, elementally.</li>
            <li>It goes on comfortable and leaves a nice feel.</li>
            <li>I was elated to find this favorite form and scent of the Axe deodorant, which has been discontinued in all area retailers.  </li>
            <li>We got went we went to the US for a holiday, we love it, order it for our friends too.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described and got here in good time.</li>
            <li>Great deodorant, wish they still sold it in stores near me.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>this is the best axe scent, hands down.</li>
            <li>also, using the fresh version, which has no antiperspirant, keeps my armpits healthy.</li>
            <li>Although I find most &amp;#34;Axe&amp;#34; scents offensive, I like this one very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more or less inspired by great cologne</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the fragrance is unique and not too &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like this &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; product, I suggest you try the original.</li>
            <li>I noticed that he old recipe was always sold out in stores, so people really liked how it smelled.</li>
            <li>seldom lasts a full 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Smells good on my husband and we could never catch it in stock locally.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, soft smell that gets a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>Been using this one for a long time,people ask what smells so good often.</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed to keep me from stinking around the ladies!</li>
            <li>The product was fresh and arrived well-packaged.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t say this about the exotic Old Spice scents, for example.</li>
            <li>In all cases, the clear form was vastly better.</li>
            <li>Frankly, you&#x27;re best off going to your local grocery/drug store to let your nose decide if Dark Temptation is for you.</li>
            <li>I have been using Dark Temptation Antiperspirant and Deodorant for at least 5 years and it&#x27;s the best ever, but this deodorant only version doesn&#x27;t provide good coverage.</li>
            <li>Smells okay, but does not last.</li>
            <li>So I definitely scored points when I found this product and was able to purchase six at once.  </li>
            <li>While not a huge cost savings over the store, it is fairly priced and delivered on time.  </li>
            <li>white-colored antiperspirant version which is amazingly effective at fighting both wetness and odor and is not at all chalky as some other reviewers have suggested.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong enough that I do not worry about the fact I am not wearing an antiperspirant, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper to purchase this way.</li>
            <li>It matches your natural scent well and is unobtrusively fresh.</li>
            <li>This deodorant stick alone works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Axe seems to push out the old tried and true versions that are preferred by the older set, in favor of the new scents that all smell alike.  </li>
            <li>The darker purple/brown color is also a concern if wearing white or light-colored tees/shirts.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately Amazon sells the original 2.7 oz.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Axe has other worthwhile scents to keep things interesting, but Dark Temptation is and will be my bread and butter for quite some time.</li>
            <li>As Axe made their push into anti-perspirant product, I had occasion to compare the same scent of several of my personal favorites (&amp;#34;Clix&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Dark Temptation&amp;#34;) - clear deodorant only vs. the same scent in the white anti-perspirant - and found that the difference between the two forms was remarkable.  </li>
            <li>I really hope they change back to the old recipe and leave it alone.</li>
            <li>I know this stuff is aimed at 20-somethings, but this 53-year old loves it.</li>
            <li>My previous was the Cool Spice scent from Speedstick.</li>
            <li>My husband likes this particular deodorant, and for some reason it is no longer carried at Walgreens or our local grocery store.  </li>
            <li>They also seem to have pushed out most of the clear, deodorant only, varieties in favor of the messy white deodorant/anti-perspirant forms - which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;FYI, the new version, which is cloudy rather than clear (when you look at the stick), seems the same to me.</li>
            <li>Hard to find deodorant (not antiperspirant)  in a large economical pack.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t switched since first finding this product despite trying other scents from time to time.  </li>
            <li>I like the very manly smell of Dark Temptation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I don&#x27;t stink even after a long sweaty day at work.</li>
            <li> While it is impossible to avoid all exposure to aluminum in our modern world, I do prefer not to rub it on my body in a form that keeps it there all day long and could easily be absorbed (antiperspirant).</li>
            <li> They have the Dry (antipersperant) version, but &amp;#34;it ain&#x27;t the same&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> If I sweat hard with it, it frankly blends well with my natural body odor.</li>
            <li> I do not like anti antiperspirant due to the health hazards.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a mix of mahogany, leather, spice, and yes, dark chocolate.</li>
            <li> Shipped to my door at .30 less per stick that Wally World.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wear &amp;#34;antiperspirant&amp;#34; - just not healthy - and finding this particular scent in stores has become exceedingly difficult.</li>
            <li> Those didn&#x27;t do their job for me and left me feeling dirty, as though I needed a 2nd application.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> This is not easy to find in the store</li>
            <li> In my neck of the woods, the deodorant in this fragrance has been difficult to find recently.</li>
            <li> I picked up the \\&quot;antiperspirant and deodorant\\&quot; combination once in this Dark Temptation scent and was very disappointed to see the white messy residue that it left.  </li>
            <li> Deodorant is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> I find it extremely caustic and irritating and it has very little effect at fighting odor--</li>
            <li> but it is getting so hard to find in our stores!</li>
            <li> None of that caustic locker room nonsense.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good stuff.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Hard to find deodorant (not antiperspirant)  in a large economical pack. Much cheaper to purchase this way.</li>
            <li> I prefer not to use an antiperspirant, fears of prolonged aluminum exposure, and so I love Axe Deodorant.  The scent is strong enough that I do not worry about the fact I am not wearing an antiperspirant, but not overpowering.  I like the very manly smell of Dark Temptation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they do not know what causes Alzheimers, they have found elevated levels of aluminum in the brains of patients who suffered from the the disease.  While it is impossible to avoid all exposure to aluminum in our modern world, I do prefer not to rub it on my body in a form that keeps it there all day long and could easily be absorbed (antiperspirant).</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described and got here in good time.</li>
            <li> Something is different about this deodorant. I&#x27;m not a sweaty person but by the end of the day my pits are stinking as if I hadn&#x27;t showered in days. Hopefully this stuff isn&#x27;t expired.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dark Temptation Antiperspirant and Deodorant for at least 5 years and it&#x27;s the best ever, but this deodorant only version doesn&#x27;t provide good coverage. I threw it it away.</li>
            <li> The company that makes this changed their recipe. Why would you change the best deodorant ever into something that smells completely different? Were they not making profit on this deodorant? I noticed that he old recipe was always sold out in stores, so people really liked how it smelled. I really hope they change back to the old recipe and leave it alone.</li>
            <li> Smells okay, but does not last.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wear &amp;#34;antiperspirant&amp;#34; - just not healthy - and finding this particular scent in stores has become exceedingly difficult. Amazon to the rescue!!  While not a huge cost savings over the store, it is fairly priced and delivered on time.  I love the scent and the deodorant works as well as any. Combine it with the liquid soap and shampoo and you are good to go!!!  Still waiting for women to throw themselves at me as indicated by the advertisements... but hey, we all have dreams...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality product that works well and smells great.</li>
            <li> concerned about the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wrap my brain around chocolate-smelling deodorant, but if my teenage sons want their armpits to smell like chocolate and it makes them not smell like teenage boys, then I&#x27;m all for it!</li>
            <li> Have been using this since the being and he loves it. I too love the smell of it but it is getting so hard to find in our stores!</li>
            <li> this is the best axe scent, hands down. also, using the fresh version, which has no antiperspirant, keeps my armpits healthy. good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, the new version, which is cloudy rather than clear (when you look at the stick), seems the same to me.</li>
            <li> This is not easy to find in the store so I looked here on Amazon. The stuff smells good and lasts. My wife likes the smell and I don&#x27;t stink even after a long sweaty day at work.</li>
            <li> Very happy with thus purchase. Deodorant works fine, good aroma and no irritation. Did I mention that the price was great.</li>
            <li> Arrived on-time.  As advertised.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Although I find most &amp;#34;Axe&amp;#34; scents offensive, I like this one very much. For some reason WalMart is discontinuing it. They have the Dry (antipersperant) version, but &amp;#34;it ain&#x27;t the same&amp;#34;. Delivery was quick, and the price was good.</li>
            <li> I love this scent--hard to beat anywhere</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave the sticky feeling under my arms which an antiperspirant does (not going to get into that discussion here, though).</li>

So I definitely scored points when I found this product and was able to purchase six at once.  The product was fresh and arrived well-packaged.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and loved this product for years. In my opinion, the fragrance is unique and not too &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34;. I do not use antiperspirants just deodorants. In my neck of the woods, the deodorant in this fragrance has been difficult to find recently.</li>
            <li> I only received 5 of the 6 sticks.</li>
            <li> My store no longer carries the 2.7 oz white-colored antiperspirant Axe Dark-Temptation so I ended up buying this 3 oz. product. I find it extremely caustic and irritating and it has very little effect at fighting odor--seldom lasts a full 24 hours. The darker purple/brown color is also a concern if wearing white or light-colored tees/shirts.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately Amazon sells the original 2.7 oz. white-colored antiperspirant version which is amazingly effective at fighting both wetness and odor and is not at all chalky as some other reviewers have suggested. If you don&#x27;t like this &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; product, I suggest you try the original.</li>
            <li> Great product great price.</li>
            <li> Smells good on my husband and we could never catch it in stock locally.  It&#x27;s his favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always good, I buy it through amazon because we can&#x27;t find it to buy anywhere in Tucson Az</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant... and that&#x27;s a good thing in my mind. No sticky residue, a nice odor that doesn&#x27;t overpower, glides on easily... my go-to deodorant these days. Because it&#x27;s just a deodorant, it won&#x27;t block or irritate your skin (the Axe antiperspirant does for me). But does seem to repel sweat a bit, not just cover up the odor (don&#x27;t ask me how - I just use the stuff).</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My son got me started on this stuff.  Love it!!  You won&#x27;t if you don&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li> I do not like anti antiperspirant due to the health hazards.Deodorant is getting hard to find.Been using this one for a long time,people ask what smells so good often.Shipped to my door at .30 less per stick that Wally World.</li>
            <li> i cant find these in stores any more. this worked out good for me.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Deoderant sticks</li>
            <li> A very pleasant, not-overpowering scent with hints of chocolate, a formulation that doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, and a value pack from Amazon: what&#x27;s not to like? I know this stuff is aimed at 20-somethings, but this 53-year old loves it.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed to keep me from stinking around the ladies! They really do Love Chocolate! THANK YOU AXE</li>
            <li> Great deodorant, wish they still sold it in stores near me. Subscription was a great idea for this product, now I always have them for the man in my life.</li>
            <li> Husband likes axe and this is my favorite scent through pregnancies!-)</li>
            <li> This is my daily deodorant. My previous was the Cool Spice scent from Speedstick. Frankly, you&#x27;re best off going to your local grocery/drug store to let your nose decide if Dark Temptation is for you. But I&#x27;ll try and fill in the blanks for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a mix of mahogany, leather, spice, and yes, dark chocolate. Well, perhaps it&#x27;s mostly just that sort of deodorant-spice, but those finer things do come to mind, elementally. It&#x27;s more or less inspired by great cologne (though that doesn&#x27;t make it a substitute, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wears well. None of that caustic locker room nonsense. It matches your natural scent well and is unobtrusively fresh. If I sweat hard with it, it frankly blends well with my natural body odor. I couldn&#x27;t say this about the exotic Old Spice scents, for example. Those didn&#x27;t do their job for me and left me feeling dirty, as though I needed a 2nd application. Axe&#x27;s product is solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe has other worthwhile scents to keep things interesting, but Dark Temptation is and will be my bread and butter for quite some time.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, soft smell that gets a lot of compliments. It does limit sweating a bit, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it leaving any residue on your clothes or body. It goes on comfortable and leaves a nice feel. If you are exercising, the smell works well.</li>
            <li> I was elated to find this favorite form and scent of the Axe deodorant, which has been discontinued in all area retailers.  Axe seems to push out the old tried and true versions that are preferred by the older set, in favor of the new scents that all smell alike.  They also seem to have pushed out most of the clear, deodorant only, varieties in favor of the messy white deodorant/anti-perspirant forms - which I don&#x27;t like.  It was great to still be able to get this product through Amazon, which, I hope, continues to be manufactured.  As Axe made their push into anti-perspirant product, I had occasion to compare the same scent of several of my personal favorites (&amp;#34;Clix&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Dark Temptation&amp;#34;) - clear deodorant only vs. the same scent in the white anti-perspirant - and found that the difference between the two forms was remarkable.  In all cases, the clear form was vastly better.</li>
            <li> Product is usually great.  Been using it for a couple years.  This batch however has no odor and no protection.  I had to throw all of them out. (And yes, I tried them all for a week each).  Waste of money.  I will never buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t switched since first finding this product despite trying other scents from time to time.  I picked up the \\&quot;antiperspirant and deodorant\\&quot; combination once in this Dark Temptation scent and was very disappointed to see the white messy residue that it left.  This deodorant stick alone works very well for me.</li>
            <li> We can not get this in Australia. We got went we went to the US for a holiday, we love it, order it for our friends too.</li>
