            <li>This is a great brush.</li>
            <li>It is great for a one color all over the eye .</li>

            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE SIGMA PRODUCTS!!!</li>
            <li>I just received my E25 and E50 eyeshadow brushes and I can not tell you how much I love them!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS BRUSH!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I COULD GIVE IT MY HONEST REVIEW.  </li>
            <li>Because I reviewed this brush and wrote that it was shedding already, the nice customer service person at Sigma sent me another one.</li>
            <li>Brush looks nice</li>
            <li>I bought this beautiful Sigma brush for when I need a quick all over color on the lid.</li>
            <li>I am also waiting to receive my F82 and I am sure I will love that one as well!</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Thank you, Sigma!!!  :-)</li>
            <li>Love this brush, just like I love all of my sigma brushes.  </li>
            <li>AND I HAVE TO SAY IT HAS ALREADY BECOME ONE OF THE BRUSHES I USE MOST.</li>
            <li>Let me say I love my sigma brushes and was okay with the shedding</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I want to love this brush...</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are better brushes out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because it quickens the process for me in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li>I ordered the \\&quot;Eye Kit\\&quot; and five additional brushes to have the full set of eye brushes.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for a soft wash of colour across the entire lid and for more intricate, yet soft and diffused eye looks.</li>
            <li>I recommend these brushed to anyone who is looking for the perfect brushes at a affordable price - the next order will be the face brushes.</li>
            <li>These might be my new favorite eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li>Very pratical!!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product, but I rarely use it now because it sheds so much.</li>
            <li>Loved both the f 45 and f 30 brushes, the large fluff e 30 is shedding already.</li>
            <li>It is a good size for a large fluff brush</li>
            <li>This is my first Sigma brush.  </li>
            <li>I ripped the box open to find all the brushes in a cute mesh bag with a drawstring and each brush was in its own little plastic sleeve, none of the bristles has been bent or crumpled at a quick glance.</li>
            <li>I got a little more excited and decided to do the foiling technique....</li>
            <li>So, I thought this large brush would help with that problem.  </li>
            <li>I was truly excited for this brush because I had heard a lot of hype over Sigma brushes in general.</li>
            <li>The brushes are not heavily weighted so they really felt comfortable &amp; easy to control unlike other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable</li>
            <li>The quality is good compare with other big brand.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to finally receive my brushes.</li>
            <li>I love sigma brushes but this one is very wide .  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many Sigma brushes in the past and love the brand, but some of the other reviewers were right-</li>
            <li>They are so soft and gentle on the skin!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Priced too high.  </li>
            <li>Love it, I am using it everyday.  </li>
            <li>I keep using and cleaning it, hoping that the shedding is just the normal &amp;#34;new brush&amp;#34; shedding off the excess hairs thing</li>
            <li>Normally when brushes shed I immediately was them (because a lot of the time this will stop the shedding), and it did not shed whatsoever while I washed it.</li>
            <li>There was a little card that explained to first clean before use</li>
            <li>Sigma was new to me, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this brush.  </li>
            <li>But this isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, I love the brush and will still use it everyday!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough, it covers almost my entire eyelid from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>While the brush was soft and decently sized, it shed like no other.</li>
            <li>the soapy clear water</li>
            <li>It feels so soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>Soft.  </li>
            <li>The brush is so soft and works well.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised they offered to send me another one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if this would be a must have brush for all, but this one definitely is with me.</li>
            <li>I have just received my Sigma Large Fluff (E50) Brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger than my Mac 239, so it takes me less time to apply a lid color, which is crucial in the mornings when I need to get my face on quickly and get to work.  </li>

            <li> I have just received my Sigma Large Fluff (E50) Brush and I love it.  My make-up brush collection consists of all the Sigma Brushes.  I found that it is the same and if not better than MAC brushes.  Theses make-up brushes are good and durable.  I LOVE THESE BRUSHES!!!!  Thank you, Sigma!!!  :-)</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It is so soft and fluffy. A must have for the makeup lovers. It feels so soft on my skin. I will never buy any other brushes but Sigma.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, just like I love all of my sigma brushes.  I used this for applying shadow to my lid.  It&#x27;s bigger than my Mac 239, so it takes me less time to apply a lid color, which is crucial in the mornings when I need to get my face on quickly and get to work.  Soft.  No shedding that I could see.</li>
            <li> I just received my E25 and E50 eyeshadow brushes and I can not tell you how much I love them! They are so soft and gentle on the skin! These might be my new favorite eye shadow brushes. I am also waiting to receive my F82 and I am sure I will love that one as well!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH!  I HAD TO GIVE MYSELF A FEW WEEKS TO REALLY USE THIS BRUSH AND NOT BE BIAST SO I COULD GIVE IT MY HONEST REVIEW.  AND I HAVE TO SAY IT HAS ALREADY BECOME ONE OF THE BRUSHES I USE MOST. IT&#x27;S PERFECTLY DENSE AND GREAT FOR SHADOW APPLICATION AND SO CHEAP I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY WITH THIS BRUSH AND ALREADY HAVE MY EYE ON SOME MORE SIGMA BRUSHES..</li>
            <li> Love it, I am using it everyday.  The quality is good compare with other big brand.  The price is reasonable</li>
            <li> I bought this beautiful Sigma brush for when I need a quick all over color on the lid. The brush is so soft and works well. I gave the brush 4 stars only because it sheds every time I use it? I will wash again and hope that is stops. But this isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, I love the brush and will still use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Loved both the f 45 and f 30 brushes, the large fluff e 30 is shedding already. I bought all three recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT TO ADD (08/31/2012): Because I reviewed this brush and wrote that it was shedding already, the nice customer service person at Sigma sent me another one. Let me say I love my sigma brushes and was okay with the shedding so I was surprised they offered to send me another one. Great brushes plus excellent customer service equals a customer for life! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are the best. I highly recommend it. It makes all the diference on the make up. Love it.</li>
            <li> Priced too high.  I think it&#x27;s a fake,  but it does the job,  sheds though.  I use it for all over eyeshadow,  when I want one color.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about buying this brush, turn around and RUN, not walk away from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oy. I want to love this brush... It applies eye shadow so beautifully. It is perfect for a soft wash of colour across the entire lid and for more intricate, yet soft and diffused eye looks. BUT. IT. SHEDS. LIKE. CRAZY! I keep using and cleaning it, hoping that the shedding is just the normal &amp;#34;new brush&amp;#34; shedding off the excess hairs thing but no... It just keeps shedding and shedding and shedding. I use it, it leaves hairs all over my eyelids and face! I am going to use it until it is junky and then I&#x27;ll heave it in the round file. I won&#x27;t repurchase this brush and I certainly DO NOT recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better brushes out there. Skip this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if this would be a must have brush for all, but this one definitely is with me. It&#x27;s big enough, it covers almost my entire eyelid from top to bottom. It&#x27;s nice because it quickens the process for me in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready. Very pratical!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally receive my brushes. I ordered the \\&quot;Eye Kit\\&quot; and five additional brushes to have the full set of eye brushes. I ripped the box open to find all the brushes in a cute mesh bag with a drawstring and each brush was in its own little plastic sleeve, none of the bristles has been bent or crumpled at a quick glance. There was a little card that explained to first clean before use soooo I did. No shedding &amp; no dye flowed thur the soapy clear water :o). Once dry I went to apply my shadows with and the brush felt like silk in combination with my eye primer &amp; eye shadows. I got a little more excited and decided to do the foiling technique....OMG!!! FLAWLESS!!! I soon found myself using each and every brush. The brushes are not heavily weighted so they really felt comfortable &amp; easy to control unlike other brushes I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m looking forward to passing the word about Sigma. I recommend these brushed to anyone who is looking for the perfect brushes at a affordable price - the next order will be the face brushes.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma brush.  My biggest trouble with eyeshadow is blending...I can&#x27;t seem to get my eyeshadows blended out well.  So, I thought this large brush would help with that problem.  It works well and I also use it for putting on color under the eye brow.  I think it would be great for applying highlighter, too.  It&#x27;s not quite as soft as I thought it would be, but like I said, this is my first Sigma brush, so maybe my expectations were unrealistic.  I do have a Sigma brush set on order that hasn&#x27;t been delivered yet.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. It applies the make up with a deep pigmented color. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE SIGMA PRODUCTS!!!</li>
            <li> I was truly excited for this brush because I had heard a lot of hype over Sigma brushes in general. I was hoping this would be comparable to another large fluff brush I had sadly it was not. While the brush was soft and decently sized, it shed like no other. Normally when brushes shed I immediately was them (because a lot of the time this will stop the shedding), and it did not shed whatsoever while I washed it. I used it again dry and the shedding commenced! I really wanted to love this product, but I rarely use it now because it sheds so much. It is a good size for a large fluff brush and I like the handle, but due to the shedding it gets three stars.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many Sigma brushes in the past and love the brand, but some of the other reviewers were right- this one sheds. I have never had this problem with my other Sigma brushes but this one leaves hairs all over my eyelid and face. Too bad because I normally love them. Maybe best to skip this brush, and get another instead.</li>
            <li> My wife has had this  for 1 month  and loves the entire sigma line of brushes. She reccomends to everyone.</li>
            <li> It sheds a lot. Non-stop.</li>
            <li> Brush looks nice but once I started using it it was terrible quality. The brush falls apart on your face. Very poor quality!</li>
            <li> I saw this brush used in a video on YouTube demonstrating an undereye concealing technique.  Sigma was new to me, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this brush.  It is the perfect size to layer powder over concealer. Very impressed with the quality for the price.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love sigma brushes but this one is very wide .  It is great for a one color all over the eye .</li>
