            <li>I use lemon essential oil a lot, so I LOVE that this comes in a large bottle!  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural since I can&#x27;t have certain chemicals in the house because of my son&#x27;s illness AND who wants those harmful products around anyway??</li>
            <li>Overall this is okay.</li>
            <li>Bleach works great, but I hate the smell of it, and not so sure it&#x27;s safe around the pets.</li>
            <li>I decided to take an opportunity to receive this product for minimal cost for an honest review.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>First off, I have been dealing with indigestion and heartburn.</li>
            <li>so many uses for this essential oil.</li>
            <li>Love this product, recently started using oils.</li>
            <li>Love that this comes in a bigger bottle,</li>
            <li>Lemon oil is one of the most versatile essential  oils out there I think.</li>
            <li>Always keep the oil out of direct light and heat.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is pure lemon oil from pressed peels..</li>
            <li>also used Pure Body Naturals on my sons chest as well in his humidifier.</li>
            <li>there is always a certain funk in my kids room.</li>
            <li>Since it’s pure oil, you may want to dilute the oil for any use on the body itself.</li>
            <li>and I was really hoping I would like it.  </li>
            <li>I should have tried before ordering so much.  </li>
            <li>I really am surprised about theis lemon oil, it is exactly like what was advertised</li>
            <li>First thing is first with any essential oil I get..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend..</li>
            <li>but you have to dilute in other oil like coconut because is strong</li>
            <li>but not least...</li>
            <li>unlike other oil products, Pure Body Natural Lemon Oil came in a HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review no other monetary compensation was given .</li>
            <li>Pure Body Naturals has a 3 month money back guarantee, but I highly doubt you’d ever need it.</li>
            <li>Pure Body Naturals Lemon Essential Oil is made of 100% pure therapeutic grade essential oil with no fillers or additives.  </li>
            <li>Only giving 4 stars because I accidentally received Lemon oil from another company, which in my opinion worked a little better.</li>
            <li>Sadly for me the smell reminds me of furniture polish and not like fresh lemons, but that&#x27;s okay because I am using this oil for making natural cleaning products in my home.</li>
            <li>It’s a natural detox and helps flush your body of toxins.</li>
            <li>The bottle is HUGE and last such a long time.</li>
            <li>a few drops went right in the diffuser!</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s a very large bottle of lemon oil, not one of those tiny little essential oil bottles that seem to disappear within days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to try eating pastas and some of my favorite foods again without having to deal with the painful after effects!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A few drops into a small spray water bottle and you have your own fabric or air freshener.</li>
            <li>Previously, I had been using straight bleach to alleviate the smell.</li>

            <li> i used my lemon oil  in my husbands foot soaking machine and he says his feet feel great, it put a little moisture back in them he has asked for it again when he does his foot soak. i received this to give my honest opinion on.</li>
            <li> I  Think that your body Naturals makes some of the best essential oil products. I got this lemon oil in the mail the other day and I must say it is huge. I am big on essential oils and they usually come in a tiny ounce bottle. But this is 4 ounces of goodness. When I opened it the smell was very lemony and fragrant one of my favorite smells is lemon. Lemon essential oil mixed with water and natural dish detergent will make a spider repellent so when you have . A4 ounce bottle it will go a very very long way. I love the fact that this oil came with a dropper it made it easy for me to measure out the amount I needed to make my skin product. I use this essential oil mixed with a carrier argon oil on my knees to lighten the dark spots. I felt no burning sensation but it went on smooth and left my skin feeling silky and nice. I was able to try this out at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased review. All content in this review is my own by my own personal testing on my body. Thank you</li>
            <li> Sadly for me the smell reminds me of furniture polish and not like fresh lemons, but that&#x27;s okay because I am using this oil for making natural cleaning products in my home. If I were making beauty products I&#x27;d probably be upset too. Also I found the smell a bit too strong, but that could have been me not diluting it enough.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used lemon essential oil in other applications and those other oils in the tiny bottles smelled fresher to me. Overall this is okay. Not bad, not amazingly wonderful either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is pure lemon oil from pressed peels.. It smells like a perfume and smells terribly bitter.. I bought this as a replacement to what I usually use... its not even close.</li>
            <li> Awesome lemon smell. I use it in my kitchen and on my kitchen counter.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!! Huge bottle too, thank you!!</li>
            <li> I really am surprised about theis lemon oil, it is exactly like what was advertised, love lobe love, will order again</li>
            <li> First thing is first with any essential oil I get.. a few drops went right in the diffuser! and it smells wonderful! I use lemon for all kinds of things.. I use it to kill germs on the counters or my hands.. I use it to make a bug spray because bug hate citrus. we also use it if anyone has a cough.. we just take a little and rub it on our chest and you get an instant relief. Lemon is really a great Oil to have in the home for many reason. I only named a few. This is a very good quality and everything I have used it for so far it seems to work great. I haven&#x27;t had any bad results yet! I cant believe I received the opportunity to try this for a discounted price in return for my honest and unbiased review and I will continue to purchase. This is great oil at an awesome price!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of citrus, so this purchase was really a no-brainer for me. It&#x27;s just figuring out how very many things you can do with this oil that will make you happy. First, it&#x27;s a very large bottle of lemon oil, not one of those tiny little essential oil bottles that seem to disappear within days. You will have enough lemon oil to last a while. I have a particular problem with my kitchen sink, it seems the trap in the elbow of the pipe tends to collect crud over several weeks’ time, and starts to smell really bad. Previously, I had been using straight bleach to alleviate the smell. Bleach works great, but I hate the smell of it, and not so sure it&#x27;s safe around the pets. Fortunately, this lemon oil comes with convenient dropper, so you can start using it right away. I put a few drops in my sink drain. The fresh lemon smell is heavenly, and my drains don&#x27;t skin any longer. I think there is going to be a hundred different ways of using this stuff! I am very happy with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;I was given this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review of it.</li>
            <li> packaging was efficient to protect the contents. Aroma was pleasant, when adding to water, had a light flavoring.</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell and huge bottle for the price!!! Can&#x27;t wait to use!!!</li>
            <li> I never used lemon oil before, although I have heard amazing things about it. I decided to take an opportunity to receive this product for minimal cost for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;  I used this product in a couple different ways, although I&#x27;m sure there are many more ways to use it. First off, I have been dealing with indigestion and heartburn. I tried a few drops in my water bottle at work and I noticed that my acid reflex is GONE! You don&#x27;t understand...this is something I had dealt with since I was a very small child. I&#x27;m so excited to try eating pastas and some of my favorite foods again without having to deal with the painful after effects!&lt;br /&gt;I also used Pure Body Naturals on my sons chest as well in his humidifier. He has RAD (Reactive Airway Disease)-Asthmatic symptoms to everything. It helped open his airway to the point he didn&#x27;t need to use his inhaler which has steroids. I LOVE it! He was able to sleep in peace without wheezing. That is something amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it to clean with. I put a few drops in the dishwasher and also in my cleaner spray bottle. I love it! It made everything smell so fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least...there is always a certain funk in my kids room. I could clean and clean and I could never figure out where it&#x27;s coming from...hello!!...Their SHOES! P.U! Well, I diluted a few drops into a water spray bottle, sprayed them at night and WAALAA! That problem is solved! I love this Lemon oil! I love that it&#x27;s natural since I can&#x27;t have certain chemicals in the house because of my son&#x27;s illness AND who wants those harmful products around anyway?? NOT ME! unlike other oil products, Pure Body Natural Lemon Oil came in a HUGE bottle. I highly recommend..</li>
            <li> so many uses for this essential oil. I&#x27;m amazed how well it works. Only giving 4 stars because I accidentally received Lemon oil from another company, which in my opinion worked a little better.</li>
            <li> OMG the first time i used this oil i fell in love with it. The smell is so fresh. The bottle is HUGE and last such a long time. It is worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love this product, recently started using oils. This Lemon is great! I put it in a little  warmer and in 15 min the smell is all over the house. Arrived fast, good packaging.</li>
            <li> I like this oil. I use it to freshen the house by boiling a pot of water and adding a few drops of the lemon. When I do this in the morning  before you know it I&#x27;m dressed and out the door feeling fresh. I also mix it with my facial moisturize and my skin glows. It&#x27;s a wonderful product with so many uses that comes with a convenient dropper.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Love it. Use daily in diffuser</li>
            <li> I love it, smells so good, I put it on my skin (not sure if it&#x27;s working because I have been using it for a short time period) but you have to dilute in other oil like coconut because is strong, we also use it in the hands soap and smells delicious</li>
            <li> Caused headaches for all family members. Scent is very overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I use lemon essential oil a lot, so I LOVE that this comes in a large bottle!  I put 5 drops of this oil in my diffuser that I keep in my kitchen and in a couple seconds my kitchen smelled like fresh lemons.  I also use lemon oil to make cleaning products.  I put 8 drops of this oil in a spray bottle filled with white vinegar and it worked great to clean my sticky countertops!  I also like that this particular company has a money back guarantee and they will refund you if you are not satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the lemon.</li>
            <li> Great quality and smell. Great price.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed in this product.  I didn&#x27;t think it tasted like lemon and I think it has a musty smell.  Really sad because the price was right and I was really hoping I would like it.  I guess you get what you pay for!  I should have tried before ordering so much.  (ordered 3)</li>
            <li> I love the scent of lemon oil from my difffuser going thru my house . Lemon oil has many benefits, cleansing and purification, A remedy for halitosis  ( Bad Breath) Digestion,thrist quencher,  Promotes weight loss, .Teeth whitener ,clean your hands and it&#x27;s a fantastic face wash. When I&#x27;m in a bad mood I put lemon essential oil in my deffusor get in the air and my mood starts to change and it also helps my depression. I always have lemon oil in my house.I received this gift for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
