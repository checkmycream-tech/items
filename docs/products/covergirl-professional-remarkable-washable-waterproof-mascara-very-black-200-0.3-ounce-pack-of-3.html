            <li>It applies beautifully, and stays put, no Matter what!</li>
            <li>The thing I like best about it is that when you pull it out of the tube, it wipes off a sufficient amount of product (this is one of my mascara pet peeves!)</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it means that you get an excellent, clump-free application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ladies it is the greatest thing ever.</li>
            <li>Always looks great and doesn&#x27;t clump!</li>
            <li>I have  worn this mascara for a number of years, and let me say THERE IS NOTHING BETTER ON THE MARKET!!!  </li>
            <li>Remarkable!</li>
            <li>JUST a great great product!</li>
            <li>It is indeed waterproof but washable, doesn&#x27;t smudge, looks great, lengthens lashes well.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>It enhances my lashes very nicely, doesn&#x27;t smudge or give me &amp;#34;panda eyes&amp;#34;, and washes off with soap and water.</li>
            <li>It really is a nice mascara!</li>
            <li>I loved the wand with this mascara.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>I now buy it in packs of 3 to make sure i have it around!</li>
            <li>I opened up the mascara to try it, the first thing I was impressed with was the brush.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best on the market....</li>
            <li>This mascara is nice and moist, but definetely not waterproof.</li>
            <li>If you want an excellent, truly waterproof mascara, try Loreal Voluminous Million Lashes Waterproof or Covergirl Professional</li>
            <li>CoverGirl Professional Remarkable Washable Waterproof mascara is not that remarkable.</li>
            <li>I wear sunscreen all the time and it tends to make most of the mascara I wear smudge just under my eye..</li>
            <li>great price, not clumping, doesnt make spidereyes unless you really are glopping it on, and doesnt smudge...win.  </li>
            <li>Glad I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara because it&#x27;s washable, yet resistant to moisture.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to struggle to remove it like you do most water-proof mascaras.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>It should be advertised as the most waterproof mascara THAT IS SAFE FOR YOUR EYES.  </li>
            <li>I love that this mascara is so inexpensive, but even if it weren&#x27;t I&#x27;d buy it.</li>
            <li>Was pleased to get my favorite mascara at such a great price!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara:)</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s where the \\&quot;washable\\&quot; part comes in, which is very true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the best-- super dark, does not clump, holds a curl nicely and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li>Waterproof, but washes off easily....</li>
            <li>Shipping, very quick.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily  </li>
            <li>Then when I want to take it off, it comes off easily</li>
            <li>washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I buy the &amp;#34;Very Black&amp;#34; and it adds a ton of volume, doesn&#x27;t wash away with the touch of water, but does wash away easily in the shower when you are purposefully cleaning.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural looking clump free mascara.</li>
            <li>It is easily washed away with soap and water and does not damage or pull the lashes out when you wash your eye makeup off.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara because it offers a good balance between waterproof and washable.</li>
            <li>It is not terribly expensive individually, but in this 3-pack, it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li>but I got it cheap</li>
            <li>and i can trust to look fabulous all day.</li>
            <li>i thought the price was cheap, and it said the mascara was waterproof, then i got it, and</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time without drying out  Great value for your money</li>
            <li>It did a great job of separating my lashes but this was certainly not waterproof or cry proof.</li>
            <li>This mascara is probably great for people who have brown to black eyelashes anyway.  </li>
            <li>what a shame, I really need to find sweat proof, humidity proof, and smudge proof!!</li>
            <li>(I put some other kind on once and it literally would not come off!).</li>
            <li>so for what I paid it was worth it.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this mascara running or smudging (although I haven&#x27;t given the waterproof aspect a full test by swimming or anything like that), and it truly DOES wash off easily with soap and water, which I</li>

            <li>.. right?</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it I had to use eye make up remover first, washed after, and still had mascara on.</li>
            <li>first I thought it was the eyeliner, but went without eyeliner for a day and realized it was my mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used waterproof mascaras and never had problems with any burning my eyes when I was in hot and/or humid weather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless I happen to chance upon something better, this product has definitely become my #1, go-to mascara.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless I happen to chance upon something better, this product has definitely become my #1, go-to mascara.  </li>
            <li>It stays on throughout the day at my job in an extremely hot kitchen where I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of mascara.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY different kinds, from products that used to work well for me (e.g., [[ASIN:B000T5KAT2 Maybelline Full and Soft</li>
            <li>Who wants their lashes to just stick straight out?!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive eyes that burn,sting, tear and turn red easily.  </li>
            <li>Too much product gets onto it but isn&#x27;t applied to the lashes well.</li>
            <li>I have been on a quest to find a mascara that works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>Im giving it three stars only because it was really cheap</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this mascara</li>
            <li>Bought for my 3 daughters for Christmas and they all really like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone looking for a (monetarily) cheaper mascara!</li>
            <li>For normal wear it is safe, comfortable, and has even stayed on through occasional crying and tears.  </li>
            <li>I mainly wear mascara when I&#x27;m going out, going out for me means dancing, and when I dance I</li>
            <li>HIghly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara and have used it for a few years.</li>
            <li>My ONLY qualm is that the tube doesn&#x27;t last too long, it would be great if it were about 50% larger!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof, but not hard to get off</li>
            <li>The focus is definitely more on length than volume; that worked fine for me, but someone searching more for the latter might be a bit disappointed.  </li>
            <li>black smears down my cheeks (would be good for a horror film).</li>
            <li>Unlike other waterproof mascaras I&#x27;ve tried in the past, it is also very easy to remove, and comes right off with my Clinique or Sonia Kashuk eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I recently needed to purchase some waterproof mascara to wear to a funeral, and saw that this had positive reviews on a beauty forum.  </li>
            <li>This mascara never runs and i can wash it completely off with Dove soap.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara, and will definitely re-purchase it when I work my way through all three tubes.</li>
            <li>but the formula was very wet, and too much of the product came out on the wand, making very clumpy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes quite as thick as my go-to mascara (Bare Escentuals Buxom Lash), it creates nice length and volume, and really stays put, even through quite a few tears.  </li>
            <li>I am a mascara fanatic and love to try all different kinds of mascara.  </li>
            <li>I tried another brand that was supposed to be \\&quot;better\\&quot; and came right back to this one before finishing the other.    </li>
            <li>However, I really dislike having to spend a long time trying to get my mascara off at night, having eyelashes come off in the process, and waking up with raccoon eyes the next morning.</li>
            <li>When I want complete water-proofing, I will use another mascara over it as a 2nd coat.</li>
            <li>recently, I read about Cover Girl Professional.  </li>
            <li>Regular Waterproof mascaras require oily makeup removers to get them off, which is an added expense, and that oil can also irritate sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>I will be re-purchasing, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it!that worked fine for me, but someone searching more for the latter might be a bit disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I also found that I could apply several coats--with or without drying in-between--and build the product up even further for a more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li>I find that this hardly shows on my lashes AND that the tube dries out too quickly) to newer products (such as [[ASIN:B004Y9M81W</li>
            <li>well.. its just ok, it&#x27;s not waterproof at all, i mean, it doesnt run down your face during the day, but the point of being waterproof is that u can use it while u are on a pool, beach</li>

            <li> The worst ever,I went back to my true love which is Lancome Hypnose waterproof volumizing mascara.</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Volum&#x27; Express Falsies Flared Waterproof Mascara, Very Black 295,</li>
            <li> It stays on as long as needed and when you take your makeup off it comes off.</li>
            <li> mascara worked extremely well for my short, stumpy lashes.  </li>
            <li> Other Waterproof mascaras have little pieces of mascara that sometimes break off from the lashes, especially if you accidentally forget and rub your eyelids, and those rough pieces, although tiny, get into your eyes and roll around on your eyeball, SCRATCHING.  </li>
            <li> Easily removes with cold cream or soap and water.  </li>
            <li> So if you cry, some will come off, but only a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn better mascaras, but this one isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>

            <li> The problem with waterproof mascaras is the fact that they stick like glue to your eyelashes, which, obviously, is why they&#x27;re waterproof. However, I really dislike having to spend a long time trying to get my mascara off at night, having eyelashes come off in the process, and waking up with raccoon eyes the next morning. I love this mascara because it offers a good balance between waterproof and washable.</li>
            <li> This is what I have used for years.  I have to watch for sales at the store.  With the $3 coupon and no sales tax, Amazon is the way to go.</li>
            <li> 1. Personally I don&#x27;t like the density of the brush. Too much product gets onto it but isn&#x27;t applied to the lashes well. Doesn&#x27;t build a lot of volume. Isn&#x27;t going to be my go to mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Waterproof, but washes off easily....kinda. The first time I wore it I had to use eye make up remover first, washed after, and still had mascara on. So with a little labor and scrubbing with additional remover it eventually came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Price, for the product is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Shipping, very quick.</li>
            <li> Not exactly waterproof and not exactly washable. I mainly wear mascara when I&#x27;m going out, going out for me means dancing, and when I dance I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;When I sweat it streaks, and it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.&lt;br /&gt;No different than a regular mascara but I got it cheap so for what I paid it was worth it.</li>
            <li> This is probably the cheapest mascara I&#x27;ve used and buying them in a pack of three means I never have to worry about when to replace my mascara. It&#x27;s also the best-- super dark, does not clump, holds a curl nicely and doesn&#x27;t flake. The subscribe and save option makes it nearly half the price of comparable mascaras at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara fanatic and love to try all different kinds of mascara.  This one didn&#x27;t work for me.  It is NOT truly waterproof.  A little too much crying or getting the lashes wet, and the mascara starts to come off.  If you want an excellent, truly waterproof mascara, try Loreal Voluminous Million Lashes Waterproof or Covergirl Professional All in One Waterproof Mascara.</li>
            <li> I have always trusted Cover Girl Mascara it just works for me and i can trust to look fabulous all day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara!  I tried another brand that was supposed to be \\&quot;better\\&quot; and came right back to this one before finishing the other.    Pros:    Does not clump  Stays on your eyelashes and not under your eyes  Washes off easily  Lasts a long time without drying out  Great value for your money</li>
            <li> Yay, finially an actually waterproof mascara that doesnt smudge on me.  I wear sunscreen all the time and it tends to make most of the mascara I wear smudge just under my eye..first I thought it was the eyeliner, but went without eyeliner for a day and realized it was my mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go great price, not clumping, doesnt make spidereyes unless you really are glopping it on, and doesnt smudge...win.  Glad I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used waterproof mascaras and never had problems with any burning my eyes when I was in hot and/or humid weather. As soon as I started to sweat this mascara got in my eyes, my eyes started to burn then started to tear up, then the mascara ran down my face, black smears down my cheeks (would be good for a horror film). And I couldn&#x27;t hardly see to find a towel!They were returned.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smear under eyes as some mascara does</li>
            <li> There are lots of clumps &amp; globs. Well, in the product&#x27;s advertisement, they didn&#x27;t mention \\&quot;No clumps, No globs\\&quot;, so I guess they know their product well. Waste of money. Negative stars if there is an option.</li>
            <li> I have  worn this mascara for a number of years, and let me say THERE IS NOTHING BETTER ON THE MARKET!!!  I have NEVER had any issues with it. It applies beautifully, and stays put, no Matter what! Never any smudges, smears, flaking off or anything else. STAYS PUT UNTIL YOU REMOVE IT EFFORTLESSLY WITH WATER IN THE SHOWER.  JUST a great great product!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara because it&#x27;s washable, yet resistant to moisture. So if you cry, some will come off, but only a little. It will not make you look like a raccoon. Then when I want to take it off, it comes off easily and I don&#x27;t need to struggle to remove it like you do most water-proof mascaras. When I want complete water-proofing, I will use another mascara over it as a 2nd coat.</li>
            <li> i have used this mascara for about 10 years and can&#x27;t find it in my local big box anymore.  I have super sensitive eyes that burn,sting, tear and turn red easily.  This mascara never runs and i can wash it completely off with Dove soap.  I now buy it in packs of 3 to make sure i have it around!</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest to find a mascara that works really well for me.  I have tried MANY different kinds, from products that used to work well for me (e.g., [[ASIN:B000T5KAT2 Maybelline Full and Soft Washable Mascara Brownish Black]]--now I find that this hardly shows on my lashes AND that the tube dries out too quickly) to newer products (such as [[ASIN:B004Y9M81W Maybelline New York Volum&#x27; Express Falsies Flared Waterproof Mascara, Very Black 295, 0.31-fluid Ounce]]--not bad overall, but the formula was very wet, and too much of the product came out on the wand, making very clumpy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More recently, I read about Cover Girl Professional.  I liked the idea of a washable waterproof mascara--I prefer to have at least one waterproof mascara on hand for when I wear contacts, but I hate using eye makeover remover and/or struggling to get the product off my lashes.  I found this product on sale, so I tried to give it a try, purchasing the \\&quot;Brownish Black\\&quot; version (it also comes in black, but I tend to think that looks too harsh with my brown eyes and medium-dark brown hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened up the mascara to try it, the first thing I was impressed with was the brush.  Many of today&#x27;s newer mascara&#x27;s have fancy, complicated brushes; this one is simple yet well-designed.  The thing I like best about it is that when you pull it out of the tube, it wipes off a sufficient amount of product (this is one of my mascara pet peeves!) so that you don&#x27;t have to waste product by wiping off excess with a tissue (why would I want to waste money that way?).  Furthermore, it means that you get an excellent, clump-free application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara worked extremely well for my short, stumpy lashes.  It builds quite a bit of length without giving that \\&quot;spidery\\&quot; look.  I also found that I could apply several coats--with or without drying in-between--and build the product up even further for a more dramatic look.  The focus is definitely more on length than volume; that worked fine for me, but someone searching more for the latter might be a bit disappointed.  So far, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this mascara running or smudging (although I haven&#x27;t given the waterproof aspect a full test by swimming or anything like that), and it truly DOES wash off easily with soap and water, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless I happen to chance upon something better, this product has definitely become my #1, go-to mascara.  I will be re-purchasing, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it!that worked fine for me, but someone searching more for the latter might be a bit disappointed.

            <li> I&#x27;ve worn better mascaras, but this one isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am disappointed. it smudges and runs... what a shame, I really need to find sweat proof, humidity proof, and smudge proof!!</li>
            <li> So i bought this pack of three, cause i thought the price was cheap, and it said the mascara was waterproof, then i got it, and well.. its just ok, it&#x27;s not waterproof at all, i mean, it doesnt run down your face during the day, but the point of being waterproof is that u can use it while u are on a pool, beach.. right? well, dont count on this mascara for those activities, also i think the formula is too heavy. Im giving it three stars only because it was really cheap and it does a \\&quot;ok\\&quot; job for a daily mascara.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.  It is indeed waterproof but washable, doesn&#x27;t smudge, looks great, lengthens lashes well.  HIghly recommended.  Remarkable!</li>
            <li> Did stage work for 50 years.  Absolutely the best on the market....nobody ever has it in stock...that should tell you something.....doesn&#x27;t run, doesn&#x27;t flake and only cakes if you make it.  Easily removes with cold cream or soap and water.  Great product.  I&#x27;ll be devastated if they ever stop making this.....and to Cover Girl....Don&#x27;t change the brush!</li>
            <li> I recently needed to purchase some waterproof mascara to wear to a funeral, and saw that this had positive reviews on a beauty forum.  It really is a nice mascara! While it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes quite as thick as my go-to mascara (Bare Escentuals Buxom Lash), it creates nice length and volume, and really stays put, even through quite a few tears.  Unlike other waterproof mascaras I&#x27;ve tried in the past, it is also very easy to remove, and comes right off with my Clinique or Sonia Kashuk eye makeup remover.  I really like this mascara, and will definitely re-purchase it when I work my way through all three tubes.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this mascara but It is really not meant for sensitive eyes like it stated.My eyes were burning badly!My eyes were watery and really red plus  the mascara flake all over.I was only wearing this mascara in my eyes had no eyeliner or eye shadow on so I knew I need to take this mascara off.The worst ever,I went back to my true love which is Lancome Hypnose waterproof volumizing mascara.Ladies it is the greatest thing ever.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. I use 3 coats to get killer lashes. Doesn&#x27;t smear or flake. washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 3 daughters for Christmas and they all really like it.</li>
            <li> I have bought this mascara for over 10 years. It is not terribly expensive individually, but in this 3-pack, it&#x27;s a great deal! I now buy it in the 3-pack and have one in my bathroom, one in the purse, and one at work - so everywhere I go without having to move it back and forth and keep track! I buy the &amp;#34;Very Black&amp;#34; and it adds a ton of volume, doesn&#x27;t wash away with the touch of water, but does wash away easily in the shower when you are purposefully cleaning. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a (monetarily) cheaper mascara!</li>
            <li> CoverGirl Professional Remarkable Washable Waterproof mascara is not that remarkable. Its fault is that it clumps. It is waterproof and it is washable - but otherwise less than average.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this item was being taken off the market and discontinued.  NEVER STOP MAKING THIS!  It should be advertised as the most waterproof mascara THAT IS SAFE FOR YOUR EYES.  Other Waterproof mascaras have little pieces of mascara that sometimes break off from the lashes, especially if you accidentally forget and rub your eyelids, and those rough pieces, although tiny, get into your eyes and roll around on your eyeball, SCRATCHING.  They can&#x27;t dissolve in the eye fluids.  Regular Waterproof mascaras require oily makeup removers to get them off, which is an added expense, and that oil can also irritate sensitive eyes.  Covergirl&#x27;s Washable Waterproof Mascara stays on, unless you immerse your face or head into water.  For normal wear it is safe, comfortable, and has even stayed on through occasional crying and tears.  Contact Lens users NEVER want to get a particle stuck under the lens that won&#x27;t dissolve, because the lens holds the particle against your eye, grinding.  This mascara can dissolve. And,it washes off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the regular waterproof formula in black/brown so I purchased this one. I don&#x27;t know WHAT covergirl is doing to their mascara formula but this stuff actually straightened my eyelashes. I curl my lashes before applying mascara and I could see them visibly uncurl after I applied the mascara. So weird! Who wants their lashes to just stick straight out?!</li>
            <li> This mascara is probably great for people who have brown to black eyelashes anyway.  However, anyone with blond eyelashes, it&#x27;s not a good product to use.  Coverage is pathetic and dries too quickly so will rub off when trying to get the coverage needed.</li>
            <li> My eyes water often, so I always use waterproof mascara for my lower lashline. Within five minutes after applying, the mascara on my corner lashes was entirely gone and smudged. I looked ridiculous for the rest of the day. This mascara is nice and moist, but definetely not waterproof.</li>
            <li> I loved the wand with this mascara. It did a great job of separating my lashes but this was certainly not waterproof or cry proof. If I got even the least bit of moisture on this mascara, it was smearing.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and have used it for a few years. It enhances my lashes very nicely, doesn&#x27;t smudge or give me &amp;#34;panda eyes&amp;#34;, and washes off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural looking clump free mascara. It stays on throughout the day at my job in an extremely hot kitchen where I sweat a lot. I did wear it swimming and it came off when I rubbed my eyes, though it did not run down my face. I have used other waterproof mascaras while swimming and they stay on the lashes even if I touch them. I guess that&#x27;s where the \\&quot;washable\\&quot; part comes in, which is very true. It is easily washed away with soap and water and does not damage or pull the lashes out when you wash your eye makeup off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of mascara. I&#x27;m on the move a lot and other mascaras tend to smudge or run-- not this one! It&#x27;s waterproof, but not hard to get off (I put some other kind on once and it literally would not come off!). I love that this mascara is so inexpensive, but even if it weren&#x27;t I&#x27;d buy it. My ONLY qualm is that the tube doesn&#x27;t last too long, it would be great if it were about 50% larger!</li>
            <li> Was pleased to get my favorite mascara at such a great price!  This has been my go to mascara for years.  Always looks great and doesn&#x27;t clump!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara:) It stays on as long as needed and when you take your makeup off it comes off.</li>
