            <li>Nice colors.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to get two for the price of one.</li>
            <li>I do not declare myself to be proficient in manicures by any stretch of the means, but Shellac is very, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Aptly named, this will make an incredible first selection of Shellac&#x27;s many colors.  </li>
            <li>This color is beautiful and it really pops!</li>
            <li>Perfect Christmas and in general holiday season color.</li>
            <li>I love this combo.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get a UV lamp or it won&#x27;t set.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>Love the colors, love the product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many of my friends and colleagues I have directed in their selection of Shellac products to polish their nails in the privacy and convenience of their homes.  </li>
            <li>,i wanna buy more colors....</li>
            <li>Quick shipping makes it even better.</li>
            <li>You have your fun, festive Wild Fire, then your classic, sophisticated Ruby Ritz in the PERFECT Pair Duo Pack.  </li>
            <li>A uv light is needed</li>
            <li>I like the relatively light shimmer.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly like it&#x27;s supposed to, not shrinking on the nail.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic experience.</li>
            <li>The Ruby Ritz polish is beautiful, with just enough sparkle to stand out, but not so much as to be garish.</li>
            <li>It is true to its reputation.  </li>
            <li>and it came of quickly.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>that I don&#x27;t understand how they have become so popular nor why they are used in the multiple nail salons.</li>
            <li>Even my older style bottles are still just fine.</li>
            <li>However the consistency of the nail polish doesnt seem right</li>
            <li>Exactly as stated .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews and finally thought I need to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>One is really sparkly!</li>
            <li>You can save SO much money by doing these at home instead of going to the salon every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>it just starts growing out the nail a bit much.</li>
            <li>I like this duo from cnd, thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the ruby ritz by itself.</li>
            <li>As for these colors, the plain red is awesome, it&#x27;s your classic red nail, and I get lots of compliments.  </li>
            <li>Even the bottle color is true to the actual polish color.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>The straight red is great, the sparkly red is more of a pink that a dark red,</li>
            <li>Wildfire is HOT hot red and ruby ritz is sparkly red like dorothys shoes!</li>
            <li>My nails look professionally groomed today as they did when I paid for it!  </li>
            <li>The company shipped fast, 3 days earlier than expected, priced right, and they were packaged well.</li>
            <li>Now the wildfire, endless possibilities both alone and layered on top or under other colors, like grapefruit sparkle, vip silver, hot pop pink.</li>
            <li>CND wears well, and looks fresh everyday.</li>
            <li>The deeper red with glitter is ok, but a little too dark for my taste.</li>
            <li>I also bought Ruby Red-Fine Glitter  by Glitties Nail Art to make it more dramatic.</li>
            <li>just the red without shimer is such a vivid red.</li>

            <li> Very nice. Not your typical Ruby slipper type color and a darker red...</li>
            <li> the 2 best color of shellac for the price of one:) it was a good deal and I would do it again. Ruby Ritz is amazing! It stays even more than 14 days , it depends on your nail growth!</li>
            <li> Very nice looking and lasts</li>
            <li> Great staying power!  The actual color has sparkles in it, if that&#x27;s your taste.  Otherwise, this is the best brand of gel polish!</li>
            <li> Great product..beautiful color!! Good seller..fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Wildfire is my go-to Shellac color, so when I came across this combo pack, I jumped on it. The Ruby Ritz polish is beautiful, with just enough sparkle to stand out, but not so much as to be garish.</li>
            <li> i am new to Shellac and this I purchased to start with the base and top coat shellac also. However the consistency of the nail polish doesnt seem right and it came of quickly. So I purchased a different nail color also from Shellac and it worked great. This one was a failure to me.</li>
            <li> I love this combo. I also bought Ruby Red-Fine Glitter  by Glitties Nail Art to make it more dramatic. just the red without shimer is such a vivid red.</li>
            <li> You can save SO much money by doing these at home instead of going to the salon every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get jealous get shellac. Doesn&#x27;t mess up your nails. Make sure you get a UV lamp or it won&#x27;t set.</li>
            <li> The straight red is great, the sparkly red is more of a pink that a dark red, like it looks like it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews and finally thought I need to give it a try.  It is true to its reputation.  I can go 3 weeks without chips etc it just starts growing out the nail a bit much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about a 3 week wear.  Love it..</li>
            <li> I like this duo from cnd, thanks</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Beautiful apple red and the ruby slippers will be perfect for the holidays!</li>
            <li> Wildfire is HOT hot red and ruby ritz is sparkly red like dorothys shoes! Love em!</li>
            <li> In love :) Great seller and great product</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> Great duo pack!  Nice colors.  The wildfire have sparkled in it and is a great Christmas time color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to get two for the price of one. Quick shipping makes it even better.</li>
            <li> One is really sparkly! Candy apple red with sparkles. Great polish though.</li>
            <li> I really like the ruby ritz by itself. I like the relatively light shimmer. It&#x27;s not gaudy and adds a little pop to it. Perfect Christmas and in general holiday season color.

            <li> Stunning colors and absolutely beautiful!</li>
            <li> Love the colors, love the product.CND is the best shellac out there</li>
            <li> Ladies, this is probably the best investment of the two chosen colors you will ever make!  You have your fun, festive Wild Fire, then your classic, sophisticated Ruby Ritz in the PERFECT Pair Duo Pack.  Aptly named, this will make an incredible first selection of Shellac&#x27;s many colors.  I stopped frequenting my Salon every 3 weeks for a Shellac manicure at $40 a pop (plus tip) and ordered the Shellac set for a Christmas gift to myself.  I do not declare myself to be proficient in manicures by any stretch of the means, but Shellac is very, very easy to use.  My nails look professionally groomed today as they did when I paid for it!  If I can do it, anyone can.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many of my friends and colleagues I have directed in their selection of Shellac products to polish their nails in the privacy and convenience of their homes.  My investment paid off within 4 manicures!</li>
            <li> CND, the only soak off gel polish that works. Goes on smoothly like it&#x27;s supposed to, not shrinking on the nail. And comes off like it&#x27;s supposed to, don&#x27;t have to scrape it or file it off.  There are some others out there that I don&#x27;t understand how they have become so popular nor why they are used in the multiple nail salons. CND wears well, and looks fresh everyday. Sometimes it&#x27;s only the nail growth that requires me to have them redone. Colors are great, the Ruby Ritz has a sparkle in it, perfect for the holidays. Even the bottle color is true to the actual polish color.</li>
            <li> Great price. Good products.</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful and it really pops!</li>
            <li> Did not care for this polish.  It&#x27;s too runny</li>
            <li> Did not realize it was gel</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic experience. No problems.</li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t take out the shipping coming to palau,i wanna buy more colors....</li>
