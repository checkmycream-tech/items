            <li>I looked on Amazon and sure enough it was listed!</li>
            <li>This product does seem to tighten the skin almost after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I tried this first time through the &amp;#34;free offer&amp;#34; that others have commented about.  </li>

            <li>She has started using the system about a month ago and is seeing a large difference in her face.  </li>
            <li>Insisting on a certain amount of words makes me not want to  write the review  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for reducing fine wrinkles and with a moisturizer improves the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li>Fast affordable product.</li>
            <li>Try it, I really think you will like it.</li>

            <li>and I was responsible.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Yes, feels a little sticky when you put it on but dries quickly leaving a smooth matte.  </li>
            <li>I recorded my conversations with Sky (ID #355) and Jonathan (ID#305) who respectively offered 35 and 50% of the product but would not refund me for the full amount that I asked for.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend using the renewal peel (miracle product--</li>
            <li>I ordered a complete set for my niece and this product was being used up fast</li>
            <li>I received the product and my card was charged indicating that the Autofill worked correctly although, I did not received a confirmation email,  or an email reflecting conditions of purchase or any other communication that represented the &amp;#34;contract&amp;#34; agreed upon between the company and myself when I  filled the internet order.</li>
            <li>After attempting to return it to no avail and having the customer service representative tell me this type of advertising and withdrawing $100 per month is actually both legal and ethical</li>
            <li>The products are easy to use and very reasonably priced, at least through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I ran out of the first bottle and for several months used something else.  </li>
            <li>I was charged a 97.88$ by SKINCRE on 01/15/14 (13 days after the first charge) and called the number provided by my online bank statement which was the only way I could communicate with the company since I used up the product and discarded the bottle (I was not planning on reordering it).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fought adult acne during my hormone cycles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will recommend my mother&#x27;s age adult.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>One small drop every day massaging it in for 30 seconds is all it took to make my face and neck smooth again.</li>
            <li>Indeed, I never received my copy of the sale contract or any other documentation bearing the conditions of purchase or even the necessary information to cancel my trial period therefore, I ask for a full refund of the 97.88$.&lt;br /&gt;Julie Della-Maria</li>
            <li>This cleanser is the only cleanser I have tried so far that resulted in noticeable reduction of pores and acne formation.</li>
            <li>Also, I would be required to send them an email stating I would not pursue any disputes or further action.  </li>
            <li>I tried a &amp;#34;trial offer&amp;#34; directly from the AuraVie com., and was almost conned into paying $100.00 per month for same 3 products you can buy here for $30.00.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive on my budjet.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face feeling fresh and firm all day.</li>
            <li>After placing several orders through Amazon.com over the holidays, Amazon (at least I assume it was Amazon) offered me a free gift: a choice of three or four products, one of which was Auravie beauty products.  </li>
            <li>I first started using this product a few months ago.  </li>
            <li>On the downside, the bottle doesn&#x27;t hold that much product and when I promptly received the order, I noticed the fluid was a little below the bottom of the cap.  </li>
            <li>I tried this one first from one of the major sites promotion was not very satisfied when I found out the price they would be charging me!!</li>

            <li> It keeps my face feeling fresh and firm all day.</li>
            <li> After placing several orders through Amazon.com over the holidays, Amazon (at least I assume it was Amazon) offered me a free gift: a choice of three or four products, one of which was Auravie beauty products.  </li>
            <li> I first started using this product a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> On the downside, the bottle doesn&#x27;t hold that much product and when I promptly received the order, I noticed the fluid was a little below the bottom of the cap.  </li>
            <li> I tried this one first from one of the major sites promotion was not very satisfied when I found out the price they would be charging me!!</li>
            <li> Not one of the compliments&lt;br /&gt;I have been given in the past -- and now I am 76 years old!!!!</li>
            <li> so I am anxious to try it very soon..</li>
            <li> Just this week, there was a second charge of $97.88 apparently to a business called &amp;#34;ANTIAGE.&amp;#34;  I tried to contact both of these places by phone, and on the other end of the line was a recording which told me to &amp;#34;Press 1 for Mask.&amp;#34;  I had to cancel my debit card to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li> Visible results in not too long at all...</li>
            <li> first its a scam, and second it makes break outs worse.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Serum&amp;#34; is the secret to success.</li>
            <li> This revive makes my skin feel tighter and wrinkles less apparent.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> As long as they keep stocking it, I&#x27;ll keep buying!</li>
            <li> I found the link to an internet promotion for the product (that was not their actual website) browsing on social network websites and Autofill the blank fields for address, email (like I did for this complaint and all my internet business) and credit card information.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate - cold in winter, hot in summer.  </li>
            <li> Previous orders did not prove it to work on my skin, so sent back for refunds</li>
            <li> However, it can give a slightly &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feels after it is dry.  </li>
            <li> see my other review) before hand.</li>
            <li> But can find other products at Walgreens</li>
            <li> I had used this product in the past and have recently received another shipment-</li>
            <li> works extremely well to improve wrinkles and areas of dryness.</li>
            <li> Is a little sticky until completely dry.  </li>
            <li> While on the phone with the representative I could hear other reps on the phone with people who were calling with the same complaint I had.  </li>
            <li> When she complained she didn&#x27;t know why she was charged on her credit card for a product she didn&#x27;t order,  her credit card company and AuraVie refused to back out the charges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps my face moisturized without any heavy build-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few over the years.</li>
            <li> I also had a shock when my credit card got charged and another round of products showed up, but it was my fault for not watching closely and paying attention to the details of the sample offer.  </li>
            <li> I received an Ad for skincare products from AuraVie Skincare for a trial sample if you answered a few survey questions.</li>
            <li> and there is a visible difference in how firm my face looks after using it.  </li>
            <li> It also had a rather plain smell, not perfumed.</li>
            <li> It helps eliminate small wrinkles and tighten and tone skin.</li>
            <li> I have an issue with oily skin and have a very hard time finding product that won&#x27;t make my face extremely oily.</li>
            <li> DURING OUR SLOWED ECONOMY PLEASE PLEASE SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED DOLLARS.</li>
            <li> I was told it was too late</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s never too late.  </li>
            <li> I was told it was too late</li>
            <li> This serum has a subtle, but repulsive smell.</li>
            <li> Also, a little expensive.</li>
            <li> It is sad that we fall prey to these companies that don&#x27;t thrive on quality but instead on misleading customers.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t base your decision on grumpy consumers who felt cheated.  </li>
            <li> BAD PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After you press the Order button you are in for a horrible ride in their world of legaly stealing money from you by their hiding the Terms and Condition of what is</li>
            <li> I found the customer person argumentative, insulting and demeaning.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product, have been using it for 1 year and my skin looks great, get lots of compliments</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love it and will keep buying as long as I can find it!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly  smelled fresh  works well for my skin this is my 3 rd bottle</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this product.  I used it before then ran out and stopped.  I like how my skin feels with this so I ordered it again.  The price was good and it came to my house quickly.</li>
            <li> Ultra light. Keeps my face moisturized without any heavy build-up. Quickly absorbed into skin. Excellent for all skin types, especially for oily, problematic skin. Can be used under foundation, with smooth results and no cakiness.  I HIGHLY recommend using the renewal peel (miracle product--see my other review) before hand. Bought for around $12---a steal.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast affordable product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but heard it has good results so I am anxious to try it very soon..</li>
            <li> My mother gave me this product to try.  It was okay,  not as hydrating as I would have hoped and caused my forehead to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger problem was she was tricked into buying it ( two products ) for over $89.00.  It was labeled on amazon as&lt;br /&gt;a &amp;#34;trial sized offer&amp;#34;,  the price was in NOT IN WRITING ANYWHERE.  When she complained she didn&#x27;t know why she was charged on her credit card for a product she didn&#x27;t order,  her credit card company and AuraVie refused to back out the charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of this product.  There are many complaints about them online..</li>
            <li> I love all of AuraVie products, I love the smell, very clean and fresh. Try it, I really think you will like it.</li>
            <li> I was getting those turkey neck lines until I started using this product. One small drop every day massaging it in for 30 seconds is all it took to make my face and neck smooth again. I love this product.</li>
            <li> There is no \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; skin care product.  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few over the years. Rhonda Allison; Love My Body; Dermalogica; etc... I live in a dry climate - cold in winter, hot in summer.  I&#x27;ve fought adult acne during my hormone cycles. I don&#x27;t wear make-up. I&#x27;ve tried Botox once.  I saw the free sample ad for this product and went for it.  I also had a shock when my credit card got charged and another round of products showed up, but it was my fault for not watching closely and paying attention to the details of the sample offer.  I cancelled my order with the parent company, and it was no big deal.  Now I purchase the products on Amazon.  I use all 3 - cleanser, serum, and moisturizer.  I go through the serum twice as fast as the cleanser and moisturizer.  I use it on my neck, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face it, good skin care products aren&#x27;t cheap, so I&#x27;m grateful I found one that works for me.  My skin looks good and feels good (I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and looking 10-15 yrs younger without make up!).  Don&#x27;t base your decision on grumpy consumers who felt cheated.  If nothing else has worked for you, I&#x27;d give this one a try. It&#x27;s not a time consuming regimen, either. It&#x27;s also cheaper than a lot of stuff out there as you search for the fountain of youth!</li>
            <li> This serum is light and it goes on smoothly to the skin.  However, it can give a slightly &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feels after it is dry.  I like to use it mainly because of the excellent results of AuraVie&#x27;s Purifying Cleanser Toner Gel.  The CLEANSER does a great job at cleaning the facial skin while leaving the skin with a soft and smooth feels.  This cleanser is the only cleanser I have tried so far that resulted in noticeable reduction of pores and acne formation.</li>
            <li> This product works.  my skin looks younger and feels good!&lt;br /&gt; I would recomend it a fast and easy cleaning routine!</li>
            <li> I ordered a complete set for my niece and this product was being used up fast so I reordered this one bottle for her to use.  She has started using the system about a month ago and is seeing a large difference in her face.  I also use myself and love it.</li>
            <li> I see the result.&lt;br /&gt;Do not wait to see it.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend my mother&#x27;s age adult. over 80th.&lt;br /&gt;She like the product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a thing to my skin.  And it&#x27;s a SCAM!! Don&#x27;t fall for the survey offering free trial!</li>
            <li> I admit that I fell for the \\&quot;pay only shipping\\&quot; scam and actually payed $98 for this product. After attempting to return it to no avail and having the customer service representative tell me this type of advertising and withdrawing $100 per month is actually both legal and ethical, I thought I would give it a try because it was already paid for. There is nothing luxurious or replenishing about this product. My 10 dollar bottle of Kiss My Face or aveeno is significantly more hydrating and cleansing. It is sad that we fall prey to these companies that don&#x27;t thrive on quality but instead on misleading customers.</li>
            <li> I received an Ad for skincare products from AuraVie Skincare for a trial sample if you answered a few survey questions. The offer implied a chance to try the products for the cost of shipping. I was later billed for approx. $98 and sent a 2nd shipment also billed to my credit card for $98+. I contacted customer service and told them I hadn&#x27;t had time to try the first sample as I&#x27;d been on vacation. I was told it was too late and I was responsible. They also claimed that I should have read the fine print that I&#x27;d signed up to receive monthly shipments at this rate. After complaining and telling the person I&#x27;d return the shipment &amp; dispute the charges he agreed to waive the restocking cost but said I couldn&#x27;t dispute the fees for the sample shipment because I was beyond 30 days. I found the customer person to be argumentative.  (I noticed on my credit card statement they bill under the name SKINREN).  I believe Amazon should stop offering their products.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product a few months ago.  I am very happy with how easily it soaks into my skin without making it &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;.  I keeps my face looking fresh and young.  Fine lines have improved.  It also had a rather plain smell, not perfumed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the BEST EVER!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It helps my brown spots to lighten up! I need to use it more! Kind of expensive on my budjet.</li>
            <li> I can see a visible difference in my skin immediately after using this product.  Skin texture also improves by following up with the moisturizing cream.  I have ordered this product twice.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!! first its a scam, and second it makes break outs worse. I used it twice before deciding to toss it. BAD PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I saw their ad on an article on-line.  I provided credit card number to cover $4.95 for shipping of what I understood to be a sample of their product.  I started receiving the product on a monthly basis and my credit card was billed $97.88 for each shipment.  I called them to dispute the monthly charges and receipt of products I did NOT order.  I was advised that there was a disclaimer on the ad that stated I understood I would be shipped the product monthly and charged accordingly.  This is a disclaimer I never saw!  While on the phone with the representative I could hear other reps on the phone with people who were calling with the same complaint I had.  The representative gave me a cancellation number and agreed to the return of ONE OF TWO SHIPMENTS; however, my refund would be $83.20, not $97.88 as there would be a restocking fee.  Also, I would be required to send them an email stating I would not pursue any disputes or further action.  Otherwise, the deal was off!  They are scammers and con artists.  DON&#x27;T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID.</li>
            <li> It was ok. But can find other products at Walgreens</li>
            <li> it really works.  Since I have used it, for about 6 months, friends have told me that I have beautiful skin.  Not one of the compliments&lt;br /&gt;I have been given in the past -- and now I am 76 years old!!!! Well, it&#x27;s never too late.  I recommend Auravie highly!!!</li>
            <li> RUN FOR YOU LIFE.....Do NOT GIVE CREDIT INFORMATION.&lt;br /&gt;We bought into the scam and now we are entangled in trying to get Discover to give us our money back. Headache, nightmare!</li>
            <li> AuraVie has great products. I would recommend them to everyone</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keeps my face feeling fresh and firm all day. A great wrinkle reducer</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have used in firming up the face.  I use it every time I put my make up on and there is a visible difference in how firm my face looks after using it.  Love the product.  A must for women who care.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Aura Vie makes it money by offering something enticing at a low cost.  Then you give them your CC info.  After you press the Order button you are in for a horrible ride in their world of legaly stealing money from you by their hiding the Terms and Condition of what is is you actually agreed to.  DO not reward this company.</li>
            <li> Previous orders did not prove it to work on my skin, so sent back for refunds</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and it has worked very well.  The products are easy to use and very reasonably priced, at least through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this every day very good.</li>
            <li> This serum has a subtle, but repulsive smell. I couldn&#x27;t stand putting it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful buying this product if they offer too good of a deal. This company may offer a great deal up front, but later charge your credit card $97 and hope you don&#x27;t notice.&lt;br /&gt;Just a warning. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> At my age I have tried many products for my skin..I tried this one first from one of the major sites promotion was not very satisfied when I found out the price they would be charging me!! I looked on Amazon and sure enough it was listed! Now I can order it and save money at the same time..I use all 3 products of this brand and am really happy with the results-it helps with the dryness, the wrinkles and cleansing..</li>
            <li> Too expensive but worth it! I bought this item before from the originsl web site n its alot more... So i was looking for coupons or a better deal and i found it</li>
            <li> I received the purchase on time and in perfect condition from this seller, I love this product, thank you</li>
            <li> ONLY LASER OR A FACE LIFT CAN GIVE YOU THE RESULTS THIS PRODUCT CLAIMS. DURING OUR SLOWED ECONOMY PLEASE PLEASE SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED DOLLARS. $$$$$$$$$$ $75.00 BUCKS COULD BRING HOME A LOT OF BACON.</li>
            <li> This is the youth serum. It helps eliminate small wrinkles and tighten and tone skin. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> After placing several orders through Amazon.com over the holidays, Amazon (at least I assume it was Amazon) offered me a free gift: a choice of three or four products, one of which was Auravie beauty products.  I was told during this process that I ONLY had to pay $5 for shipping.  So I chose Auravie.  A month later, I see a charge for $97.88 on my checking account (I had used my debit card).  The name of the business listed there was REFRESH with an 877 phone number.  Just this week, there was a second charge of $97.88 apparently to a business called &amp;#34;ANTIAGE.&amp;#34;  I tried to contact both of these places by phone, and on the other end of the line was a recording which told me to &amp;#34;Press 1 for Mask.&amp;#34;  I had to cancel my debit card to get rid of them.  Don&#x27;t fall for the &amp;#34;Free Gift from Amazon&amp;#34; line!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for their free trial offer, this does not exist. They will charge your account $97.88. When you call to dispute this no one will answer the phone number provided. I called and canceled my order within 10 days like they said and they still charged me, so i called and canceled again hoping they will get the message. Also filed dispute with my bank concerning this.And will call BBB.</li>
            <li> This product does seem to tighten the skin almost after the first use.  I would definitely recommend this product for reducing fine wrinkles and with a moisturizer improves the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> It was on time and I love the product!!!! Great job</li>
            <li> This revive makes my skin feel tighter and wrinkles less apparent. I use day and night and love love this product</li>
            <li> This serum works wonders.  Leaves skin soft and smooth.  Is a little sticky until completely dry.  Don&#x27;t give up on it, you will definitely see results.</li>
            <li> Insisting on a certain amount of words makes me not want to  write the review  once what you&#x27;ve said what you think it&#x27;s should be all you need.</li>
            <li> love this product.  Have used it often and works well for face and neck.</li>
            <li> I had used this product in the past and have recently received another shipment- forgot how much I liked it in combination with the toning cleanser gel and moisturizer- works extremely well to improve wrinkles and areas of dryness.</li>
            <li> I tried this first time through the &amp;#34;free offer&amp;#34; that others have commented about.  I ran out of the first bottle and for several months used something else.  Then, recalling how I liked this particular product, I bought it again via Amazon.  Within a day or two my fine, and not so fine facial lines, diminished again.  Yes, feels a little sticky when you put it on but dries quickly leaving a smooth matte.  On the downside, the bottle doesn&#x27;t hold that much product and when I promptly received the order, I noticed the fluid was a little below the bottom of the cap.  I brought this to the vendor&#x27;s attention as a FYI and they promptly sent me another bottle.  I call that excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> I received an Ad for skincare products from AuraVie Skincare for a trial sample. The offer implied a chance to try the products for the cost of shipping.  I was later billed for approx. $97 and sent a 2nd shipment also billed to my credit card for $97+.  I contacted customer service and told them I hadn&#x27;t had time to try the first sample as I&#x27;d been on vacation.  I was told it was too late and I was responsible.  They also claimed that I should have read the fine print that I&#x27;d signed up to receive monthly shipments at this rate.  After complaining and telling the person I&#x27;d return the shipment &amp; dispute the charges he agreed to waive the restocking cost but said I couldn&#x27;t dispute the fees for the sample shipment because I was beyond 30 days.  I found the customer person argumentative, insulting and demeaning.  I finally hung up rather than argue with him or hear further demeaning comments. (I noticed on my credit card statement they bill under the name MYSKIN 8777437943 CA)</li>
            <li> I found the link to an internet promotion for the product (that was not their actual website) browsing on social network websites and Autofill the blank fields for address, email (like I did for this complaint and all my internet business) and credit card information. I received the product and my card was charged indicating that the Autofill worked correctly although, I did not received a confirmation email,  or an email reflecting conditions of purchase or any other communication that represented the &amp;#34;contract&amp;#34; agreed upon between the company and myself when I  filled the internet order. I was charged a 97.88$ by SKINCRE on 01/15/14 (13 days after the first charge) and called the number provided by my online bank statement which was the only way I could communicate with the company since I used up the product and discarded the bottle (I was not planning on reordering it). I recorded my conversations with Sky (ID #355) and Jonathan (ID#305) who respectively offered 35 and 50% of the product but would not refund me for the full amount that I asked for. Indeed, I never received my copy of the sale contract or any other documentation bearing the conditions of purchase or even the necessary information to cancel my trial period therefore, I ask for a full refund of the 97.88$.&lt;br /&gt;Julie Della-Maria</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job! I just wish it was a bit stronger !! All in All its a very good product !</li>
            <li> it is the best that I have ever used it make your face look good and feel good I will keep buying AuraVie</li>
            <li> It does help the appearance of a tighter skin.  After you put moisturizer on, it deflates the tightness and your make-up does not look so good.  I would recommend trying it.  Also, a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried a &amp;#34;trial offer&amp;#34; directly from the AuraVie com., and was almost conned into paying $100.00 per month for same 3 products you can buy here for $30.00. I had to return the &amp;#34;risk-free trial&amp;#34; products, but not before I had the chance to use them. The cleanser and toner made an immediate difference in my skin; pores reduced, texture smoother and clearer. So glad I found this on Amazon at a reasonable price. As long as they keep stocking it, I&#x27;ll keep buying! No noticeable difference with the moisturizer, however. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
            <li> Just two weeks, you can see the skin brighter and wrinkles were significantly reduced, highly recommended AuraVie Serum, I  continue to use it now  more than a year.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome</li>
            <li> It works, tightens and smooths..</li>
            <li> It does tighten the skin &amp; pores.  It doesn&#x27;t make you years younger  though.</li>
            <li> The three part AuraVie system is the most effective skin care system I&#x27;ve ever used. Visible results in not too long at all...The &amp;#34;Serum&amp;#34; is the secret to success.</li>
            <li> Very pleased in fact I need to reorder!</li>
            <li> Product is great and I received it right away!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have an issue with oily skin and have a very hard time finding product that won&#x27;t make my face extremely oily. This goes on light and doesn&#x27;t make it oily.</li>
            <li> I had used this before, ran out and now I am using again.My face &amp;  neck feel smooth , firmer and beginning to diminish my fine lines.  I love how my face feels CLEAN AND FRESH, not oily as with some other products I have used.</li>
            <li> Love these products. Face feels and looks fresher. I buy regularly.</li>
