            <li>Best rosehip oil out there:))</li>
            <li>Loving it!</li>
            <li>but I knew to expect that, nice amber color, like it should be!</li>
            <li>Feels nice on my hands too!</li>
            <li>I thought it would have a beautiful rose smell...</li>
            <li>Great stuff love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO happy I found this amazing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge bottle and a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>This is a great oil for a amazing price.</li>
            <li>😊😊😊 turning 70 in July and feeling good looking.</li>
            <li>I have used that oil at my friend house before I order mine  and loved it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I have been using this oil on my face since I have read that it is good for aging skin.  </li>
            <li>But I still had some problems with breakouts/blackheads,since I had good results with the rosehip oil</li>
            <li>Rose hip oil is a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>and I still thought it was good.  </li>
            <li>I thought the no color or odor was good, but in my research, I see that good quality rosehip  oil is a yellow-orange color</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good oil to use on my face after moisturizer</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll enjoy it too :D</li>
            <li>Well, good thing I found this stuff.</li>
            <li>I immediately loved how it felt on my skin</li>
            <li>Product is of good quality.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and my skin looks and feels wonderful without being overly oily.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Rosehip oil because I had read that it&#x27;s good for removing spots.</li>
            <li>good price</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>which is good if you are wanting to prevent water loss (preventing water loss is how occulise ingredients like vaseline and oil moisturize).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>It feels so good on your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin have never felt or looked this good.</li>
            <li>Radha Rosehip Oil is so good for my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip Oil feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>NOTHING HAS EVER MADE MY SKIN FEEL THIS GOOD.  </li>
            <li>Great product in a nice bottle.</li>
            <li>Would order again, really good product, made my face firmer</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a good skin care product to help with my dehydrated face.</li>
            <li>Its good for my hair but no changes on skin.</li>
            <li>But she loved it to minimize wrinkles.</li>
            <li>good product for rashes and summer mishaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been blessed with good genes and my skin has never presented a problem to me.</li>
            <li>Another one of my good to luxurious oils</li>
            <li>Does not work well for my fair, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Packing was good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good all purpose oil for cleansing and moisturizing skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>This oil feels good on my skin, but have not seen any result yet.  </li>
            <li>The value is good for bottle size.  </li>
            <li>Wrapped up with care, which was good because it it a glass bottle.</li>
            <li>Good lesson learned.</li>
            <li>So good</li>
            <li>A good product which does what it promises.  </li>
            <li>Awesome substitute for chemical filled moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Either way, I feel more beautiful every day that I wear this.</li>
            <li>This is a very rich luxurious oil beautifully packaged.</li>
            <li>Really Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;First of all the prompt service was great and packaged perfectly.  </li>
            <li>but I am a loyal user of all of the Radha beauty line, and I do purchase as well as will continue to purchase this great line for years to come!</li>
            <li>I am super impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful on my skin and has a pleasing mild scent.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, lightweight, absorbs quickly, non greasy, no smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used an oil on my face, so I can&#x27;t compare to others but my experience with this product has been exceptional.  </li>

            <li>Definitely great value for the money, because this is one of the best facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li>From everything I&#x27;ve learned about rosehip seed oil it should have a warm amber or tangerine color to it.</li>
            <li>I rub it on my palms to warm it</li>
            <li>It glides on nice and has a nice feel.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell too.  </li>
            <li>Have noticed a lot of skin moisturizing products with rose hip oil.</li>
            <li>I have heard about the healing properties of rose hips but never tried it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the kind of product that appeals to me.</li>
            <li>This rose</li>
            <li>My skin lovingly eats it up and the smell vanishes before I leave the house in the morning.</li>
            <li>I am 57 and have just added rose hip to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>Rose hip extract oil makes skin supple immediately....</li>
            <li>for  a  honest  review</li>
            <li>It is really nice</li>
            <li>The package is also nice, feels quality.</li>
            <li>It has a nice texture, seems to moisturize nicely.</li>
            <li>but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of oil this is, but what I got was not rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>I decided to go to Whole Foods and just purchase some there, that rosehip oil did not freeze and is working perfectly.</li>
            <li>This appears to not be rose hip oil.</li>
            <li>though that would be nice.</li>
            <li>My sister&#x27;s hairdresser introduced her to Rose oil to soothe hand and foot nail cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I find that kind of testimonial a bit suspect</li>
            <li>I find that kind of testimonial a bit suspect</li>
            <li>and this makes it feel really nice.</li>
            <li>After some &#x27;googling&#x27; I read that rose</li>
            <li>Smells somewhat neutral with a hint of rose.</li>
            <li>Nice oil.  </li>
            <li>RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>from what I have witnessed with my own skin in just 5 days I do believe the product will make a noticeable difference on these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but opinion is my own ...</li>
            <li>It has been working so well for my eczema as well as just giving my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li>This companies Rose</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best product I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Rosehip oil for years to help maintain my skin and am absolutely loving this brand.</li>
            <li>Feels so silky and yet not greasy because it soaks in so nicely.</li>
            <li>SO IT WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE I FIND THE RESULTS ABOUT THE ROSE HIP SERUM.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has no smell, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I just started using my rose hip oil.</li>
            <li>I am loving this product.  </li>
            <li>my wife love this she use it after showering on her face and elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;(got a good discount on this item)</li>
            <li>I even use it to make my own body butters.</li>
            <li>I opened it up and immediately liked the smell.</li>
            <li>I got this, some rose water and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>; I REVEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>Has no smell to it which i liked.</li>
            <li>Really nice oil.  </li>
            <li>Oh and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I loved more.  </li>
            <li>I GOT THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  </li>
            <li>(To be fair, I have an extremely acute sense of smell, so a lot of things that bother me wouldn&#x27;t even register to most people.)  </li>
            <li>Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>I am totally loving this oil.</li>
            <li>and I honestly like this oil.</li>
            <li>I mix my own cleansing/nourishing oil for my face.</li>
            <li>It has almost no scent which is a nice surprise as rose oil can be a bit pungent.  </li>
            <li>my skin just absorbs the rose hip oil.  </li>
            <li>honestly, it kind of smelled of smells &amp;#34;earthy.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>and I am really loving it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never purchased rose hip oil before but, considering what it is supposed to look and smell like</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think what I received is rose hip oil.  </li>
            <li>Really good results.:-)</li>
            <li>But I wish it would have a stronger rose fragrance</li>
            <li>Amazing, extremely fast shipping and product arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>One of their representative also contacted me to see how I liked it as a follow up to the purchase.</li>
            <li>Communication from seller was superb and the package was packed very well.</li>
            <li>It adds a nice amount of cover without being overly greasy.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my face and it gives me a nice glow</li>
            <li>So when I read about rose hip oil I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I gave her some rose oil and now she uses it as well.</li>
            <li>I have been using rose hip oils for 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Asorbs nicely into the skin with no oily residue.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a nice sheen on my fingernails too.</li>
            <li>Rosehip sounds like rose smell, but rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m loving it already.</li>
            <li>I had read Rosehip Oil was good for your hair, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how mine would react.</li>
            <li>Amazon shipping is the issue and they damaged the metal bottle on one, but this is a nice bottle and glass dropper.</li>
            <li>Nice to see a product deliver as advertised.</li>
            <li>but I am already loving it.</li>
            <li>Nice moisture---recommended for aging skin</li>
            <li>I really liked the bottle.</li>
            <li>I am loving this Rosehip Oil from Radha.</li>
            <li>The oil itself has a nice thickness to it, I use it for my knees and ankles</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast and packing great!</li>
            <li>oil is really nice</li>

            <li>Absolutely amazing, quick shipping and beautiful bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use regular moisturizer anymore, and the best part is being able to apply makeup over the oil!!</li>
            <li>normally I get good deals on good products but this one is the motherload of great deals</li>
            <li>The packaging is also beautiful, I love leaving it out on my countertop to enjoy.</li>

            <li>and I first gave it 5 stars because it seemed good.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty good ND</li>
            <li>1) When people ask if oil might be good to add to their skin care routine, I always ask if they would be willing to put olive oil on their face.</li>
            <li>pretty good i will be buying this again and again</li>
            <li>Best of all, it is so gentle and non-greasy, sinking in fully within an hour; I use it on my young children&#x27;s faces and hands as well as my own.</li>
            <li>It absorbed very nicely and quickly into her skin.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find a cold-pressed, organic oil to try with NO added fragrance!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not completely disappointed!</li>
            <li>Its organic, very light, observe quickly, non sticky!</li>
            <li>Great customer service, cruelty free and high quality!  </li>
            <li>Also, the huge amount of this oil make me love it even more.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s nice, light and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Radha Beauty products have such great products,&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil feels so nice,</li>
            <li>I make my own facial products and this is a great oil to buy.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth and order free.</li>
            <li>Great product so far!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve heard that this is a great oil for rejuvenating the skin cells, let&#x27;s just say I haven&#x27;t been told I look old!</li>
            <li>I just started using it but have been happy with the results so far!  </li>

            <li>I thought the Ebook was a very good extra item.</li>
            <li>Great light oil but very moisturizing, saw noticeable reductions in fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin really smooth and has been improving the appearance of my scars, but that will take more time I think</li>
            <li>I very happy with this product which was packaged well and delivered as expected.</li>
            <li>but more importantly I like the oil on my face.  </li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>If you want to moisturize your lips, shea butter is the best possible balm I&#x27;ve found (mix it with powdered stevia extract and peppermint or sweet orange oil for flavor and sweetness.)</li>
            <li>My skin looks great not to mention my hair is soft and shinny after washing the oil out.</li>
            <li>I make sure to tightly secure the cap and store my bottle in the refrigerator door.</li>
            <li>So soft, silky and great feeling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavier than I expected which is a great thing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely and light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I use it under my makeup and it gives such a beautiful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love</li>
            <li>This is my first time using rosehip oil and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am about to re-order because it dramatically extended the life of my moisturizer, eliminated a need for serums, and is overall an incredible value.  </li>
            <li>so glad that I got to try it out for free because otherwise I probably never would&#x27;ve given it a chance.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel smooth and look healthy.</li>
            <li>I was able to use this product for free so I can try it out.  </li>
            <li>I know many people under value Certified Organic products, but when looking for oils it&#x27;s is so important to buy organic.</li>
            <li>But this brand, this brand is great (so far).</li>
            <li>For me this is a really healing oil and it is loaded with nutrients that are so good for a person.</li>
            <li>Well, this is the way it is, &amp;  a lot of the chemicals in lotions, etc aren&#x27;t really all that good for you,&amp; some are even known to cause cancer, etc..</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I bought some for my mom, as well.</li>
            <li>It appears that this Radha Beauty Rosehip Oil is doing an excellent job of calming this rash down (redness has gone in most areas) and in some areas it looks to be gone.).</li>
            <li>This product has a very light color and doesn&#x27;t have the unique smell of rosehip oil, which some people wouldn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>It sinks in wonderfully and even though it has a scent, it disappears very quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, smells nice.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft which is very nice . . .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about what I&#x27;ll put on my face and this is very nice and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin react.  </li>
            <li>When I got the oil I was excited to try something so inventive.</li>
            <li>There are so many benefits to using Rose Hip Seed Oil on your skin, and this one is of very high quality.  </li>
            <li>I break out easily so adding oils to my face wasn&#x27;t something i had thought of doing</li>
            <li>Absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>it came with a dropper to make it easy to get the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>

            <li>The oil absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>First off, don&#x27;t expect it to smell like roses; it has a unique, pleasant scent and a rich color.</li>
            <li>great product, I read reviews before buying it, and it actually works, am glad I found this product before the winters</li>
            <li>Really repairs my skin, keeps it soft and is great on my face to my heels!</li>
            <li>And I revived my order very quickly too.  </li>
            <li>and it is really easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this great organic Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li>so the smell didn&#x27;t seem so strong.  </li>

            <li>hands down Radha has the best products</li>

            <li>Smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Using on exzema, fine wrinkles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>however it drys just fine..</li>
            <li>I had been perusing an older book I have, by a very reputable &amp; successful man who makes natural and organic hair &amp; skin products.</li>
            <li>It has brightened my face and gotten rid of fine lines forming under my eyes, around my eyes, and on my brow.</li>
            <li>I feel it has helped a lot with fine lines and works well as a moisturizer leaving no greasy feeling .</li>
            <li>/&gt; Treats fine lines and wrinkles  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has become a lot smoother and my acne scars are disappearing more quickly since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li>A literal transformation before my eyes with how quickly it seems to be working!    </li>
            <li>I love that it soaks in to your skin quickly leaving a non greasy feeling.  </li>

            <li>Came quickly and packaged well!</li>
            <li>While I have to wonder if this indicates that a lot of the good stuff has been stripped out in the processing, it works so nicely that I don&#x27;t wonder for long.</li>
            <li>Might I add that I&#x27;ve used another brand of rose hip oil that claimed to be 100% pure but was scented with rose oil or something to make it smell pretty but wasn&#x27;t listed as an ingredient) and caused me to breakout.</li>
            <li>Goes on very light, applies easily and absorbs right away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-It helps to smooth my fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know that reviews are very important to sellers and if possible I will change this and give five stars if you can convince me that no color and no odor is a good thing in rosehip oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE IT the REAL DEAL!!</li>
            <li>Love it so much and wish I knew of it 10 years ago!!</li>
            <li>I am a 42 year old woman with fair skin, fine lines, and crows feet.</li>
            <li>Huge ounce and 100% rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since placed an order with a national, reputable brand of organic, cold-pressed rosehip seed oil, one that has both the distinct color and smell of genuine rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my face morning and night and have noticed a HUGE difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li>The best thing though, my 2 kids rub their faces against my 43 year old face, and they purr with delight how soft it is.</li>
            <li>At 4 ounces, this bottle is comparatively HUGE by comparison for the price and</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge deal as I can still get out oil in a somewhat controlled manner but a functional dropper would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes in a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>have no illusions that if I stopped using the product things would revert to normal, but consistent use yields great results.  </li>
            <li>but it is already making a huge difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>Huge bottle.</li>
            <li>The bottle was also huge.</li>
            <li>This oil make your skin smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product to use with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It feels light on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Its</li>
            <li>it smells just like rosehips is supposed to lightly nutty.</li>
            <li>The oil I received had a light greenish/gray tint to it which tells me it was NOT rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li>fast.the smell is tolerable and fades when product has been absorbed by the skin and even if i use it under my make up it doesnt make my face oily but with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the oil for about a week and it seems great.</li>
            <li>Makes a great carrier oil for some healing essential oils too.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for an amazing product</li>
            <li>The quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a secure package in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>Probably a combination of soy, rapeseed and cheap olive oil.  </li>
            <li>What a  FABULOUS OIL.  </li>
            <li>This is a great facial moisturizer.</li>

            <li>&amp;#34; I wanna say thank you for the seller for the free samples.</li>
            <li>I purchased it to keep on hand for when I ran out of my current Rosehip oil which I purchased at a great price on another online store.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s light and it absorbs into the skin immediately.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent.</li>
            <li>The rosehip oil goes on the skin smoothly and doesn’t leave my skin greasy after.</li>
            <li>Where the Sukin immediately absorbed into my skin leaving it glowing and moisturized, the Radha sits on top of my skin leaving it oily and glossy.</li>
            <li>Yes I got a coupon for a free product for review</li>

            <li>Cheap eye dropper.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this Rosehip oil on my face and hands.</li>
            <li>Rosehip seed oil is great for overall body moisturizing (not greasy) and also face cleansing.</li>
            <li>So happy that I found Rosehip Oil &amp; is now part of my daily anti aging beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to mix in with essential oils and use as a face cream.  </li>
            <li>think this is fantastic</li>
            <li>This would be a great carrier oil to add some therapeutic, healing essential oils to for skin</li>
            <li>received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>and I will be using my own products as much as I can.</li>
            <li>The product is fresh, it&#x27;s authentic, and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li>Light smell just started using it</li>
            <li>As a result, my skin is always smooth and luminous.</li>
            <li>This rosehip oil is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and softer.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the information booklet that was emailed to me about the rose hip oil.</li>
            <li>such a great product.</li>
            <li>i got this product for free to review</li>
            <li>Orde free.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s leak free.</li>
            <li>10 star all the way,,,,,its fantastic</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d like to warn others if they receive a light colored, basically unscented oil in a brown bottle, to just return it.  </li>
            <li>one is light color with nutty smell( this company) - no problem</li>
            <li>and if there is, it&#x27;s extremely light.</li>
            <li>This way the oil is absorbed into the skin better.</li>
            <li>Skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m applying it to my face to help smooth my skin and soothe rosacea.  </li>
            <li>Rose hip oil comes from the seeds of a specific variety of rose, Rosa aff. rubiginosa or Rosa moschata.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>; So far so good using it on my face under my moisturizer mornings and evenings.</li>
            <li>So far, so good though.</li>
            <li>So far is good.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on smoothly, and stays fresh looking for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>I love all kinds of facial oils, and this a another good one.</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell results, however so far so good.  </li>
            <li>For those rave reviews that state this is wonderful facial oil, I can only wonder if these people 1) Are real users of this oil; 2) Are familiar with authentic rosehip seed oil; 3) Are getting good results because its an oil and any natural oil is good for the face.</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil absorbs right into the hair, making my hair shinier, softer, and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Works beautifully on my über dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time purchasing/using rosehip oil, so I have nothing to compare but this oil soaks into my skin nicely and has no unpleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>I mix an essential oil for nerve repair in with it, it&#x27;s lovely!!</li>
            <li>The blue tinted bottle is also very nice because I can leave it sitting on the counter</li>
            <li>Smells very fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Free and WORTH it!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the results so far and plan on continuing the routine!</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a good skin product for my sensitive skin because it has no fillers of any kind!</li>
            <li>Blends well with all my EOs for a wonderful and highly absorbable facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>So fresh, nourishing, mild and lovely.</li>
            <li>It is a light, easily and quickly absorbed oil.</li>
            <li>The Radha brand is great—cold-pressed for maximum vitamins, very handy dropper, really gorgeous thick blue glass bottle that makes me feel good every time I see it on the shelf.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Radha, for the opportunity to try such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>Big fan of this rose hip oil!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to add this to my collection of oils.</li>
            <li>Radha Soami means &amp;#34;Lord of the Soul&amp;#34;, a term I am familiar with on my meditation path.</li>
            <li>I have continued to use it and with each passing day my facial skin looks so much better, it has a healthy glow, my complexion is more even toned and it feels softer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy my rose hip oil from Radha again!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about contact with the seller in sharing information on the many wonderful uses for the essential oils she carries.  </li>
            <li>amazing product, definitely gonna buy again, it makes your skin look more hydratated and smooth</li>
            <li>I was so excited once I received the package.</li>
            <li>I have even used it on a fresh tattoo!  </li>
            <li>I was actually excited when it came.</li>
            <li>Even though I was not sure what to expect upon purchasing this, I am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li>After opening it the first thing I did was smell it and to my surprise it had no scent at all, even after applied to skin it has no scent which I love.</li>
            <li>and I can already tell a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>Not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This may just be the first product which keeps advertised promises:).</li>
            <li>was excited to receive this to test out and review.</li>
            <li>I am excited to add this to my oil regimen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used, and enjoyed the benefits of, other Rose Hip oil, but I love the purity of Radha.</li>
            <li>The important thing is the oil seems nice so far, it takes time to soak in...</li>
            <li>The oil is light, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on clothing or bedding.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Five stars is not enough but that&#x27;s what it when up to, it&#x27;s by far the best</li>
            <li>and if anyone can shed more factual light on the color/odor thing, it would be appreciated.  </li>
            <li>This rosehip oil is an incredible product––it absorbs quickly, so no worries about getting oil on clothing, paper, etc.</li>
            <li>and it left my skin looking amazing and healthy.</li>
            <li>for my dry skin,it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>It is light and non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many bottles of rosehip oil and never have I smelled a more rancid old smell.</li>
            <li>However, I can attest that this oil is light, absorbs quickly and does not leave the skin greasy.</li>
            <li>Also Radha&#x27;s shipping is quick and secure.</li>
            <li>what an amazing product, my skin feels so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I love the smooth feel and fast absorption.  </li>
            <li>What surprised me the most however, was the effect it had on the &amp;#34;coffee stains&amp;#34; on my face and hands, they&#x27;re virtually gone!  </li>
            <li>I am reviewing this product and so far love it!</li>
            <li>My body is so soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li>This oil works miracles to keep them soft and smooth without leaving a greasy residue that makes me feel like I&#x27;m going to slip and fall!!</li>
            <li>Very good product, I wish it was a little thicker.</li>
            <li>Rich, smooth and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>The oil is absorbed into the skin quickly and it wont make you feel greasy!</li>
            <li>I use it on my face right before bed!</li>
            <li>I am reordering product right now!</li>
            <li>Since purchasing, I also learned that rosehip oil is excellent for aging skin and have found that the oil, applied under my eyes, has visibly reduced my fine lines (more so than my expensive cosmetic creams, which I discontinued using while trying the oil).</li>
            <li>and I have problem skin ( usually I have to have oil free products), this product moisturizes without clogging my pores, very good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I use it in my bath and it leaves my skin so soft and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li>IT IS AMAZING, I AM 100 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li>Really amazing for moisture and soft skin.</li>
            <li>So after just a few days I am pretty impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>and I can tell how much I&#x27;m going to love it already.</li>
            <li>so glad I found this product I have suffered with eczema my whole life</li>
            <li>My skin glows creamy with a gentle rosey-ness, and a dewey youthful rounding out of my more angular features is taking place.  </li>
            <li>, compare effects against the outcomes of different products, arrive at conclusions that are fair and balanced.  </li>
            <li>(one was for a friend) and at 4oz they are a good deal, but their only benefit for me, seems to be as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This product is i really need to make my skin healthy.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference, if any yet around my stretch marks or scars, but I have noticed that the skin around the area looks healthier, is better moisturized and softer than it was 5 days ago.</li>
            <li>I am an herbalist and know that this should be a light amber to reddish color and have a distinct aroma.</li>
            <li>A full 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Also, having done comparable reviews on similar products, I see that Radha Rosehip Oil is competitively priced, so it is a good value.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good  about the organic Rosehip Oil.  </li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner, helps with my son&#x27;s eczema a whole lot more than just lotion or creams.</li>
            <li>This is a true head-to-toe product that has a multitude of uses.</li>
            <li>However, the true test will be during the winter months ahead.  </li>
            <li>no breakouts either!My stretch marks(they&#x27;re more than 5 yrs old,so i didnt expect much)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews very often, but this product is everything it says it is and more.  </li>
            <li>So far I am loving this oil.</li>
            <li>Such good oil.</li>
            <li>I cannot discern a smell to the product, but it is a light golden color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle itself was what I consider a full size with a dropper</li>
            <li>and I expect it to last for a good while.</li>
            <li>She said &amp;#34;Rosehip Oil is full of anti oxidants &amp; it works in a cellular level to rejuvenate the skin.</li>
            <li>love how it absorbs in the skin fast &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily.</li>
            <li>I love knowing that I&#x27;m doing something really food for my skin</li>
            <li>Love this so much.</li>
            <li>Sweet baby J...</li>

            <li>I received this oil in good condition and properly packaged.  </li>
            <li>They really, REALLY want customer feedback, which is a sure sign of a company that cares about their products and their customers.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, not bad.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Super good mixed with coconut oil on face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant and using this because I researched that this specific oil is good for stretch marks.</li>
            <li>AFTER I USE UP THE OTHER BOTTLES I HAVE,  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.</li>
            <li>The dropper has been great and mess free.  </li>
            <li>She also finds it very effective in keeping her heels from drying and being rough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49 this year and this plumps up all the fine lines around my eyes and my entire face looks smoother and has a really nice glow.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft and I do believe it&#x27;s helping my fine lines around my eyes the most.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin, Leaves my feet super soft.</li>
            <li>What I ordered is what I got and quickly.</li>

            <li>It does not feel greasy and soaks into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>and it has a mildly fishy odor.</li>

            <li>I told her maybe it was the oil but couldn&#x27;t believe a product worked so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Also, this goes on like an oil, but it does absorb quickly, so it will not leave you feeling or looking oily.</li>
            <li>I add my essential oils to it daily for a perfect moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of your many different types of oils.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making such a great product and for caring about your customers.  </li>
            <li>but it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 6 months pregnant</li>
            <li>This oil, mixed with jojoba oil, makes the perfect facial moisturizer for my sensitive/oily/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It soaked in quickly and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super grateful that I found this...</li>
            <li>I started looking into better options and Rosehip Oil was one of the main things I was seeing.</li>
            <li>Really quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Very nice skin oil, light in color and clear, with barely any scent.</li>
            <li>The dropper is actually very easy to use, and the overall shape of the bottle makes it easy to hold as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both products :)</li>
            <li>I enjoy this oil very much.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend trying it if you haven&#x27;t done so already.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very fast and if you apply it at night, you will wake up with skin smooth like a baby.</li>
            <li>High quality  Rosehip oil for sure.</li>
            <li>I received my Radha Rosehip Oil in a beautiful blue glass bottle with a separate dropper from the cap, the packaging was very professional</li>
            <li>I have used other oils on my face, and this one is, by far, the best I have used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a different brand of rosehip seed oil before and was very pleased with those results, but not these.  </li>
            <li>Very, very orange!</li>
            <li>I received my first bottle from Radha free as a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience after using their product.</li>
            <li>All organic, I am fast becoming a fan of Radha Beauty Products</li>
            <li>Still very pretty.</li>
            <li>My order arrived -securely packed-within the week and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I am just starting to use all natural skin care products on my face and this one does so many good things for your skin</li>
            <li>Nice light oil, absorbs nicely, Organic, and VERY IMPORTANT, NOT tested on animals, and since real rosehip oil is fragrance free this can be mixed with any other of your choice.</li>
            <li>so my tummy had some undesirable looseness that made me feel less physically attractive).  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried Rosehip Oil and so far it seems to work amazingly.</li>
            <li>I opened all 4 and tried them alternately to see if some bottles were as good as the first</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and I didn’t feel a need for moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It absorbed reasonably quickly and I have that dewy skin</li>
            <li>It is super fresh, lightweight, and scent-less.</li>
            <li>very moisturizing and came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m very old, so there&#x27;s no hope for the Grand Canyon-like crevices, which line my face, but Radha Rosehip Oil has lessened the redness, and flakiness.</li>
            <li>This is a very high grade oil that is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00LNOV8JO ORGANIC Rosehip Oil - 4 Ounce &amp;#x2605; 100% Pure USDA Certified Organic &amp;#x2605; BEST MOISTURIZER to heal Dry Skin, Fine Lines, Stretch Marks, Eczema, Acne Scars, &amp; More! &amp;#x2605; Cold Pressed, Virgin Rose hip Seed Oil For Face and Skin &amp;#x2605</li>
            <li>,  I got acne after I used at the first week !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finally starting to love the way my skin looks, and I can&#x27;t wait to see the improvements over time!</li>
            <li>The first day I used this product, I was amazed!</li>
            <li>Thanks Radha Skincare!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for 5 days, but I must say I already love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product,  I can see clear results on my skin!</li>
            <li>Packaging is pretty to boot!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I do a lot  of  work with essential  oils and love this!</li>
            <li>It absorbs wonderfully, has little to no odor, and makes my skin super soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Spots and scars heal MUCH more quickly with the help of rosehip oil, and when I use 1-3 drops in my masks, my skin is always soft and refreshed when I rinse the mask off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old and have very sensitive, fair, combination, and acne-prone skin...</li>
            <li>However, the bottle that I just ordered is very light and clear.  </li>
            <li>With all the benefits of rosehip I was able to retire many of my  chemical ridden store bought lotions and creams and replaced it with this one all natural product.the bottle is a very nice looking dark blue glass and its easily applied with the dropper that comes with it.</li>
            <li>and I am not seeing as much settling and creasing into the fine lines under my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, this oil is a great little</li>
            <li>It works great alone or by adding a few drops to my moisturizer or body lotion.</li>
            <li>It is very silky with a light scent.  </li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of Radha Organic Rosehip oil and it has done some amazing things for my skin.  </li>
            <li>This rosehip oil is amazing, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Even though i&#x27;ve only been using for 3 days now, it&#x27;s amazing how my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>every day for years to calm my skin down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a woman prone to skin damage, I want to say - thank you so much for making this product available....</li>
            <li>The oil soaks into the skin, making your skin very silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>so the oil stays fresh</li>
            <li>I could see my laugh lines start to diminish and</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>In the beginning I added an essential oil like lavender or rose (diluted)</li>
            <li>This bottle is lacking the golden color I&#x27;ve come to expect.</li>
            <li>, never have I ever come across a product that I&#x27;ve put on my face that has had such astounding results.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>After a couple of days I&#x27;m amazed how it was absorbed but not greasy.</li>
            <li>This comes complete with a glass eye dropper which aids in usage of this oil to make sure your recipes are on point.</li>
            <li>My only thought it that 4 ounces is A LOT of rose hip oil.  </li>
            <li>I like to put it on before my makeup because it gives the makeup a fresh dewy look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing has helped moisturize my skin more, and reduce old scars, than this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try it.</li>
            <li>I liked that oil enough to want to re-purchase rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this 4 oz bottle from Radha, and, in comparing the two, I would not go back to Eve Hansen, though I liked that oil, too.  </li>
            <li>though that would be nice.go back to Eve Hansen, though I liked that oil, too.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin feeling smooth but not greasy; I&#x27;ve enjoyed putting it in baths for an extra but of moisture as well as adding it to lotions.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve seen a difference in the reduction of lines, especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried some of the Rosehip oil at a friends house and my skin was immediately more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never shelling out that sort of money again when this product is truly superior, minus the chemical garbage, and does wonders for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using rose water and this this oil kicks up the results an extra notch.</li>
            <li>This far I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li>Not only was the rosehip oil of top quality, It also came with a free book on the benefits of rosehip oil and how to use it.  </li>
            <li>but I may return it and reorder my last rose hip oil purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been using rose hip oil for several years on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>So far I am in love with this product ...</li>
            <li>So far, I love the rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>I used it full strength at first</li>
            <li>I use it at night and my skin looks fresh and plump in the a.m.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if any one of these people commenting have gotten a truly FRESH bottle of Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>#34;what is that musty, fishy smell?&amp;#34; only to conclude that it was my own face.  </li>
            <li>Love this rosehip oil as it makes my skin hydrated &amp; soft and don&#x27;t feel greasy after apply it.  </li>
            <li>If you are a rose hip oil fan you should definitely consider trying this brand.</li>
            <li>&amp;  there is a natural odor with this, though it has so many advantages for your skin, that makes up for that...</li>
            <li>It has no smell on its own, so I can smell whatever Essential oil</li>
            <li>Unless something changes for the worse, I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again, for sure!!!!</li>
            <li>I have just discovered the benefits of using rose oil daily.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have that distinct &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34; smell that rosehip seed oil has.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my face every night and my skin has become so soft, smooth and radiant!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how soft it makes my skin when I mix it with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice dark glass bottle, has a dropper packaged separately, and it shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for an Organic Rosehip Oil to help keep my skin from becoming dry and am so glad I found this.</li>
            <li>It is healing scars pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>It seems a bit oily when you first put it on, but it soaks in the skin quickly so your skin doesn&#x27;t feel all oily.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it smells a little funny (kind of like toasted wood?).</li>
            <li>I was hoping to see a more dramatic difference in my redness, but all in all, it seems great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already using vitamin C serum with hyluronic acid which also good for removing spots and a host of other things.</li>
            <li>must admit I&#x27;m excited to use it every day because I believe it&#x27;s something really helpful and healing for the skin.</li>
            <li>I am sure that it is good for my skin but have not used it long enough to see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Once again, the company is very good to seal the bottle with a screw on lid and provide the extra long dropper to use with the oil.</li>
            <li>nice glass bottle and dropper which makes it easy to not make a mess</li>
            <li>I soaks right it.</li>
            <li>It feels silky and soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>Heard about this company from Banana Blondie and ordered right away.</li>
            <li>although it is an oil.. goes on like silk and absorbs right into skin... leaves skin radiant...</li>
            <li>Could feel and see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>I got my product right on time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a right amount for me.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel refreshed when applied right before bedtime.  </li>
            <li>I put it on skin (elbow and knees) and hair right after I take a shower.</li>
            <li>I was referred to this oil, and I am so glad I did purchase it, it leaves my skin so soft and smooth, it is diminishing my wrinkles at a nice rate, i feel so much better when i use this produce,  there are so many things that u can do with this product,  put a few drops on your hands and rub into your hair after shower, gets rid of Frizz among other things.  </li>
            <li>I most certainly intend to purchase this again, along with the Lavendar, &amp; may even give the new Tea-Tree a try.</li>
            <li>The dropper applicator made it very easy to apply just enough oil to my face.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, I am very cautious on what I put on my face, I dislike products that are very grease and leave my face the same way, but I fell in love with this oil as soon as I tried it</li>
            <li>I am glad that Amazon made we aware of it as I make an oil based facial cream incorporating several oils in a cream base and am very happy to include this wonderful oil.  </li>
            <li>I blend with a few EOs and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>The oil doesn&#x27;t smell or look like the rosehip seed oil I&#x27;ve bought in the past, nor does it have its great results.  </li>
            <li>Came fast in the mail and everything that was said - is true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few days and am loving what I&#x27;m seeing!  </li>
            <li>I am old enough to stop looking for newer, better, latest.  </li>
            <li>After all the great reviews about being great for sensitive skin, this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li>It is so soothing, absorbs quickly, and has made my skin super soft!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting constant compliments on my skin, and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my fine lines around my eyes and the lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>The next day I used just a drop per each area of my face (right cheek, left cheek, forehead, and nose/chin and had great results.</li>
            <li>Even though I have a very dry, allergic and sensitive skin, I am absolutely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>and sure enough it smelled exactly what is should smell like!  </li>
            <li>I already own two other brands but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to receive a coupon to receive this item for free</li>
            <li>last night I rubbed a few drops on the burn and this morning I woke up to a beautiful tan (no peeling!)</li>
            <li>and I think an oil like this will come in handy after the vigorous hand washing and colder dry weather that is bound to happen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a week or so, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Order shipped fast and I received it really quickly.</li>
            <li>I look for products that are natural feeling and work to easy the  aging on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also absorbs super fast.</li>
            <li>The rose hip oil is terrific, and I really like that it is organic and cold-pressed.  </li>
            <li>After a week I just had thoughts how I could live without this oil before!!!</li>
            <li>Very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>So easy and simple for keeping your skin healthy and young!  </li>
            <li>I am a very satidfied customer and would recommend this wonderful oil to anyone looking to add to or remake their current beauty routine into an organic, clean and green routine!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is good for my skin and not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t sink into my skin very fast</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>This product has NO smell, is very light in color, similar to almond oil or something.</li>
            <li>The oil came very fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very reasonably priced for an  orgaic product.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much</li>
            <li>For now, I am impressed with how incredibly soft it leaves my skin without the usual side effects that I typically have with any kind of scented product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used it to cleanse my face (I know adding oil sounds counter-productive, but it is actually really good for skin), used it as a cuticle oil and applied a little bit to the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>The product that I received is the proper clear golden amber color and the scent is strong but sweet which quickly fades away.</li>
            <li>This product is not scented and I was surprised at the huge bottle, which is a colored glass (prevents breakdown of the oil) and comes with a dropper in the lid.</li>
            <li>Glad I got 2 of the big bottles</li>
            <li>Since it was the first time I have bought Rosehip Oil</li>
            <li>My skin becomes much brighter !</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased it</li>
            <li>First off, I will say that this company&#x27;s customer service was as advertised</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Received on time and product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Received my order several days ago and love it.....</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>From the first drop, the improvement to my skin is evident.</li>
            <li>Unadulterated, directly out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>its my first time using it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much I like this stuff !  </li>
            <li>Think it really works!</li>
            <li>I love this not only does it work well for wrinkles  </li>
            <li>Now this does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I felt an immediate improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I do LOVE this product and will order it again in the future.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I had ever used rosehip oil</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s probably still 3/4 or even more left.</li>
            <li>which wasn&#x27;t a pretty situation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>the first time I order one I use it all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update later if I get more info.</li>
            <li>Was sceptical of all the claims at first.</li>
            <li>Use at nite and first thing in the am.</li>
            <li>Natural, cheap and ez to apply.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Glad I got the big bottle.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could&#x27;ve made this purchase better would have been to include the dropper as pictured.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Love this product, definitely will order again. 😍</li>
            <li>I only wish it was a pump rather then a dropper top.  </li>
            <li>After using the Rosehip Oil for 3 weeks, my face fells smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love using it on my face as it helps even my skin tone and smooth over old acne scars from my teen years.  </li>
            <li>Love mixing with essential oils!</li>
            <li>My first order from Radha seemed legit.</li>
            <li>First time trying Rosehip oil</li>
            <li>I recently had surgery on my elbow (july 9th 2015) and i LOVE this already.</li>
            <li>so that when I run out, I will know exactly what I will buy.  </li>
            <li>I gotta say I absolutely adore this oil!  </li>
            <li>I love it, use it every night before bed, on my entire body not just my face.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a week and love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I could tell just by the fact that there was a glass dropper that this oil was much better than many I have bought in stores in the past.</li>
            <li>and I love the color of the blue bottle.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Radha!</li>
            <li>I did the first 3 days without.</li>
            <li>Most products are in tiny bottles.</li>
            <li>The oil is smooth, has a soft scent and blends well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Rosehip Oil from other companies and find this to be my FAVORITE!</li>
            <li>Love the rosehip essential oil.</li>
            <li>Using it daily on my face and love the results.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

            <li>Only the purest oils are even considered for our products and we just love Radha Rosehip and so do our customers.</li>

            <li>Stellar product.</li>
            <li>I plan on visiting the Radha web site and exploring more uses, such as on my hair.  </li>
            <li>That was my first experience with an Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li>It is oily when you first put it on, and it does take sometime for it to absorb.  </li>
            <li>Product as described, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s doing, to the finer lines; I only know my skin feels better, after a week of using the product.</li>

            <li>It is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different kinds of lotions, and not one has worked as well as Radha Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in a big 4oz bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li>Well, when first applied it does but then absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>this oil left my face with a lovely rosey glow</li>
            <li>very comparable to argon oil!  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Overall I am so pleased to have found this natural beauty product!!!!</li>
            <li>The next morning my skin feels super smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love the deep blue bottle and the dropper makes it so easy to dispense the right amount for my face.</li>
            <li>Intense moisture, absorbs right away.</li>
            <li>I had heard of rosehip oil and always wanted to try,  I had previously bought the Radha Vitamin C Serum and was very pleased, so I decided to jump in to try the Rosehip Oil in my quest to correct my sun damaged skin ...</li>
            <li>This particular brand is very light in color and free of odor unlike other brands.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have indicated, I put it on before bed and my skin feels amazing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It is either refined beyond recognition or not actually rosehip seed oil, which should have a mild woody scent and a rich amber color.</li>
            <li>The subtle scent of this oil is great</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be dry these days and it turns more soft and smooth after i apply the oil.  </li>
            <li>Received my order extremely fast, and I can not rave enough about how fabulous This product is!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite Rosehip oil that I have use so far.</li>
            <li>First of all the smell of this oil is earthy and pure so you know that no fragrance has been added.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use it a little while before I wrote a review, and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>If you get the chance to research it a bit, you&#x27;ll find it has some wonderful qualities for helping the body such as being full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much</li>
            <li>Well worth the money and highly recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>I Can&#x27;t get over the positive effects it already has made on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have seen nothing but positive effects on my skin from this.</li>
            <li>It has a particular smell right when you put it on</li>
            <li>Thanks to all the reviews, I thought this should be my first oil to try.  </li>
            <li>Really made a difference after the first application.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much RADHA !</li>
            <li>It really does absorb fast!</li>
            <li>On my face, twice a day, on my feet, once or twice a day, and pretty much anything else I could think of.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried it I keep marveling at how the fingers I used to apply it felt so much softer than the others.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much every organic plant oil you can think of: argan, jojoba, coconut, kukui,  almond, squalene, primrose...</li>
            <li>Also, Radha offers good advice and information on their product that other companies do not.</li>
            <li>I use more of it before bed as a night and eye cream cream, and less in the morning, when I rub in my tinted BB cream on right over it—it actually makes my makeup blend better than without the rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>Very light, sweet scent, almost imperceptible,  </li>
            <li>, my skin was already starting to look healthier and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>When I took my concerns outside of amazon to a group that tests and analyzes EOs, they had many concerns over this company and their responses they are giving to customers regarding this particular EO.</li>
            <li>, I don have any major skin tone issues, but my overall complexion seems really nice.</li>
            <li>I had to finish using my last face cream and have only used this the last two nights, but I am extremely impressed so far.  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful although I have not actually used it other than in one recipe where I found the smell did not last.  </li>
            <li>and I have seen none of that for myself (nothing more significant than the current products used currently).  </li>
            <li>and I have seen none of that for myself (nothing more significant than the current products used currently).  </li>
            <li>I did receive this oil at a promotional discount price, but I would definitely pay full price for it, as it can also be used on one&#x27;s hair and scalp to alleviate dandruff as well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use the product, as I have pretty much falling in love with it and already feel as if it is one of those personal care products I just cannot live without.</li>
            <li>being more on the dry side and</li>
            <li>I tried so many products to dry out my face to prevent the oilyness which made my skin freak out.</li>
            <li>With they being said, my face produced more oil to help compensate for me trying to dry it out</li>
            <li>This is a big bottle and the dropper makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>love this product, it was a bit oilier than i had anticipated but has already in a week helped dry skin patches on my arms and elbows.</li>
            <li>Most moisturizers clog my giant pores, but this absorbs cleanly and instantly.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin so smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li>It soaks into the skin quickly and leaves it feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>so I really love how it moisturizes the really dry and flaky areas of my skin.</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild acne as an adult</li>
            <li>I mix it with pure aloe Vera and wear overnight to moisturize after using drying acne products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is pure rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>This product states its 100% pure organic rosehip seed oil with no fillers.</li>
            <li>Does not have the appearance of pure Rosehip oil or smell.  </li>
            <li>Radha Rosehip seed Oil is pure and healing.</li>
            <li>I’m not convinced that this is pure Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>#34;scent of pure rosehip oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t seem to be how pure rosehip oil is described.</li>
            <li>4 OZ, note the large size for the price of an ounce.  </li>
            <li>it is a large amount, me and my mom being using it</li>
            <li>I absolutely live it!!</li>
            <li>In fact, I bought some very expensive serum from a famous skin care line recently, which came with a sample of the line&#x27;s best selling moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality pure oil .  </li>
            <li>Even though your skin absorbs the oil quickly you don&#x27;t need but a few drops, and it won&#x27;t clog up your pores so it&#x27;s safe for oily skin and T-zones.</li>
            <li>I am 44, this oil seems makes me break out which is odd because I thought it&#x27;s good for mature skin.  </li>
            <li>Using the rosehip oil, I am seeing continued improvement in the texture and diminished appearance of fine facial lines and reduced depth of deeper lines.</li>
            <li>bottle left, and it has kept just fine at room temperature.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible smell, just odd and not one I love, so I put a drop of an essential oil to it when I use it.</li>
            <li>This product is very high quality and Organic to boot.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I had very high hopes.</li>
            <li>I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Very high quality Rosehip Seed oil.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving it oo early to live a complete review</li>
            <li>I was having a dry skin scaly  breakout on my right palm, so I applied the Radha rose hip oil last night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it mixed with other oils in a coconut oil carrier on blemishes and dry skin with great results!</li>
            <li>I use it primarily under my eyes, but on super dry days, I have used it all over my face with no problems with my pores or new blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be repurchasing this product when my huge 4 oz.</li>
            <li>The oil is light yellow color and doesn’t really have a smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks seller for introduced such a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>and I added my choice of essential oils, and now my skin is happy, glowing, and firm.</li>
            <li>It soaks it really well and leaves no greasy residue feeling.</li>
            <li>You just don&#x27;t get customer service like that very often.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It soaks in really fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need much to cover your whole face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>I used it on my heels and they are already so much softer and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this company and oil!</li>
            <li>every night, after washing my face (with a gentle soap), I apply a couple of drops on my face.</li>
            <li>This product really delivers.</li>
            <li>My skin texture is SOoooo much smoother.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  </li>
            <li>I definitely received genuine rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really been a blessing to have found this oil.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>such a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs really well into my skin</li>
            <li>Now I just use it straight and don&#x27;t even notice the smell.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I do my chores and at the end of the day my face is still very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have been using it at night on my face and neck, and I really like the results.  </li>
            <li>Very hydrating.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>My wife bought it, She loves it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find it works well for whole body.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Previous Review:&lt;br /&gt;I had read that rosehip oil is very beneficial for the skin</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that it does not have much of a smell.</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my hair but did not have much luck.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have aging skin</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch</li>
            <li>My reason for trying rosehip oil is to counteract the dryness from the melasma / brown spot/enlarged pores treatments that I&#x27;ve been using that have been really drying on my skin.</li>
            <li>and this makes it feel really nice.d for applying the oil</li>
            <li>I use this oil at night after exfoliating, you can really feel the blood rise to your face</li>
            <li>It had a very fishy scent.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A VERY SILKY OIL.  </li>
            <li>I like how well and how fast it worked.</li>
            <li>They work very well together.  </li>
            <li>It has not broken me out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>When I received the product free to review it my only expectation</li>
            <li>For real oil.</li>
            <li>Really unsure about the contents of bottle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I also have issues with eczema and using this oil has really helped improve my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks Radha Beauty.</li>
            <li>I use it straight out of the bottle to moisturize my hands.  </li>
            <li>Very Moisturizing for the skin without creating any irritations or acne issues.</li>
            <li>so I really shouldn&#x27;t say anything as I know that you gotta judge these things in along run.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>The item arrived on time and was packed very well.</li>
            <li>The oil doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and is orange in color.</li>
            <li>ordered it and it came fast.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and can be used on the face and neck without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it since October and my skin is so much healthier both in appearance and to the touch.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Radha Beauty for introducing me to your products-</li>
            <li>In the morning my heels are much softer.  </li>
            <li>and this has really helped.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the dryness of cold winter days.  </li>
            <li>I think this is because when I feel the area, it is so soft, but it has absorbed quite well and does not look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I am planning to get one for my mother, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived fast and the company representative even called to check if I had arrived</li>
            <li>haha...</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin softer also seems some of the wrinkles aren&#x27;t so noticeable</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product with some skepticism as to how well it would REALLY work to reduce the appearance of stretch marks, saggy skin, etc.  </li>
            <li>The oil came well packaged and sealed very well</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t put it over my whole face.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this oil!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much product I received.  </li>
            <li>After speaking with Sean, another user, she confirmed that it definitely was the oil.</li>
            <li>Now my Mom wants a bottle too.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that really stand up to the claim.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy and fast absorbent.</li>
            <li>I really like this product a lot.</li>
            <li>but, the really selling point of the Radha brand is that you get 4 ounces of the oil.</li>
            <li>but it is very moisturizing and makes my skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li>Oily skin like mines don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need much makeup to give me an even skin tone.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to work upright, I have to tilt the whole dropper when I&#x27;m using it</li>
            <li>She had some surgery that requires gently massaging the incisions and finds it very soothing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t gaze into the mirror, much, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling everyone how much this oil has helped my skin.</li>
            <li>As for it being organic, I can&#x27;t say much about that.  </li>
            <li>This oil is very moisture but not oily.</li>
            <li>really does help with itching.  </li>
            <li>My heels are always rough and cracked because I love going barefoot all the time.</li>
            <li>But this oil is actually helping to heal pimples faster and make my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m VERY picky about my skincare products.</li>
            <li>Thanks Radha for this quality product.</li>
            <li>It can really be used all over your body though.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on my hands and it really helps moisturize my skin, even after washing my hands -which</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t really come with any instructions for use</li>
            <li>The company also packaged it very well</li>
            <li>It was very moisturizing and made my skin softer and reduced the visibilty of the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I also really appreciated the Radha follow up and usage tips.  </li>
            <li>The packaging on this was also very well done.  </li>
            <li>Really making a difference, feeling softer and healthier</li>
            <li>We already tried it out and it fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Not that you really notice it to begin with!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>oil absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling.</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s not much control over how many drops you can squeeze it</li>
            <li>but it got very oily.</li>
            <li>Therosehip oil really helped.</li>
            <li>For me, since I&#x27;m unsure of what kind of oil I actually got, I won&#x27;t be using it and have requested a refund (which is currently processing).</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel, and the next morning it still feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>This rose hip oil sinks into my skin completely, leaving it supple and hydrated but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product at fist, but the oil in my third and forth bottle came completely different than the fist two.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different rose hip oils.</li>
            <li>My always red skin is soothed nicely by it when I apply it in the evenings, and I wake with a definite glow.</li>
            <li>my skin looks more clear and younger.</li>
            <li>Sean offered the kind of customer service missing in today&#x27;s often impersonal shopping experience: personable, polite, and knowledgable.</li>
            <li>I warm a few drops of oil between the hands by rubbing, then I gently pat the oil onto my face and decollete.  </li>
            <li>I have used the product since it arrived (08/08/2014) and am able to provide the following review: I developed a heat rash on my neck and used the oil to test it out.</li>
            <li>this is most certainly NOT Rosehip seed oil.  </li>
            <li>wow..just wow !!!</li>
            <li>Makes skin SO SOFT and not oily AT ALL!!!</li>
            <li>Light and super gentle on my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to oils, which first began with coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>Was ok i wounder  if it really organic used 6 other rosehip oil</li>
            <li>Loving it so far along with the other products</li>
            <li>I use it on my face, &amp; good for dry feet legs, dry skin, damaged skin, &amp; a beauty aid...</li>
            <li>but it definetly works great on skin and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I want to give rosehip oil a chance, due to my severe eczema, but this product makes me hesitant to even use it more than once.</li>
            <li>I don;t see any difference than most other non-cooking oils.</li>
            <li>Great quality and a LITTLE bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>A little goes a LONG way, so this is a great value for me.</li>
            <li>I found that it goes on easier than many other oils, and that I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands of Rosehip oil and they were lovely too,</li>
            <li>I love it and can&#x27;t wait to try it for other uses.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I have been using it only 2 weeks, too soon to see major changes</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love what this product does for my dry, sensitive, aging skin!</li>
            <li>I am giving a 3 right now because I have not used this specific product long, but have used rosehip seed oil for a while and love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried quite a few Rosehip oils in the past, and this is the best yet!</li>
            <li>I love this product as its makes my skin so soft and it really heal your dry skin</li>
            <li>I really like the first one it clear color and doesn&#x27;t have smell .</li>
            <li>I am  a true believer that it really just may be the Holy Grail...or something very similar.</li>
            <li>it absorbs very quickly but doesn&#x27;t dry out at all.  </li>
            <li>far Rosehip Oil has done an amazing job fading those dark marks......</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used rosehip oil, and I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li>No nasty rancid smell, clean and moisturizing without irritating my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(fabulous...very light, easy spreading, not tacky or thick).</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry (ok mature) skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this rosehip oil on my face with geranium essential oil and really like the way it absorbs quickly, leaving my face well-moisturized but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is huge and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I really like that the only ingredient is rosehip oil because I like using natural products on my skin rather than product filled with chemicals.</li>
            <li>After just six days of applying this oil twice a day, my skin is almost completely clear for the first time in months.</li>
            <li>i dry skin it moisturizes helps with fine lines.</li>
            <li>, i apply 2 to 3 drops of rosehip oil into my hair, instantly my hair gets smooth and soft, it tamm hair frizz!</li>
            <li>I might give it more stars in the future except that I&#x27;m noticing a weird trend on Amazon where sellers ask for reviews to be posted (which is fair)</li>
            <li>a man I don&#x27;t like using such product,  she forced it to use it, it worked pretty well  :P</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t realize the full benefits until I used this on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I did test it on my hands first, but the product had act sensitively to my face.</li>
            <li>NOT good for me, but daughter loved the product.</li>
            <li>I use it with natural essential oils to help combate acne, and fine lines/wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It is great on my alligator dry legs, have not used it long enough for results on wrinkles or Sun damage.</li>
            <li>I have hypothyroidism, which causes extremely dry skin, and this is the first product I have found that gives me smooth, baby soft skin.  </li>
            <li>but the smell is a little overwhelming (very smoky.)  </li>
            <li>The oil I received was very fresh and the bottle has a long dropper, which I like for oil, easier than a pump.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it 4 days so far but already see a significant change in the texture of my skin where it was showing the most dryness, areas I wasn&#x27;t seeing results when using the other Olay and Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li>As I had used other brand before, I really like this product as it does not have a strong smell at all.</li>
            <li>Great price as well in comparison to other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Feel like I have been given a whole body of new skin.  </li>
            <li>Both seem to go on very smoothly and to absorb into the skin very quickly (not immediately, but in an hour or so, my skin (face) did not seem very oily).  </li>
            <li>Both seem to go on very smoothly and to absorb into the skin very quickly (not immediately, but in an hour or so, my skin (face) did not seem very oily).  </li>
            <li>Less redness, more even skintone&amp; texture.</li>
            <li>I wear less makeup and my skin feels more supple.</li>
            <li>Since my first review, I&#x27;ve also added this product to my hair regimen, so pretty much every day, I apply 1-2 drops to the ends of my long, fine, breakage-prone hair to prevent split ends and keep them soft and shiny between washes, and I&#x27;ve mixed it with jojoba and EVOO for oil treatments.</li>
            <li>I feel I do notice the elusive &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; after applying it but be warned, less is more.</li>
            <li>Even though it is oil, I have noticed that I get less shiny throughout the day, my skin is smoother, and my makeup looks better for longer.</li>
            <li>For this product using less is definitely more.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even, less inflammation,  clearing blemishes, and smoothing out any scars.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO many different moisturizers and this one finally does the trick.  </li>
            <li>; This is my first time using Radha Rosehip Oil, so let&#x27;s hope it delivers the same results as the first bottle I discovered</li>
            <li>This bottle of oil was larger than I expected which was nice.</li>
            <li>My pores are super tiny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this now for only 3 days (along with clay facial soap vs ones with sulfates in them) and my face looks a million times better.</li>
            <li>Finally, something that shows instant improvement which seemingly gets better.</li>
            <li>The results are better than the more expensive face creams on the market</li>
            <li>This on in particular is a yellowish orange.</li>
            <li>This particular bottle of oil was a gift from the company</li>
            <li>Most products only coat the surface of the skin but this stuff goes in deep and does wonders.</li>
            <li>My main skin concern is the dryness, even during summer time.</li>
            <li>I was very eager to try out this rosehip oil and surprised at what 4 oz really looked like.</li>
            <li>definitely will get more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>I have recently gotten into oils, and i have found this particular oil makes my skin feel so smooth and soft after i apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is light and unassuming, the texture is also light, delicate.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as fragrant as I expected (I have rose water toner, so I was assuming it would smell similar)</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hyperpigmentation and boxcar/ice pick scarring from a severe breakout I had when I was 19, and this oil has visibly evened out my skin so much in under a week; the hyperpigmentation is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited by all the products I&#x27;ve used and look forward to a long relationship.  </li>
            <li>For facial skin care, rose hip oil offers several benefits when applied externally due to its primary constituents:</li>
            <li>Comes in a very pretty blue bottle.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to fragrance!</li>
            <li>I did a little research prior to ordering and found the cold press rose hips is the best (which this Radha product is).</li>
            <li>Very sensitive skin and this product works!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for people with skin condition like rosacea.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone with dermatitis or eczema.</li>
            <li>Highly recomanded.</li>
            <li>, I can not afford expensive beauty products, but those expensive products don&#x27;t always work, you jut pay for the name brand, so I am thrilled about your excellent beauty products, thank you so much for your quality and affordability</li>
            <li>I would imagine that would be to the high vitamin C content.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I didnt have high expectations of a oil working.</li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT HIGHLY..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and the company.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Radha products.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this products to my friends.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It sinks in nicely and has gotten rid of my dry skin very well.</li>
            <li>Everything I&#x27;ve read in natural beauty and essential oil books say that that rosehip oil should be a rich amber color.</li>
            <li>and I like that it is pure and natural.</li>
            <li>The oil is clear with no aroma, and does not retain any characteristics of pure unrefined rosehip seed oil.  </li>
            <li>Acne cleared up a little, too :)</li>
            <li>and when you mix this with a little water your skin feels heavenly smooth!</li>
            <li>I have bought rosehip oil from other companies and the real stuff has an amber color and a very distinct smell.</li>
            <li>The other brands have an earthy scent to them, and the books say that it should have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way so a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>The next morning when I wake up my skin is always super soft!</li>
            <li>One warning: the oil is a sort of light brown color, and it does stain clothes, so be careful with it.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my skin because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and moisturized, which really helps my eczema.</li>
            <li>So far though, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>With all the uses and benefits it offers to the whole family, and the length of time it will last, the price tag is well worth the output.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>These oils feel very luxurious and soft on my skin</li>
            <li>It is clear that they really care about me and their products.</li>
            <li>and where I had rough parts on my forehead are now smooth, it absorbs into your skin well and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
            <li>basically had NO scent &amp; was almost clear in color, much like the refined/processed oil you would buy in the store.</li>
            <li>I am expecting more result after few weeks.  </li>
            <li>Tried working it out but company insists this is normal.</li>
            <li>, they are really smooth and soft and not nearly as crapey .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing without being too heavy and layers well on top of serums,sunscreens, etc.</li>
            <li>The Radha rosehip oil feels so nice and delicate on my face and leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li>Nice larger size,  will last a while and will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face twice a day, and was able to tell a difference in just a few days.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I wanted to give it a few weeks before I commented, but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>A bit later after applying, I sometimes think it hasn&#x27;t absorbed.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to know if it will help elevate the scaring, my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li>It works way better when I apply a few drops onto my hair after I shower.  </li>
            <li>They told me the the smell was normal, but</li>
            <li>I used it a few days and love the feel on my skin and the glow....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and my skin is softer and more radiant than ever.</li>
            <li>This rose hip oil is thick, orange, with a hearty smell as it is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li>The Radha is still infinitely better than any other non-rosehip lotion I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m suspicious that the effects are so much different than a competing 100% pure cold-pressed rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>The most they did was make my skin break out and cost $$$ a half ounce!</li>
            <li>I have only had this product for a short while but wanted to say that the service was quick and how much I like the product!  </li>
            <li>Why pay for high priced skin creams that have the same active ingredients as natural rose hip oil?  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin super soft and supple as though you just received both a facial and microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li>On top of that, my skin has started getting some dry patches recently, and I needed a moisturizer that would help with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I just received my Radha Rosehip Organic Oil earlier this week and my skin LOVES it; it just soaks it right up.</li>
            <li>High quality organic product and professional sellers!</li>
            <li>The Radha people really take a lot of care with wrapping the glass bottle which is a nice change compared to some sellers here on Amazon lately!</li>
            <li>but im noticing them smoothing out and becoming less noticable-</li>
            <li>First of all, I was surprised by how large the bottle was, I was expecting a much smaller size bottle.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very smart and can distinguish different oils from one another.  </li>
            <li>The rosehip oil in particular, is the first product that has stopped my face from developing red patches in the winter.</li>
            <li>Other brands I have are the amber color as well making me wonder why this one is sooo light.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little too early to tell just how much I love it, but time will tell and I promise to let everyone know.......</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added but unexpected benefit is the difference in my hands since this is my method for applying the oil, they are really smooth and soft and not nearly as crapey .  </li>
            <li>Now I am going to incorporate it into my lotions and new serum</li>
            <li>so using new products tends to make me break out.</li>
            <li>Any new pimples literally heal overnight when I use this oil, and it even seems to shrink pimples before they form.</li>
            <li>However the new bottle I received has a tinit of orange.</li>
            <li>I have tried it all, and still keep looking for new discoveries.  </li>
            <li>I always prepared myself for my new breakouts.</li>
            <li>I live in NM where there is sun</li>
            <li>I live in the mountains</li>
            <li>I live in the desert</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a new product for me.</li>
            <li>I live the area</li>
            <li>My wife uses it more or less as a whole body oil but especially likes it on her face and heels.</li>
            <li>and I apply it to my dry areas and it instantly feels better so soft and moisturized without feeling oily and  greasy and hasn&#x27;t made me breakout.  </li>
            <li>Only been using it for a few days, but loving the results already.</li>
            <li>I put aside my rosehip oil to use the moisturizer, and after a week decided my rosehip oil did a better job of keeping my skin moisturized and smooth, so OUT with the expensive cream.</li>
            <li>It was soft and smooth where I have these rough patches on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone who has issues with dry skin, eczema, fine lines, stretch marks, scars, or is just generally concerned about aging and drying issues will benefit from this.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>If you have used oil in your skin care routine before and are looking for something new, I completely recommend this!</li>
            <li>It also makes the skin very soft.</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter and feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne prone skin, and this oil has soothed my skin and calmed my flare ups.</li>
            <li>The scent is very natural and doesn&#x27;t clash with my cologne.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>It does make my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft..</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The left side looks almost completely healed where as the right is still destroyed.</li>
            <li>I came back from a trip and really knew I needed to calm it down right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other oils I have used were much thinner (not pure) and far less effective.</li>
            <li>The biggest surprise was the size of the bottle -- I was envisioning a small bottle, like tinctures come it, but this bottle is positively HUGE!  </li>
            <li>But so far has helped me on flakiness and redness!</li>
            <li>No greasy feeling, skin was sooo soft, and I think it took the burn out of the sunburned shoulders!</li>
            <li>My first time ordering, but will definitely order again.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have dirched my usual moisturizer in favor of this oil and my skin looks and feels better after a week.</li>
            <li>Like the woman, I will use this for 4 weeks minimum; I say &amp;#34;minimum,&amp;#34; because from the first day used on my skin, I saw repairs happening, and I will likely be a fan of this product for life.</li>
            <li>I am testing this product at a low cost with the understanding that I would provide a review and inspection for people interested in purchasing the product.</li>
            <li>This product comes in a pretty blue 4 oz glass bottle sealed with a lid and comes with a glass dropper that can be used for the oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I keep using it that it will make some sort of a difference on these areas, how dramatically I am not sure, though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be checking here first, before purchasing essential oils elsewhere...</li>
            <li>It is a much larger sized bottle for a lower price than many other brands.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a natural moisturizer, I give this oil my highest recommendation!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been clear on whether to use it with my normal face cream or without so</li>
            <li>In using this for my naturally curly hair, which often times gets frizzy as it dries, I have not had any frizz!</li>
            <li>For example, the number &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines between my eyebrows are nearly gone (yay!)</li>
            <li>It is also lacks the unique scent of the other rosehip oils that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>You will be &amp;#34;smack yo baby&#x27;s bottom&amp;#34; soft!</li>
            <li>Some scarring from old blemishes have started to disappear since including it in my regimen!</li>
            <li>I put it on my face and neck and cannot remember my neck ever feeling so soft!  </li>
            <li>I found this oil by searching Amazon and after the first night of receiving it and using it, it cleared up the redness by the next morning!  </li>
            <li>The only recommendation for the company would be to use a higher quality dropper.  </li>
            <li>All the oils that I have used have been deep golden/amber in color, including the first bottle of Radha Rosehip that I bought.  </li>
            <li>The product also arrived early!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased a product numerous times.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong, but with time I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.  </li>
            <li>I notice the deeper creased in my forehead are smoother over these last few days, I also find that gently patting this into the skin under my eyes really helps to smooth at the lines there, the fine lines are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>it is clear in color rather than the more yellow color of the other brand oil.  </li>
            <li>it is clear in color rather than the more yellow color of the other brand oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week to get rid old stretch marks and prevent new ones from forming while I&#x27;m losing weight.</li>
            <li>It is very long which is useful</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and I feel instant as well as long range comfort.  </li>
            <li>This has been my go to moisturizer every morning and night for the past few days and it has been great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying moisturizers and treatments for dry skin and am now trying less commercial products since I am not seeing good results results from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is so dry, the oil is instantly absorbed.</li>
            <li>, it just helps my makeup look fresh and dewy rather than dry and cakey.  </li>
            <li>I love it, my skin looks younger, moisture all the time, the dark spots and sun damage in my face looks like it&#x27;s fading.  </li>
            <li>and ive spent a lot on skincare from lancome to shiseido and this works as good if not better</li>
            <li>So at first when I opened the bottle, there was definitely a kind of weird smell to the oil.  </li>
            <li>It just makes my skin very soft and has completely taken care of the dryness.  </li>
            <li>But very busy lately, but this is an fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>It seems a few fine lines around the eyes have disappeared</li>
            <li>The fine lines on my cheeks are gone with just a few weeks application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this product for a little over a month in combination with a liquid exfoliant, I have seen a significant improvement in the appearance of my skin both in terms of occurrence of new blemishes and the diminishing of acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the pure Radha Rosehip Oil for several weeks now.</li>
            <li>This is PURE rosehip oil, no added essential orders or scents...</li>
            <li>I have paid the same price as this oil is listed, received a smaller quantity and a far less effective product.</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for rosehip hip oil,and I have been using this for a week and it feels adequate for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>I am one of those people with an oily t zone, high level of sensitivity, and apparently dehydrated winter cheeks now</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that is not one to protect me from the occasional spatter of acne, however this certainly doesn&#x27;t trigger that behavior.</li>
            <li>This really hydrates my VERY dry skin, and my lines are very diminished.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able with the dropper to use as little or as much as possible at a time.  </li>
            <li>Rosehip absorbs very quickly and won&#x27;t leave an oily feeling behind, just very soft pretty skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried black soap, jojoba, castor, grapeseed, coconut, tea tree and just about every other nut oil but my own.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, the beauty secret</li>
            <li>This oil is clear and has no odor.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and soft and less frizz.</li>
            <li>It is a clear, scent-free oil.</li>
            <li>This oil is clear as vegetable oil and is scentless.</li>
            <li>no more scratching, no more redness, it is great.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have used it on my nails and face and it instantly absorbs and leaves my skin very hydrated and plump.</li>
            <li>I reapplied the oil after her shower and it was almost completely clear in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some have been clear and some have been a yellowish orange.</li>
            <li>Clear, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>By morning, the rash was gone and my skin clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It makes my skin SO soft and brightens up my skin tone!&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive and combination skin.</li>
            <li>Once it soaks into my skin (just give it a couple of minutes), I apply a tiny bit of shea butter to really lock that moisture in.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li>, the Dr&#x27;s were surprised @</li>
            <li>I am also a breast cancer survivor and was looking for a natural alternative for my face.  </li>
            <li>I decided to also try Radha Age-Defying Skin clearing serum every night and now my skin is soft, with tighter pores, no breakouts and wrinkles are fading.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;m amazed at the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li>, it felt amazing,it was so soft.</li>
            <li>Face glows and skin stays soft all day.</li>
            <li>No problems so far with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>(basically don&#x27;t squeeze any additional oil into the dropper and just work with whatever drips off naturally.)</li>
            <li>It was soft without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>Its naturally toning the skin it and it reduce wrinkles.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>In the evenings, I put it on after Radha&#x27;s Skin Clearing serum, and the combination has proven beneficial for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and so far I am seeing no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I have skin that is prone to breakouts - both because it is sensitive and because it&#x27;s oily.</li>
            <li>Absorbs and blends with skin&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li>Leaves me with soft, supple, moisturizer skin.</li>
            <li>Since I have sensitive skin, I decided to test it on my hands avery night</li>
            <li>I went the whole day without having to apply any extra moisturizer to my problem areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil daily and highly doubt I&#x27;ll ever go without it again!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since February and have noticed a considerable improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>This oil has changed my skin completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using it on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li>I add a few drops of hylauranic acid and mix them and put it on at night and there is a difference the price is fantastic im in my 60s</li>
            <li>My skin feels baby soft.</li>
            <li>I am not sure it is exactly miracle, but it has cleared up my difficult adult acne and it does make your skin feel incredible and glowing, without an oily feel.  </li>
            <li>I also put it on my hands that have always looked old.  </li>
            <li>This oil was rancid smelled old .</li>
            <li>I used it on my face, on scars and on old stretch marks from puberty.</li>
            <li>She has frequent flares in the summer, and was experiencing one the day the package arrived.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural remedy.</li>
            <li>The rosehip oil is gentle enough to use around the eyes and lessened the appearance of lines and &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it</li>
            <li>It melts into the skin and leaves its soft.</li>
            <li>I have noticed no breakouts and I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not fruity or perfumy, but natural.</li>
            <li>you feeling soft and supple hours after you wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>completely-</li>
            <li>WOW..</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I use it frequently.</li>
            <li>I have seen so much improvement in my complexion over the last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really soft, has natural glow and looks dewy.</li>
            <li>So far, I have used it on my face, neck and hands.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and after 3 weeks I  have noticed the &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have noticed a marked improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I found it absorbs rapidly into the skin and leaves it feeling soft and supple without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Thinking that the product would help eliminate or even lessen the effect/appearance of both issues, it so far has not.</li>
            <li>Made the purchase over two weeks now and still have not seen any signs that the product works aside from making my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>It is making such a difference in my skin and hair especially as a natural.</li>
            <li>My hair has become incredibly soft overnight with just one application throughout my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li>The oil I received smelled old and rancid.  </li>
            <li>My face is soft n radiant.</li>
            <li>However, you wake up with soft and moisturized skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it as a moisturizer under my eyes so far I like it.  </li>
            <li>it is natural.</li>
            <li>It looks like diluted vegetable oil and is completely odorless.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel soft and plumps up the skin.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I used this twice a day for a month and did not see any results as far as scars or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m using this oil my skin feels plump, supple, and soft in ways it&#x27;s never felt before.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>and I wish someone would have told me about this before I was 31 years old.</li>
            <li>Also was very pleasantly surprised that I cannot smell it at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this product 1 week ago and let me tell you, this is so natural.</li>
            <li>After a week I started to notice that my stretch marks on my belly has cleared a lot, also my face feels soft and tighter.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend using this product!  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated without being sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>Read online on a blog about young woman with adult acne and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>Ditto for me, had it since I was young.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my skin softer I have seen some change as far as wrinkles go</li>
            <li>so I might be a bit early on the review.  </li>
            <li>But...so far, it seems to work quite well.  </li>
            <li>and it has made my elbows really soft.</li>
            <li>am positively surprised by this product and so is my daughter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That said, it makes my face soft as silk.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think about the smell of a natural product.</li>
            <li>all the big corps don&#x27;t want u to know about, it really does work, unbelevable</li>
            <li>nothing so far</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m sure there is chemistry and biology behind these properties, size of molecules and all - but none really are.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t break out and even better results when I put a few drops of essential oils!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using my oil a few days,but love how it feels.</li>
            <li>I have only had the organic rosehip oil for a few days, but I am in love.</li>
            <li>This does not need to be refrigerated but keep it in a dark cool place.</li>
            <li>I still think I will be adding a few extra drops at night to let more sink into my skin over night.</li>
            <li>My skin is less dry, smoother and my make up goes on much easier and doesn&#x27;t collect in the fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Almost my entire face was red, irritated, flaky, oily, and covered in whiteheads - yikes, right?</li>
            <li>I recently had a total replacement of my right knee.</li>
            <li>Not sure about Grade and Quality it is very thin in texture and almost colorless and scent free.. Not usual characteristics of pure rose hip oil,  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, has very little fragrance and does not leave me with a sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>It sinks right into my skin, and any oily or greasy residue is gone within minutes.  </li>
            <li>This has a slight fragrance, much like french fries, but quickly dissipates, the softness of my skin does not disappear though.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a few drops, which is great to have a big bottle that will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>It is also very, very reasonably priced (I have have had oils that run up to $200/oz, which makes me furious in hindsight) and comes capped with a separate dropper cap - and the dropper is actually long enough to fit all the way down into the bottle.  </li>
            <li>, it  makes my skin really soft and healthy looking specially for cold weather .I will buy it again .</li>
            <li>This oil has smoothed lines, brightened my skin, taken away the redness, made me break out less than the prescription Roscacea medicine, and made my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>Even a little bit made any stray grey hair shiny and much more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I read lot of review and got confused at first, after I using different rosehip oil and ask someone who using more time now I find out.</li>
            <li>It is super pure, has a delicate natural smell (no perfumes), and plumps up the skin to diminish the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>Nearly every facial oil claims to be highly absorbable by the skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what I got, like these 1 star reviewers said, the color is that of vegetable oil which is almost clear with a light tint and has no smell.  </li>
            <li>My skin needs the moisture, but it did leave me a bit greasy...and my fine hair, around my face, got oilier than usual.</li>
            <li>I had decided on my birthday that I better look into some serious skin products.</li>
            <li>The oil goes on and remains oily for a while, but it does seem to &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; quickly, as I stated previously.  </li>
            <li>The oil goes on and remains oily for a while, but it does seem to &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; quickly, as I stated previously.  </li>
            <li>and I do believe that my fine lines are less obvious.  </li>
            <li>My skin is dry, but many lotions will cause breakouts of little whiteheads.</li>
            <li>about 2 weeks ago i had major surgery, &amp; as soon as the Dr. cleared me for using creams to help with the itch &amp; scarring, i used the Rosehip Oil applied directly on my scars.</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil is definitely very different from any other oil I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all of them).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and this brand overall.  </li>
            <li>I have old and new facial acne scars</li>
            <li>when I used harsh acne medication it would dry my skin which brought more wrinkles-ugh.</li>
            <li>Brightens my face as I use it under my normal daily moisturizure.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s absolutely NO miracle, for that;).  </li>
            <li>and my knees are healed and almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>ONLY AFTER A FEW DAYS OF USE, I SEE THE FINE LINES AROUND MY EYE LESSENING..</li>
            <li>Considering both are supposed to be 100% pure cold-pressed, I assumed they would be essentially the same.</li>
            <li>As rose hip oils in general become rancid over a certain period of time, I put a little quantity for daily use in a small bottle and I keep the remaining in the refrigerator.  </li>
            <li>there is a little smell to it, but nowhere close to other brands I have purchased so far!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very light and reminds me of soap.</li>
            <li>Then upon closer look I saw that the scar tissue was actually coming off and revealing a new layer of skin.</li>
            <li>This is my new carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>In a things-can&#x27;t-get-any-worst act of desperation I recently both three new products--witch hazel, a well reviewed lotion, and the as pictured RRO.</li>
            <li>but I wish the tip of the hole was smaller; I have to be very careful because the oil really drips out fast.</li>
            <li>I am also looking forward to blending it with the Argan Oil and lavender essential oil from Radha with some local beeswax to make a gentle salve.</li>
            <li>The key is to put a few drops on your fingertips and then smooth on face while still damp from washing.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night and my face is fresh, plump and moisturized in the a.m. thus using less of my daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have to be careful of the products that I use, and this product seems to have a very &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I normally use before going to bed at night, wash my face first, spray with Rosewater then apply a few drops of this Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too big of a deal because I just use it as a night time moisturizer only and give it the night to really soak into the skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and everything makes it red.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and I am starting to see changes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this oil on: dark pink/purple scars from scratched mosquito bites, scrape scars, a dog bite, sun damaged areas, brown age/liver spots, spots where the skin has obviously got DNA damage (raised light brown or raised white areas), hypertrophic scars, indented scars, etc.</li>
            <li>Organic and cold-pressed are major</li>
            <li>I HAVE RECEIVED NO OTHER COMPENSATION FROM THE MANUFACTURER OR DISTRIBUTOR FOR THIS REVIEW*</li>
            <li>And you can tell a major difference.</li>
            <li>I had surgery with major scaring, nerve damage, etc...</li>
            <li>on my closed wound; I add some to my hair right before shampooing, massage it into my fingernails &amp; use it lightly on my facial sunspots.</li>
            <li>I got carded last night for the first time in a very long time...</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and gentle fragrance ( very slight) ...</li>
            <li>Within the first two days my other half said my skin looked like it was glowing, so I took a look in the mirror and noticed he was right</li>
            <li>My scar is healing great and the pain isn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally write reviews about products I return</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and clear on what the product is.</li>
            <li>Apparently this is indicative of processed oil to remove the color and odor.  </li>
            <li>I initially ordered this oil to prevent crows feet and help keep my skin looking young.</li>
            <li>This surprised me because one of the products I tried recently was Bio-oil and that caused break outs.  </li>
            <li>I had developed a skin rash and red itchy hives in spots.</li>
            <li>I am only giving this 4 stars as it is too early to tell if this is truly going to work for me or not.</li>
            <li>I applied the oil to the outbreak at about 3PM and by the time she was to take her shower before bed, I could barely see the inflammation.</li>
            <li>I prefer a natural approach whenever possible, but NOT all natural substances are created equal.</li>
            <li>It spreads very well but is not very absorbent</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s only been about 4 days so far, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it on my hands and arms so far.  </li>
            <li>After daily application of the rosehip oil, even this area is considerably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely had this two days.</li>
            <li>Sinks into skin and hair fast</li>
            <li>and I will be reordering in the near future.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve said, it might be a bit early to tell, so once I&#x27;ve used it for awhile, I&#x27;ll come back and update my experience.</li>
            <li>It barely has any smell which is the way it should be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unfair to judge this product after using it only a week although I have liked it very much so far.</li>
            <li>The oil comes in a fantastic thick glass bottle with a glass stopper.</li>
            <li>cause it just makes it more irritated and look worse.  </li>
            <li>but it was absorbed in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin moisturized, I have less little bumps on my face, and more evenness.</li>
            <li>The odor will die down for the most part after a few hours.</li>
            <li>This can be corrected and handled well, but until I see a report proving authenticity, I’m very cautious in continuing use as I need to be very concerned with what I put on my body due to wide variety of reactions from things.</li>
            <li>I expected a certain rose smell and was disappointed at first to not smell it.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased to have a larger quantity, since I do use it liberally, but for less dollars per ounce than I was previously paying.  </li>
            <li>Radha Rosehip Oil , I am half way through my first bottle</li>
            <li>I first began using Radha rosehip oil under my eyes and dry areas and it did wonders to improve wrinkles and alleviate dry spots without breaking out.</li>
            <li>The smell is decent (not bad and not great).  </li>
            <li>Trader Joes Jojoba oil is a lot less expensive, but there is something very nice about this oil</li>
            <li>Trader Joes Jojoba oil is a lot less expensive, but there is something very nice about this oil</li>
            <li>It absorbs in the skin really well without looking extremely greasy and without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going out into a New Jersey winter with my slightly dry skin, I add another moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li>Fine lines have vanished, and I&#x27;d swear that the dark circles under my eyes have lessened to the point that much less concealer is needed.  </li>
            <li>This bottle, in a household of 4, with frequent use (especially by the youngest), will STILL last 6-9 months.</li>
            <li>My face is not dry anymore.</li>
            <li>especially these last few days it has been very windy making my skin feel tight and dry and the oil instantly made me feel better.  </li>
            <li>Smells little funny</li>
            <li>I used on my face and it was a little oily the first 1/2 or so</li>
            <li>It can appear to be oily when you first apply, so you need little and need to rub in well.</li>
            <li>The smell takes a little getting used to at first but doesn&#x27;t linger</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use too much, because this oil is pretty thick and makes my skin sticky,so I use only 3 drops for my entire face.</li>
            <li>The dry, dry winter wind usually gives me scale-like dryness on my face, and no matter how many moisturizers I apply, the scales remain.</li>
            <li>The only con in my opinion is the applicator I feel as I waste product because it just flows right through the applicator</li>
            <li>I have been using beauty oils for a year or two but they were all from Sephora and therefore overpriced and filled with fragrance, which is not good skincare.</li>
            <li>people said dark color with fishy smell is real rosehip oil</li>
            <li>This is part of a pretty extensive skin care routine that includes 3 different cleansers, two face masks, and various other products that I rotate in and out depending on my mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels completely moisturized without being greasy &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to absorb.</li>
            <li>I am mainly interested in using this on my face for acne scarring, skin dullness, uneven skin tone, and dryness</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it is absorbed into the skin fully; I never feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I have one brand that the oil is very thin which is good for your face and for the other</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will explore other offerings from Rhada.</li>
            <li>It might be an oil, but after using it skin feels soft and dry, not oily at all.</li>
            <li>It is a dry oil which moisturizes well, and thankfully for me, there is no added fragrance to which I might normally be sensitive towards.  </li>
            <li>I also use it occasionally on dry cracked heels at night, then wear an old pair of socks to bed.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from dry skin, age spots, sun spots/discoloration, and scars -- all of which this oil is helping to diminish, while making my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>rosehip seed oil has caught the attention of mant beauty cult followers as well as beauty product companies, so it is becoming difficult to find trusting companies who offers organic, quality rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>A few drops in the targeted areas and like magic, no more itching after one application.</li>
            <li>but so far no new acne developments which is a miracle.  </li>
            <li>No new breakouts either so far.</li>
            <li>I have had a host of skin problems my whole life: severe eczema, icthyosis vulgaris, dermatographic uticaria, occasional hives outbreaks due to allergies, and hopelessly dry skin in general.</li>
            <li>After years of experimenting with all kinds of blends, this little blue bottle of pure rosehip oil blew me away.</li>
            <li>There is no scent, which I am happy about since other reviews said it smelled unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>Within less than a week of daily use mixed with my moisturizer and straight on my face at night, I can already see a lightning of the spots.  </li>
            <li>It is a very pale yellow color, and just barely it is very close to clear.</li>
            <li>super sensitive skin (I&#x27;m asian and 39 yrs old, and the last couple years trying to find anything to moisturize my skin properly without having a reaction or rash has been an expensive nightmare)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products, I only use very natural products with no chemicals and heard of this company from a friend of mine.</li>

            <li> Loving it!</li>

            <li> Feels nice on my hands too!</li>
            <li> I thought it would have a beautiful rose smell...</li>
            <li> Great stuff love it!</li>

            <li> 😊😊😊 turning 70 in July and feeling good looking.</li>
            <li> I have used that oil at my friend house before I order mine  and loved it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil on my face since I have read that it is good for aging skin.  </li>
            <li> But I still had some problems with breakouts/blackheads,since I had good results with the rosehip oil</li>
            <li> Rose hip oil is a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and I still thought it was good.  </li>
            <li> I thought the no color or odor was good, but in my research, I see that good quality rosehip  oil is a yellow-orange color</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good oil to use on my face after moisturizer</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll enjoy it too :D</li>
            <li> Well, good thing I found this stuff.</li>
            <li> I immediately loved how it felt on my skin</li>
            <li> Product is of good quality.  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and my skin looks and feels wonderful without being overly oily.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Rosehip oil because I had read that it&#x27;s good for removing spots.</li>
            <li> good price</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> which is good if you are wanting to prevent water loss (preventing water loss is how occulise ingredients like vaseline and oil moisturize).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> It feels so good on your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin have never felt or looked this good.</li>
            <li> Radha Rosehip Oil is so good for my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip Oil feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> NOTHING HAS EVER MADE MY SKIN FEEL THIS GOOD.  </li>
            <li> Great product in a nice bottle.</li>
            <li> Would order again, really good product, made my face firmer</li>
            <li> so I was looking for a good skin care product to help with my dehydrated face.</li>
            <li> Its good for my hair but no changes on skin.</li>
            <li> But she loved it to minimize wrinkles.</li>
            <li> good product for rashes and summer mishaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed with good genes and my skin has never presented a problem to me.</li>
            <li> Another one of my good to luxurious oils</li>
            <li> Does not work well for my fair, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Packing was good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good all purpose oil for cleansing and moisturizing skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This oil feels good on my skin, but have not seen any result yet.  </li>
            <li> The value is good for bottle size.  </li>
            <li> Wrapped up with care, which was good because it it a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Good lesson learned.</li>
            <li> So good</li>
            <li> A good product which does what it promises.  </li>
            <li> Awesome substitute for chemical filled moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Either way, I feel more beautiful every day that I wear this.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich luxurious oil beautifully packaged.</li>
            <li> Really Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;First of all the prompt service was great and packaged perfectly.  </li>
            <li> but I am a loyal user of all of the Radha beauty line, and I do purchase as well as will continue to purchase this great line for years to come!</li>
            <li> I am super impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful on my skin and has a pleasing mild scent.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, lightweight, absorbs quickly, non greasy, no smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an oil on my face, so I can&#x27;t compare to others but my experience with this product has been exceptional.  </li>

            <li> My skin feels moisturized, bright and smooth!</li>
            <li> Amazing skin care product.</li>
            <li> Very prompt and courteous service!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely great value for the money, because this is one of the best facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li> From everything I&#x27;ve learned about rosehip seed oil it should have a warm amber or tangerine color to it.</li>
            <li> I rub it on my palms to warm it</li>
            <li> It glides on nice and has a nice feel.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell too.  </li>
            <li> Have noticed a lot of skin moisturizing products with rose hip oil.</li>
            <li> I have heard about the healing properties of rose hips but never tried it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the kind of product that appeals to me.</li>
            <li> This rose</li>
            <li> My skin lovingly eats it up and the smell vanishes before I leave the house in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am 57 and have just added rose hip to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Rose hip extract oil makes skin supple immediately....</li>
            <li> for  a  honest  review</li>
            <li> It is really nice</li>
            <li> The package is also nice, feels quality.</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture, seems to moisturize nicely.</li>
            <li> but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of oil this is, but what I got was not rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I decided to go to Whole Foods and just purchase some there, that rosehip oil did not freeze and is working perfectly.</li>
            <li> This appears to not be rose hip oil.</li>
            <li> though that would be nice.</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s hairdresser introduced her to Rose oil to soothe hand and foot nail cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I find that kind of testimonial a bit suspect</li>
            <li> I find that kind of testimonial a bit suspect</li>
            <li> and this makes it feel really nice.</li>
            <li> After some &#x27;googling&#x27; I read that rose</li>
            <li> Smells somewhat neutral with a hint of rose.</li>
            <li> Nice oil.  </li>
            <li> RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> from what I have witnessed with my own skin in just 5 days I do believe the product will make a noticeable difference on these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but opinion is my own ...</li>
            <li> It has been working so well for my eczema as well as just giving my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> This companies Rose</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rosehip oil for years to help maintain my skin and am absolutely loving this brand.</li>
            <li> Feels so silky and yet not greasy because it soaks in so nicely.</li>
            <li> SO IT WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE I FIND THE RESULTS ABOUT THE ROSE HIP SERUM.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has no smell, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I just started using my rose hip oil.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product.  </li>
            <li> my wife love this she use it after showering on her face and elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;(got a good discount on this item)</li>
            <li> I even use it to make my own body butters.</li>
            <li> I opened it up and immediately liked the smell.</li>
            <li> I got this, some rose water and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> ; I REVEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Has no smell to it which i liked.</li>
            <li> Really nice oil.  </li>
            <li> Oh and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I loved more.  </li>
            <li> I GOT THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  </li>
            <li> (To be fair, I have an extremely acute sense of smell, so a lot of things that bother me wouldn&#x27;t even register to most people.)  </li>
            <li> Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> I am totally loving this oil.</li>
            <li> and I honestly like this oil.</li>
            <li> I mix my own cleansing/nourishing oil for my face.</li>
            <li> It has almost no scent which is a nice surprise as rose oil can be a bit pungent.  </li>
            <li> my skin just absorbs the rose hip oil.  </li>
            <li> honestly, it kind of smelled of smells &amp;#34;earthy.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> and I am really loving it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased rose hip oil before but, considering what it is supposed to look and smell like</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think what I received is rose hip oil.  </li>
            <li> Really good results.:-)</li>
            <li> But I wish it would have a stronger rose fragrance</li>
            <li> Amazing, extremely fast shipping and product arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> One of their representative also contacted me to see how I liked it as a follow up to the purchase.</li>
            <li> Communication from seller was superb and the package was packed very well.</li>
            <li> It adds a nice amount of cover without being overly greasy.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face and it gives me a nice glow</li>
            <li> So when I read about rose hip oil I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I gave her some rose oil and now she uses it as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using rose hip oils for 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Asorbs nicely into the skin with no oily residue.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a nice sheen on my fingernails too.</li>
            <li> Rosehip sounds like rose smell, but rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m loving it already.</li>
            <li> I had read Rosehip Oil was good for your hair, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how mine would react.</li>
            <li> Amazon shipping is the issue and they damaged the metal bottle on one, but this is a nice bottle and glass dropper.</li>
            <li> Nice to see a product deliver as advertised.</li>
            <li> but I am already loving it.</li>
            <li> Nice moisture---recommended for aging skin</li>
            <li> I really liked the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am loving this Rosehip Oil from Radha.</li>
            <li> The oil itself has a nice thickness to it, I use it for my knees and ankles</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast and packing great!</li>
            <li> oil is really nice</li>
            <li> This seems like a really nice product.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a wonderful moisturizing and healthy skin care oil!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing, quick shipping and beautiful bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use regular moisturizer anymore, and the best part is being able to apply makeup over the oil!!</li>
            <li> normally I get good deals on good products but this one is the motherload of great deals</li>
            <li> The packaging is also beautiful, I love leaving it out on my countertop to enjoy.</li>
            <li> Also, fantastic customer service, super speedy shipment and impressive after-purchase follow up.  </li>

            <li> and I first gave it 5 stars because it seemed good.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good ND</li>
            <li> 1) When people ask if oil might be good to add to their skin care routine, I always ask if they would be willing to put olive oil on their face.</li>
            <li> pretty good i will be buying this again and again</li>
            <li> Best of all, it is so gentle and non-greasy, sinking in fully within an hour; I use it on my young children&#x27;s faces and hands as well as my own.</li>
            <li> It absorbed very nicely and quickly into her skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a cold-pressed, organic oil to try with NO added fragrance!</li>

            <li> Its organic, very light, observe quickly, non sticky!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s nice, light and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Radha Beauty products have such great products,&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil feels so nice,</li>
            <li> I make my own facial products and this is a great oil to buy.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth and order free.</li>
            <li> Great product so far!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve heard that this is a great oil for rejuvenating the skin cells, let&#x27;s just say I haven&#x27;t been told I look old!</li>
            <li> I just started using it but have been happy with the results so far!  </li>

            <li> I thought the Ebook was a very good extra item.</li>
            <li> Great light oil but very moisturizing, saw noticeable reductions in fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin really smooth and has been improving the appearance of my scars, but that will take more time I think</li>
            <li> I very happy with this product which was packaged well and delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> but more importantly I like the oil on my face.  </li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> If you want to moisturize your lips, shea butter is the best possible balm I&#x27;ve found (mix it with powdered stevia extract and peppermint or sweet orange oil for flavor and sweetness.)</li>
            <li> My skin looks great not to mention my hair is soft and shinny after washing the oil out.</li>
            <li> I make sure to tightly secure the cap and store my bottle in the refrigerator door.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I am about to re-order because it dramatically extended the life of my moisturizer, eliminated a need for serums, and is overall an incredible value.  </li>
            <li> so glad that I got to try it out for free because otherwise I probably never would&#x27;ve given it a chance.</li>

            <li> For me this is a really healing oil and it is loaded with nutrients that are so good for a person.</li>
            <li> Well, this is the way it is, &amp;  a lot of the chemicals in lotions, etc aren&#x27;t really all that good for you,&amp; some are even known to cause cancer, etc..</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, I bought some for my mom, as well.</li>

            <li> When I got the oil I was excited to try something so inventive.</li>
            <li> There are so many benefits to using Rose Hip Seed Oil on your skin, and this one is of very high quality.  </li>

            <li> Might I add that I&#x27;ve used another brand of rose hip oil that claimed to be 100% pure but was scented with rose oil or something to make it smell pretty but wasn&#x27;t listed as an ingredient) and caused me to breakout.</li>

            <li> I know that reviews are very important to sellers and if possible I will change this and give five stars if you can convince me that no color and no odor is a good thing in rosehip oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE IT the REAL DEAL!!</li>
            <li> Love it so much and wish I knew of it 10 years ago!!</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old woman with fair skin, fine lines, and crows feet.</li>
            <li> Huge ounce and 100% rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since placed an order with a national, reputable brand of organic, cold-pressed rosehip seed oil, one that has both the distinct color and smell of genuine rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face morning and night and have noticed a HUGE difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> The best thing though, my 2 kids rub their faces against my 43 year old face, and they purr with delight how soft it is.</li>
            <li> At 4 ounces, this bottle is comparatively HUGE by comparison for the price and</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a huge deal as I can still get out oil in a somewhat controlled manner but a functional dropper would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes in a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> have no illusions that if I stopped using the product things would revert to normal, but consistent use yields great results.  </li>
            <li> but it is already making a huge difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle.</li>
            <li> The bottle was also huge.</li>
            <li> This oil make your skin smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product to use with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It feels light on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Its</li>
            <li> it smells just like rosehips is supposed to lightly nutty.</li>
            <li> The oil I received had a light greenish/gray tint to it which tells me it was NOT rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> fast.the smell is tolerable and fades when product has been absorbed by the skin and even if i use it under my make up it doesnt make my face oily but with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the oil for about a week and it seems great.</li>
            <li> Makes a great carrier oil for some healing essential oils too.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for an amazing product</li>
            <li> The quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a secure package in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Probably a combination of soy, rapeseed and cheap olive oil.  </li>
            <li> What a  FABULOUS OIL.  </li>
            <li> This is a great facial moisturizer.</li>

            <li> &amp;#34; I wanna say thank you for the seller for the free samples.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to keep on hand for when I ran out of my current Rosehip oil which I purchased at a great price on another online store.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s light and it absorbs into the skin immediately.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent.</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil goes on the skin smoothly and doesn’t leave my skin greasy after.</li>
            <li> Where the Sukin immediately absorbed into my skin leaving it glowing and moisturized, the Radha sits on top of my skin leaving it oily and glossy.</li>
            <li> Yes I got a coupon for a free product for review</li>
            <li> Radha&#x27;s is scent free and 100% rosehip oil</li>

            <li> I did receive it for free through AMZ review trader.</li>
            <li> The cobalt blue container is attractive and also works to prevent sunlight damaging the oil inside.</li>
            <li> Cheap eye dropper.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this Rosehip oil on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> Rosehip seed oil is great for overall body moisturizing (not greasy) and also face cleansing.</li>
            <li> So happy that I found Rosehip Oil &amp; is now part of my daily anti aging beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to mix in with essential oils and use as a face cream.  </li>
            <li> think this is fantastic</li>
            <li> This would be a great carrier oil to add some therapeutic, healing essential oils to for skin</li>
            <li> received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li> and I will be using my own products as much as I can.</li>
            <li> The product is fresh, it&#x27;s authentic, and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Light smell just started using it</li>
            <li> As a result, my skin is always smooth and luminous.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and softer.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated the information booklet that was emailed to me about the rose hip oil.</li>
            <li> such a great product.</li>
            <li> i got this product for free to review</li>
            <li> Orde free.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s leak free.</li>
            <li> 10 star all the way,,,,,its fantastic</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d like to warn others if they receive a light colored, basically unscented oil in a brown bottle, to just return it.  </li>
            <li> one is light color with nutty smell( this company) - no problem</li>
            <li> and if there is, it&#x27;s extremely light.</li>
            <li> This way the oil is absorbed into the skin better.</li>
            <li> Skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m applying it to my face to help smooth my skin and soothe rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Rose hip oil comes from the seeds of a specific variety of rose, Rosa aff. rubiginosa or Rosa moschata.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> ; So far so good using it on my face under my moisturizer mornings and evenings.</li>
            <li> So far, so good though.</li>
            <li> So far is good.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on smoothly, and stays fresh looking for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> I love all kinds of facial oils, and this a another good one.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell results, however so far so good.  </li>
            <li> For those rave reviews that state this is wonderful facial oil, I can only wonder if these people 1) Are real users of this oil; 2) Are familiar with authentic rosehip seed oil; 3) Are getting good results because its an oil and any natural oil is good for the face.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil absorbs right into the hair, making my hair shinier, softer, and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Works beautifully on my über dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time purchasing/using rosehip oil, so I have nothing to compare but this oil soaks into my skin nicely and has no unpleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> I mix an essential oil for nerve repair in with it, it&#x27;s lovely!!</li>
            <li> The blue tinted bottle is also very nice because I can leave it sitting on the counter</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Free and WORTH it!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the results so far and plan on continuing the routine!</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a good skin product for my sensitive skin because it has no fillers of any kind!</li>
            <li> Blends well with all my EOs for a wonderful and highly absorbable facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So fresh, nourishing, mild and lovely.</li>
            <li> It is a light, easily and quickly absorbed oil.</li>
            <li> The Radha brand is great—cold-pressed for maximum vitamins, very handy dropper, really gorgeous thick blue glass bottle that makes me feel good every time I see it on the shelf.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Radha, for the opportunity to try such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Big fan of this rose hip oil!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to add this to my collection of oils.</li>
            <li> Radha Soami means &amp;#34;Lord of the Soul&amp;#34;, a term I am familiar with on my meditation path.</li>
            <li> I have continued to use it and with each passing day my facial skin looks so much better, it has a healthy glow, my complexion is more even toned and it feels softer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy my rose hip oil from Radha again!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about contact with the seller in sharing information on the many wonderful uses for the essential oils she carries.  </li>
            <li> amazing product, definitely gonna buy again, it makes your skin look more hydratated and smooth</li>
            <li> I was so excited once I received the package.</li>
            <li> I have even used it on a fresh tattoo!  </li>
            <li> I was actually excited when it came.</li>
            <li> Even though I was not sure what to expect upon purchasing this, I am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> After opening it the first thing I did was smell it and to my surprise it had no scent at all, even after applied to skin it has no scent which I love.</li>
            <li> and I can already tell a significant difference.  </li>
            <li> Not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This may just be the first product which keeps advertised promises:).</li>
            <li> was excited to receive this to test out and review.</li>
            <li> I am excited to add this to my oil regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used, and enjoyed the benefits of, other Rose Hip oil, but I love the purity of Radha.</li>
            <li> The important thing is the oil seems nice so far, it takes time to soak in...</li>
            <li> The oil is light, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on clothing or bedding.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Five stars is not enough but that&#x27;s what it when up to, it&#x27;s by far the best</li>
            <li> and if anyone can shed more factual light on the color/odor thing, it would be appreciated.  </li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is an incredible product––it absorbs quickly, so no worries about getting oil on clothing, paper, etc.</li>
            <li> and it left my skin looking amazing and healthy.</li>
            <li> for my dry skin,it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> It is light and non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many bottles of rosehip oil and never have I smelled a more rancid old smell.</li>
            <li> However, I can attest that this oil is light, absorbs quickly and does not leave the skin greasy.</li>
            <li> Also Radha&#x27;s shipping is quick and secure.</li>
            <li> what an amazing product, my skin feels so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I love the smooth feel and fast absorption.  </li>
            <li> What surprised me the most however, was the effect it had on the &amp;#34;coffee stains&amp;#34; on my face and hands, they&#x27;re virtually gone!  </li>
            <li> I am reviewing this product and so far love it!</li>
            <li> My body is so soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li> This oil works miracles to keep them soft and smooth without leaving a greasy residue that makes me feel like I&#x27;m going to slip and fall!!</li>
            <li> Very good product, I wish it was a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Rich, smooth and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> The oil is absorbed into the skin quickly and it wont make you feel greasy!</li>
            <li> I use it on my face right before bed!</li>
            <li> I am reordering product right now!</li>
            <li> Since purchasing, I also learned that rosehip oil is excellent for aging skin and have found that the oil, applied under my eyes, has visibly reduced my fine lines (more so than my expensive cosmetic creams, which I discontinued using while trying the oil).</li>
            <li> and I have problem skin ( usually I have to have oil free products), this product moisturizes without clogging my pores, very good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I use it in my bath and it leaves my skin so soft and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li> IT IS AMAZING, I AM 100 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li> Really amazing for moisture and soft skin.</li>
            <li> So after just a few days I am pretty impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> and I can tell how much I&#x27;m going to love it already.</li>
            <li> so glad I found this product I have suffered with eczema my whole life</li>
            <li> My skin glows creamy with a gentle rosey-ness, and a dewey youthful rounding out of my more angular features is taking place.  </li>
            <li> , compare effects against the outcomes of different products, arrive at conclusions that are fair and balanced.  </li>
            <li> (one was for a friend) and at 4oz they are a good deal, but their only benefit for me, seems to be as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is i really need to make my skin healthy.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference, if any yet around my stretch marks or scars, but I have noticed that the skin around the area looks healthier, is better moisturized and softer than it was 5 days ago.</li>
            <li> I am an herbalist and know that this should be a light amber to reddish color and have a distinct aroma.</li>
            <li> A full 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Also, having done comparable reviews on similar products, I see that Radha Rosehip Oil is competitively priced, so it is a good value.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good  about the organic Rosehip Oil.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner, helps with my son&#x27;s eczema a whole lot more than just lotion or creams.</li>
            <li> This is a true head-to-toe product that has a multitude of uses.</li>
            <li> However, the true test will be during the winter months ahead.  </li>
            <li> no breakouts either!My stretch marks(they&#x27;re more than 5 yrs old,so i didnt expect much)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often, but this product is everything it says it is and more.  </li>

            <li> and I expect it to last for a good while.</li>

            <li> Oil absorbs quickly . . .</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil absorbs so quickly.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel greasy and soaks into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li> and it has a mildly fishy odor.</li>
            <li> Not to mention super hydrated and no longer oily.</li>
            <li> Felt better the next day :)</li>
            <li> I cant believe how quickly it started smoothing my wrinkles and did not cause a rosacea flare up</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and I put on some Vaseline to lock in the oil.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s super moisturizing but not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I love how my face  is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped quickly and well packaged.   </li>
            <li> The color does provide benefits to protecting the product from degrading as quickly too.</li>
            <li> but it goes away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly without an oil residue.</li>
            <li> I also started using a mild salacylic 2% wash in addition to the oil.</li>
            <li> Am so happy I found this on Amazon, at such a reasonable price....</li>
            <li> I told her maybe it was the oil but couldn&#x27;t believe a product worked so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Also, this goes on like an oil, but it does absorb quickly, so it will not leave you feeling or looking oily.</li>
            <li> I add my essential oils to it daily for a perfect moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of your many different types of oils.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for making such a great product and for caring about your customers.  </li>
            <li> but it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 6 months pregnant</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m super grateful that I found this...</li>

            <li> Really quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Very nice skin oil, light in color and clear, with barely any scent.</li>
            <li> The dropper is actually very easy to use, and the overall shape of the bottle makes it easy to hold as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both products :)</li>
            <li> I enjoy this oil very much.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend trying it if you haven&#x27;t done so already.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very fast and if you apply it at night, you will wake up with skin smooth like a baby.</li>
            <li> High quality  Rosehip oil for sure.</li>
            <li> I received my Radha Rosehip Oil in a beautiful blue glass bottle with a separate dropper from the cap, the packaging was very professional</li>
            <li> I have used other oils on my face, and this one is, by far, the best I have used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a different brand of rosehip seed oil before and was very pleased with those results, but not these.  </li>
            <li> Very, very orange!</li>
            <li> I received my first bottle from Radha free as a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience after using their product.</li>
            <li> All organic, I am fast becoming a fan of Radha Beauty Products</li>
            <li> Still very pretty.</li>
            <li> My order arrived -securely packed-within the week and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am just starting to use all natural skin care products on my face and this one does so many good things for your skin</li>
            <li> Nice light oil, absorbs nicely, Organic, and VERY IMPORTANT, NOT tested on animals, and since real rosehip oil is fragrance free this can be mixed with any other of your choice.</li>
            <li> so my tummy had some undesirable looseness that made me feel less physically attractive).  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried Rosehip Oil and so far it seems to work amazingly.</li>
            <li> I opened all 4 and tried them alternately to see if some bottles were as good as the first</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and I didn’t feel a need for moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It absorbed reasonably quickly and I have that dewy skin</li>
            <li> It is super fresh, lightweight, and scent-less.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing and came very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m very old, so there&#x27;s no hope for the Grand Canyon-like crevices, which line my face, but Radha Rosehip Oil has lessened the redness, and flakiness.</li>
            <li> This is a very high grade oil that is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00LNOV8JO ORGANIC Rosehip Oil - 4 Ounce &amp;#x2605; 100% Pure USDA Certified Organic &amp;#x2605; BEST MOISTURIZER to heal Dry Skin, Fine Lines, Stretch Marks, Eczema, Acne Scars, &amp; More! &amp;#x2605; Cold Pressed, Virgin Rose hip Seed Oil For Face and Skin &amp;#x2605</li>
            <li> ,  I got acne after I used at the first week !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally starting to love the way my skin looks, and I can&#x27;t wait to see the improvements over time!</li>
            <li> The first day I used this product, I was amazed!</li>
            <li> Thanks Radha Skincare!!</li>

            <li> Love this product,  I can see clear results on my skin!</li>
            <li> Packaging is pretty to boot!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I do a lot  of  work with essential  oils and love this!</li>
            <li> It absorbs wonderfully, has little to no odor, and makes my skin super soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Spots and scars heal MUCH more quickly with the help of rosehip oil, and when I use 1-3 drops in my masks, my skin is always soft and refreshed when I rinse the mask off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and have very sensitive, fair, combination, and acne-prone skin...</li>
            <li> However, the bottle that I just ordered is very light and clear.  </li>
            <li> With all the benefits of rosehip I was able to retire many of my  chemical ridden store bought lotions and creams and replaced it with this one all natural product.the bottle is a very nice looking dark blue glass and its easily applied with the dropper that comes with it.</li>
            <li> and I am not seeing as much settling and creasing into the fine lines under my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, this oil is a great little</li>
            <li> It works great alone or by adding a few drops to my moisturizer or body lotion.</li>
            <li> It is very silky with a light scent.  </li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Radha Organic Rosehip oil and it has done some amazing things for my skin.  </li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is amazing, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Even though i&#x27;ve only been using for 3 days now, it&#x27;s amazing how my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> every day for years to calm my skin down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a woman prone to skin damage, I want to say - thank you so much for making this product available....</li>
            <li> The oil soaks into the skin, making your skin very silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> so the oil stays fresh</li>
            <li> I could see my laugh lines start to diminish and</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I added an essential oil like lavender or rose (diluted)</li>
            <li> This bottle is lacking the golden color I&#x27;ve come to expect.</li>
            <li> , never have I ever come across a product that I&#x27;ve put on my face that has had such astounding results.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> After a couple of days I&#x27;m amazed how it was absorbed but not greasy.</li>
            <li> This comes complete with a glass eye dropper which aids in usage of this oil to make sure your recipes are on point.</li>
            <li> My only thought it that 4 ounces is A LOT of rose hip oil.  </li>
            <li> I like to put it on before my makeup because it gives the makeup a fresh dewy look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing has helped moisturize my skin more, and reduce old scars, than this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try it.</li>
            <li> I liked that oil enough to want to re-purchase rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this 4 oz bottle from Radha, and, in comparing the two, I would not go back to Eve Hansen, though I liked that oil, too.  </li>
            <li> though that would be nice.go back to Eve Hansen, though I liked that oil, too.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin feeling smooth but not greasy; I&#x27;ve enjoyed putting it in baths for an extra but of moisture as well as adding it to lotions.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve seen a difference in the reduction of lines, especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I recently tried some of the Rosehip oil at a friends house and my skin was immediately more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never shelling out that sort of money again when this product is truly superior, minus the chemical garbage, and does wonders for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rose water and this this oil kicks up the results an extra notch.</li>
            <li> This far I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> Not only was the rosehip oil of top quality, It also came with a free book on the benefits of rosehip oil and how to use it.  </li>
            <li> but I may return it and reorder my last rose hip oil purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using rose hip oil for several years on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> So far I am in love with this product ...</li>
            <li> So far, I love the rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I used it full strength at first</li>
            <li> I use it at night and my skin looks fresh and plump in the a.m.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if any one of these people commenting have gotten a truly FRESH bottle of Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> #34;what is that musty, fishy smell?&amp;#34; only to conclude that it was my own face.  </li>
            <li> Love this rosehip oil as it makes my skin hydrated &amp; soft and don&#x27;t feel greasy after apply it.  </li>
            <li> If you are a rose hip oil fan you should definitely consider trying this brand.</li>
            <li> &amp;  there is a natural odor with this, though it has so many advantages for your skin, that makes up for that...</li>
            <li> It has no smell on its own, so I can smell whatever Essential oil</li>
            <li> Unless something changes for the worse, I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again, for sure!!!!</li>
            <li> I have just discovered the benefits of using rose oil daily.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have that distinct &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34; smell that rosehip seed oil has.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face every night and my skin has become so soft, smooth and radiant!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how soft it makes my skin when I mix it with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice dark glass bottle, has a dropper packaged separately, and it shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an Organic Rosehip Oil to help keep my skin from becoming dry and am so glad I found this.</li>
            <li> It is healing scars pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> It seems a bit oily when you first put it on, but it soaks in the skin quickly so your skin doesn&#x27;t feel all oily.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it smells a little funny (kind of like toasted wood?).</li>
            <li> I was hoping to see a more dramatic difference in my redness, but all in all, it seems great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already using vitamin C serum with hyluronic acid which also good for removing spots and a host of other things.</li>
            <li> must admit I&#x27;m excited to use it every day because I believe it&#x27;s something really helpful and healing for the skin.</li>
            <li> I am sure that it is good for my skin but have not used it long enough to see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Once again, the company is very good to seal the bottle with a screw on lid and provide the extra long dropper to use with the oil.</li>
            <li> nice glass bottle and dropper which makes it easy to not make a mess</li>
            <li> I soaks right it.</li>
            <li> It feels silky and soaks right in.  </li>
            <li> Heard about this company from Banana Blondie and ordered right away.</li>
            <li> although it is an oil.. goes on like silk and absorbs right into skin... leaves skin radiant...</li>
            <li> Could feel and see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> I got my product right on time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a right amount for me.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel refreshed when applied right before bedtime.  </li>
            <li> I put it on skin (elbow and knees) and hair right after I take a shower.</li>
            <li> I was referred to this oil, and I am so glad I did purchase it, it leaves my skin so soft and smooth, it is diminishing my wrinkles at a nice rate, i feel so much better when i use this produce,  there are so many things that u can do with this product,  put a few drops on your hands and rub into your hair after shower, gets rid of Frizz among other things.  </li>
            <li> I most certainly intend to purchase this again, along with the Lavendar, &amp; may even give the new Tea-Tree a try.</li>
            <li> The dropper applicator made it very easy to apply just enough oil to my face.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, I am very cautious on what I put on my face, I dislike products that are very grease and leave my face the same way, but I fell in love with this oil as soon as I tried it</li>
            <li> I am glad that Amazon made we aware of it as I make an oil based facial cream incorporating several oils in a cream base and am very happy to include this wonderful oil.  </li>
            <li> I blend with a few EOs and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> The oil doesn&#x27;t smell or look like the rosehip seed oil I&#x27;ve bought in the past, nor does it have its great results.  </li>
            <li> Came fast in the mail and everything that was said - is true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few days and am loving what I&#x27;m seeing!  </li>
            <li> I am old enough to stop looking for newer, better, latest.  </li>
            <li> After all the great reviews about being great for sensitive skin, this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It is so soothing, absorbs quickly, and has made my skin super soft!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting constant compliments on my skin, and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my fine lines around my eyes and the lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> The next day I used just a drop per each area of my face (right cheek, left cheek, forehead, and nose/chin and had great results.</li>
            <li> Even though I have a very dry, allergic and sensitive skin, I am absolutely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> and sure enough it smelled exactly what is should smell like!  </li>
            <li> I already own two other brands but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive a coupon to receive this item for free</li>
            <li> last night I rubbed a few drops on the burn and this morning I woke up to a beautiful tan (no peeling!)</li>
            <li> and I think an oil like this will come in handy after the vigorous hand washing and colder dry weather that is bound to happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a week or so, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Order shipped fast and I received it really quickly.</li>
            <li> I look for products that are natural feeling and work to easy the  aging on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also absorbs super fast.</li>
            <li> The rose hip oil is terrific, and I really like that it is organic and cold-pressed.  </li>
            <li> After a week I just had thoughts how I could live without this oil before!!!</li>
            <li> Very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> So easy and simple for keeping your skin healthy and young!  </li>
            <li> I am a very satidfied customer and would recommend this wonderful oil to anyone looking to add to or remake their current beauty routine into an organic, clean and green routine!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is good for my skin and not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t sink into my skin very fast</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> This product has NO smell, is very light in color, similar to almond oil or something.</li>
            <li> The oil came very fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very reasonably priced for an  orgaic product.</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much</li>
            <li> For now, I am impressed with how incredibly soft it leaves my skin without the usual side effects that I typically have with any kind of scented product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used it to cleanse my face (I know adding oil sounds counter-productive, but it is actually really good for skin), used it as a cuticle oil and applied a little bit to the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> The product that I received is the proper clear golden amber color and the scent is strong but sweet which quickly fades away.</li>
            <li> This product is not scented and I was surprised at the huge bottle, which is a colored glass (prevents breakdown of the oil) and comes with a dropper in the lid.</li>

            <li> Since it was the first time I have bought Rosehip Oil</li>
            <li> My skin becomes much brighter !</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased it</li>
            <li> First off, I will say that this company&#x27;s customer service was as advertised</li>

            <li> Received my order several days ago and love it.....</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> From the first drop, the improvement to my skin is evident.</li>
            <li> Unadulterated, directly out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> its my first time using it.</li>

            <li> I love this not only does it work well for wrinkles  </li>
            <li> Now this does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I felt an immediate improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I do LOVE this product and will order it again in the future.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I had ever used rosehip oil</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s probably still 3/4 or even more left.</li>
            <li> which wasn&#x27;t a pretty situation.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> the first time I order one I use it all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update later if I get more info.</li>
            <li> Was sceptical of all the claims at first.</li>
            <li> Use at nite and first thing in the am.</li>
            <li> Natural, cheap and ez to apply.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Glad I got the big bottle.</li>
            <li> The only thing that could&#x27;ve made this purchase better would have been to include the dropper as pictured.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, definitely will order again. 😍</li>
            <li> I only wish it was a pump rather then a dropper top.  </li>
            <li> After using the Rosehip Oil for 3 weeks, my face fells smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love using it on my face as it helps even my skin tone and smooth over old acne scars from my teen years.  </li>
            <li> Love mixing with essential oils!</li>
            <li> My first order from Radha seemed legit.</li>
            <li> First time trying Rosehip oil</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery on my elbow (july 9th 2015) and i LOVE this already.</li>
            <li> so that when I run out, I will know exactly what I will buy.  </li>
            <li> I gotta say I absolutely adore this oil!  </li>
            <li> I love it, use it every night before bed, on my entire body not just my face.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a week and love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I could tell just by the fact that there was a glass dropper that this oil was much better than many I have bought in stores in the past.</li>
            <li> and I love the color of the blue bottle.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Radha!</li>
            <li> I did the first 3 days without.</li>
            <li> Most products are in tiny bottles.</li>
            <li> The oil is smooth, has a soft scent and blends well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rosehip Oil from other companies and find this to be my FAVORITE!</li>
            <li> Love the rosehip essential oil.</li>
            <li> Using it daily on my face and love the results.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> using it in essential oil body butter recipe. :)</li>
            <li> Only the purest oils are even considered for our products and we just love Radha Rosehip and so do our customers.</li>
            <li> AT FIRST, BUT</li>
            <li> I bought this after doing some research and reading other people&#x27;s review and I love it!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe how useful this oil is on everything.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a week consistently each morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I managed to make it into the tester group for this product when it first came out.</li>
            <li> Love Radha Rosehip Oil and will definitely purchase again.  </li>
            <li> DEFINITELY WILL ORDER MORE</li>
            <li> so the top couldn&#x27;t open.  </li>
            <li> It REALLY DOES speed up the healing process!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly in a lovely blue bottle and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> I will order from this company again and hope someone like Sean is around the next time I buy a car :)</li>
            <li> Stellar product.</li>
            <li> I plan on visiting the Radha web site and exploring more uses, such as on my hair.  </li>
            <li> That was my first experience with an Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> It is oily when you first put it on, and it does take sometime for it to absorb.  </li>
            <li> Product as described, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s doing, to the finer lines; I only know my skin feels better, after a week of using the product.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> It is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different kinds of lotions, and not one has worked as well as Radha Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a big 4oz bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li> Well, when first applied it does but then absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first time using this type of oil</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE beauty product that i use daily.  </li>
            <li> IT MAKE MY FACE SMOOTH AND SOFT</li>
            <li> Not only will I be purchasing more of the rosehip oil from this company, I also will be purchasing some for both my daughters.</li>
            <li> ;-).</li>
            <li> This is my first purshase of Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> This is also my first use.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product - its the only thing I&#x27;ve been using for moisture all summer.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> first time for me to used this product</li>
            <li> I would definitely order this product again:)</li>
            <li> The first night I tried it</li>
            <li> I think I used too many drops and was left with an oily coating on my skin.</li>
            <li> Low odor and better quality.</li>
            <li> Love the rosehip oil, can tell already the different in my skin texture</li>
            <li> Fast ship!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> and I definitely see them getting better.</li>
            <li> this oil left my face with a lovely rosey glow</li>
            <li> very comparable to argon oil!  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Overall I am so pleased to have found this natural beauty product!!!!</li>
            <li> The next morning my skin feels super smooth.  </li>
            <li> Love the deep blue bottle and the dropper makes it so easy to dispense the right amount for my face.</li>
            <li> Intense moisture, absorbs right away.</li>
            <li> I had heard of rosehip oil and always wanted to try,  I had previously bought the Radha Vitamin C Serum and was very pleased, so I decided to jump in to try the Rosehip Oil in my quest to correct my sun damaged skin ...</li>
            <li> This particular brand is very light in color and free of odor unlike other brands.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have indicated, I put it on before bed and my skin feels amazing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It is either refined beyond recognition or not actually rosehip seed oil, which should have a mild woody scent and a rich amber color.</li>
            <li> The subtle scent of this oil is great</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be dry these days and it turns more soft and smooth after i apply the oil.  </li>
            <li> Received my order extremely fast, and I can not rave enough about how fabulous This product is!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Rosehip oil that I have use so far.</li>
            <li> First of all the smell of this oil is earthy and pure so you know that no fragrance has been added.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it a little while before I wrote a review, and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> If you get the chance to research it a bit, you&#x27;ll find it has some wonderful qualities for helping the body such as being full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much</li>
            <li> Well worth the money and highly recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li> No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li> and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> I Can&#x27;t get over the positive effects it already has made on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have seen nothing but positive effects on my skin from this.</li>
            <li> It has a particular smell right when you put it on</li>
            <li> Thanks to all the reviews, I thought this should be my first oil to try.  </li>
            <li> Really made a difference after the first application.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much RADHA !</li>
            <li> It really does absorb fast!</li>
            <li> On my face, twice a day, on my feet, once or twice a day, and pretty much anything else I could think of.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried it I keep marveling at how the fingers I used to apply it felt so much softer than the others.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much every organic plant oil you can think of: argan, jojoba, coconut, kukui,  almond, squalene, primrose...</li>
            <li> Also, Radha offers good advice and information on their product that other companies do not.</li>
            <li> I use more of it before bed as a night and eye cream cream, and less in the morning, when I rub in my tinted BB cream on right over it—it actually makes my makeup blend better than without the rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Very light, sweet scent, almost imperceptible,  </li>
            <li> , my skin was already starting to look healthier and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> When I took my concerns outside of amazon to a group that tests and analyzes EOs, they had many concerns over this company and their responses they are giving to customers regarding this particular EO.</li>
            <li> , I don have any major skin tone issues, but my overall complexion seems really nice.</li>
            <li> I had to finish using my last face cream and have only used this the last two nights, but I am extremely impressed so far.  </li>
            <li> Smells wonderful although I have not actually used it other than in one recipe where I found the smell did not last.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen none of that for myself (nothing more significant than the current products used currently).  </li>
            <li> and I have seen none of that for myself (nothing more significant than the current products used currently).  </li>
            <li> I did receive this oil at a promotional discount price, but I would definitely pay full price for it, as it can also be used on one&#x27;s hair and scalp to alleviate dandruff as well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use the product, as I have pretty much falling in love with it and already feel as if it is one of those personal care products I just cannot live without.</li>
            <li> being more on the dry side and</li>
            <li> I tried so many products to dry out my face to prevent the oilyness which made my skin freak out.</li>
            <li> With they being said, my face produced more oil to help compensate for me trying to dry it out</li>
            <li> This is a big bottle and the dropper makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> love this product, it was a bit oilier than i had anticipated but has already in a week helped dry skin patches on my arms and elbows.</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers clog my giant pores, but this absorbs cleanly and instantly.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin so smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li> It soaks into the skin quickly and leaves it feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> so I really love how it moisturizes the really dry and flaky areas of my skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild acne as an adult</li>
            <li> I mix it with pure aloe Vera and wear overnight to moisturize after using drying acne products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is pure rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> This product states its 100% pure organic rosehip seed oil with no fillers.</li>
            <li> Does not have the appearance of pure Rosehip oil or smell.  </li>
            <li> Radha Rosehip seed Oil is pure and healing.</li>
            <li> I’m not convinced that this is pure Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> #34;scent of pure rosehip oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to be how pure rosehip oil is described.</li>
            <li> 4 OZ, note the large size for the price of an ounce.  </li>
            <li> it is a large amount, me and my mom being using it</li>
            <li> I absolutely live it!!</li>
            <li> In fact, I bought some very expensive serum from a famous skin care line recently, which came with a sample of the line&#x27;s best selling moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality pure oil .  </li>
            <li> Even though your skin absorbs the oil quickly you don&#x27;t need but a few drops, and it won&#x27;t clog up your pores so it&#x27;s safe for oily skin and T-zones.</li>
            <li> I am 44, this oil seems makes me break out which is odd because I thought it&#x27;s good for mature skin.  </li>
            <li> Using the rosehip oil, I am seeing continued improvement in the texture and diminished appearance of fine facial lines and reduced depth of deeper lines.</li>
            <li> bottle left, and it has kept just fine at room temperature.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible smell, just odd and not one I love, so I put a drop of an essential oil to it when I use it.</li>
            <li> This product is very high quality and Organic to boot.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I had very high hopes.</li>
            <li> I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Very high quality Rosehip Seed oil.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it oo early to live a complete review</li>
            <li> I was having a dry skin scaly  breakout on my right palm, so I applied the Radha rose hip oil last night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it mixed with other oils in a coconut oil carrier on blemishes and dry skin with great results!</li>
            <li> I use it primarily under my eyes, but on super dry days, I have used it all over my face with no problems with my pores or new blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be repurchasing this product when my huge 4 oz.</li>
            <li> The oil is light yellow color and doesn’t really have a smell.</li>
            <li> Thanks seller for introduced such a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> and I added my choice of essential oils, and now my skin is happy, glowing, and firm.</li>
            <li> It soaks it really well and leaves no greasy residue feeling.</li>
            <li> You just don&#x27;t get customer service like that very often.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It soaks in really fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need much to cover your whole face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> I used it on my heels and they are already so much softer and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this company and oil!</li>
            <li> every night, after washing my face (with a gentle soap), I apply a couple of drops on my face.</li>
            <li> This product really delivers.</li>
            <li> My skin texture is SOoooo much smoother.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  </li>
            <li> I definitely received genuine rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really been a blessing to have found this oil.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> such a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs really well into my skin</li>
            <li> Now I just use it straight and don&#x27;t even notice the smell.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I do my chores and at the end of the day my face is still very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have been using it at night on my face and neck, and I really like the results.  </li>
            <li> Very hydrating.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> My wife bought it, She loves it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find it works well for whole body.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previous Review:&lt;br /&gt;I had read that rosehip oil is very beneficial for the skin</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that it does not have much of a smell.</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair but did not have much luck.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have aging skin</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch</li>
            <li> My reason for trying rosehip oil is to counteract the dryness from the melasma / brown spot/enlarged pores treatments that I&#x27;ve been using that have been really drying on my skin.</li>
            <li> and this makes it feel really nice.d for applying the oil</li>
            <li> I use this oil at night after exfoliating, you can really feel the blood rise to your face</li>
            <li> It had a very fishy scent.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY SILKY OIL.  </li>
            <li> I like how well and how fast it worked.</li>
            <li> They work very well together.  </li>
            <li> It has not broken me out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Came fast.</li>
            <li> When I received the product free to review it my only expectation</li>
            <li> For real oil.</li>
            <li> Really unsure about the contents of bottle.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I also have issues with eczema and using this oil has really helped improve my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks Radha Beauty.</li>
            <li> I use it straight out of the bottle to moisturize my hands.  </li>
            <li> Very Moisturizing for the skin without creating any irritations or acne issues.</li>
            <li> so I really shouldn&#x27;t say anything as I know that you gotta judge these things in along run.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and was packed very well.</li>
            <li> The oil doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and is orange in color.</li>
            <li> ordered it and it came fast.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and can be used on the face and neck without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since October and my skin is so much healthier both in appearance and to the touch.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Radha Beauty for introducing me to your products-</li>
            <li> In the morning my heels are much softer.  </li>
            <li> and this has really helped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the dryness of cold winter days.  </li>
            <li> I think this is because when I feel the area, it is so soft, but it has absorbed quite well and does not look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I am planning to get one for my mother, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived fast and the company representative even called to check if I had arrived</li>
            <li> haha...</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin softer also seems some of the wrinkles aren&#x27;t so noticeable</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with some skepticism as to how well it would REALLY work to reduce the appearance of stretch marks, saggy skin, etc.  </li>
            <li> The oil came well packaged and sealed very well</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t put it over my whole face.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this oil!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much product I received.  </li>
            <li> After speaking with Sean, another user, she confirmed that it definitely was the oil.</li>
            <li> Now my Mom wants a bottle too.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that really stand up to the claim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy and fast absorbent.</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> but, the really selling point of the Radha brand is that you get 4 ounces of the oil.</li>
            <li> but it is very moisturizing and makes my skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li> Oily skin like mines don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need much makeup to give me an even skin tone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work upright, I have to tilt the whole dropper when I&#x27;m using it</li>
            <li> She had some surgery that requires gently massaging the incisions and finds it very soothing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t gaze into the mirror, much, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling everyone how much this oil has helped my skin.</li>
            <li> As for it being organic, I can&#x27;t say much about that.  </li>
            <li> This oil is very moisture but not oily.</li>
            <li> really does help with itching.  </li>
            <li> My heels are always rough and cracked because I love going barefoot all the time.</li>
            <li> But this oil is actually helping to heal pimples faster and make my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m VERY picky about my skincare products.</li>
            <li> Thanks Radha for this quality product.</li>
            <li> It can really be used all over your body though.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my hands and it really helps moisturize my skin, even after washing my hands -which</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t really come with any instructions for use</li>
            <li> The company also packaged it very well</li>
            <li> It was very moisturizing and made my skin softer and reduced the visibilty of the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I also really appreciated the Radha follow up and usage tips.  </li>
            <li> The packaging on this was also very well done.  </li>
            <li> Really making a difference, feeling softer and healthier</li>
            <li> We already tried it out and it fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Not that you really notice it to begin with!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> oil absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s not much control over how many drops you can squeeze it</li>
            <li> but it got very oily.</li>
            <li> Therosehip oil really helped.</li>
            <li> For me, since I&#x27;m unsure of what kind of oil I actually got, I won&#x27;t be using it and have requested a refund (which is currently processing).</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel, and the next morning it still feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> This rose hip oil sinks into my skin completely, leaving it supple and hydrated but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I liked the product at fist, but the oil in my third and forth bottle came completely different than the fist two.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different rose hip oils.</li>
            <li> My always red skin is soothed nicely by it when I apply it in the evenings, and I wake with a definite glow.</li>
            <li> my skin looks more clear and younger.</li>
            <li> Sean offered the kind of customer service missing in today&#x27;s often impersonal shopping experience: personable, polite, and knowledgable.</li>
            <li> I warm a few drops of oil between the hands by rubbing, then I gently pat the oil onto my face and decollete.  </li>
            <li> I have used the product since it arrived (08/08/2014) and am able to provide the following review: I developed a heat rash on my neck and used the oil to test it out.</li>
            <li> this is most certainly NOT Rosehip seed oil.  </li>
            <li> wow..just wow !!!</li>
            <li> Makes skin SO SOFT and not oily AT ALL!!!</li>
            <li> Light and super gentle on my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to oils, which first began with coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> Was ok i wounder  if it really organic used 6 other rosehip oil</li>
            <li> Loving it so far along with the other products</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, &amp; good for dry feet legs, dry skin, damaged skin, &amp; a beauty aid...</li>
            <li> but it definetly works great on skin and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I want to give rosehip oil a chance, due to my severe eczema, but this product makes me hesitant to even use it more than once.</li>
            <li> I don;t see any difference than most other non-cooking oils.</li>
            <li> Great quality and a LITTLE bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way, so this is a great value for me.</li>
            <li> I found that it goes on easier than many other oils, and that I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of Rosehip oil and they were lovely too,</li>
            <li> I love it and can&#x27;t wait to try it for other uses.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it only 2 weeks, too soon to see major changes</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I love what this product does for my dry, sensitive, aging skin!</li>
            <li> I am giving a 3 right now because I have not used this specific product long, but have used rosehip seed oil for a while and love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few Rosehip oils in the past, and this is the best yet!</li>
            <li> I love this product as its makes my skin so soft and it really heal your dry skin</li>
            <li> I really like the first one it clear color and doesn&#x27;t have smell .</li>
            <li> I am  a true believer that it really just may be the Holy Grail...or something very similar.</li>
            <li> it absorbs very quickly but doesn&#x27;t dry out at all.  </li>
            <li> far Rosehip Oil has done an amazing job fading those dark marks......</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used rosehip oil, and I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li> No nasty rancid smell, clean and moisturizing without irritating my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (fabulous...very light, easy spreading, not tacky or thick).</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry (ok mature) skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this rosehip oil on my face with geranium essential oil and really like the way it absorbs quickly, leaving my face well-moisturized but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is huge and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really like that the only ingredient is rosehip oil because I like using natural products on my skin rather than product filled with chemicals.</li>
            <li> After just six days of applying this oil twice a day, my skin is almost completely clear for the first time in months.</li>
            <li> i dry skin it moisturizes helps with fine lines.</li>
            <li> , i apply 2 to 3 drops of rosehip oil into my hair, instantly my hair gets smooth and soft, it tamm hair frizz!</li>
            <li> I might give it more stars in the future except that I&#x27;m noticing a weird trend on Amazon where sellers ask for reviews to be posted (which is fair)</li>
            <li> a man I don&#x27;t like using such product,  she forced it to use it, it worked pretty well  :P</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t realize the full benefits until I used this on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I did test it on my hands first, but the product had act sensitively to my face.</li>
            <li> NOT good for me, but daughter loved the product.</li>
            <li> I use it with natural essential oils to help combate acne, and fine lines/wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is great on my alligator dry legs, have not used it long enough for results on wrinkles or Sun damage.</li>
            <li> I have hypothyroidism, which causes extremely dry skin, and this is the first product I have found that gives me smooth, baby soft skin.  </li>
            <li> but the smell is a little overwhelming (very smoky.)  </li>
            <li> The oil I received was very fresh and the bottle has a long dropper, which I like for oil, easier than a pump.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it 4 days so far but already see a significant change in the texture of my skin where it was showing the most dryness, areas I wasn&#x27;t seeing results when using the other Olay and Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li> As I had used other brand before, I really like this product as it does not have a strong smell at all.</li>
            <li> Great price as well in comparison to other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Feel like I have been given a whole body of new skin.  </li>
            <li> Both seem to go on very smoothly and to absorb into the skin very quickly (not immediately, but in an hour or so, my skin (face) did not seem very oily).  </li>
            <li> Both seem to go on very smoothly and to absorb into the skin very quickly (not immediately, but in an hour or so, my skin (face) did not seem very oily).  </li>
            <li> Less redness, more even skintone&amp; texture.</li>
            <li> I wear less makeup and my skin feels more supple.</li>
            <li> Since my first review, I&#x27;ve also added this product to my hair regimen, so pretty much every day, I apply 1-2 drops to the ends of my long, fine, breakage-prone hair to prevent split ends and keep them soft and shiny between washes, and I&#x27;ve mixed it with jojoba and EVOO for oil treatments.</li>
            <li> I feel I do notice the elusive &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; after applying it but be warned, less is more.</li>
            <li> Even though it is oil, I have noticed that I get less shiny throughout the day, my skin is smoother, and my makeup looks better for longer.</li>
            <li> For this product using less is definitely more.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even, less inflammation,  clearing blemishes, and smoothing out any scars.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many different moisturizers and this one finally does the trick.  </li>
            <li> ; This is my first time using Radha Rosehip Oil, so let&#x27;s hope it delivers the same results as the first bottle I discovered</li>
            <li> This bottle of oil was larger than I expected which was nice.</li>
            <li> My pores are super tiny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for only 3 days (along with clay facial soap vs ones with sulfates in them) and my face looks a million times better.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that shows instant improvement which seemingly gets better.</li>
            <li> The results are better than the more expensive face creams on the market</li>
            <li> This on in particular is a yellowish orange.</li>
            <li> This particular bottle of oil was a gift from the company</li>
            <li> Most products only coat the surface of the skin but this stuff goes in deep and does wonders.</li>
            <li> My main skin concern is the dryness, even during summer time.</li>
            <li> I was very eager to try out this rosehip oil and surprised at what 4 oz really looked like.</li>
            <li> definitely will get more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> I have recently gotten into oils, and i have found this particular oil makes my skin feel so smooth and soft after i apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is light and unassuming, the texture is also light, delicate.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as fragrant as I expected (I have rose water toner, so I was assuming it would smell similar)</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hyperpigmentation and boxcar/ice pick scarring from a severe breakout I had when I was 19, and this oil has visibly evened out my skin so much in under a week; the hyperpigmentation is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited by all the products I&#x27;ve used and look forward to a long relationship.  </li>
            <li> For facial skin care, rose hip oil offers several benefits when applied externally due to its primary constituents:</li>
            <li> Comes in a very pretty blue bottle.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to fragrance!</li>
            <li> I did a little research prior to ordering and found the cold press rose hips is the best (which this Radha product is).</li>
            <li> Very sensitive skin and this product works!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for people with skin condition like rosacea.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone with dermatitis or eczema.</li>
            <li> Highly recomanded.</li>
            <li> , I can not afford expensive beauty products, but those expensive products don&#x27;t always work, you jut pay for the name brand, so I am thrilled about your excellent beauty products, thank you so much for your quality and affordability</li>
            <li> I would imagine that would be to the high vitamin C content.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I didnt have high expectations of a oil working.</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT HIGHLY..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and the company.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Radha products.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this products to my friends.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It sinks in nicely and has gotten rid of my dry skin very well.</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve read in natural beauty and essential oil books say that that rosehip oil should be a rich amber color.</li>
            <li> and I like that it is pure and natural.</li>
            <li> The oil is clear with no aroma, and does not retain any characteristics of pure unrefined rosehip seed oil.  </li>
            <li> Acne cleared up a little, too :)</li>
            <li> and when you mix this with a little water your skin feels heavenly smooth!</li>
            <li> I have bought rosehip oil from other companies and the real stuff has an amber color and a very distinct smell.</li>
            <li> The other brands have an earthy scent to them, and the books say that it should have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> The next morning when I wake up my skin is always super soft!</li>
            <li> One warning: the oil is a sort of light brown color, and it does stain clothes, so be careful with it.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my skin because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft and moisturized, which really helps my eczema.</li>
            <li> So far though, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> With all the uses and benefits it offers to the whole family, and the length of time it will last, the price tag is well worth the output.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> These oils feel very luxurious and soft on my skin</li>
            <li> It is clear that they really care about me and their products.</li>
            <li> and where I had rough parts on my forehead are now smooth, it absorbs into your skin well and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
            <li> basically had NO scent &amp; was almost clear in color, much like the refined/processed oil you would buy in the store.</li>
            <li> I am expecting more result after few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Tried working it out but company insists this is normal.</li>
            <li> , they are really smooth and soft and not nearly as crapey .  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing without being too heavy and layers well on top of serums,sunscreens, etc.</li>
            <li> The Radha rosehip oil feels so nice and delicate on my face and leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li> Nice larger size,  will last a while and will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face twice a day, and was able to tell a difference in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I wanted to give it a few weeks before I commented, but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> A bit later after applying, I sometimes think it hasn&#x27;t absorbed.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to know if it will help elevate the scaring, my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> It works way better when I apply a few drops onto my hair after I shower.  </li>
            <li> They told me the the smell was normal, but</li>
            <li> I used it a few days and love the feel on my skin and the glow....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and my skin is softer and more radiant than ever.</li>
            <li> This rose hip oil is thick, orange, with a hearty smell as it is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> The Radha is still infinitely better than any other non-rosehip lotion I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m suspicious that the effects are so much different than a competing 100% pure cold-pressed rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> The most they did was make my skin break out and cost $$$ a half ounce!</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a short while but wanted to say that the service was quick and how much I like the product!  </li>
            <li> Why pay for high priced skin creams that have the same active ingredients as natural rose hip oil?  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin super soft and supple as though you just received both a facial and microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> On top of that, my skin has started getting some dry patches recently, and I needed a moisturizer that would help with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I just received my Radha Rosehip Organic Oil earlier this week and my skin LOVES it; it just soaks it right up.</li>
            <li> High quality organic product and professional sellers!</li>
            <li> The Radha people really take a lot of care with wrapping the glass bottle which is a nice change compared to some sellers here on Amazon lately!</li>
            <li> but im noticing them smoothing out and becoming less noticable-</li>
            <li> First of all, I was surprised by how large the bottle was, I was expecting a much smaller size bottle.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very smart and can distinguish different oils from one another.  </li>
            <li> The rosehip oil in particular, is the first product that has stopped my face from developing red patches in the winter.</li>
            <li> Other brands I have are the amber color as well making me wonder why this one is sooo light.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little too early to tell just how much I love it, but time will tell and I promise to let everyone know.......</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added but unexpected benefit is the difference in my hands since this is my method for applying the oil, they are really smooth and soft and not nearly as crapey .  </li>
            <li> Now I am going to incorporate it into my lotions and new serum</li>
            <li> so using new products tends to make me break out.</li>
            <li> Any new pimples literally heal overnight when I use this oil, and it even seems to shrink pimples before they form.</li>
            <li> However the new bottle I received has a tinit of orange.</li>
            <li> I have tried it all, and still keep looking for new discoveries.  </li>
            <li> I always prepared myself for my new breakouts.</li>
            <li> I live in NM where there is sun</li>
            <li> I live in the mountains</li>
            <li> I live in the desert</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a new product for me.</li>
            <li> I live the area</li>
            <li> My wife uses it more or less as a whole body oil but especially likes it on her face and heels.</li>
            <li> and I apply it to my dry areas and it instantly feels better so soft and moisturized without feeling oily and  greasy and hasn&#x27;t made me breakout.  </li>
            <li> Only been using it for a few days, but loving the results already.</li>
            <li> I put aside my rosehip oil to use the moisturizer, and after a week decided my rosehip oil did a better job of keeping my skin moisturized and smooth, so OUT with the expensive cream.</li>
            <li> It was soft and smooth where I have these rough patches on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who has issues with dry skin, eczema, fine lines, stretch marks, scars, or is just generally concerned about aging and drying issues will benefit from this.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> If you have used oil in your skin care routine before and are looking for something new, I completely recommend this!</li>
            <li> It also makes the skin very soft.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and feels very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin, and this oil has soothed my skin and calmed my flare ups.</li>
            <li> The scent is very natural and doesn&#x27;t clash with my cologne.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> It does make my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft..</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The left side looks almost completely healed where as the right is still destroyed.</li>
            <li> I came back from a trip and really knew I needed to calm it down right away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other oils I have used were much thinner (not pure) and far less effective.</li>
            <li> The biggest surprise was the size of the bottle -- I was envisioning a small bottle, like tinctures come it, but this bottle is positively HUGE!  </li>
            <li> But so far has helped me on flakiness and redness!</li>
            <li> No greasy feeling, skin was sooo soft, and I think it took the burn out of the sunburned shoulders!</li>
            <li> My first time ordering, but will definitely order again.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have dirched my usual moisturizer in favor of this oil and my skin looks and feels better after a week.</li>
            <li> Like the woman, I will use this for 4 weeks minimum; I say &amp;#34;minimum,&amp;#34; because from the first day used on my skin, I saw repairs happening, and I will likely be a fan of this product for life.</li>
            <li> I am testing this product at a low cost with the understanding that I would provide a review and inspection for people interested in purchasing the product.</li>
            <li> This product comes in a pretty blue 4 oz glass bottle sealed with a lid and comes with a glass dropper that can be used for the oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I keep using it that it will make some sort of a difference on these areas, how dramatically I am not sure, though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be checking here first, before purchasing essential oils elsewhere...</li>
            <li> It is a much larger sized bottle for a lower price than many other brands.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural moisturizer, I give this oil my highest recommendation!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been clear on whether to use it with my normal face cream or without so</li>
            <li> In using this for my naturally curly hair, which often times gets frizzy as it dries, I have not had any frizz!</li>
            <li> For example, the number &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines between my eyebrows are nearly gone (yay!)</li>
            <li> It is also lacks the unique scent of the other rosehip oils that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> You will be &amp;#34;smack yo baby&#x27;s bottom&amp;#34; soft!</li>
            <li> Some scarring from old blemishes have started to disappear since including it in my regimen!</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and neck and cannot remember my neck ever feeling so soft!  </li>
            <li> I found this oil by searching Amazon and after the first night of receiving it and using it, it cleared up the redness by the next morning!  </li>
            <li> The only recommendation for the company would be to use a higher quality dropper.  </li>
            <li> All the oils that I have used have been deep golden/amber in color, including the first bottle of Radha Rosehip that I bought.  </li>
            <li> The product also arrived early!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased a product numerous times.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong, but with time I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.  </li>
            <li> I notice the deeper creased in my forehead are smoother over these last few days, I also find that gently patting this into the skin under my eyes really helps to smooth at the lines there, the fine lines are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> it is clear in color rather than the more yellow color of the other brand oil.  </li>
            <li> it is clear in color rather than the more yellow color of the other brand oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week to get rid old stretch marks and prevent new ones from forming while I&#x27;m losing weight.</li>
            <li> It is very long which is useful</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and I feel instant as well as long range comfort.  </li>
            <li> This has been my go to moisturizer every morning and night for the past few days and it has been great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying moisturizers and treatments for dry skin and am now trying less commercial products since I am not seeing good results results from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry, the oil is instantly absorbed.</li>
            <li> , it just helps my makeup look fresh and dewy rather than dry and cakey.  </li>
            <li> I love it, my skin looks younger, moisture all the time, the dark spots and sun damage in my face looks like it&#x27;s fading.  </li>
            <li> and ive spent a lot on skincare from lancome to shiseido and this works as good if not better</li>
            <li> So at first when I opened the bottle, there was definitely a kind of weird smell to the oil.  </li>
            <li> It just makes my skin very soft and has completely taken care of the dryness.  </li>
            <li> But very busy lately, but this is an fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> It seems a few fine lines around the eyes have disappeared</li>
            <li> The fine lines on my cheeks are gone with just a few weeks application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this product for a little over a month in combination with a liquid exfoliant, I have seen a significant improvement in the appearance of my skin both in terms of occurrence of new blemishes and the diminishing of acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the pure Radha Rosehip Oil for several weeks now.</li>
            <li> This is PURE rosehip oil, no added essential orders or scents...</li>
            <li> I have paid the same price as this oil is listed, received a smaller quantity and a far less effective product.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for rosehip hip oil,and I have been using this for a week and it feels adequate for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people with an oily t zone, high level of sensitivity, and apparently dehydrated winter cheeks now</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is not one to protect me from the occasional spatter of acne, however this certainly doesn&#x27;t trigger that behavior.</li>
            <li> This really hydrates my VERY dry skin, and my lines are very diminished.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able with the dropper to use as little or as much as possible at a time.  </li>
            <li> Rosehip absorbs very quickly and won&#x27;t leave an oily feeling behind, just very soft pretty skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried black soap, jojoba, castor, grapeseed, coconut, tea tree and just about every other nut oil but my own.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, the beauty secret</li>
            <li> This oil is clear and has no odor.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and soft and less frizz.</li>
            <li> It is a clear, scent-free oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is clear as vegetable oil and is scentless.</li>
            <li> no more scratching, no more redness, it is great.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have used it on my nails and face and it instantly absorbs and leaves my skin very hydrated and plump.</li>
            <li> I reapplied the oil after her shower and it was almost completely clear in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some have been clear and some have been a yellowish orange.</li>
            <li> Clear, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> By morning, the rash was gone and my skin clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It makes my skin SO soft and brightens up my skin tone!&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive and combination skin.</li>
            <li> Once it soaks into my skin (just give it a couple of minutes), I apply a tiny bit of shea butter to really lock that moisture in.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li> , the Dr&#x27;s were surprised @</li>
            <li> I am also a breast cancer survivor and was looking for a natural alternative for my face.  </li>
            <li> I decided to also try Radha Age-Defying Skin clearing serum every night and now my skin is soft, with tighter pores, no breakouts and wrinkles are fading.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m amazed at the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> , it felt amazing,it was so soft.</li>
            <li> Face glows and skin stays soft all day.</li>
            <li> No problems so far with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> (basically don&#x27;t squeeze any additional oil into the dropper and just work with whatever drips off naturally.)</li>
            <li> It was soft without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> Its naturally toning the skin it and it reduce wrinkles.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> In the evenings, I put it on after Radha&#x27;s Skin Clearing serum, and the combination has proven beneficial for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and so far I am seeing no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I have skin that is prone to breakouts - both because it is sensitive and because it&#x27;s oily.</li>
            <li> Absorbs and blends with skin&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li> Leaves me with soft, supple, moisturizer skin.</li>
            <li> Since I have sensitive skin, I decided to test it on my hands avery night</li>
            <li> I went the whole day without having to apply any extra moisturizer to my problem areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil daily and highly doubt I&#x27;ll ever go without it again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since February and have noticed a considerable improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> This oil has changed my skin completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using it on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of hylauranic acid and mix them and put it on at night and there is a difference the price is fantastic im in my 60s</li>
            <li> My skin feels baby soft.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it is exactly miracle, but it has cleared up my difficult adult acne and it does make your skin feel incredible and glowing, without an oily feel.  </li>
            <li> I also put it on my hands that have always looked old.  </li>
            <li> This oil was rancid smelled old .</li>
            <li> I used it on my face, on scars and on old stretch marks from puberty.</li>
            <li> She has frequent flares in the summer, and was experiencing one the day the package arrived.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural remedy.</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil is gentle enough to use around the eyes and lessened the appearance of lines and &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it</li>
            <li> It melts into the skin and leaves its soft.</li>
            <li> I have noticed no breakouts and I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not fruity or perfumy, but natural.</li>

            <li> completely-</li>
            <li> WOW..</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I use it frequently.</li>
            <li> I have seen so much improvement in my complexion over the last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really soft, has natural glow and looks dewy.</li>
            <li> So far, I have used it on my face, neck and hands.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft and after 3 weeks I  have noticed the &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have noticed a marked improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I found it absorbs rapidly into the skin and leaves it feeling soft and supple without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Thinking that the product would help eliminate or even lessen the effect/appearance of both issues, it so far has not.</li>
            <li> Made the purchase over two weeks now and still have not seen any signs that the product works aside from making my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> It is making such a difference in my skin and hair especially as a natural.</li>
            <li> My hair has become incredibly soft overnight with just one application throughout my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li> The oil I received smelled old and rancid.  </li>
            <li> My face is soft n radiant.</li>
            <li> However, you wake up with soft and moisturized skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer under my eyes so far I like it.  </li>
            <li> it is natural.</li>
            <li> It looks like diluted vegetable oil and is completely odorless.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel soft and plumps up the skin.  </li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I used this twice a day for a month and did not see any results as far as scars or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m using this oil my skin feels plump, supple, and soft in ways it&#x27;s never felt before.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> and I wish someone would have told me about this before I was 31 years old.</li>
            <li> Also was very pleasantly surprised that I cannot smell it at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 1 week ago and let me tell you, this is so natural.</li>
            <li> After a week I started to notice that my stretch marks on my belly has cleared a lot, also my face feels soft and tighter.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend using this product!  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated without being sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> Read online on a blog about young woman with adult acne and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> Ditto for me, had it since I was young.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my skin softer I have seen some change as far as wrinkles go</li>
            <li> so I might be a bit early on the review.  </li>
            <li> But...so far, it seems to work quite well.  </li>
            <li> and it has made my elbows really soft.</li>
            <li> am positively surprised by this product and so is my daughter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That said, it makes my face soft as silk.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think about the smell of a natural product.</li>
            <li> all the big corps don&#x27;t want u to know about, it really does work, unbelevable</li>
            <li> nothing so far</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m sure there is chemistry and biology behind these properties, size of molecules and all - but none really are.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out and even better results when I put a few drops of essential oils!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using my oil a few days,but love how it feels.</li>
            <li> I have only had the organic rosehip oil for a few days, but I am in love.</li>
            <li> This does not need to be refrigerated but keep it in a dark cool place.</li>
            <li> I still think I will be adding a few extra drops at night to let more sink into my skin over night.</li>
            <li> My skin is less dry, smoother and my make up goes on much easier and doesn&#x27;t collect in the fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Almost my entire face was red, irritated, flaky, oily, and covered in whiteheads - yikes, right?</li>
            <li> I recently had a total replacement of my right knee.</li>
            <li> Not sure about Grade and Quality it is very thin in texture and almost colorless and scent free.. Not usual characteristics of pure rose hip oil,  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily, has very little fragrance and does not leave me with a sticky residue.  </li>
            <li> It sinks right into my skin, and any oily or greasy residue is gone within minutes.  </li>
            <li> This has a slight fragrance, much like french fries, but quickly dissipates, the softness of my skin does not disappear though.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops, which is great to have a big bottle that will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> It is also very, very reasonably priced (I have have had oils that run up to $200/oz, which makes me furious in hindsight) and comes capped with a separate dropper cap - and the dropper is actually long enough to fit all the way down into the bottle.  </li>
            <li> , it  makes my skin really soft and healthy looking specially for cold weather .I will buy it again .</li>
            <li> This oil has smoothed lines, brightened my skin, taken away the redness, made me break out less than the prescription Roscacea medicine, and made my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li> Even a little bit made any stray grey hair shiny and much more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I read lot of review and got confused at first, after I using different rosehip oil and ask someone who using more time now I find out.</li>
            <li> It is super pure, has a delicate natural smell (no perfumes), and plumps up the skin to diminish the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Nearly every facial oil claims to be highly absorbable by the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I got, like these 1 star reviewers said, the color is that of vegetable oil which is almost clear with a light tint and has no smell.  </li>
            <li> My skin needs the moisture, but it did leave me a bit greasy...and my fine hair, around my face, got oilier than usual.</li>
            <li> I had decided on my birthday that I better look into some serious skin products.</li>
            <li> The oil goes on and remains oily for a while, but it does seem to &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; quickly, as I stated previously.  </li>
            <li> The oil goes on and remains oily for a while, but it does seem to &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; quickly, as I stated previously.  </li>
            <li> and I do believe that my fine lines are less obvious.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry, but many lotions will cause breakouts of little whiteheads.</li>
            <li> about 2 weeks ago i had major surgery, &amp; as soon as the Dr. cleared me for using creams to help with the itch &amp; scarring, i used the Rosehip Oil applied directly on my scars.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is definitely very different from any other oil I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all of them).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and this brand overall.  </li>
            <li> I have old and new facial acne scars</li>
            <li> when I used harsh acne medication it would dry my skin which brought more wrinkles-ugh.</li>
            <li> Brightens my face as I use it under my normal daily moisturizure.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s absolutely NO miracle, for that;).  </li>
            <li> and my knees are healed and almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> ONLY AFTER A FEW DAYS OF USE, I SEE THE FINE LINES AROUND MY EYE LESSENING..</li>
            <li> Considering both are supposed to be 100% pure cold-pressed, I assumed they would be essentially the same.</li>
            <li> As rose hip oils in general become rancid over a certain period of time, I put a little quantity for daily use in a small bottle and I keep the remaining in the refrigerator.  </li>
            <li> there is a little smell to it, but nowhere close to other brands I have purchased so far!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very light and reminds me of soap.</li>
            <li> Then upon closer look I saw that the scar tissue was actually coming off and revealing a new layer of skin.</li>
            <li> This is my new carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> In a things-can&#x27;t-get-any-worst act of desperation I recently both three new products--witch hazel, a well reviewed lotion, and the as pictured RRO.</li>
            <li> but I wish the tip of the hole was smaller; I have to be very careful because the oil really drips out fast.</li>
            <li> I am also looking forward to blending it with the Argan Oil and lavender essential oil from Radha with some local beeswax to make a gentle salve.</li>
            <li> The key is to put a few drops on your fingertips and then smooth on face while still damp from washing.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night and my face is fresh, plump and moisturized in the a.m. thus using less of my daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have to be careful of the products that I use, and this product seems to have a very &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I normally use before going to bed at night, wash my face first, spray with Rosewater then apply a few drops of this Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too big of a deal because I just use it as a night time moisturizer only and give it the night to really soak into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and everything makes it red.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and I am starting to see changes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this oil on: dark pink/purple scars from scratched mosquito bites, scrape scars, a dog bite, sun damaged areas, brown age/liver spots, spots where the skin has obviously got DNA damage (raised light brown or raised white areas), hypertrophic scars, indented scars, etc.</li>
            <li> Organic and cold-pressed are major</li>
            <li> I HAVE RECEIVED NO OTHER COMPENSATION FROM THE MANUFACTURER OR DISTRIBUTOR FOR THIS REVIEW*</li>
            <li> And you can tell a major difference.</li>
            <li> I had surgery with major scaring, nerve damage, etc...</li>
            <li> on my closed wound; I add some to my hair right before shampooing, massage it into my fingernails &amp; use it lightly on my facial sunspots.</li>
            <li> I got carded last night for the first time in a very long time...</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and gentle fragrance ( very slight) ...</li>
            <li> Within the first two days my other half said my skin looked like it was glowing, so I took a look in the mirror and noticed he was right</li>
            <li> My scar is healing great and the pain isn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally write reviews about products I return</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and clear on what the product is.</li>
            <li> Apparently this is indicative of processed oil to remove the color and odor.  </li>
            <li> I initially ordered this oil to prevent crows feet and help keep my skin looking young.</li>
            <li> This surprised me because one of the products I tried recently was Bio-oil and that caused break outs.  </li>
            <li> I had developed a skin rash and red itchy hives in spots.</li>
            <li> I am only giving this 4 stars as it is too early to tell if this is truly going to work for me or not.</li>
            <li> I applied the oil to the outbreak at about 3PM and by the time she was to take her shower before bed, I could barely see the inflammation.</li>
            <li> I prefer a natural approach whenever possible, but NOT all natural substances are created equal.</li>
            <li> It spreads very well but is not very absorbent</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s only been about 4 days so far, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it on my hands and arms so far.  </li>
            <li> After daily application of the rosehip oil, even this area is considerably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely had this two days.</li>
            <li> Sinks into skin and hair fast</li>
            <li> and I will be reordering in the near future.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said, it might be a bit early to tell, so once I&#x27;ve used it for awhile, I&#x27;ll come back and update my experience.</li>
            <li> It barely has any smell which is the way it should be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfair to judge this product after using it only a week although I have liked it very much so far.</li>
            <li> The oil comes in a fantastic thick glass bottle with a glass stopper.</li>
            <li> cause it just makes it more irritated and look worse.  </li>
            <li> but it was absorbed in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin moisturized, I have less little bumps on my face, and more evenness.</li>
            <li> The odor will die down for the most part after a few hours.</li>
            <li> This can be corrected and handled well, but until I see a report proving authenticity, I’m very cautious in continuing use as I need to be very concerned with what I put on my body due to wide variety of reactions from things.</li>
            <li> I expected a certain rose smell and was disappointed at first to not smell it.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased to have a larger quantity, since I do use it liberally, but for less dollars per ounce than I was previously paying.  </li>
            <li> Radha Rosehip Oil , I am half way through my first bottle</li>
            <li> I first began using Radha rosehip oil under my eyes and dry areas and it did wonders to improve wrinkles and alleviate dry spots without breaking out.</li>
            <li> The smell is decent (not bad and not great).  </li>
            <li> Trader Joes Jojoba oil is a lot less expensive, but there is something very nice about this oil</li>
            <li> Trader Joes Jojoba oil is a lot less expensive, but there is something very nice about this oil</li>
            <li> It absorbs in the skin really well without looking extremely greasy and without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going out into a New Jersey winter with my slightly dry skin, I add another moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li> Fine lines have vanished, and I&#x27;d swear that the dark circles under my eyes have lessened to the point that much less concealer is needed.  </li>
            <li> This bottle, in a household of 4, with frequent use (especially by the youngest), will STILL last 6-9 months.</li>
            <li> My face is not dry anymore.</li>
            <li> especially these last few days it has been very windy making my skin feel tight and dry and the oil instantly made me feel better.  </li>
            <li> Smells little funny</li>
            <li> I used on my face and it was a little oily the first 1/2 or so</li>
            <li> It can appear to be oily when you first apply, so you need little and need to rub in well.</li>
            <li> The smell takes a little getting used to at first but doesn&#x27;t linger</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use too much, because this oil is pretty thick and makes my skin sticky,so I use only 3 drops for my entire face.</li>
            <li> The dry, dry winter wind usually gives me scale-like dryness on my face, and no matter how many moisturizers I apply, the scales remain.</li>
            <li> The only con in my opinion is the applicator I feel as I waste product because it just flows right through the applicator</li>
            <li> I have been using beauty oils for a year or two but they were all from Sephora and therefore overpriced and filled with fragrance, which is not good skincare.</li>
            <li> people said dark color with fishy smell is real rosehip oil</li>
            <li> This is part of a pretty extensive skin care routine that includes 3 different cleansers, two face masks, and various other products that I rotate in and out depending on my mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels completely moisturized without being greasy &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to absorb.</li>
            <li> I am mainly interested in using this on my face for acne scarring, skin dullness, uneven skin tone, and dryness</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it is absorbed into the skin fully; I never feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I have one brand that the oil is very thin which is good for your face and for the other</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will explore other offerings from Rhada.</li>
            <li> It might be an oil, but after using it skin feels soft and dry, not oily at all.</li>
            <li> It is a dry oil which moisturizes well, and thankfully for me, there is no added fragrance to which I might normally be sensitive towards.  </li>
            <li> I also use it occasionally on dry cracked heels at night, then wear an old pair of socks to bed.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin, age spots, sun spots/discoloration, and scars -- all of which this oil is helping to diminish, while making my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> rosehip seed oil has caught the attention of mant beauty cult followers as well as beauty product companies, so it is becoming difficult to find trusting companies who offers organic, quality rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> A few drops in the targeted areas and like magic, no more itching after one application.</li>
            <li> but so far no new acne developments which is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> No new breakouts either so far.</li>
            <li> I have had a host of skin problems my whole life: severe eczema, icthyosis vulgaris, dermatographic uticaria, occasional hives outbreaks due to allergies, and hopelessly dry skin in general.</li>
            <li> After years of experimenting with all kinds of blends, this little blue bottle of pure rosehip oil blew me away.</li>
            <li> There is no scent, which I am happy about since other reviews said it smelled unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Within less than a week of daily use mixed with my moisturizer and straight on my face at night, I can already see a lightning of the spots.  </li>
            <li> It is a very pale yellow color, and just barely it is very close to clear.</li>
            <li> super sensitive skin (I&#x27;m asian and 39 yrs old, and the last couple years trying to find anything to moisturize my skin properly without having a reaction or rash has been an expensive nightmare)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products, I only use very natural products with no chemicals and heard of this company from a friend of mine.</li>
            <li> Having had nasty leaky boxes before I appreciated the extra effort that went into making sure it didn&#x27;t arrive broken, though their wrapping was almost too good.</li>
            <li> It seems to work really well as long as you only use a tiny amount; the lines around my mouth are less noticeable</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is great, it soaks into the skin quickly and is not super oily afterwards, it also does not have a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> It is equal to other natural rosehip oils that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Plus a little really goes a long way</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel so soft as it sinks in quite well, even when used alone!</li>
            <li> My skin with Sukin&#x27;s was crazy soft, with the Radha I&#x27;ve still got many dry patches.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see longer term rests such as wrinkles but home</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re only using 6-7 drops twice a day, this is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Oil leaves skin feeling soft and non irritating;)</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a difference in my skin in terms of bounce &amp; elasticity...definitely not as many of those fine little lines we hate to see in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> So if your skin gets a little dry in patches give it a day or two and gently exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> Since you only need a couple drops of this rosehip oil it will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> My previous Eve Hanson rosehip oil had this color and odor, but I gave it a lesser review because wasn&#x27;t wild about the color and smell and had tried the Radha here, which didn&#x27;t have it.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days, but my face seems to be feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I have had a scar on my right elbow from a gnarly fall when I was a kid that I never even thought of trying to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> this should last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Long term results will be realized with regular use</li>
            <li> The 4oz bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T LAST LONG.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because I&#x27;ve only had it for so long</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time too.</li>
            <li> It is heavy, which is normal for oil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It has a nice consistency, definitely not too thick BUT not too thin</li>
            <li> Also the first few days of using the oils my face broke out just a little but after continuing for a few days my skin cleared up and has been very moisturized ever since I started the oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve marked it down because of the smell and color.</li>
            <li> This bottle should last a while using on your face and hands twice daily for anti-aging and evening out skin tone, maybe a little less if using for large patches of eczema or psoriasis on the body.</li>
            <li> sure and place your hand next to the bottle to catch spills as you lift the dropper out because its too thin for the dropper to hold it in properly) and has very little odor.</li>
            <li> Although there are many benefits to using this organic oil, I suffer from very very dry skin, it is always itchy and uncomfortable, and I also suffer from acne and the products I use to fight the acne add to the dryness and discomfort.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was the packaging, someone had not sealed the inner box and the product was hanging out lose of its original box in a larger box with a small piece of bubble wrap attached to nothing.  </li>
            <li> It actually appeared clear in the dropper, but when put in a small, white prescription lid you could see the actual color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a for about a week,&lt;br /&gt;PLUS, a tiny drop goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This 4 oz bottle will last for a long time!  </li>
            <li> The quality is about the same as other brands I have used, but this bottle is much bigger for the same price.  </li>
            <li> It is a light yellow/amber color, has the weird earthy almost fishy smell, and came in the blue bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this as a serum under my regular moisturizer and it is truly a dry oil.</li>
            <li> This works well on my dry, chemically treated hair to add moisture, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li> My entire face would be oily in 20min and my nose dry and peeling.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup 3 days a week and found over the last 2 days that my foundation is not grabbing onto the dry spots anymore</li>
            <li> I was actually looking to buy argan oil which is really expensive if you buy genuine ecocert argan oil</li>
            <li> I was actually looking to buy argan oil which is really expensive if you buy genuine ecocert argan oil</li>
            <li> so I need extra 3 drops or so to hydrate the dry area.</li>
            <li> People with dry skin should definitely try this oil.  </li>
            <li> It did make the patches dry the second day</li>
            <li> There may be variations of the depth of color from batch to batch, but all organic, cold-pressed, rosehip seed oil should have this same characteristic color.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice and long term benefits.</li>
            <li> The delicate oil needs refrigerated or stored in a cool, dark location to prevent rancidity.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever made my skin feel so soft and it seems to help with my acne even though I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I developed an allergic reaction (red blotches) after using this product on my face for a few days.</li>
            <li> The bottle was bigger than I expected, and it came with a regular screw on lid, and a glass dropper as well.  </li>
            <li> The last brand felt greasy &amp; thick with an unusual smell----</li>
            <li> I mix it with my lotion, add a few drops to my bath water and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue using Rosehip oil for a very long time!</li>
            <li> and I began to get a red dry and itchy rash on my cheeks on day!  </li>
            <li> but  then when I open it it&#x27;s not the same like the other  .The</li>
            <li> This is the third brand of Rosehip oil that I&#x27;ve tried and this is much different and inferior to the other ones that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It totally cleared up some very dry skin on my arms</li>
            <li> Finally, something that moisturizes my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I put a little on my face before bed and my skin is completely glowing when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> One note, though: as a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil, it won&#x27;t dry out your facial skin, but it will dry out and irritate/chap mucosal skin -</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t use anything like this on this area due to break outs, but so far, after mixing it with a bit of my moisturizer, I&#x27;ve seen much brighter skin after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for wound healing, scars, dry skin, and dry hair!</li>
            <li> Love the way the product works; not so crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> I was using a different, store-made brand in the past which was nowhere near the quality of Radha.</li>
            <li> Even during this short time, my old blemish scars are appearing lighter than usual.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is normal.</li>
            <li> Also, used after a long day at the beach.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say if there are any long term benefits because I haven&#x27;t been using it long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not young</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not young</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had oily combo skin for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it a few days</li>
            <li> I use it at night  after I remove my makeup and my face is still wet, then combine it with my regular moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft after just a few applications.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to seeing what this does for my skin over the long term.</li>
            <li> I just got my rosehip oil few days ago, so I feel like it&#x27;s really early to judge,but I like it.</li>
            <li> That part is not really important as far as I know.</li>
            <li> The reason I only give four stars is because it does not really impress me.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and my husband has never said he smelled something strange.  </li>
            <li> Radha Rosehip oil keeps my skin moist all day long.  </li>
            <li> I will be patronizing this company for a long time.  </li>
            <li> all the time my shin is dry and cracked all year long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for just a few days so far, but I can tell it is helping my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I am using Retin A .05 every other night and Radha Rosehip Oil as my only moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t under stand how there can be such a difference between this and other products??</li>
            <li> Bottle and dropper are key to adding ingredients to other oils/essiental oils.  </li>
            <li> All further research regarding Rosehip oil points to this product being from something other than the rosehip seed.  </li>
            <li> The product I received does not match anything I’ve seen or had described to me from other professionals in the line of Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> After asking my friend if she uses her other creams too, I added those back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to blackouts on my nose and break outs other places occasionally.</li>
            <li> This is very similar to Argan oil; I am looking forward to trying the other oils from this company.</li>
            <li> I have used other essential oils before but never this brand or oil</li>
            <li> Lastly, it does not absorb into my skin like the other oils I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I am using it as a carrier oil for other stronger essential oils.</li>
            <li> I caution anyone to purchase this brand of oil because it is vastly different and lacks the quality of other organic rosehip oils.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am not giving a 5-star, is that I&#x27;d like to see if it takes it a little further as the fig oil did.</li>
            <li> (likely due to my oily skin),</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the blue bottle color it said it was but other than that item</li>
            <li> When I looked at my palm this morning the healing process has started, my dry skin is totally healed on the palm area and two fingers and the other three fingers are almost healed.  </li>
            <li> My skin is softer and it does not look dry or shiny.</li>
            <li> Also, my skin is REALLY dry and &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m 52)...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize my skin was so dry till I used this.  </li>

            <li> I got this for my teenage daughter!&lt;br /&gt;She has minor acne but every spot leaves a dark mark on her</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product on my face for a few days, and only applying it at night.</li>
            <li> Using a few drops twice a day from this large bottle should last at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> no need to use a lot, a single drop of it</li>
            <li> and I will use it in some of my beauty products I create, but I&#x27;m not sure that I would purchase it again because I&#x27;m not sure of it being the right oil in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic for the skin on my face and neck, which is both crazy dry (cracks, flakes, other horrors) and prone to hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too slick and has no heavy scent but still moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I have used Rosehip oil for a long time and this is absolutely not it.</li>

            <li> but it is loose</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are still there but much less visible and the skin on my belly indeed looks far less saggy.  </li>
            <li> This product  has helped my troubled dry skin tremendously.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it the second time because the price was way down</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of this oil in my hands and then pat it on my face into the drier areas and work it into the trouble spots, in particular my forehead and cheek/chin area.</li>
            <li> Since so little goes such a long way I plan on adding it to some homemade body</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be sticking to it for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I think I found our go to product when we start to get the dry itchy skin!</li>
            <li> this is a MUST have for anyone with a dry skin type!  </li>
            <li> also use on my face as i have dry skin!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry skin for years!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has really dry skin!</li>
            <li> Buy for my disapointment when I order mine own the bottle was empty in a box :-(  </li>
            <li> Her crow&#x27;s feet are less obvious.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops goes a long way and the bottle comes with a glass dropper to ensure a proper portion is administered.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been only  using this product for a week and half</li>
            <li> I take a medication that causes a slight rash on various area of my arms and leg.</li>
            <li> Only had for a less than a week</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and heals dry, flaky and rough skin</li>
            <li> The weird smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a true wonder it didn&#x27;t break because its glass and very poorly packaged.  </li>
            <li> My skin must be very dry because my skin soaks up the oil and doesn’t leave a residue like some reviews state.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and have been using this on my face</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> The 4 oz size will go a very long way since I only need a few drops to make my hands moisturized and</li>
            <li> I have normal skin but have always struggled with a few small dry patches around my nose and brow area.</li>
            <li> I have used other oils in the past, but never has my skin felt so soft as it does after using this product.</li>
            <li> Smells a little funky, but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I have accually been putting a little extra under my eyes and its helping under there</li>
            <li> Now I use it at night mixed with a little vitamin E crème.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised at how plump and dewy my skin already looks, and my acne (especially the hard little bumps under the skin on my chin) and scars have noticeably diminished.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for several days, and in this brutal winter, skin constantly barraged by my boyfriend&#x27;s radiator, I have already noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my face and other dry spots.</li>
            <li> and so far I can see it&#x27;s transforming my skin from looking dull to youthful.</li>
            <li> My skin would be described as a combination of oily and dry; I get dry patches on my cheeks and chin, but I have a slightly oily forehead and nose.</li>
            <li> using this Rosehip oil for only a few days my skin is noticeably softer and smoother...</li>
            <li> I spent hundreds on Strivectin and never seen a difference.</li>
            <li> The oil seems to be what I expected.</li>
            <li> She has only been using it for a few days, and she can already see a change in her skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Will further comment on the outcome after using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> but I have only used it for a few days,</li>
            <li> but none of them performed as I expected.</li>
            <li> I used a few drops on my hands and felt instant relief.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had melasma for a few years now, age spots/sun damage spots that I have noticed over the last couple of years and am just now using products to bleach and fade the skin discoloration.  </li>
            <li> essential fatty acids, vitamin E, vitamin C and B-carotene, a form of vitamin A.I received the product to test .</li>
            <li> You really only need a few drops on your face.</li>
            <li> After only a few applications I think it may be making it not as itchy.</li>
            <li> In only a few days, I saw improvement in scars.  </li>
            <li> whenever I have a few extra bucks</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> It also has absolutely no scent to it at all.</li>
            <li> Just a few dab&#x27;s last all day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only been a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Radha Rosehip Oil for a few days now, but I can already see an improvement in the tone and clarity of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I add a few drops  with  Neutrogena  daily moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li> And, all I did was mindlessly massage into my hands what was left after applying some to my face.  </li>
            <li> Thicker than expected,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days</li>
            <li> Add it to your deep conditioners or a few drops to your face cream.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all, not much fragance and</li>
            <li> I tried to remove a sun spot a few months ago and it seems like the rosehip oil is speeding up the process - because it is finally starting to disappear.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is one of few oils I know works on my skin, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and actually brightens my skin.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this oil does what I expected.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful what I use</li>
            <li> Just a few drops was enough to hydrate my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but I think the appearance and health of my skin has improved since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Since receiving this product, I have used a few drops after cleansing and toning my skin, and it seems to be helping to fade some of my scars left from acne.  </li>
            <li> Foremost: Thanks to all the bloggers/reviewers for putting me on to this game changing oil.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this Rosehip oil in the past and it arrived just as described - in a blue glass bottle, containing a darker colored yellow oil with a slightly nutty scent.  </li>
            <li> The last batch of 4 bottles did NOT work as well as previous purchase, the color was way too dark and did not do as well.</li>
            <li> So I started using it only at night and mixing in a couple of drops of tea tree oil to mask the odor, then just using plain jojoba in the morning.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m Indian and my scars stay dark for a VERY long time) and have seborrheic dermatitis around my hair line and ears.</li>
            <li> I use it daily on my breasts which have always been badly stretch marked due to extreme growth spurts in puberty and have been a real source of self-consciousness.  </li>
            <li> I use this oil on my face and neck and add to a few problem spots in other areas with what&#x27;s left on my hand(s) after I&#x27;ve applied it to my face.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my face and neck and add to a few problem spots in other areas with what&#x27;s left on my hand(s) after I&#x27;ve applied it to my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at the results after just a few days, my redness has gone down, acne scaring and dark spots are disappearing, and my current acne is not a cyst anymore the swelling has gone down immensely</li>
            <li> I use this every single day as my moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mixed it with a small amount of vitamin E oil to thin it out, because it is thick and rich.</li>
            <li> one is dark color with fishy smell( other company) - my skin turn red on chick and forehead and little itcy.</li>
            <li> My skin is silky soft, radiant and gives my skin a subtle look plus it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> Ive had the product now for nearly 2 weeks, and I can tell that my dark spots are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> Radha brand absorbs INTO the skin, does NOT feel oily &amp; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was previously using argan oil, but it was too heavy, ended up breaking me out, and I could only use it at night.  </li>
            <li> The oil in my bottle is very pale yellow with a minimal scent that l</li>
            <li> I intend to use it daily (just a few drops!)</li>
            <li> The scent differs from the oil I have been using for two years,which I am assuming is due to the fact that no perfumes have been added, which, to me, is preferable.  </li>
            <li> On days when I&#x27;m at home I forego with any other creams/serum during the day</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my body under other lotions.</li>
            <li> I am going to post this question for this item, and the other two brands I have ordered.</li>
            <li> and I noticed this happened to other people with their purchase as well.</li>
            <li> No scent that will clash with any other scents or clash with anyone&#x27;s sense of smell.  </li>
            <li> It has a different smell but its not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> (I did not reference or question any other EO Radha is selling.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I plan on using the product on my face at night as other reviews have suggested to see if it helps to soften the wrinkles a bit.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts or other issues with this oil</li>
            <li> I have received some from other companies that do not have seals.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to find other uses for this product and to try it out for the other uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The color is that of vegetable oil, unlike the other rosehip oils that were amber colored.</li>
            <li> No greasy residue and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> or else it will drip while I&#x27;m transferring it to my other container.</li>
            <li> I often don&#x27;t add any other moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using on my face for the past several days.  </li>
            <li> I have had other products like that</li>
            <li> If it is, it seems it has been extremely refined.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the product lives up to its standards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for no more than a week or two and have received compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I use it at night as a moisturizer (a little bit goes a very long way).</li>
            <li> I can recommend this product to those with dry skin or just want to give their skin a little pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> My scalp tends to be a little dry after washing.</li>
            <li> Also It has less viscosity, so it&#x27;s harder to control.</li>
            <li> it seems to have made the hollows under my eyes seem less hollow.</li>
            <li> use this along with Jojoba oil and a few drops of an EO, and it seems to be helping my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am using it on a few scars to see if their appearance is reduced and will report back in a few weeks with an updated report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face looks less like aged leather and noticeably healthier.</li>
            <li> a little goes a VERY long way!</li>
            <li> I used a little on my hands which are very dry.</li>
            <li> I saw such dramatic improvement in my skin, I began to read about other oils for specific issues.</li>
            <li> With the little money spent.</li>
            <li> one had a slight Rose-y fragrance, and the other none at all... but no matter.  </li>
            <li> The other products I have tried before (which themselves differ from each other a little) are much darker in color, thicker in consistency and have faint scents that remind me of coffee.</li>
            <li> I thought if I didn&#x27;t like the oil, at least I would have the cobalt blue bottle...</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> This oil also gets rid of dark marks.</li>
            <li> I think this oil has 100% helped with evening my skin tone and fading my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Radha&#x27;s product has been a dark gold color with a rancid mall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my dark acne scars fading.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with purchasing these high quality products from Radha Beauty!</li>
            <li> only complaint is the dropper they send with the bottle.</li>
            <li> Never saw any real benefit from the use of this, sorry to say/  </li>
            <li> I got this product to help with some scaring and dark spots on my forearms.</li>
            <li> It was not fresh.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that with time it will lighten the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I am 56, and am slowly turning back the hands of time.</li>
            <li> I have a few clay and cocoa masks and I use this rosehip oil as the wet ingredient to hydrate the mask for application.  </li>
            <li> They are no longer pink, but pale like the rest of me.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops of Vitamin C serum to a few drops of this Rosehip oil to dry skin</li>
            <li> I only wish I took before and after photos since my knees were really dry, flaky, and the skin was really broken.</li>
            <li> I do believe it has started to tone the redness of my skin down</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t know how, but it takes the inflamed pimples down to a recovery stage.</li>
            <li> I have a &amp;#34;sunspot&amp;#34; on my face and some down my neck.  </li>
            <li> would give 5 stars, but that would mean I look 60 years younger...</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and subtle even after one week of use!</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so this time.</li>
            <li> AS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, AND OIL SMELLS</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks I noticed less breakouts and brighter looking skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 73 and just wish I had used this continually for 40 or some odd years.  </li>
            <li> This oil also seems slightly thicker, though that may be my imagination.</li>
            <li> This oil also seems slightly thicker, though that may be my imagination.</li>
            <li> My skin will typically break out in hours if something irritates it</li>
            <li> and these results in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> The woman in the photos had severe facial scarring, having been in a serious auto accident.</li>
            <li> I use less in the morning, because I end up putting makeup over it for the day.</li>
            <li> The scar was about half gone, I added the Rosehips and the scar is just about invisible.</li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from eczema, and hydro-cortisone has just never really helped much at all.</li>
            <li> It is light-weight as it drips slightly faster than another Rosehip Oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so I use less makeup because of this product.</li>
            <li> It goes on quickly, is not oily and does not clog my pores.  </li>
            <li> It is not super oily and my skin feels softer after I use it.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed by the previous reviews and ordered a bottle for myself and another for my mom.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other rose-hip oils, but they pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> I have used some other oils in the past as a moisturizer and have broken out, but so far no breakouts with this one.</li>
            <li> I was also skeptical about the high rating, but I agree.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of this product lessening dark spots or melasma as other reviewers say they have seen, and these results in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t make a mess</li>
            <li> What a mess, huh?</li>
            <li> I expected a small, 1 oz bottle</li>
            <li> At first I found the smell of Radha oil really awkward as the rosehip seed oil that I was using did not have the smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure of this product lessening dark spots or melasma as other reviewers say they have seen,</li>
            <li> It was late arriving due to a hang up with one of the carriers but only a day late.</li>
            <li> But in all the years that I&#x27;ve been trying new and expensive anti-aging this or sculpting and wrinkle removing that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and it has cleared up my rough elbows and moisturizes my face without turning it into an oil slick.</li>
            <li> In just a few days I can see a slight improvement in wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Rosehip oil for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> THERE WERE LITTLE SHARDS OF GLASS THROUGH OUT MY PACKAGE.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to buy this oil</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m wondering about regarding this oil is that it has no color and little if any odor.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I rubbed a little alcohol and</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was due to how the rosehip oil was packaged.</li>
            <li> It seems a little oily to use under make-up with a mineral powder foundation, but since I purchased it to use around my eyes at night it has met all expectations.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the skin around my eyes feels a little softer since I started using this oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> HEY, EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s a little heavier/oilier than another brand I was using, but that can be a matter of taste.</li>
            <li> I add a little to my moisturizer and my skin is dewy all day</li>
            <li> A little sticky when i apply</li>
            <li> During the day, I mix a little bit with my moisturizer and it prevents it from looking too oily.  </li>
            <li> So often there is little or no change</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even started to get rid of my scars that I have had since I was a little kid.</li>
            <li> Three 2 days and 2nights now of dousing my face with this stuff and not a breakout in sight NOR that pre-breakout nerve pinging tenderness that usually accompanies ever other oil.</li>
            <li> : If you are using an active like retinol or an acne fighting ingredient (SA, Azelic Acid) wait at least 15 minutes before using this as it&#x27;ll dilute the active.</li>
            <li> my son has slightly red/pink checks with little bumps on them (on saw on Dr. Oz that it can be treated with Rosehip Oil) and I have a recent scar above my lip from a cold sore that I picked at.</li>
            <li> (I have other oils in plastic bottles that are very messy).</li>
            <li> Oil - 100% Pure Cold Pressed Certified Organic 4 fl.</li>
            <li> There was little to no benefit in using the few drops that I did use.  </li>
            <li> The rosehip oil iteself was a very dark amber.</li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from eczema and this seems to really help her out.</li>
            <li> I just received this a few days ago...</li>
            <li> just few a days ago @</li>
            <li> Even though I just received this a few days ago I already am having progress with my skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and had trouble with breakouts along with wrinkles beginning to show..</li>
            <li> there was quit a few options when purchasing this item</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it A few days, and my skin is showing signs of improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I use it everywhere, everyday.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Is a must have for everyday skin care.</li>
            <li> I used a few drops night and in the morning on my face, on my stomach for stretch marks from my pregnancies and a couple scars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> I got this to try a few days after my friend was telling me she discovered it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rosehip oil for a few weeks now and can tell the difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I started having dark spots on my face from the sun, and even from past acne scars.</li>
            <li> I have combo &amp; sensitive skin &amp; this moisturizes without irritating or causing breakouts!</li>
            <li> tried using it as my day moisturizer, but it is too heavy under my make up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using the product a few days.  </li>
            <li> When I emailed the supplier about it, they responded in a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the oil just for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just received this oil to test out a few days ago</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that overpowering and dissipates within a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Felt like I had an oil slick on my face, never absorbed and didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I have a few spots of eczema on my arms and forehead which seem to be showing some improvement after a few applications.</li>
            <li> Its a bit to heavy to wear during the day under make-up</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to help decrease my lines.  </li>
            <li> I rub a few drops into my face and forehead before makeup and after washing my face at night.  </li>
            <li> I am anxious to try some of their other oils, too, as you can&#x27;t beat the quality and value of their 4 ounce bottle!</li>
            <li> Crows feet that I&#x27;ve had for years, which I&#x27;ve applied both every all-natural hippie formulation or synthetic serum on, are now almost gone within less than a week of using this product twice a day (now I&#x27;m bumping it up to 3 times a day!)  </li>
            <li> In less than a week, I can see and feel a difference in my face!  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, not oily at all!&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> and I use less of my day-moisturizer!</li>
            <li> The reason I am skeptical of this is because the color, smell and consistency is so different from the other two brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the grown man begrudgingly cringing like a pre-teen from cheek kisses and other such close encounters with my face because in a mere two hours a reaction is prone to erupt.</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s silly, but I am very partial to blue bottles.&lt;br /&gt;The eye gel I ordered</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this enough to notice a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> they are not easy on my skin, I get a lot of redness and dryness, a bit of sensitivity as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few drops of this after I have cleaned and dried my face and my skin feels renewed!  </li>
            <li> However, it did get rid of a small and raised dried skin formation on my finger.</li>
            <li> so that is all I have been using it for these past few days.</li>
            <li> So since receiving my products(the amount is outrageous 4oz for the cost)I use about a dime size on face and a little more for body</li>
            <li> I have used rosehip oil morning and night for at least 3 months now, and I&#x27;m still not through half of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m giving a neutral 3 star for quick delivery, annoying company requests for reviews.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend your product to anyone looking for a moisture boosting face treatment for mid to late years!!</li>
            <li> My little skin &amp;#34;irregularities&amp;#34; are slowly disappearing</li>
            <li> It takes very little product to accomplish a lot.  </li>
            <li> i apply very little oil on face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid a lot of money for department store expensive serums only to be disappointed that I paid so much for something that did so little.  </li>
            <li> and I needed something fast, my breakouts were getting bad.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> Beyond that though, I&#x27;m not sure what to say.</li>
            <li> I am not one for lotions, etc... usually don&#x27;t like the feel of them glopping up my pores...</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have that awful rosehip smell.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure about this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what rosehip oil is supposed to be in color or smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what rosehip oil is supposed to be in color or smell</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break me out, helps with dryness, and yet doesn&#x27;t turn my face into an oil slick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is psoriasis or eczema.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet if it is helping.</li>
            <li> well I tell you what happened to my skin is actually unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve protected my skin from sun for years, but had excessive freckling on my hands.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually use rosehip oil, but I received the product in return for a review.</li>
            <li> Also I added a few drops to my leave in conditioner and in a week I can literally see the roots of my hair thicken!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past week.</li>
            <li> but it usually reeks!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was not expecting this product to be any different and have to say how wrong</li>
            <li> and i usually use oils on my face.</li>
            <li> I hate to leave less than 5 star reviews unless there is a real problem</li>
            <li> I have tough skin on my feet due to wearing a lot of heels and wedges and as soon as I put this on, my feet felt a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> Due to dry/eczema and oily part of my skin, I have a very difficult time finding a facial cream that works  </li>
            <li> is very dried.</li>
            <li> my skin is def less dey and my hands too!!</li>
            <li> The positive reviews are suspect. :(</li>
            <li> know that this isn’t always a reflection on the company itself as I’ve seen other Essential Oil companies find they have a bad batch of something and not realize it.  </li>
            <li> For example on your armpits, strangely it keeps me from getting the stank, or this one time I had those random ear infections or</li>
            <li> , I hope it doesn&#x27;t fail me in the long run.</li>
            <li> , winter is dry season in Florida, and dry weather is really bad for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love that this rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it because other brands have a weird nasty smell to their rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> No more itching, no more redness!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they go bad quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has hardly any scent, and the dropper keeps everything neat.</li>
            <li> It also helps with hard scratchy elbows and heels.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain, but it never feels greasy and yet I can tell it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li> a s night time moisturizer for face and body, cuticle oil, a massage for tired feet and have tried a little bit om</li>
            <li> Just a little confused since everyone is talking about the color &amp; smell of their oil - mine</li>
            <li> Delicate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too late now to get a refund.  </li>
            <li> I have been testing the oil on the delicate skin on my wrist below the palm of my hand to see how I will react before giving it a try on my face.  </li>
            <li> oh boy were my expectations surpassed to say the least.</li>
            <li> Back to school cold season is just about to start here</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50s and my skin around the eyes and neck is tighter now than it was 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference in your skin from the moment you apply it, or at least I could.</li>
            <li> No, they didn&#x27;t pay me for this review...at least not yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slowly fading it away.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my face twice a day and slowly seeing results.</li>
            <li> small crow&#x27;s feet is gone!</li>
            <li> This  doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t try argan oil</li>
            <li> This  doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t try argan oil</li>
            <li> I assume they mean the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> (As in no more drug store products that never fulfill their promises!)</li>
            <li> I moved to this (less expensive) brand after having used Sukin&#x27;s rosehip oil for around a year.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I am speechless but so grateful and a no doubt committed consumer of the Organic Rosehip Seed Oil moving forward.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I was skeptical because of so many people saying it smelled horrible and that the oil must have gone bad.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll immediately feel a subtle difference.</li>
            <li> But maybe not good with my skin type</li>
            <li> Well that&#x27;s not a good idea</li>
            <li> I had a scar on the side of my face from a pimple that left an ugly scar.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, age hasn&#x27;t tampered feisty breakouts and my dried out skin after this MA winter was in a state of emergency.</li>
            <li> I thought with the higher price, I would get a quality product, but was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical about rosehip seed oil working for my oily, acne-prone skin, but I decided to give it a try after I recently had a bad breakout that just wouldn&#x27;t stop spreading.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m addicted to it.</li>
            <li> I started using Rosehip Oil after watching Victoria Secret Angel Miranda Kerr talking about it in an interview about her skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s too late for me to return, but I would never buy this one again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got an irritating condition around my nose and around my scalp line that becomes inflamed and flaky.  </li>
            <li> but they were completely false.  </li>
            <li> I read some of the other bad reviews</li>
            <li> It does not have a bad smell as other reviews indicated.</li>
            <li> hip oil is cold pressed and comes from a small batch.</li>
            <li> and I notice dramatic improvent in my skin.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the late review!  </li>
            <li> I am concerned it might go bad since I use so little at a time.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in the smell.</li>
            <li> My face is glowing despite the harsh cold!</li>
            <li> It maybe not a true but base on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> It should also have a smell to it, described as earthy, tea like or even a faint fishy smell.</li>
            <li> Sad and sorry customer here.</li>
            <li> I wonder what went wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this oil has not done anything to improve my dermatitis even though in their product description they do seem to suggest that this oil  helps with dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I doubt one is going to see overnight results with age spots etc.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I doubt one is going to see overnight results with age spots etc.</li>
            <li> I have always had horrible skin, anytime I walked outside on a humid day</li>
            <li> I tried contacting the seller to ask but I was unable to.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about putting oil on my face because I thought if would make it break out</li>
            <li> But I was wrong.</li>
            <li> So ill keep it up</li>
            <li> Sadly, I discovered it was not compatible with my skin type.</li>
            <li> I have replaced my expensive moisturizer with this</li>
            <li> Needless to say after making two purchases she is sold on both the product and the vendor.</li>
            <li> I ran out and it is SO expensive.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the fake reviews fool you, this stuff is garbage.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this in your eyes - it is very irritating.</li>
            <li> and Fall &amp; Winter are when it&#x27;s typically the worst!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to order again.</li>
            <li> As a college student who grew up in California and is now faced with the blistering east coast cold, this oil has been so helpful.</li>
            <li> After I did some research, I found that cold pressed rosehip is supposed to smell like the Radha oil does.  </li>
            <li> Used in combination with the dermaroller and broke out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it for random scars/stretch marks on my body, though I haven&#x27;t seen an improvement in stretch marks (yet!).</li>
            <li> I had previous started using another brand of Rosehip oil and it had a horrible scent which disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I started off using it morning and night, but unfortunately I find the smell very unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> cuz it smells like a bad medicine ointment.</li>
            <li> SO BAD</li>
            <li> I read some reviews stating that the oil they received  smelled bad or fishy.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about my experience.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it to remove my eye make-up - that was a bad idea.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is not supposed to smell bad.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and know when oils are bad.  </li>
            <li> Except for the odor( which is not so bad), the oil does not have a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I have a bad toenail, and I&#x27;m going to try it on that</li>
            <li> I have really bad oily skin with pimples</li>
            <li> I started using this oil on my elbows, since I was scared i might have a bad reaction, turns out i didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> but my dropper lid broke almost immediately :(</li>
            <li> I was sent a brown bottle, not what is pictured, so I am just slightly disappointed with that.</li>
            <li> but id have to say i wasnt disappointed in my pick......</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hated this oil.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> if you think it will smell like &amp;#34;roses&amp;#34; you will be very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it smells awful.</li>
            <li> This smells awful and is like putting crisco oil on your face..</li>
            <li> I am disgusted.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> I have horrible dermatitis on my face and it had gotten to a point where medication wasn&#x27;t even helping.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent rosehip oil! It absorbs quickly leaving my skin feeling great. My daughter uses it on her itchy skin &amp; she&#x27;s relieved immediately. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Really Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;First of all the prompt service was great and packaged perfectly.  Glad I got 2 of the big bottles and I can tell how much I&#x27;m going to love it already. Goes on very light, applies easily and absorbs right away.  Since it was the first time I have bought Rosehip Oil I wasn&#x27;t sure which company to buy from.....but this company has does everything great.  Can&#x27;t wait to see my results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to oils, which first began with coconut oil.  I saw such dramatic improvement in my skin, I began to read about other oils for specific issues. Using the rosehip oil, I am seeing continued improvement in the texture and diminished appearance of fine facial lines and reduced depth of deeper lines. I&#x27;m also seeing results in improved texture lightening of sun spots on my chest and hands.  Now if it were only possible to just bathe in the stuff! 😊😊😊 turning 70 in July and feeling good looking. Wish I had found these oils 30 years ago. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality pure oil .  It is great on my alligator dry legs, have not used it long enough for results on wrinkles or Sun damage. I love that it has no odor .</li>
            <li> The item were good !!  But maybe not good with my skin type ,  I got acne after I used at the first week !</li>
            <li> I use it to moisturize my face and use it to supplement my shampoo and conditioner and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly , very light in color. Big fan of this rose hip oil!</li>
            <li> Quality product and have already ordered again</li>
            <li> It totally cleared up some very dry skin on my arms</li>
            <li> Lovely product! Skin already feels softer. Very prompt and courteous service!!! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, have been using as a moisturizer on my face and hands and am impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> Buy this!!! Oh my gosh I absolutely love this oil. I am all about oils for the skin and this one is wonderful. I put it on each night after cleansing. It soaks it really well and leaves no greasy residue feeling. And by the way, the customer service from this company is amazing. They emailed me saying they got my order, they emailed me when it was sent, and they emailed me with a follow up to make sure I was satisfied. You just don&#x27;t get customer service like that very often.</li>
            <li> I love this oil it&#x27;s the best . This oil make your skin smooth&lt;br /&gt;And feel like silk!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Rosehip oil for a little over a month now and I really like it. I was fortunate enough to receive a coupon to receive this item for free and I&#x27;m so glad I used it as it was about to expire.  I break out easily so adding oils to my face wasn&#x27;t something i had thought of doing but I have combination skin and I apply it to my dry areas and it instantly feels better so soft and moisturized without feeling oily and  greasy and hasn&#x27;t made me breakout.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product especially these last few days it has been very windy making my skin feel tight and dry and the oil instantly made me feel better.  I read somewhere this can be used on hair too I will start using it on my hair today and keep you up to date on the benefits because I have the dryest hair - fingers crossed but it definetly works great on skin and a little goes a long way this should last you a long time.</li>
            <li> love it! does not have the &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell that many others do, so pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Leaves a yellow tinge/stain.  Not sure if that is normal.</li>
            <li> What I ordered is what I got and quickly.</li>
            <li> Received this one on time. It&#x27;s a great product to use with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn... I love this oil but my dropper lid broke almost immediately :( I ordered the lavender oil and argan oil from this brand and those are also amazing oils but don&#x27;t seem to have the lid problem.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! I saw a difference after one use! My skin looks healthier, it glows, my pores are dramatically smaller. And it&#x27;s only been one week!</li>
            <li> I have used that oil at my friend house before I order mine  and loved it that&#x27;s why I give 5star . Buy for my disapointment when I order mine own the bottle was empty in a box :-(  I&#x27;m afraid to order again. I wished they could wrap the bottle with bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Makes my skin really smooth and has been improving the appearance of my scars, but that will take more time I think</li>
            <li> I love this Rosehip Oil by Rahda Beauty!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and was packaged well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what i thought:&lt;br /&gt;-It has a nice consistency, definitely not too thick BUT not too thin either!&lt;br /&gt;-It has no smell, which i love, because i&#x27;m putting it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with anything else I have put on.&lt;br /&gt;-It soaks in really fast.&lt;br /&gt;-It makes my skin SO soft and brightens up my skin tone!&lt;br /&gt;-You don&#x27;t need much to cover your whole face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;-The bottle is a good size, and you can even use the oil to make your own beauty recipes.&lt;br /&gt;-This oil does not leave my skin clogged like some oils do.&lt;br /&gt;-It feels light on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Its packaged in a blue cobalt bottle so the oil stays fresh longer.&lt;br /&gt;-It helps to smooth my fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;-This oil is perfect for cracked dry skin..I used it on my heels and they are already so much softer and healthier!&lt;br /&gt;-After using this Rosehip oil for only a few days my skin is noticeably softer and smoother...Even after washing my face or taking a shower i notice my skin is healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you are looking for a good size bottle of high quality Rosehip oil, but also with a price tag you can afford then I highly recommend this company and oil!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I don&#x27;t believe the product I received is actual rosehip oil. This oil is clear and has no odor. I have bought rosehip oil from other companies and the real stuff has an amber color and a very distinct smell. I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the late review!  But very busy lately, but this is an fantastic product!  I have tried quite a few Rosehip oils in the past, and this is the best yet!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I had skin rash on my face for days. My friend suggested this oil, and it worked! The rash was gone 3 days after I started using the oil in replacement of moisturizer. I have a sensitive and combination skin. This product fits my skin type. My skin is softer and it does not look dry or shiny. Thank you!</li>
            <li> As a college student who grew up in California and is now faced with the blistering east coast cold, this oil has been so helpful. The dry, dry winter wind usually gives me scale-like dryness on my face, and no matter how many moisturizers I apply, the scales remain. Oil to the rescue! Here&#x27;s my routine: every night, after washing my face (with a gentle soap), I apply a couple of drops on my face. Once it soaks into my skin (just give it a couple of minutes), I apply a tiny bit of shea butter to really lock that moisture in. My face is glowing despite the harsh cold! One warning: the oil is a sort of light brown color, and it does stain clothes, so be careful with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome for my sensitive combination Michigan skin. I&#x27;m also trying this on my prevention of stretch marks (5mts pregnant). Will update if it works! But so far has helped me on flakiness and redness!</li>
            <li> I should give zero rating</li>
            <li> Radha Rosehip Oil , I am half way through my first bottle and I notice dramatic improvent in my skin. I am on an intensive rejuvenation program and the Rosehip Oil is a key factor. I am using Retin A .05 every other night and Radha Rosehip Oil as my only moisturizer. It gives a beautiful tone and even hydrated quality to my skin. 5 Stars for Radha Rosehip Oil!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. Will order more when i run out.</li>
            <li> This product is very high quality and Organic to boot. Well worth the money and highly recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to add this to my collection of oils. Even more excited when I used it on my skn!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  Great quality, generous amount!  Feels wonderful on my skin and I see and feel a difference already..</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful. Delicate. Exquisite. Elegant. Appealing excellence. Great for all types of skin. Oh, and the bottle is stunning. Highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so this time. My skin looks AMAZING! This time of year my skin starts to show the effects of the harsher weather. But this oil is helping to combat this. It is not heavy and has a pleasant scent. Be careful not to use too much as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is great to use as a moisturizer. It&#x27;s nice, light and fragrance free. It might be an oil, but after using it skin feels soft and dry, not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I like the way this soothes your skin but it smells awful. I don&#x27;t use it when I have to go to work or plan on snuggling with the Mr. cuz it smells like a bad medicine ointment. But it does make your skin feel great if you can stand the smell.</li>
            <li> wow..just wow !!! the Oil keeps his promises. hands down Radha has the best products</li>
            <li> This product really delivers. Visible difference in your skin with comsistent use! It is the best!!</li>
            <li> Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and it has cleared up my rough elbows and moisturizes my face without turning it into an oil slick. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really Awesome ! My skin becomes much brighter !</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful although I have not actually used it other than in one recipe where I found the smell did not last.  Despite this I do think it&#x27;s a great product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in my skin after 2-3 uses.  I could see my laugh lines start to diminish and small crow&#x27;s feet is gone! I use 3 drops twice a day on face, neck and décolletage area.  Amazing and will continue to use.  Dont hesitate.  Buy it now.  I spent hundreds on Strivectin and never seen a difference.</li>
            <li> Most excellent product and it was delivered on time!!!</li>
            <li> so far so good, product came very quickly and I am enjoying using it !!</li>
            <li> fantastic product! my skin is def less dey and my hands too!!</li>
            <li> GLASS DROPPER ARRIVED SHATTERED AS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, AND OIL SMELLS SO BAD I DON&#x27;T WANT IT ON MY SKIN. IT SMELLS RANCID. THERE WERE LITTLE SHARDS OF GLASS THROUGH OUT MY PACKAGE.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s really good. Huge ounce and 100% rosehip oil. Good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time purchasing/using rosehip oil, so I have nothing to compare but this oil soaks into my skin nicely and has no unpleasant aroma. nice glass bottle and dropper which makes it easy to not make a mess (I have other oils in plastic bottles that are very messy). So far I&#x27;m very happy with this oil.</li>
            <li> Great product so far! Helps fade scars.</li>
            <li> Great for your skin.  I use it on my face, no breakout.  Skin looks clearer.  Supposed to help with scarring.  I believe my pores are looking smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Will reorder.</li>
            <li> Great oil. Love it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product. Only been using it for a few days, but loving the results already. Product arrived quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews stating that the oil they received  smelled bad or fishy. I was a little nervous to buy this oil but I was pleasantly surprised. it smells just like rosehips is supposed to lightly nutty. I am very happy with my purchase and have been using it daily. it doesn&#x27;t sink into my skin very fast and I do have to wipe some off if I use it in the morning but I love it.</li>
            <li> I just received this a few days ago... I thought if I didn&#x27;t like the oil, at least I would have the cobalt blue bottle... nope! I was sent a brown bottle, not what is pictured, so I am just slightly disappointed with that. The important thing is the oil seems nice so far, it takes time to soak in... I thought it would become dryer, like a dry-oil. There is no scent, which I am happy about since other reviews said it smelled unpleasant.  The dropper is glass but I wish the tip of the hole was smaller; I have to be very careful because the oil really drips out fast. I will keep using it and see if I notice any improvements in my skin. So far it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I already notice my skin has improved after one week using Organic Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li> Definitely great value for the money, because this is one of the best facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried everything. In fact, I bought some very expensive serum from a famous skin care line recently, which came with a sample of the line&#x27;s best selling moisturizing cream. I put aside my rosehip oil to use the moisturizer, and after a week decided my rosehip oil did a better job of keeping my skin moisturized and smooth, so OUT with the expensive cream.</li>
            <li> Pure and excellent product</li>
            <li> I love it....it&#x27;s a little too early to tell just how much I love it, but time will tell and I promise to let everyone know.......I PROMISED TO LET EVERYONE KNOW and I LOVE IT....I can HONESTLY tell you that this stuff is WONDERFUL.  My skin texture is SOoooo much smoother.  this IS NOT greasy at all.  THIS IS A SUPER BOOSTER for your skin!!!!!!!!#!</li>
            <li> Absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> Big size!  I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out quickly.  Smells little funny but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  My skin is moistured better than before.  I am expecting more result after few weeks.  Hopefully, it will help me to eliminate age spot as well.</li>
            <li> I am using this product twice daily on my face.  My skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I definitely received genuine rosehip oil.  It is a light yellow/amber color, has the weird earthy almost fishy smell, and came in the blue bottle. It works great alone or by adding a few drops to my moisturizer or body lotion.</li>
            <li> Some complaints about  the smell of this product scared me...but they were completely false.  My skin feels noticeably better in the five days I have been using it.  The customer service is clearly interested in making sure that I am pleased with this product and that is rare!!!</li>
            <li> I love Radha Rosehip Oil! This is the first time I have purchased it and I love it.</li>
            <li> I very happy with this product which was packaged well and delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> First off, I will say that this company&#x27;s customer service was as advertised and I&#x27;ll give them 2 stars just for that. Beyond that though, I&#x27;m not sure what to say. The oil I received had a light greenish/gray tint to it which tells me it was NOT rosehip seed oil. It actually appeared clear in the dropper, but when put in a small, white prescription lid you could see the actual color. From everything I&#x27;ve learned about rosehip seed oil it should have a warm amber or tangerine color to it. There may be variations of the depth of color from batch to batch, but all organic, cold-pressed, rosehip seed oil should have this same characteristic color. If it doesn&#x27;t, then its either not rosehip seed oil, or its been chemically altered or otherwise processed to remove the color, and would indicate it is not cold-pressed. It should also have a smell to it, described as earthy, tea like or even a faint fishy smell. This oil has no smell whatsoever. For those rave reviews that state this is wonderful facial oil, I can only wonder if these people 1) Are real users of this oil; 2) Are familiar with authentic rosehip seed oil; 3) Are getting good results because its an oil and any natural oil is good for the face. For me, since I&#x27;m unsure of what kind of oil I actually got, I won&#x27;t be using it and have requested a refund (which is currently processing). I&#x27;ve since placed an order with a national, reputable brand of organic, cold-pressed rosehip seed oil, one that has both the distinct color and smell of genuine rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> This product  has helped my troubled dry skin tremendously.  It&#x27;s really been a blessing to have found this oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product eversince i used it(almost a month) it made my skin beatiful and breakout disappered and scars faded fast.the smell is tolerable and fades when product has been absorbed by the skin and even if i use it under my make up it doesnt make my face oily but with a healthy glow. I just wish it has a pump instead of a dropper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the oil for about a week and it seems great. I might give it more stars in the future except that I&#x27;m noticing a weird trend on Amazon where sellers ask for reviews to be posted (which is fair) but I&#x27;ve already gotten three emails asking/reminding me to do this. It&#x27;s unfair to judge this product after using it only a week although I have liked it very much so far.</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time and was packaged appropriately. The oil seems to be what I expected. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Verified Purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS ITEM!!! I use it for so many things, hair, skin, nails &amp; I&#x27;m telling you, a mix of this &amp; lavender oil helps fade these varicose veins that were starting too appear on my legs. Just so happens about 2 weeks ago i had major surgery, &amp; as soon as the Dr. cleared me for using creams to help with the itch &amp; scarring, i used the Rosehip Oil applied directly on my scars. just few a days ago @ a recheck, the Dr&#x27;s were surprised @ how well it&#x27;s healed &amp; looks pretty good for a &#x27;scar.&#x27; I intend to use it daily (just a few drops!) on my closed wound; I add some to my hair right before shampooing, massage it into my fingernails &amp; use it lightly on my facial sunspots. I was using a different, store-made brand in the past which was nowhere near the quality of Radha. The last brand felt greasy &amp; thick with an unusual smell---- Radha brand absorbs INTO the skin, does NOT feel oily &amp; a little goes a long way. I most certainly intend to purchase this again, along with the Lavendar, &amp; may even give the new Tea-Tree a try.</li>
            <li> Love how my skin feels! Great bottle, no dryflakes</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Nice light oil, absorbs nicely, Organic, and VERY IMPORTANT, NOT tested on animals, and since real rosehip oil is fragrance free this can be mixed with any other of your choice.</li>
            <li> Beautiful rosehip oil....such a fantastic price.  The scent differs from the oil I have been using for two years,which I am assuming is due to the fact that no perfumes have been added, which, to me, is preferable.  I also am reminded of Spirit when I see that name &amp;#34;Radha&amp;#34;.  Radha Soami means &amp;#34;Lord of the Soul&amp;#34;, a term I am familiar with on my meditation path.</li>
            <li> Better than any moisturizer and wrinkle reducer that I&#x27;ve ever used. Smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil on my face since I have read that it is good for aging skin.  It is very silky with a light scent.  I blend with a few EOs and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Awesome oil!  Even though I just received this a few days ago I already am having progress with my skin. It is healing scars pretty quickly.  It also makes the skin very soft. You won&#x27;t regret ordering this oil. The wrinkle reduction needs more time of using this oil and I believe it will happen.</li>
            <li> I expected a certain rose smell and was disappointed at first to not smell it.  I&#x27;ve come to like the fragrance but more importantly I like the oil on my face.  I soaks right it.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Radha Organic Rosehip oil and it has done some amazing things for my skin.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and had trouble with breakouts along with wrinkles beginning to show..when I used harsh acne medication it would dry my skin which brought more wrinkles-ugh. I am also a breast cancer survivor and was looking for a natural alternative for my face.  I first began using Radha rosehip oil under my eyes and dry areas and it did wonders to improve wrinkles and alleviate dry spots without breaking out. But I still had some problems with breakouts/blackheads,since I had good results with the rosehip oil I decided to also try Radha Age-Defying Skin clearing serum every night and now my skin is soft, with tighter pores, no breakouts and wrinkles are fading.  I noticed the skin clearing serum is currently unavailable, please don&#x27;t discontinue!  I highly recommend both products :)</li>
            <li> My skin looks so radiant after using this product.  After a week of nightly use, I&#x27;ve notice that my skin is brighter and healthy looking.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with all of the Radha products that I have ordered. The rosehip oil in particular, is the first product that has stopped my face from developing red patches in the winter. I use this as a serum under my regular moisturizer and it is truly a dry oil. This is a fantasic product for a great price.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.  She has only been using it for a few days, and she can already see a change in her skin tone.  Her crow&#x27;s feet are less obvious.  It is a great product, and the customer service was also good.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Very effectvie oil; at a great price with prompt shipment</li>
            <li> This oil is lovely! It absorbs really well into my skin and I love the scent! I look forward to ordering from this company in the future as it is such a great product and value!</li>
            <li> Finally, something that moisturizes my very dry skin.  I have tried SO many different moisturizers and this one finally does the trick.  The smell is a little strong, but with time I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.  In the beginning I added an essential oil like lavender or rose (diluted) so the smell didn&#x27;t seem so strong.  Now I just use it straight and don&#x27;t even notice the smell.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product.....there was quit a few options when purchasing this item but id have to say i wasnt disappointed in my pick......</li>
            <li> I have been using Radha Rosehip oil for over a year and always get compliments on my skin.  Now I am going to incorporate it into my lotions and new serum I making.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is amazing, especially for the price. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has become a lot smoother and my acne scars are disappearing more quickly since I&#x27;ve been using this. It took about 3 weeks for my skin to &amp;#34;get used to it&amp;#34;...I am acne prone so using new products tends to make me break out. After 3 weeks I noticed less breakouts and brighter looking skin. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this oil twice a week. On days when I&#x27;m at home I forego with any other creams/serum during the day and  I use this as a spa treatment of some sort. I rub it on my palms to warm it them pat it on my face. I do my chores and at the end of the day my face is still very moisturized. No odor which is a plus for me. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Received on time and product is exactly as described. Will further comment on the outcome after using it for a few weeks.  Using on exzema, fine wrinkles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the deep blue bottle and the dropper makes it so easy to dispense the right amount for my face.</li>
            <li> After researching the benefits of essential oils in treating scars, I decided to try rosehip oil. The oil is light, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on clothing or bedding. I&#x27;ve been applying the oil 1-2 times daily for just over a month and my scars have visibly lightened, become softer and are no longer reddish in hue. Since purchasing, I also learned that rosehip oil is excellent for aging skin and have found that the oil, applied under my eyes, has visibly reduced my fine lines (more so than my expensive cosmetic creams, which I discontinued using while trying the oil). Radha&#x27;s rosehip oil is excellent quality and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Received my order several days ago and love it.....Even though i&#x27;ve only been using for 3 days now, it&#x27;s amazing how my skin feels.  I used on my face and it was a little oily the first 1/2 or so but after that it felt wonderful.  I&#x27;m 73 and just wish I had used this continually for 40 or some odd years.  The delivery from Radha was quick and well packaged, will not hesitate to order again from them</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer for my face. Makes a great carrier oil for some healing essential oils too.</li>
            <li> This bottle is lacking the golden color I&#x27;ve come to expect. Also It has less viscosity, so it&#x27;s harder to control.</li>
            <li> I love this Rhada Beauty Rosehip Seed Oil!  I am just starting to use all natural skin care products on my face and this one does so many good things for your skin, I use it as my nighttime moisturizer.  It seems a bit oily when you first put it on, but it soaks in the skin quickly so your skin doesn&#x27;t feel all oily.  There are so many benefits to using Rose Hip Seed Oil on your skin, and this one is of very high quality.  I love the way it makes my skin feel, and the next morning it still feels so soft.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is legit</li>
            <li> Great Product  For skin and hair. Even though this is an oil and I have problem skin ( usually I have to have oil free products), this product moisturizes without clogging my pores, very good moisturizer.  This works well on my dry, chemically treated hair to add moisture, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use this the way I was supposed to or maybe I was expecting a miracle but I saw/felt no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it a little while before I wrote a review, and I am very pleased.  I have been using it at night on my face and neck, and I really like the results.  I think I look better and my skin feels softer.  I will try it on my hands, elbows and heels of my feet too.  I like it very much.  It arrived on time and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m amazed at the amount of product you get. This is a huge bottle. The oil itself is thin(be sure and place your hand next to the bottle to catch spills as you lift the dropper out because its too thin for the dropper to hold it in properly) and has very little odor. It glides on nice and has a nice feel. I can&#x27;t see any results yet, I was holding off on reviewing for some results but finally decided to go ahead and say what I could about it. Even without results, the product is a value for 100% rosehip oil</li>
            <li> This smells awful and is like putting crisco oil on your face..Never again.</li>
            <li> Great value, fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very hydrating. I&#x27;ve been using it A few days, and my skin is showing signs of improvement. Less redness, more even skintone&amp; texture.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  I&#x27;m going to make hand cream with it but haven&#x27;t done it yet.</li>
            <li> I was immediately seduced. Have been using for a couple of weeks every morning under my sunscreen. I have sensitive skin that is not one to protect me from the occasional spatter of acne, however this certainly doesn&#x27;t trigger that behavior. It sits well under the sunscreen and any make up I apply. I was concerned it would cause my mascara to end up all under my eyes but the oil doesn&#x27;t seem to be my mascara&#x27;s enemy. My skin looks dewy. I dig dewy skin. I have also used it on my body under other lotions. Not bad, not bad.</li>
            <li> Radha Beauty Rosehip Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this oil specifically for my shampoo recipe. My hair feels clean and soft and less frizz. It is such a wonderful product. I get essential oils for making homemade gifts for my friends and family. I make lip balms, bubble bath, body scrubs, shampoo, and body wash. This rosehip oil was easy to use in my recipes and smelled great. It&#x27;s a better brand than the others that I have used the smell is better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used, and enjoyed the benefits of, other Rose Hip oil, but I love the purity of Radha. From the first drop, the improvement to my skin is evident. Also, Radha offers good advice and information on their product that other companies do not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I just recieved this today and I must say I absolutely love this Rosehip oil! While in the shower I applied to my hair and to body wash after getting out of the shower I felt my skin, it felt amazing,it was so soft. I;m so glad I found this product I have suffered with eczema my whole life and so does my daughter I think I found our go to product when we start to get the dry itchy skin! Thank you so much for an amazing product and I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  It stays on and does not cause any skin nor eye irritation when it comes close to the eyes.  I&#x27;ve used it for just a few days so far, but I can tell it is helping my very dry skin.  Much better than the argan oil I had been using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 4 days since I started using this product in combination with coconut oil and I can already see a difference in my stretch marks. They are visibly reduced. I&#x27;m hoping the more I use the more they disappear. I apply the rosehip in the am and the coconut oil in the pm</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 sytars but I have only used it for a few days, so far it&#x27;s great.  I put it on my face and hands and especially on my nails which were damaged from gel polish.  It feels silky and soaks right in.  It never feels oily or greasy.  Looking forward to seeing if some of the brown spots on my hands and arms lighten.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews for products anymore.  After 10 years of buying on this site, it just gets to be a chore.  But in all the years that I&#x27;ve been trying new and expensive anti-aging this or sculpting and wrinkle removing that, never have I ever come across a product that I&#x27;ve put on my face that has had such astounding results.  Crows feet that I&#x27;ve had for years, which I&#x27;ve applied both every all-natural hippie formulation or synthetic serum on, are now almost gone within less than a week of using this product twice a day (now I&#x27;m bumping it up to 3 times a day!)  My skin glows creamy with a gentle rosey-ness, and a dewey youthful rounding out of my more angular features is taking place.  A literal transformation before my eyes with how quickly it seems to be working!    As a dude with a scientific bent, I&#x27;m very objective in my evaluation of effectiveness.  I test and retest, compare effects against the outcomes of different products, arrive at conclusions that are fair and balanced.  This is a product where every star has earned itself rightfully.  I will be buying again and again.    One note, though: as a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil, it won&#x27;t dry out your facial skin, but it will dry out and irritate/chap mucosal skin - so keep it away from the line of your eyelids and your lips.  If you want to moisturize your lips, shea butter is the best possible balm I&#x27;ve found (mix it with powdered stevia extract and peppermint or sweet orange oil for flavor and sweetness.)</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great oil...Five stars!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love it, my skin looks younger, moisture all the time, the dark spots and sun damage in my face looks like it&#x27;s fading.  I will definitely buy this product again. I recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil seems to be very good for skin.  It has a nice smell too.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products for skincare ranging from your over-the-counter brands like Oil of Olay to more high-end brands like Shiseido. I&#x27;ve also tried coconut, jojoba, grapeseed, geranium, lavendar and argan oil. My skin would be described as a combination of oily and dry; I get dry patches on my cheeks and chin, but I have a slightly oily forehead and nose. After I discovered a bottle of rosehip seed oil at the market, I began to use it. Within 2-3 weeks I noticed my skin was softer and healthier-looking, my wrinkles were finer, and my age spots were getting lighter—even my mother asked me if I was using makeup to cover my &amp;#34;freckles.&amp;#34; This is my first time using Radha Rosehip Oil, so let&#x27;s hope it delivers the same results as the first bottle I discovered; regardless, rosehip oil has CHANGED MY LIFE and I&#x27;ll be sticking to it for a very long time!</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin. Also worked great healing up a burn from the toaster. No scar! Also, used after a long day at the beach. No greasy feeling, skin was sooo soft, and I think it took the burn out of the sunburned shoulders! Great product! Have noticed a lot of skin moisturizing products with rose hip oil. This 100% oil is wonderful! This was an amazon trader purchase. Free and WORTH it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face morning and night and have noticed a HUGE difference in my complexion. Changed for the better!!</li>
            <li> Five stars is not enough but that&#x27;s what it when up to, it&#x27;s by far the best , I&#x27;ll give them five planets :D</li>
            <li> Great product and great price. Face glows and skin stays soft all day.</li>
            <li> The product arrived well-packaged so the glass bottle wouldn&#x27;t break in transit. I have heard about the healing properties of rose hips but never tried it. I used a little on my hands which are very dry. After a couple of days I&#x27;m amazed how it was absorbed but not greasy. A little goes a long way. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The last batch of 4 bottles did NOT work as well as previous purchase, the color was way too dark and did not do as well.I opened all 4 and tried them alternately to see if some bottles were as good as the first but none of them performed as I expected. Sad and sorry customer here. I wonder what went wrong. I am disgusted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few weeks now and I can say that it does a great job of hydrating my face. I&#x27;m 36 , have acne scars on my skin (I&#x27;m Indian and my scars stay dark for a VERY long time) and have seborrheic dermatitis around my hair line and ears. Unfortunately, this oil has not done anything to improve my dermatitis even though in their product description they do seem to suggest that this oil  helps with dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bottles of it (one was for a friend) and at 4oz they are a good deal, but their only benefit for me, seems to be as a moisturizer. Hasn&#x27;t helped with my scars or my dermatitis. It doesn&#x27;t clog the pores and my skin feels hydrated without looking oily.</li>
            <li> My skin feels AMAZING!!! I thought I would use this just on my face, however I have been slathering it everywhere before bed and after the shower. My skin looks great not to mention my hair is soft and shinny after washing the oil out. I even got a sun burn on my shoulders yesterday and last night I rubbed a few drops on the burn and this morning I woke up to a beautiful tan (no peeling!) I will buy this product forever!</li>
            <li> A wonderful product. My face feels and looks better after 1 application! A very good value also.</li>
            <li> Delightful. I have been using the pure Radha Rosehip Oil for several weeks now. Unadulterated, directly out of the bottle. So fresh, nourishing, mild and lovely. It&#x27;s just the kind of product that appeals to me. I am also looking forward to blending it with the Argan Oil and lavender essential oil from Radha with some local beeswax to make a gentle salve.</li>
            <li> This rose hip oil is awesome. The quality is fantastic. It makes my skin feel so great. It arrived in a secure package in a timely fashion. I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> it is  very GOOD too, dissapears quickly from the skin not leaving a residue or burning  in the eyes. its my first time using it.</li>
            <li> My wife bought it, She loves it very much.&lt;br /&gt;As a man I don&#x27;t like using such product,  she forced it to use it, it worked pretty well  :P</li>
            <li> I love this product as its makes my skin so soft and it really heal your dry skin</li>
            <li> Love this oil!  I use it in most of my diy beauty recipes!</li>
            <li> LOVE THEIR PRODUCTS - THE RADHA LAVENDER OIL IS SOME OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED! On par with Du Terra oil.</li>
            <li> I use this oil at night because it is, well , oily. They give you a generous amount for the price compared to others I&#x27;ve tried. It makes my skin feel hydrated.</li>
            <li> Oil absorbs quickly . . . I haven&#x27;t noticed any odor that others have mentioned.  It leaves my skin feeling soft which is very nice . . . Florida sun can ravage skin.</li>
            <li> This is it. I have found the holy grail of skin care. VISIBLE, yes, VISIBLE results to skin tone/texture in a week. Smells a little funky, but it doesn&#x27;t last. My skin lovingly eats it up and the smell vanishes before I leave the house in the morning. And yes, I&#x27;ve head people sniff my face to be sure. After years of experimenting with all kinds of blends, this little blue bottle of pure rosehip oil blew me away.</li>
            <li> Very nice ...good quality...fast shipping...will buy again...thank you....</li>
            <li> Received a brown bottle, with no scent or colour - not the right item at all Replaced with no fuss, very happy</li>
            <li> great service &amp; love the products</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I like this stuff !  I am not one for lotions, etc... usually don&#x27;t like the feel of them glopping up my pores... but this stuff I thoroughly enjoy using ! Also, my skin is REALLY dry and &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m 52)... I am amazed at what an improvement this oil makes and also that even the next day, my skin stills looks moisturized... I bought 2 bottles - one had a slight Rose-y fragrance, and the other none at all... but no matter.  I bought it for its skin benefits, not for its fragrance, and I am completely Happy with the results !!!</li>
            <li> I am 57 and have just added rose hip to my skin care regimen. After one week of use I have already noticed the lines around my eyes and lips have diminished greatly. I wear less makeup and my skin feels more supple. I would recommend this product to anyone at any age.</li>
            <li> this is most certainly NOT Rosehip seed oil.  Probably a combination of soy, rapeseed and cheap olive oil.  I returned mine.  don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Think it really works!</li>
            <li> Radha oils rock!  Tea tree oil is amazing, peppermint is very potent and has strong vapors... Works great on my bedding in the laundry with 3-5 drops... I even add it to my febreeze fabric allergy spray - perfect.  Rose hip extract oil makes skin supple immediately.... Long term results will be realized with regular use I hope... I&#x27;m 1 week in.</li>
            <li> I love the look of the glass container it is in.Also, there is no fragrance to his oil which is perfect for sensitive skin sufferers like my daughter. This comes complete with a glass eye dropper which aids in usage of this oil to make sure your recipes are on point. My daughter suffers from eczema and this seems to really help her out. She had a flare up when we received it, so we began using this immediately. This worked so wonderful. I applied it after bathtime. It absorbed very nicely and quickly into her skin. She wasn&#x27;t left with that oily feeling you would come to expect with using oil. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using  this oil for a week now. I cannot believe the difference in my skin!!!! I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and have sensitive skin.  My complexion has improved so much in only one week..  What a  FABULOUS OIL.  This rosehip oil absorbs so quickly.  I also appreciate the follow-up from your company.  Great products and super service.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> Rose hip oil is a great moisturizer.  My only thought it that 4 ounces is A LOT of rose hip oil.  I only use like a drop or two per day so maybe a 2 ounce bottle would have been sufficient.</li>
            <li> Was ok i wounder  if it really organic used 6 other rosehip oil the feel and smell were organic . This one was different</li>
            <li> This is a great facial moisturizer. I use it morning and night.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice and long term benefits. It does not feel greasy and soaks into my skin quickly. I was concerned about an odor but there is none.  I would recommend this product and this vendor to others.</li>
            <li> I have used other oils on my face, and this one is, by far, the best I have used.  My daughter is an esthetician and she uses rosehip oil during her facials.  But I didn&#x27;t realize the full benefits until I used this on a daily basis.  I&#x27;m 49 this year and this plumps up all the fine lines around my eyes and my entire face looks smoother and has a really nice glow.  The oil absorbs without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I am giving a 3 right now because I have not used this specific product long, but have used rosehip seed oil for a while and love it. The reason I am skeptical of this is because the color, smell and consistency is so different from the other two brands I have tried. This product has NO smell, is very light in color, similar to almond oil or something. The other products I have tried before (which themselves differ from each other a little) are much darker in color, thicker in consistency and have faint scents that remind me of coffee. I don&#x27;t under stand how there can be such a difference between this and other products?? I am going to post this question for this item, and the other two brands I have ordered.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it on my face right before bed! I also use it as my moisturizer before I put on my make up</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and my skin already feels smoother and firmer. It is not at all greasy. The smell is very pleasant compared to other rose hip oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> Smooth and goes on my face great.  Quality product.  I love it.  Brightens my face as I use it under my normal daily moisturizure.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil. I am so glad with the results I am getting. I am really glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Time to change things up a bit as what I have been using isn&#x27;t working anymore. Thanks to all the reviews, I thought this should be my first oil to try.  Amazing!  Working on clearing up the residual of eczema on my arms.  Didn&#x27;t realize my skin was so dry till I used this.  Feel like I have been given a whole body of new skin.  Gave this to my husband to try on his face.  Really made a difference after the first application.  Redness gone and roscea diminishing.  This is working better for him than what the dermatologist gave him. Love the dropper in the bottle. Great product. Vendor is great to work with as well.  What have you got to lose?</li>
            <li> I love this not only does it work well for wrinkles  but it is helping my grandson dry skin condition I recived  this  product  at  a  discount  for  a  honest  review</li>
            <li> Love this oil. It&#x27;s absorbent and feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a godsend for you skin, my face has never looked and felt so good, Will buy many more times</li>
            <li> Just as described. Great product. No problems so far with acne prone skin. I mix it with pure aloe Vera and wear overnight to moisturize after using drying acne products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week and I love it.  I wash my face, use witch hazel, then use this as my moisturizer day and night.  I use a cotton ball so it helps with leaving any extra oil and then massage into my skin. I love the glow it gives me and so far I can see it&#x27;s transforming my skin from looking dull to youthful.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with your rosehip oil-it is a product I see using for many years to come. I would recommend your product to anyone looking for a moisture boosting face treatment for mid to late years!! I find it works well for whole body. Wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rosehip oil twice a day for over 10 years as part of my facial regime.... and I swear by it!  I just started using Radha Rosehip Oil and really love the quality of this product!</li>
            <li> Great quality, fast shipping. Thank you</li>
            <li> Now this does exactly what it says it does.  My little skin &amp;#34;irregularities&amp;#34; are slowly disappearing and that&#x27;s what I had hoped for.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> Face changer.&lt;br /&gt;Love it !</li>
            <li> 5 stars because 9 stars was not an option.  Received better than my monies worth.</li>
            <li> Great Value! Use about a dime size on face, hands, especially cuticles and elbows! Noticed a difference in my skin 5 days in.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels on my face!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, excellent transaction. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The product that I received is the proper clear golden amber color and the scent is strong but sweet which quickly fades away. It leaves your skin super soft and supple as though you just received both a facial and microdermabrasion. I make sure to tightly secure the cap and store my bottle in the refrigerator door. The dropper isn&#x27;t the best but you get used to it so you don&#x27;t make a mess (basically don&#x27;t squeeze any additional oil into the dropper and just work with whatever drips off naturally.) I&#x27;m very happy with the product quality and performance and will reorder from this supplier. Don&#x27;t forget to use in conjunction with sunscreen on both face and hands. Even though your skin absorbs the oil quickly you don&#x27;t need but a few drops, and it won&#x27;t clog up your pores so it&#x27;s safe for oily skin and T-zones. This bottle should last a while using on your face and hands twice daily for anti-aging and evening out skin tone, maybe a little less if using for large patches of eczema or psoriasis on the body. As of now I can&#x27;t say if it works on scars or stretchmarks as I haven&#x27;t tried it for that purpose yet.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! The first time I used it, I felt an immediate improvement in my skin.  It was soft without being greasy.  It absorbed quickly and I didn’t feel a need for moisturizer.  I used a few drops on my hands and felt instant relief.  My hands get so chapped and dry in the winter.  I look forward to continued improvement in the texture and health of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
            <li> So far best Rosehip Oil I have ever found for the price~</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My first time ordering, but will definitely order again.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t have that awful rosehip smell.</li>
            <li> This is great added moisturizer for my face because I add a couple drops in my moisturizer and apply to on my skin. It is gentle on my skin because I have sensitive skin. Also I use it in my hair to help make my hair look healthy. The rosehip oil helps with my scalp from being dry and flakey. I love that this rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it because other brands have a weird nasty smell to their rosehip oil. Since you only need a couple drops of this rosehip oil it will last you a very long time. It is really nice it came with a dropper to make it easy to get the product out of the bottle. I really like that the only ingredient is rosehip oil because I like using natural products on my skin rather than product filled with chemicals. I received this rosehip oil for free to test and review then give my honest unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> This bottle of oil was larger than I expected which was nice. The package is also nice, feels quality. I like the eye dropper. The oil itself has almost no smell. It has a nice texture, seems to moisturize nicely. Can&#x27;t say if there are any long term benefits because I haven&#x27;t been using it long but it keeps my face moisturized through the day. Overall I&#x27;m pretty pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product to review but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical about rosehip seed oil working for my oily, acne-prone skin, but I decided to give it a try after I recently had a bad breakout that just wouldn&#x27;t stop spreading. Almost my entire face was red, irritated, flaky, oily, and covered in whiteheads - yikes, right? After just six days of applying this oil twice a day, my skin is almost completely clear for the first time in months. Any new pimples literally heal overnight when I use this oil, and it even seems to shrink pimples before they form. I have a lot of hyperpigmentation and boxcar/ice pick scarring from a severe breakout I had when I was 19, and this oil has visibly evened out my skin so much in under a week; the hyperpigmentation is almost completely gone! I&#x27;ve also used it for random scars/stretch marks on my body, though I haven&#x27;t seen an improvement in stretch marks (yet!). I&#x27;m finally starting to love the way my skin looks, and I can&#x27;t wait to see the improvements over time! I will definitely be repurchasing this product when my huge 4 oz. bottle runs out. Thank you, Radha Beauty!  Edit 12/27/15: After months of experimentation with this product, I still consider this oil to be a valuable addition to my skincare regimen. I did eventually find that this oil didn&#x27;t suit my face for daily all-over use, but I still use it regularly to help heal individual acne spots faster and in my occasional bentonite clay masks. Spots and scars heal MUCH more quickly with the help of rosehip oil, and when I use 1-3 drops in my masks, my skin is always soft and refreshed when I rinse the mask off. I&#x27;ve also tried this oil on dry and cracked skin on my hands and feet and on bug bites with great results! Since my first review, I&#x27;ve also added this product to my hair regimen, so pretty much every day, I apply 1-2 drops to the ends of my long, fine, breakage-prone hair to prevent split ends and keep them soft and shiny between washes, and I&#x27;ve mixed it with jojoba and EVOO for oil treatments. Argan oil, eatyour heart out! Lol. Oh, and after 8 months of daily use, I still have 1/3 of my 4 oz. bottle left, and it has kept just fine at room temperature. I would definitely recommend this product for wound healing, scars, dry skin, and dry hair!</li>
            <li> Feel moisturized and smooth after I applied the oil to my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Rosehip oil for one week now and I love it! It&#x27;s very moisturizing! This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Rosehip, I usually use Johoba mixed with some essential oils. But I&#x27;ve been using this with essential oils and some days mixed with the Johoba and essential oil mixture I make. I really love it! Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products, I only use very natural products with no chemicals and heard of this company from a friend of mine. I&#x27;d also like to mention that they have wonderful customer service, and speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> I love my rosehip oil. However the new bottle I received has a tinit of orange. Is there a change??</li>
            <li> This product is just as amazing as the seller&#x27;s service! I will definitely order again... and then again!</li>
            <li> Horrible! I don&#x27;t know what kind of oil this is, but what I got was not rosehip oil. I refrigerated as stated and the “rosehip oil” became clumpy and froze, which from my understanding rosehip oil does not do when refrigerated. I read some of the other bad reviews and I noticed this happened to other people with their purchase as well. I decided to go to Whole Foods and just purchase some there, that rosehip oil did not freeze and is working perfectly. Never ordering from this company again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this and getting my money back.</li>
            <li> I do LOVE this product and will order it again in the future.  I am glad that Amazon made we aware of it as I make an oil based facial cream incorporating several oils in a cream base and am very happy to include this wonderful oil.  I also like to use it alone for various apps.  Your packaging and presentation is lovely as well.  I suppose it&#x27;s silly, but I am very partial to blue bottles.&lt;br /&gt;The eye gel I ordered is also wonderful -- again will order in future.&lt;br /&gt;Good job!&lt;br /&gt;Good products!</li>
            <li> Understand, my bathroom looks like a beauty supply store.  I have tried it all, and still keep looking for new discoveries.  Nearly every facial oil claims to be highly absorbable by the skin - I&#x27;m sure there is chemistry and biology behind these properties, size of molecules and all - but none really are.  Until this.  This rose hip oil sinks into my skin completely, leaving it supple and hydrated but not greasy.  I love it.  It is also very, very reasonably priced (I have have had oils that run up to $200/oz, which makes me furious in hindsight) and comes capped with a separate dropper cap - and the dropper is actually long enough to fit all the way down into the bottle.  I highly recommend this product and will explore other offerings from Rhada.</li>
            <li> I have dirched my usual moisturizer in favor of this oil and my skin looks and feels better after a week. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I had ever used rosehip oil and I love it. I tend to have combination skin with it being more on the dry side and the rose oil is the first product that I&#x27;ve used that is really perfect for controlling the oil and the dryness. It moisturizes my skin without feeling at all greasy. Since using it my complexion has also become a lot more even and people have even said that my skin has a glow to it. I like to put it on before my makeup because it gives the makeup a fresh dewy look. And you can&#x27;t beat the price of this rosehip oil for the amount that you get. I&#x27;ve been using it 1-2 times a day for the last three months and there&#x27;s probably still 3/4 or even more left.</li>
            <li> I have had a host of skin problems my whole life: severe eczema, icthyosis vulgaris, dermatographic uticaria, occasional hives outbreaks due to allergies, and hopelessly dry skin in general. I&#x27;ve been in and out of dermatologists&#x27; offices with all kinds of prescriptions ointments, some steroidal and some not, and have tried applying gentle/thick creams (Eucerin, CeraVe, etc.) every day for years to calm my skin down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has helped moisturize my skin more, and reduce old scars, than this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try it. It may take 2-3 weeks of routine use to see a difference, but it will work.</li>
            <li> Very light, sweet scent, almost imperceptible,  I have used this for a couple of weeks now and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  I started getting those tiny lines from aging and  this oil is a big help in reducing them.  I&#x27;ve also used it mixed with other oils in a coconut oil carrier on blemishes and dry skin with great results!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; I wanna say thank you for the seller for the free samples. This product is i really need to make my skin healthy. Its naturally toning the skin it and it reduce wrinkles.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> love it and would order it again</li>
            <li> This appears to not be rose hip oil. It is a clear, scent-free oil. The positive reviews are suspect. :( I returned it.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this oil!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It comes in a beautiful blue, glass bottle which is three ounces and the dropper came with it as well. I saw a difference the moment I used it! Just two drops and my face was glowing. It was soft and smooth where I have these rough patches on my skin. A++ Radha</li>
            <li> love this product!!! after using it for a week I started noticing the redness on my skin reduced and  my skin start glowing. highly recommend this product for people with skin condition like rosacea.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of this 4 oz. oil on Amazon and I first gave it 5 stars because it seemed good.  I purchased it the second time because the price was way down and I still thought it was good.  I purchased it to keep on hand for when I ran out of my current Rosehip oil which I purchased at a great price on another online store.  It&#x27;s too late now to get a refund.  I hate to leave less than 5 star reviews unless there is a real problem and I&#x27;m not sure about this one. What I&#x27;m wondering about regarding this oil is that it has no color and little if any odor. Apparently this is indicative of processed oil to remove the color and odor.  I thought the no color or odor was good, but in my research, I see that good quality rosehip  oil is a yellow-orange color and it has a mildly fishy odor. My previous Eve Hanson rosehip oil had this color and odor, but I gave it a lesser review because wasn&#x27;t wild about the color and smell and had tried the Radha here, which didn&#x27;t have it.  My third purchased rosehip oil was from Life-Flo and had both the color and odor.  I liked everything about it (got it on special on iHerb or one of the online stores).  I&#x27;m not 100% sure on any of this and if anyone can shed more factual light on the color/odor thing, it would be appreciated.  I&#x27;ll ask Radha here ... why does your oil have no color or odor??  Is it because it&#x27;s been processed out??  I know that reviews are very important to sellers and if possible I will change this and give five stars if you can convince me that no color and no odor is a good thing in rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous Review:&lt;br /&gt;I had read that rosehip oil is very beneficial for the skin so I tried Eve Hansen through Amazon which is also 4 oz. and was about the same price as this Radha product. I liked that oil enough to want to re-purchase rosehip oil.  I read more reviews and it was a toss up as to purchasing Radha or Eve Hansen.  I decided to try this 4 oz bottle from Radha, and, in comparing the two, I would not go back to Eve Hansen, though I liked that oil, too.  Both seem to go on very smoothly and to absorb into the skin very quickly (not immediately, but in an hour or so, my skin (face) did not seem very oily).  The two things notably DIFFERENT in this Radha oil is that it does not have the &amp;#34;kind of fishy&amp;#34; odor to it that the Eve Hansen had, and it is clear in color rather than the more yellow color of the other brand oil.  This oil also seems slightly thicker, though that may be my imagination. I&#x27;m not sure what rosehip oil is supposed to be in color or smell so I&#x27;m only going on preference here, since both seemed to have the same effect on my skin.  I use this oil on my face and neck and add to a few problem spots in other areas with what&#x27;s left on my hand(s) after I&#x27;ve applied it to my face. Trader Joes Jojoba oil is a lot less expensive, but there is something very nice about this oil and I think (??) my skin is improved after using if twice a day for 4-5 months. I&#x27;m not young and so I&#x27;m not worried about acne or having too oily skin so that may play into the picture. The oil goes on and remains oily for a while, but it does seem to &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; quickly, as I stated previously.  I have a couple of age or brown spots on my face and I think I&#x27;m starting to see them fade a bit. Unfortunately, I doubt one is going to see overnight results with age spots etc. though that would be nice.go back to Eve Hansen, though I liked that oil, too.

            <li> So I&#x27;ve had oily combo skin for as long as I can remember. My entire face would be oily in 20min and my nose dry and peeling. I tried so many products to dry out my face to prevent the oilyness which made my skin freak out. With they being said, my face produced more oil to help compensate for me trying to dry it out which wasn&#x27;t a pretty situation. I initially ordered this oil to prevent crows feet and help keep my skin looking young. I went ahead and slathered this all over my face to see what would happen and it&#x27;s the best decision of my life!!! I use this every single day as my moisturizer!! I&#x27;m in love!! My skin is no longer oily I have a beautiful healthy glow and my nose isn&#x27;t dry anymore. This oil also gets rid of dark marks. When I apply my makeup my skin looks so flawless and beautiful. Not to mention super hydrated and no longer oily. Who would have thought putting an oil on oily skin can help?! This oil leaves no greasy residue and has my skin feeling amazing and supple!! Highly recommended!! Will continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I have been using this rosehip oil on my face for 2 weeks now.  I really appreciate that it does not have much of a smell. I love that it soaks in to your skin quickly leaving a non greasy feeling.  My skin is much softer.  GREAT as a moisturizer.  I tried it on my hair but did not have much luck.  Even a little bit made any stray grey hair shiny and much more noticeable. Oh well, i&#x27;ll have to keep trying different products for my curly frizzy hair.  I was hoping for a one product fits all.&lt;br /&gt;Did not happen.</li>
            <li> I have always had horrible skin, anytime I walked outside on a humid day I always prepared myself for my new breakouts. I recently moved to Japan where it&#x27;s rediculously humid and I needed something fast, my breakouts were getting bad. I stumbled across this oil and ordered it, I will never use anything else on my face. I don&#x27;t get any new breakouts and my face is almost flawless. My pores are super tiny it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> the first time I order one I use it all and I like it then I reorder again but  then when I open it it&#x27;s not the same like the other  .The color different and  also have the smell . I really like the first one it clear color and doesn&#x27;t have smell . I wonder why it different ????</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good ND the age 4oz make it go along way. I put it into my sugar scrub and will soon ad it to my butter</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good oil to use on my face after moisturizer and I found it in this product! I think this oil has 100% helped with evening my skin tone and fading my dark spots. I don&#x27;t really have aging skin but I&#x27;ve heard that this is a great oil for rejuvenating the skin cells, let&#x27;s just say I haven&#x27;t been told I look old!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I got, like these 1 star reviewers said, the color is that of vegetable oil which is almost clear with a light tint and has no smell.  So...what do I have?  I tried contacting the seller to ask but I was unable to.  I&#x27;ll update later if I get more info.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I added some of my favorite perfume.  So easy and simple for keeping your skin healthy and young!  I use it everywhere, everyday.  Also use it on my kids!</li>
            <li> Heard about this company from Banana Blondie and ordered right away. Have very sensitive skin and cannot use many products, but this oil make a great moisturizer and I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I Love this rosehip oil. I was skeptical about putting oil on my face because I thought if would make it break out but this oil is perfect. My face is not dry anymore. Thanks a bunch</li>
            <li> My skin is looking fresh and bright. My melasma isn&#x27;t quite fading, but it has only been a month, and several people at work have said things to the effect of &amp;#34;What do you use for your face?&amp;#34; Or you look rested. The best thing though, my 2 kids rub their faces against my 43 year old face, and they purr with delight how soft it is. It is also helping with my sons eczema. I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s hairdresser introduced her to Rose oil to soothe hand and foot nail cuticles.  My sister shared this tip with me-this product works like a dream.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is an incredible product––it absorbs quickly, so no worries about getting oil on clothing, paper, etc. It also leaves my skin feeling smooth but not greasy; I&#x27;ve enjoyed putting it in baths for an extra but of moisture as well as adding it to lotions. In the evenings, I put it on after Radha&#x27;s Skin Clearing serum, and the combination has proven beneficial for my sensitive skin. It has hardly any scent, and the dropper keeps everything neat.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful luxurious Rosehip oil from a great company. I love what it does for my skins clarity, diminishing blemishes and reducing pore size.  I&#x27;m excited by all the products I&#x27;ve used and look forward to a long relationship.  Update 10/2015 Sorrybto say I am now purchasing my rosehip from another Amazon seller. Radha&#x27;s product has been a dark gold color with a rancid mall. Tried working it out but company insists this is normal. Which it&#x27;s not. So for this item Ive switched companies. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Great product, and received quickly</li>
            <li> Lol love this oil. Was sceptical of all the claims at first. After only 4 days I could see a clearnes of my face... It even smoothed the skin on my neck and chest. The best.&lt;br /&gt; L</li>
            <li> My skin is so much better !  It works!  You can see the difference in a couple of days!</li>
            <li> My reason for trying rosehip oil is to counteract the dryness from the melasma / brown spot/enlarged pores treatments that I&#x27;ve been using that have been really drying on my skin. I&#x27;ve been buying moisturizers and treatments for dry skin and am now trying less commercial products since I am not seeing good results results from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had melasma for a few years now, age spots/sun damage spots that I have noticed over the last couple of years and am just now using products to bleach and fade the skin discoloration.  These included glycolic acid peels, hydroquinone and they are not easy on my skin, I get a lot of redness and dryness, a bit of sensitivity as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it 4 days so far but already see a significant change in the texture of my skin where it was showing the most dryness, areas I wasn&#x27;t seeing results when using the other Olay and Neutrogena products.  I put a few drops of this oil in my hands and then pat it on my face into the drier areas and work it into the trouble spots, in particular my forehead and cheek/chin area. I&#x27;m not using it on my nose because I don&#x27;t have spots in this area and it is the only place on my face that gets oily. My skin will typically break out in hours if something irritates it and so far I am seeing no irritation.  This surprised me because one of the products I tried recently was Bio-oil and that caused break outs.  I think it is the mineral oil in that  product that doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin.  I notice the deeper creased in my forehead are smoother over these last few days, I also find that gently patting this into the skin under my eyes really helps to smooth at the lines there, the fine lines are much less noticeable.  I wear makeup 3 days a week and found over the last 2 days that my foundation is not grabbing onto the dry spots anymore and I am not seeing as much settling and creasing into the fine lines under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added but unexpected benefit is the difference in my hands since this is my method for applying the oil, they are really smooth and soft and not nearly as crapey .  Rosehip oil was already on my radar and I came across a coupon which is why I tried this brand but this doesn&#x27;t influence my review of this product or brand.  I was actually looking to buy argan oil which is really expensive if you buy genuine ecocert argan oil and I decided to try this instead.  I am really pleased with this product, both in price and in performance.  This  doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t try argan oil, I hear it is terrific for your hair but now there is no rush to look for a suitable dry-patch product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure of this product lessening dark spots or melasma as other reviewers say they have seen, and these results in less than a week.  I find that kind of testimonial a bit suspect and I have seen none of that for myself (nothing more significant than the current products used currently).  I will say I am impressed that it feels really nice under my eyes, touching lightly with my ring fingers it feels plumper somehow, and definitely softer.  If for nothing else I will continue using this for that area alone since I&#x27;ve lost a bit of elasticity there and this makes it feel really nice.d for applying the oil, they are really smooth and soft and not nearly as crapey .

            <li> I love it ...l feel my face soft and my dark spots now are lees dark.</li>
            <li> the Rosehip Oil is amazing! I like it its a Great SIZE bottle the dropper picks it up great ... not to happy with how greasy the stuff feels on your face however it drys just fine.. I want to take a photo of my face close up to see the difference .. I have accually been putting a little extra under my eyes and its helping under there i can see. So glad I got this to try out i am very happy.</li>
            <li> Arrived well packed. Oil leaves skin feeling soft and non irritating;)</li>
            <li> For some reason I just love the smell of it! I use this oil at night after exfoliating, you can really feel the blood rise to your face and then you wake up in the morning looking refreshed. You can use Rosehip for literally anything..For example on your armpits, strangely it keeps me from getting the stank, or this one time I had those random ear infections or rather maybe it was a pimple in my ear?? Anyway, I rubbed a little alcohol and then Rosehip and BAM! Felt better the next day :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll enjoy it too :D</li>
            <li> I have horrible dermatitis on my face and it had gotten to a point where medication wasn&#x27;t even helping. After some &#x27;googling&#x27; I read that rose hip oil helps. I&#x27;ve been using this now for only 3 days (along with clay facial soap vs ones with sulfates in them) and my face looks a million times better. I&#x27;m SO happy I found this amazing product. Highly recommend for anyone with dermatitis or eczema.</li>
            <li> I have skin that is prone to breakouts - both because it is sensitive and because it&#x27;s oily. On top of that, my skin has started getting some dry patches recently, and I needed a moisturizer that would help with wrinkles. What a mess, huh? Well, good thing I found this stuff. Sure, it smells a little funny (kind of like toasted wood?). But it&#x27;s light and it absorbs into the skin immediately. It doesn&#x27;t break me out, helps with dryness, and yet doesn&#x27;t turn my face into an oil slick come noon.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing, quick shipping and beautiful bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I use 1 drop on face at night and it&#x27;s been glowing! Absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to family and friends.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great stuff....my wife and I have tried all different kinds of face moisturizers. Finally, something that shows instant improvement which seemingly gets better. Been using for 30 days and just bought more. It can appear to be oily when you first apply, so you need little and need to rub in well. Use at nite and first thing in the am. Excellent for sensitive skin. Natural, cheap and ez to apply.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time &amp; was well packaged. I immediately loved how it felt on my skin (fabulous...very light, easy spreading, not tacky or thick). Lots of oil in this size bottle too. No scent that will clash with any other scents or clash with anyone&#x27;s sense of smell.  I had been perusing an older book I have, by a very reputable &amp; successful man who makes natural and organic hair &amp; skin products. I was stunned when I saw actual color photos of how rosa mosqueta oil can heal severe scarring. The woman in the photos had severe facial scarring, having been in a serious auto accident. In 4 months the scars were gone &amp; she is once again beautiful. I&#x27;m using this oil on: dark pink/purple scars from scratched mosquito bites, scrape scars, a dog bite, sun damaged areas, brown age/liver spots, spots where the skin has obviously got DNA damage (raised light brown or raised white areas), hypertrophic scars, indented scars, etc. Like the woman, I will use this for 4 weeks minimum; I say &amp;#34;minimum,&amp;#34; because from the first day used on my skin, I saw repairs happening, and I will likely be a fan of this product for life. As a woman prone to skin damage, I want to say - thank you so much for making this product available....</li>
            <li> This is great product. I will purchase again. Highly recomanded.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Say goodbye to dry skin.</li>
            <li> First time ever using Rosehips oil and it is AMAZING!  In less than a week, I can see and feel a difference in my face!  This product will be a part of my face care for eternity.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this oil very much. I have used it for dry skin. It helps relieve some of the discomfort associated with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this oil - it makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is pure rosehip oil.  I&#x27;ve bought a different brand of rosehip seed oil before and was very pleased with those results, but not these.  The oil doesn&#x27;t smell or look like the rosehip seed oil I&#x27;ve bought in the past, nor does it have its great results.  I fell for the price, but won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks and I do believe that my fine lines are less obvious.  This is coming from someone who uses a x10 mirror !  I use it primarily under my eyes, but on super dry days, I have used it all over my face with no problems with my pores or new blemishes.  A little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this oil specifically to others that are looking to have a glow to their skin and feeling rejuvenated. Helps with getting rid of unsightly scars and smells great! Perfect gift for women too!</li>
            <li> Rich, smooth and easily absorbed. Great for mixing a couple of drops in a moisturiser for a healthy glow all day. Packaging doesn&#x27;t travel all that well though - the oil tends to leak out no matter the cover.</li>
            <li> I love the way this oil smells! I use it in my bath and it leaves my skin so soft and smelling amazing. It comes in a glass bottle with a dropper so it&#x27;s really easy to use. I did receive it a discounted price to review</li>
            <li> Rose hip oil comes from the seeds of a specific variety of rose, Rosa aff. rubiginosa or Rosa moschata. A cold-press extraction method separates the oil from the hips and seeds. The delicate oil needs refrigerated or stored in a cool, dark location to prevent rancidity. For facial skin care, rose hip oil offers several benefits when applied externally due to its primary constituents: essential fatty acids, vitamin E, vitamin C and B-carotene, a form of vitamin A.I received the product to test .</li>
            <li> I opened the bottle to find a very strong odor. It had a very fishy scent. The rosehip oil iteself was a very dark amber. I did test it on my hands first, but the product had act sensitively to my face. Not sure if it was due to how the rosehip oil was packaged. I want to give rosehip oil a chance, due to my severe eczema, but this product makes me hesitant to even use it more than once.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY SILKY OIL.  I JUST STARTED TO USE IT YESTERDAY.  I ONLY WISH IT CAME IN LARGER SIZE.  I BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO BE MY REGULAR AFTER I USE UP THE OTHER BOTTLES I HAVE,  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.</li>
            <li> My skins feels great.  I love this oil!</li>
            <li> this is not what I thought it would be but I am trying it maybe ok will see</li>
            <li> im very happy with my radha rosehip oil</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I feel I do notice the elusive &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; after applying it but be warned, less is more. You really only need a few drops on your face. I also mix it in with my daily body lotion. So far I&#x27;ve been using it a few days and I&#x27;ve noticed by poors are also smaller.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is said to help with eczema. I have eczema and tried it on my skin. After only a few applications I think it may be making it not as itchy. I am going to continue using this in hopes to make my skin more flawless.&lt;br /&gt;This review was based on my opinion and how the product worked for me. I am testing this product at a low cost with the understanding that I would provide a review and inspection for people interested in purchasing the product. I don&#x27;t receive any type of compensation for my reviews, the review is provided to you to help deciding to purchase the product. They are all based on my or my families experience with the product. I hope my review is helpful to you.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase of this oil.  I have Eczema on my neck and parts of my face and this has helped keep my skin moisturized without feeling too greasy!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Even though I have a very dry, allergic and sensitive skin, I am absolutely happy with this purchase. My skin feels a relief after I put a tiny amount of this oil. So soft, silky and great feeling I can get just after three days of using it. After a week I just had thoughts how I could live without this oil before!!! Absolutely amazing product! Thank you Radha!</li>
            <li> Smells somewhat neutral with a hint of rose. Absorbs and blends with skin&#x27;s natural oils. Leaves me with soft, supple, moisturizer skin. Best to use after a shower. Pat dry face with a damp wash cloth and immediately apply</li>
            <li> In only a few days, I saw improvement in scars.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Great as a moisturizer and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Comes in a very pretty blue bottle. The eye dropper makes it easy to use. It has a light scent. Goes on easliy and is not greasy. I like how well and how fast it worked. I would purchase it again!!</li>
            <li> Have used Radha Rosehip oil for seven days and it has improved my facial ph balance and has lighten some of my pigmentation from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;A welcome addition to my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was surprised by how large the bottle was, I was expecting a much smaller size bottle.  Thank you!  I&#x27;ve been using the oil for about a week now and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve seen a difference in the reduction of lines, especially around my eyes.  My skin looks brighter and feels very soft.  I use it at night  after I remove my makeup and my face is still wet, then combine it with my regular moisturizer.  They work very well together.  I will definitely reorder again!  I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference it makes after regular use, a month, 2 months, 6 months!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid a lot of money for department store expensive serums only to be disappointed that I paid so much for something that did so little.  I recently tried some of the Rosehip oil at a friends house and my skin was immediately more comfortable.  I have extremely dry skin and so this superbly emollient oil felt like my skin drank it up.  It absorbed reasonably quickly and I have that dewy skin I&#x27;ve been paying 100 plus on serums for and not obtaining.  I&#x27;m never shelling out that sort of money again when this product is truly superior, minus the chemical garbage, and does wonders for my skin.  My only complaint was the packaging, someone had not sealed the inner box and the product was hanging out lose of its original box in a larger box with a small piece of bubble wrap attached to nothing.  It is a true wonder it didn&#x27;t break because its glass and very poorly packaged.  There is a balance between over doing the packaging and having enough to insure it doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I wish it was a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Nice oil.  Glad I got the big bottle.</li>
            <li> Super good mixed with coconut oil on face</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I noticed an improvement over night!  Arrived very quickly, too.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It has not broken me out. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy in the morning either. I&#x27;m also using after my derma roller. Works great!</li>
            <li> I hated this oil. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s salad oil. This wasn&#x27;t real rose hip.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! Received my order extremely fast, and I can not rave enough about how fabulous This product is!</li>
            <li> Shipment was exceptionally timely, and follow up was fantastic.  Product is of good quality.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Great product! I used to use almond oil but have been intrigued by the benefits of Rosehip Oil. I use this on my face, body and hands. I have noticed improvement with retaining moisture. This is also a good value, the bottle is HUGE. I think it will last me about 6 months.</li>
            <li> No nasty rancid smell, clean and moisturizing without irritating my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil! It smells fantastic and my skin looks and feels wonderful without being overly oily. The Radha customer service department was excellent to work with and answered all my questions about the product.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Rosehip oil that I have use so far. It arrive in a timely manner and well protected. The cap was sealed so there was no leakage. Since I have sensitive skin, I decided to test it on my hands avery night and it left my skin looking amazing and healthy. Now I use it in combination with my moisturizer or by itself. It is truly amazing. It absorbs in the skin really well without looking extremely greasy and without clogging my pores. It has help me fade my acne scars and even out my skin. I am also happy to know that it does not have a strong smell. I had previous started using another brand of Rosehip oil and it had a horrible scent which disappointed me. So I am beyond happy that this oil does not. Application is really easy and not time consuming. I will by posting updates to see if there are any changes.</li>
            <li> The quality of this essential oil is really good!! Is a must have for everyday skin care. I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> This product comes in a pretty blue 4 oz glass bottle sealed with a lid and comes with a glass dropper that can be used for the oil. The oil is light yellow color and doesn’t really have a smell. The rosehip oil goes on the skin smoothly and doesn’t leave my skin greasy after. My skin must be very dry because my skin soaks up the oil and doesn’t leave a residue like some reviews state. This product states its 100% pure organic rosehip seed oil with no fillers. Rosehip oil is good for replenishing and revitalizing your skin and reduces the look of fine lines. Also used for wrinkles, scars, stretch marks, rashes, burns, acne scars, dry skin, dermatitis, age spots, brittle nails, psoriasis, eczema, hyper-pigmentation, radiation and sun damage, dry &amp; damaged hair, anti-inflammatory. The company sends you a free guide to your e mail after purchase, they also offer a money back guarantee if your not happy with their product with is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; below. Thank you. :)&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li> really great product. Arrived even earlier than the estimated delivery date</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as a moisturizer and it is amazing! I have normal skin but have always struggled with a few small dry patches around my nose and brow area. The first day I used this product, I was amazed! I went the whole day without having to apply any extra moisturizer to my problem areas. I&#x27;ve been using this oil daily and highly doubt I&#x27;ll ever go without it again! The only thing that could&#x27;ve made this purchase better would have been to include the dropper as pictured. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It feels so luxurious! It does everything it says it does!!! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about my experience. It comes in a nice dark glass bottle, has a dropper packaged separately, and it shipped very quickly. Very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> After being under a lot of stress, my face broke out in red, itchy, scaly bumps.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is psoriasis or eczema.  I used this product twice a day for only a week and it has taken out almost all of the redness and cleared my skin.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  I don&#x27;t use regular moisturizer anymore, and the best part is being able to apply makeup over the oil!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an oil, so it is a bit greasy. I don;t see any difference than most other non-cooking oils.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast delivery. My skin is so soft after just a few applications. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Came fast. 2nd time I ordered</li>
            <li> love it! hydrates my skin better than coconut oil, and doesn&#x27;t leave me looking greasy. I use this in the AM after washing my face and the oil absorbs within minutes, then I dab on a bb or cc cream (with SPF) and am left with a dewy glow. There is a reason Miranda Kerr swears by Rosehip oil!</li>
            <li> for my dry skin,it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I live in NM where there is sun all the time my shin is dry and cracked all year long. I had developed a skin rash and red itchy hives in spots. This product is working for me the cracks and dry spots have disappeared and it has relived my sun bumps.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this product, definitely will order again. 😍</li>
            <li> I love this oil, I am very cautious on what I put on my face, I dislike products that are very grease and leave my face the same way, but I fell in love with this oil as soon as I tried it, it leaves my skin very soft and supple, and it&#x27;s absorbed by my skin after I put in on, so that makes me very happy that it does not stay in the surface forever, I recommend this product 100%, love it an thank you for providing such great products at great prices, I can not afford expensive beauty products, but those expensive products don&#x27;t always work, you jut pay for the name brand, so I am thrilled about your excellent beauty products, thank you so much for your quality and affordability</li>
            <li> I received this 5 days ago and already I see a remarkable difference in my skin. When I received the product free to review it my only expectation was that it would do nothing and just end up being another skin care product sitting on my counter collecting dust. I used a few drops night and in the morning on my face, on my stomach for stretch marks from my pregnancies and a couple scars. Within the first two days my other half said my skin looked like it was glowing, so I took a look in the mirror and noticed he was right, my skin was already starting to look healthier and more vibrant. I have continued to use it and with each passing day my facial skin looks so much better, it has a healthy glow, my complexion is more even toned and it feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference, if any yet around my stretch marks or scars, but I have noticed that the skin around the area looks healthier, is better moisturized and softer than it was 5 days ago. I&#x27;m sure if I keep using it that it will make some sort of a difference on these areas, how dramatically I am not sure, though from what I have witnessed with my own skin in just 5 days I do believe the product will make a noticeable difference on these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the product, as I have pretty much falling in love with it and already feel as if it is one of those personal care products I just cannot live without.</li>
            <li> I moved to this (less expensive) brand after having used Sukin&#x27;s rosehip oil for around a year. Considering both are supposed to be 100% pure cold-pressed, I assumed they would be essentially the same. The Radha rosehip oil, however, hasn&#x27;t performed as well as the Sukin. Where the Sukin immediately absorbed into my skin leaving it glowing and moisturized, the Radha sits on top of my skin leaving it oily and glossy. My skin with Sukin&#x27;s was crazy soft, with the Radha I&#x27;ve still got many dry patches. The Radha is still infinitely better than any other non-rosehip lotion I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m suspicious that the effects are so much different than a competing 100% pure cold-pressed rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Such a great base for essential oils on your face...or alone.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Using it makes me feel like I&#x27;m helping myself to be the healthiest I can!&amp;#34; So far so good using it on my face under my moisturizer mornings and evenings.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. With regular use, I can see a difference. The results are better than the more expensive face creams on the market and I like that it is pure and natural.</li>
            <li> Great product. I only wish it was a pump rather then a dropper top.  Great price as well in comparison to other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> After using the Rosehip Oil for 3 weeks, my face fells smooth and soft. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since February and have noticed a considerable improvement in my skin. My overall complexion has begun to even out as my skin texture has improved. It&#x27;s moisturizing without being too heavy and layers well on top of serums,sunscreens, etc. This oil has become a mainstay in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Bottle came not as pictured, hesitant about authenticity of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m updating my review. I liked the product at fist, but the oil in my third and forth bottle came completely different than the fist two. This time the oil come tinted ORANGE . Very, very orange! I simply cannot use the product without looking like an orange cone. I tried using it only at night but I tinted my pillow case. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and gentle fragrance ( very slight) ... It is a wonderful carrier oil for EOs and also to help with skin issues ... Yes I got a coupon for a free product for review but opinion is my own ...</li>
            <li> This oil has changed my skin completely. I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me begin this with two disclaimers. 1) When people ask if oil might be good to add to their skin care routine, I always ask if they would be willing to put olive oil on their face. Its oil. For real oil. If you don&#x27;t like the feel or texture of oil, this product isn&#x27;t for you. If you have used oil in your skin care routine before and are looking for something new, I completely recommend this! 2) This is part of a pretty extensive skin care routine that includes 3 different cleansers, two face masks, and various other products that I rotate in and out depending on my mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I use this oil every day, twice a day. I use it after a cleanser and toner, both in the morning and at night. I use less in the morning, because I end up putting makeup over it for the day. Even though it is oil, I have noticed that I get less shiny throughout the day, my skin is smoother, and my makeup looks better for longer. I don&#x27;t wear a primer, I haven&#x27;t found one I like yet, so I am happy to find that my makeup isn&#x27;t melting off during the day. 10/10 would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, just buying more so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week to get rid old stretch marks and prevent new ones from forming while I&#x27;m losing weight. The jury is still out on this because it&#x27;s going to take some time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using it on my sensitive face. I usually can&#x27;t use anything like this on this area due to break outs, but so far, after mixing it with a bit of my moisturizer, I&#x27;ve seen much brighter skin after only a few uses. I&#x27;m very impressed so far.</li>
            <li> whenever I have a few extra bucks I check out amazons beauty products normally I get good deals on good products but this one is the motherload of great deals I cant believe how quickly it started smoothing my wrinkles and did not cause a rosacea flare up I add a few drops of hylauranic acid and mix them and put it on at night and there is a difference the price is fantastic im in my 60s and ive spent a lot on skincare from lancome to shiseido and this works as good if not better</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Bottle and dropper are key to adding ingredients to other oils/essiental oils.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it  i dry skin it moisturizes helps with fine lines. And lighting up discoloration</li>
            <li> Unscented but works great.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be a bit drying on my face.  I would imagine that would be to the high vitamin C content.  Vitamin C assists in the repair of skin having an oily skin would likely not be a problem with drying.</li>
            <li> BEST rose hip oil ever! It is super fresh, lightweight, and scent-less. It has been working so well for my eczema as well as just giving my skin a nice glow. This companies Rose hip oil is cold pressed and comes from a small batch. I will always buy my rose hip oil from them! Great quality and a LITTLE bit goes a long way. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The oil comes in a fantastic thick glass bottle with a glass stopper. The product goes on smoothly and is very easy to apply. In just a few days I can see a slight improvement in wrinkles around my eyes. I will probably start using it on my entire face once my current face cream is gone. It seems a little oily to use under make-up with a mineral powder foundation, but since I purchased it to use around my eyes at night it has met all expectations.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! I have only been using it for a few days but I already see a difference in my complexion. I&#x27;ve been using rose water and this this oil kicks up the results an extra notch. Will definitely purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and really dry skin on my feet and hands. I’ve been using this at night before I go to bed and I love it! It absorbs quickly and I put on some Vaseline to lock in the oil. It leaves my skin so soft and moisturized, which really helps my eczema. This company, Radha, is always a trusted source. I’ve gotten several oils from them and they are always perfectly packaged and as described. Organic and cold-pressed are major pluses.&lt;br /&gt;*Honest review for discounted product*</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s coming to a week since I began using it. This far I&#x27;m pleased but I want to wait another week before I determine if this is for me. It is helping a severe dry patch on my face.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old woman with fair skin, fine lines, and crows feet. I started using this product about a week ago and love it! I got carded last night for the first time in a very long time...thank you miracle rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product I have ever tried.  Improves skin moisture, softens my hands and strengthens my nails.&lt;br /&gt;My sister tried it and fell in love as well.  What a find!!!</li>
            <li> Really unsure about the contents of bottle.  The product itself seems very light in color with a vegetable oil smell.  Does not have the appearance of pure Rosehip oil or smell.  I have 3 bottles to compare and this bottle is completely different from the Trilogy brand I received.  All further research regarding Rosehip oil points to this product being from something other than the rosehip seed.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so!  Its a great deal.  There lies the rub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rosehip oil for years to help maintain my skin and am absolutely loving this brand. Radha&#x27;s is scent free and 100% rosehip oil so no artificial ingredients or chemicals are added that could irritate or age my skin more.  I use it twice a day, more during the winter because my skin needs more moisturizing during the colder months. It really gives a nice glow to my skin and works great for fading stretch marks and scars. With all the benefits of rosehip I was able to retire many of my  chemical ridden store bought lotions and creams and replaced it with this one all natural product.the bottle is a very nice looking dark blue glass and its easily applied with the dropper that comes with it. Rosehip absorbs very quickly and won&#x27;t leave an oily feeling behind, just very soft pretty skin. I love it and highly recommend trying it if you haven&#x27;t done so already. I received my first bottle from Radha free as a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience after using their product.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful. It is light and non-greasy and absorbs quickly. My skin feels wonderful since I started using it. I have very sensitive, acne prone skin, and this oil has soothed my skin and calmed my flare ups. My skin feels baby soft. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love it when a company under promises and over delivers.  Not only was the rosehip oil of top quality, It also came with a free book on the benefits of rosehip oil and how to use it.  I love using it on my face as it helps even my skin tone and smooth over old acne scars from my teen years.  Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised.  Feels very light.  Have only been using a couple days, but I think I see a difference in my skin already.  Much nicer than a heavy cream.</li>
            <li> I really am pleased with this oil. Feels so silky and yet not greasy because it soaks in so nicely. Love mixing with essential oils!</li>
            <li> IT IS AMAZING, I AM 100 YEARS OLD AND AFTER ALMOST ONE WEEK OF USING IT I LOOK 20 YEARS OLD.&lt;br /&gt;ACTUALLY I JUST STARTED IT SO IT WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE I FIND THE RESULTS ABOUT THE ROSE HIP SERUM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NAOMI ANGELOS</li>
            <li> This is not Rosehip Seed oil. I am an herbalist and know that this should be a light amber to reddish color and have a distinct aroma. This oil is clear as vegetable oil and is scentless. My first order from Radha seemed legit. This second bottle definitely is not.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It was late arriving due to a hang up with one of the carriers but only a day late. This oil makes my skin feel so soft and there is absolutely no smell to it at all. I do believe it has started to tone the redness of my skin down but I have only used for a week so may take some time. I have very sensitive skin and everything makes it red. I am only giving this 4 stars as it is too early to tell if this is truly going to work for me or not. So far, so good though.</li>
            <li> Not sure about Grade and Quality it is very thin in texture and almost colorless and scent free.. Not usual characteristics of pure rose hip oil,  I will give it a try but I may return it and reorder my last rose hip oil purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> i relly like ths product ,,,i used ths for my face ,hair and my skin and its work great ...</li>
            <li> First time trying Rosehip oil and I&#x27;m addicted to it. The Radha rosehip oil feels so nice and delicate on my face and leaves my skin glowing. I also have issues with eczema and using this oil has really helped improve my skin. Will definitely be a lifetime user of this product. Plus a little really goes a long way so you&#x27;re more than getting a lot of bang for your Buck!!!</li>
            <li> Product just arrived so I can&#x27;t say how it will work on skin/wrinkles etc.  Almost odorless and it absorbs quickly into the skin. Not greasy at all. Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my face and other dry spots.</li>
            <li> Radha Rosehip seed Oil is pure and healing. It sinks in nicely and has gotten rid of my dry skin very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. Our entire family uses it and loves it.  I am not sure it is exactly miracle, but it has cleared up my difficult adult acne and it does make your skin feel incredible and glowing, without an oily feel.  The key is to put a few drops on your fingertips and then smooth on face while still damp from washing.  It really is great, and so completely worth the astonishingly reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Super hydrating!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Will buy again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery on my elbow (july 9th 2015) and i LOVE this already. My scar is healing great and the pain isn&#x27;t as bad. You shouldn&#x27;t apply if you have an open wound. It came with the eye dropper as well. It&#x27;s not sticky or gooey. I prefered to use it to help with a 10cm scar across my elbow but there are many uses. You can find them in their product description or just google it. Shipped same day and was delivered within 2 days of ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely order from again. **This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> This oil is well packaged and surprisingly big. I expected a small, 1 oz bottle and it&#x27;s actually 4. It has no smell, which is nice. I use it before moisturizer and makeup. I&#x27;ve noticed my dark acne scars fading. I love this stuff! I did receive it for free through AMZ review trader.</li>
            <li> This is a great value.  A full 4 oz. bottle and you only use 3-4 drops a time, and it will probably last all year.  This oil is a gift from above.  Although there are many benefits to using this organic oil, I suffer from very very dry skin, it is always itchy and uncomfortable, and I also suffer from acne and the products I use to fight the acne add to the dryness and discomfort.  Sometimes I want to scratch my face off!!! Well that&#x27;s not a good idea cause it just makes it more irritated and look worse.  A few drops of this after I have cleaned and dried my face and my skin feels renewed!  The increased levels of comfort I feel on my skin is amazing, no more scratching, no more redness, it is great.  It goes on smooth and I feel instant as well as long range comfort.  You need to try this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for almost 4 months  after scrubs for my stretch marks.I have noticed a difference in my skin. My skin is more even tone and moisturize.It has a different smell but its not overwhelming. Oh and not of roses.</li>
            <li> I just started using my rose hip oil. I am using it on my face. I&#x27;m not sure yet if it is helping. I think I should give it 30 days to see results.</li>
            <li> very good product we use on everything.</li>
            <li> I love how this feels on my skin. It&#x27;s not too heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product.  I was only using it on my face...now I put it all over after my shower!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Rosehip oil because I had read that it&#x27;s good for removing spots. I&#x27;m already using vitamin C serum with hyluronic acid which also good for removing spots and a host of other things. Well the vitamin C was doing a great job, then I added the Rosehips, well I tell you what happened to my skin is actually unbelievable. I had a scar on the side of my face from a pimple that left an ugly scar. The scar was about half gone, I added the Rosehips and the scar is just about invisible. I really Love this product, and would reorder it again.  Thanks Radha Beauty.</li>
            <li> Been using on my face for about a month... use it mixed with a jojoba oil at night and just the Rosehip oil in the mornings after I wash my face. Really amazing for moisture and soft skin. Acne cleared up a little, too :)</li>
            <li> A must for my homemade facial serum, this oil is best used after a shower. Your skin will feel so soft as it sinks in quite well, even when used alone! I have some sun damaged areas on my face, so I add this to my retinol at night and my skin has never looked better. I am 56, and am slowly turning back the hands of time. I am anxious to try some of their other oils, too, as you can&#x27;t beat the quality and value of their 4 ounce bottle! I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  It&#x27;s super moisturizing but not oily at all.</li>

            <li> love love love  this rosehip oil.... although it is an oil.. goes on like silk and absorbs right into skin... leaves skin radiant... beautiful great great great.. .......</li>
            <li> I have been using rose hip oil for several years on my face and neck.  Why pay for high priced skin creams that have the same active ingredients as natural rose hip oil?  I had been buying another brand that was a lot more expensive.  The Radha brand is every bit as good and much more economical.  This is a big bottle and the dropper makes it easy to use.  I will definitely buy my rose hip oil from Radha again!</li>
            <li> All good.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered as promised</li>
            <li> my wife love this she use it after showering on her face and elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;(got a good discount on this item)</li>
            <li> I have Roscacea and most skin care products cause my face to break out in a rash.  This oil has smoothed lines, brightened my skin, taken away the redness, made me break out less than the prescription Roscacea medicine, and made my skin super soft.  I also put it on my hands that have always looked old.  They look better than they have in years.  It also helps with hard scratchy elbows and heels.  I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
            <li> So far I am in love with this product ... In a matter of 3 days my sons eczema is 80% better after battling with it for over a year! I just hope it continues to soothe and heal his skin. Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my stretch marks and scar.</li>
            <li> hm.  The product I received does not match anything I’ve seen or had described to me from other professionals in the line of Essential Oils. NOR does it match how Radha says they describe the oil.  There is no color or scent. There was little to no benefit in using the few drops that I did use.  I’m not convinced that this is pure Rosehip oil. I’ve read some of the responses from Radha on what to look for and how they describe this oil.  My product does not in any way match those descriptions. Very disappointed.  When I took my concerns outside of amazon to a group that tests and analyzes EOs, they had many concerns over this company and their responses they are giving to customers regarding this particular EO. (I did not reference or question any other EO Radha is selling.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that this isn’t always a reflection on the company itself as I’ve seen other Essential Oil companies find they have a bad batch of something and not realize it.  I’d maybe recommend having your oils tested from an outside, non-company affiliated source, and post those results if this is 100% or remove this batch if it is not.  This can be corrected and handled well, but until I see a report proving authenticity, I’m very cautious in continuing use as I need to be very concerned with what I put on my body due to wide variety of reactions from things.</li>
            <li> Have been using this on my face for a couple of months now. Love it. Makes my skin glow. Started putting it on my husband&#x27;s face at night as well. Highly recommend.  Seller did a great job with shipping.  Nice larger size,  will last a while and will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Love the Rose hip oil . It was shipped on time. Excellent service and value !! Thank you !</li>
            <li> feels wonderful...absorbs quickly...and good price</li>
            <li> I was sent a 4 oz. bottle of Radha Rosehip Oil to try and review.  Overall, I am impressed with the product.  It is a dry oil which moisturizes well, and thankfully for me, there is no added fragrance to which I might normally be sensitive towards.  Just a few drops goes a long way and the bottle comes with a glass dropper to ensure a proper portion is administered.  I have been testing the oil on the delicate skin on my wrist below the palm of my hand to see how I will react before giving it a try on my face.  So far so good!  I plan on using the product on my face at night as other reviews have suggested to see if it helps to soften the wrinkles a bit.  For now, I am impressed with how incredibly soft it leaves my skin without the usual side effects that I typically have with any kind of scented product.  Also, having done comparable reviews on similar products, I see that Radha Rosehip Oil is competitively priced, so it is a good value.  I&#x27;m adding this to my Amazon Wish List so that when I run out, I will know exactly what I will buy.  Thank you, Radha, for sending me this wonderful product to review.  You&#x27;ve gained a customer for sure and I cannot wait to explore more of your products!</li>
            <li> Good product. The dropper did brake in shipping.</li>
            <li> I gotta say I absolutely adore this oil!  I have been dying for a rosehip oil that was organic and luxurious and THIS is it.  Without a doubt.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a cold-pressed, organic oil to try with NO added fragrance! I am very sensitive to fragrance! So far, I have used it on my nails and face and it instantly absorbs and leaves my skin very hydrated and plump. I look forward to also using this to deep condition my hair! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> This oil is great. I recently used it for a facial serum for myself and a class I taught. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is great, it soaks into the skin quickly and is not super oily afterwards, it also does not have a horrible smell. I was great suing it straight out of the bottle. The blue tinted bottle is also very nice because I can leave it sitting on the counter and it doesn&#x27;t look like a standard bottle. I really love this product. Although I recieved this product at a dicounted rate, it did not affect my opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  I use it straight out of the bottle to moisturize my hands.  Works great!  I even use it to make my own body butters.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this in your eyes - it is very irritating. I love it, use it every night before bed, on my entire body not just my face. I tried to use it to remove my eye make-up - that was a bad idea.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...the shipment was superfast and the rosehip seed oil isn&#x27;t greasy and is wonderful.  I can&#x27;t say enough about contact with the seller in sharing information on the many wonderful uses for the essential oils she carries.  I&#x27;ll be checking here first, before purchasing essential oils elsewhere...You can&#x27;t go wrong with purchasing these high quality products from Radha Beauty!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good  about the organic Rosehip Oil.  Could feel and see a difference right away.  Awesome product, glad I found it and will continue to use it always.</li>
            <li> amazing product, definitely gonna buy again, it makes your skin look more hydratated and smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write more on this later, awesome product for skin and deserves more details in this review</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It is equal to other natural rosehip oils that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was so excited once I received the package. I opened it up and immediately liked the smell. I put it on my body and everyone loves the glow on me.</li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic! I have only been using it for a week and love the way my skin feels. It also seems to brighten my complexion some and hides some imperfections. Very Moisturizing for the skin without creating any irritations or acne issues. Looking forward to seeing what this does for my skin over the long term. So far though, I highly recommend this product! Also, the customer service is great!</li>
            <li> Best value.. Great seller.</li>
            <li> This oil was rancid smelled old . I have purchased many bottles of rosehip oil and never have I smelled a more rancid old smell.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is amazing! I used it on my face, on scars and on old stretch marks from puberty. I didn&#x27;t think it would do anything to the scars or stretch marks. It did! They are almost invisible. I&#x27;m very fair complected. They are no longer pink, but pale like the rest of me. It has brightened my face and gotten rid of fine lines forming under my eyes, around my eyes, and on my brow. it seems to have made the hollows under my eyes seem less hollow. I&#x27;ve protected my skin from sun for years, but had excessive freckling on my hands. It lightened them and moisturized my hands. I have even used it in my hair and it makes a great leave in oil treatment.  A little goes a LONG way, so this is a great value for me. Customer service is wonderful, they helped me with a shipping issue (the carrier&#x27;s fault, not theirs).</li>
            <li> I just got my rosehip oil few days ago, so I feel like it&#x27;s really early to judge,but I like it. The skin is deffinitely more pleasant to touch and it has a nice glow to it. But I&#x27;d never used any oil before purchasing this one so I really shouldn&#x27;t say anything as I know that you gotta judge these things in along run.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the quality of this oil. It&#x27;s pure and very easy to use. My daughter suffers from eczema, and hydro-cortisone has just never really helped much at all. She has frequent flares in the summer, and was experiencing one the day the package arrived. I applied the oil to the outbreak at about 3PM and by the time she was to take her shower before bed, I could barely see the inflammation. I reapplied the oil after her shower and it was almost completely clear in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has issues with dry skin, eczema, fine lines, stretch marks, scars, or is just generally concerned about aging and drying issues will benefit from this. This bottle, in a household of 4, with frequent use (especially by the youngest), will STILL last 6-9 months. With all the uses and benefits it offers to the whole family, and the length of time it will last, the price tag is well worth the output.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other oils I have used were much thinner (not pure) and far less effective. I could tell just by the fact that there was a glass dropper that this oil was much better than many I have bought in stores in the past. When you have a child with a recurring issue like eczema, you have to stay on top of it. I prefer a natural approach whenever possible, but NOT all natural substances are created equal. I have paid the same price as this oil is listed, received a smaller quantity and a far less effective product. At 4 ounces, this bottle is comparatively HUGE by comparison for the price and the purity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND FAIR REVIEW. I HAVE RECEIVED NO OTHER COMPENSATION FROM THE MANUFACTURER OR DISTRIBUTOR FOR THIS REVIEW*</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge! The dropper is actually very easy to use, and the overall shape of the bottle makes it easy to hold as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually use rosehip oil, but I received the product in return for a review. I found that it goes on easier than many other oils, and that I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all. I have noticed that the skin around my eyes feels a little softer since I started using this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts or other issues with this oil</li>
            <li> Packaged great, lasts a while. I love it. I haven&#x27;t bought moisturizer since this! I got this, some rose water and jojoba oil. Love them all!</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be on the dry side and I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural remedy. As soon as I applied the rosehip oil to my cleansed face the tightness and flakiness was relieved. The dropper applicator made it very easy to apply just enough oil to my face. The rosehip oil is gentle enough to use around the eyes and lessened the appearance of lines and &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m going to be 40 this month and lines and wrinkles are a concern but using this product has helped to assure aging gracefully.</li>
            <li> pretty good i will be buying this again and again</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived in a timely manner, helps with my son&#x27;s eczema a whole lot more than just lotion or creams.</li>
            <li> I received this rosehip oil for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. I am usually impressed with Radha&#x27;s various products, but this rosehip oil has me thinking and wondering if it truly is rosehip oil. It is a very pale yellow color, and just barely it is very close to clear. Everything I&#x27;ve read in natural beauty and essential oil books say that that rosehip oil should be a rich amber color. Other brands I have are the amber color as well making me wonder why this one is sooo light. It also has absolutely no scent to it at all. The other brands have an earthy scent to them, and the books say that it should have a strong scent. I&#x27;ve marked it down because of the smell and color. The oil itself hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all and I will use it in some of my beauty products I create, but I&#x27;m not sure that I would purchase it again because I&#x27;m not sure of it being the right oil in the bottle. It is a much larger sized bottle for a lower price than many other brands. The bottle itself is a blue glass and comes with a regular lid. It also comes with a glass dropper lid that you can exchange it for if you prefer droppers for your uses.</li>
            <li> I had heard of rosehip oil and always wanted to try,  I had previously bought the Radha Vitamin C Serum and was very pleased, so I decided to jump in to try the Rosehip Oil in my quest to correct my sun damaged skin ...I received my Radha Rosehip Oil in a beautiful blue glass bottle with a separate dropper from the cap, the packaging was very professional and I love the color of the blue bottle.  I started using the oil about 7 days ago and my skin feels softer and smoother...I have also been using the oil on my dry heels, elbows and cuticles.  If you are looking for a natural moisturizer, I give this oil my highest recommendation!</li>
            <li> Seems fresh, smells great and no leaks. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried several different rose hip oils. Some have been clear and some have been a yellowish orange. This on in particular is a yellowish orange. I love that it comes with a dropper attached to the top and that it has a seal. I have received some from other companies that do not have seals. I am still learning how to use these different oils. But for this one I decided to try it on my damaged toe nails. I damaged my toe nails on accident by removing my jamberrys nails incorrectly. So I have been using this rosehip oil on my left foots nails. And you can tell a major difference. The left side looks almost completely healed where as the right is still destroyed. I am amazed by the results. I can&#x27;t wait to find other uses for this product and to try it out for the other uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; I REVEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Has no smell to it which i liked. I feel it has helped a lot with fine lines and works well as a moisturizer leaving no greasy feeling .</li>
            <li> love this product, it was a bit oilier than i had anticipated but has already in a week helped dry skin patches on my arms and elbows.</li>
            <li> none greasy and makes my skin feel amazing. No smell which is very nice.</li>
            <li> Came fast in the mail and everything that was said - is true. Plus, it is a very big bottle!  Use it nightly on my face in place of any night cream.  Use it on a scar on my neck and scar is fading.</li>
            <li> First of all the smell of this oil is earthy and pure so you know that no fragrance has been added. I have been using it for about a week now and can honestly say that I absolutely love it! This is a true head-to-toe product that has a multitude of uses. So far I have used it a s night time moisturizer for face and body, cuticle oil, a massage for tired feet and have tried a little bit om my hair tips after styling. I am a very satidfied customer and would recommend this wonderful oil to anyone looking to add to or remake their current beauty routine into an organic, clean and green routine! Thanks Radha!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2weeks now on my skin/hair n nails, it feels wonderful!  Absorbs quickly, not oily at all!&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended! Very Pleased with this Product:)</li>
            <li> Bought 2 bottles. Great for acne scars and ashy elbows and knees. No greasy feel and no odor.</li>
            <li> I got this free from a promotion! I am absolutely in love with it! I&#x27;ve putting on my crows feet (eye area), forehead, and the top of my breast that have marks from nursing. I also just tried puting im the shower so when I&#x27;m done washing I put it on!</li>
            <li> Just started using it but so far the product is great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful Products! Radha Beauty products have such great products,&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil feels so nice,</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin I didnt have high expectations of a oil working. But I was wrong. It melts into the skin and leaves its soft. No oily residue at all. Id recommend you run not walk and pick yourself up a bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a pure oil that works beautifully in oil treatments for the hair, restoring moisture and imbibing hair with a healthy shine.  When used as a carrier oil  the addition of Geranium essential oils boosts the properties of the Rosehip Oil.  I found this oil to be very pure, with a fantastic consistency and excellent quality.  The cobalt blue container is attractive and also works to prevent sunlight damaging the oil inside.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!!!! Excellent quality at a very good price. The item arrived on time and was packed very well. The oil has a good aroma and feels great to the skin. I thought the Ebook was a very good extra item. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I definitely recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> Very good product. My skin loves this oil. Thanks very much</li>
            <li> Works beautifully on my über dry skin.  I live in the mountains so there&#x27;s no humidity.&lt;br /&gt;I love how it looks on my skin. I use it both day and night, and I also am putting it on&lt;br /&gt;a scar, so we&#x27;ll see how that works on the fading.  If your skin is dry... this is for you.</li>
            <li> I really liked this oil! I use a Zinc Oxide sunscreen so my skin is a bit flakey around my nose and forehead. I thought this would kick up my moisturizing at night as the last step of my routine. The oil doesn&#x27;t really have a smell and is orange in color. It feels thicker than say, olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pat tested this in my neck, then the edges of my face before placing it on my reactive areas like the t-zone. It spreads very well but is not very absorbent which is good if you are wanting to prevent water loss (preventing water loss is how occulise ingredients like vaseline and oil moisturize).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the dropper they send with the bottle. It is very long which is useful but it is loose so oil pours out of it. This isn&#x27;t a huge deal as I can still get out oil in a somewhat controlled manner but a functional dropper would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: If you are using an active like retinol or an acne fighting ingredient (SA, Azelic Acid) wait at least 15 minutes before using this as it&#x27;ll dilute the active.</li>
            <li> As always, Rhada Beauty Products delivers with this awesome rosehip oil. Works great and is my go to when I need to reorder.</li>
            <li> Product for review: love this product and how it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> Cheap eye dropper. Constantly have to wipe off the outside of the bottle and where the bottle sits.  Buy this for the product but transfer it to a better container.</li>
            <li> Never saw any real benefit from the use of this, sorry to say/  But I did receive the product in a very short period of time.</li>
            <li> It helped to heal a facial skin &amp;#34;eruption&amp;#34; over night. Tried it again on another spot - same results. Decided to use it under moisturizer every night. Had some left on my hands and slicked it over my hair, which got noticeably shiny w/no greasy side effects. This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> Really nice oil.  I&#x27;m picky about what I&#x27;ll put on my face and this is very nice and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin react.  Plus, the packaging is beautiful!</li>
            <li> I got this to try a few days after my friend was telling me she discovered it and her skin was glowing within 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it and it came fast. I have Amazon prime, so I suppose it was 2 days. I was happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every morning and night.  I haven&#x27;t been clear on whether to use it with my normal face cream or without so I did the first 3 days without. After asking my friend if she uses her other creams too, I added those back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit I&#x27;m excited to use it every day because I believe it&#x27;s something really helpful and healing for the skin. My skin is prone to blackouts on my nose and break outs other places occasionally. I have noticed no breakouts and I have extremely sensitive skin. When I wake up in the morning my skin looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been about 4 days so far, so I can&#x27;t report any miracles yet, but I will report back.  Oh and it smells nice. Not fruity or perfumy, but natural.</li>
            <li> This was such an awesome product. I don&#x27;t know which one I loved more.  Radha argan oil or this rosehip oil. So nourishing!</li>
            <li> Excellent. I have been  using for approx 3 weeks I love how my face  is soft and smooth. Wrinkles  on forehead  are not as deep. I will  continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> this is a MUST have for anyone with a dry skin type!  I prefer to use this before bed.  After exfoliation of your skin, this oil deeply penetrates leaves you feeling soft and supple hours after you wake up in the morning.  However, the true test will be during the winter months ahead.  I will make an update then.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It feels so good on your skin. Very moisturizing. Comes in a huge bottle. Most products are in tiny bottles. Will definetly buy more products from this company!</li>
            <li> I just started using it but have been happy with the results so far!  I put it on at night after I wash my face and it moisturizes beautifully without feeling greasy.  It seems a few fine lines around the eyes have disappeared but I don&#x27;t know if that is just wishful thinking:&amp;#34; Overall, I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this enough to notice a dramatic difference. However, I can attest that this oil is light, absorbs quickly and does not leave the skin greasy. It is very moisturizing and can be used on the face and neck without causing breakouts. I have added this to my DIY facial scrub and it is great!   The product was shipped quickly and well packaged.   This is very similar to Argan oil; I am looking forward to trying the other oils from this company. (Yay review #100!!!)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. ITS AMAZING MY SKIN LOOKS HEALTHY RADIANT AND SCARS ARE GOING AWAY.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Greetings all. After reading the reviews I had very high hopes. Boy oh boy were my expectations surpassed to say the least. The oil is smooth, has a soft scent and blends well. Just a few dab&#x27;s last all day. Recommended to my friends, for daily use and I plan to continue to buy. Thanks</li>
            <li> So far is good.I love it.</li>
            <li> Really quick shipping! So far, I love the rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It works wonders for all types of skin problems along with making my skin look radiant and almost flawless without make-up. This is a must have product.</li>
            <li> After hearing how rosehip oil can aid in eczema relief I tried Radha&#x27;s Organic Rosehip Oil. I&#x27;ve been using it since October and my skin is so much healthier both in appearance and to the touch. My eczema hasn&#x27;t been an issue since I started using Rosehip oil daily. ...and Fall &amp; Winter are when it&#x27;s typically the worst! This is a great product I would highly recommend it! It makes a fabulous addition to your bath water as well! I basically use it head to toe! I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product and this company! I absolutely love my Radha Beauty Products. This particular bottle of oil was a gift from the company but I am a loyal user of all of the Radha beauty line, and I do purchase as well as will continue to purchase this great line for years to come!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing-Like liquid gold- I have combination skin(oily some spots dry in others) &amp; I have  sun damage on my face &amp; of course those stretch marks on tummy and hips- So since receiving my products(the amount is outrageous 4oz for the cost)I use about a dime size on face and a little more for body-I apply in morning and night-been following this regiment for a month now-What ive noticed is that my skin is healthier &amp; glowing-My pores have reduced in size,sun damage has been reduced by 50%, no breakouts either!My stretch marks(they&#x27;re more than 5 yrs old,so i didnt expect much) but im noticing them smoothing out and becoming less noticable- So ill keep it up and hopefully they&#x27;ll fade away completely- Thank you so much Radha Beauty for introducing me to your products- I look forward to more great thingsfromyou</li>
            <li> I need a bit more time it&#x27;s only been a few days but so far it seems great!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! My skin have never felt or looked this good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rosehip oil for a few weeks now and can tell the difference in my skin.  I used it full strength at first but the smell is a little overwhelming (very smoky.)  Now I use it at night mixed with a little vitamin E crème.  My face is softer.  I also use it occasionally on dry cracked heels at night, then wear an old pair of socks to bed.  In the morning my heels are much softer.  I hope over time it will help reverse some sun exposure and acne scarring on my face and neck.  I&#x27;ve read that you need to rub it in thoroughly and be faithful to use it every day.  We&#x27;ll see.  It probably takes months, so will update later.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product.  I don&#x27;t write reviews very often, but this product is everything it says it is and more.  My skin just soaks it up, no greasy residue, and my moisturizer and make up go on beautifully over it.  I use it on my face twice a day, and was able to tell a difference in just a few days.  I have hypothyroidism, which causes extremely dry skin, and this is the first product I have found that gives me smooth, baby soft skin.  I have recommended it to all my friends, and I could not be any more pleased.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this oil. I have been using it morning and night to moisturize my face. Pretty amazing. Stay tuned!! - I am enjoying this. I use at night before bed.</li>
            <li> WOW.. GREAT PRODUCT..ONLY AFTER A FEW DAYS OF USE, I SEE THE FINE LINES AROUND MY EYE LESSENING..I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT HIGHLY..I AM 73 YEARS OLD AND AM ANTICIPATING TAKING AT LEAST 5 YEARS OFF MY FACIAL LINES...HEY, EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS..</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the smell and it works like a charm. I use it on my forehead and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely lovely 😊</li>
            <li> This is a great oil! It soothes my winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rosehip Oil from other companies and find this to be my FAVORITE!</li>
            <li> I like the product.  Did not realize (my fault) that it was a rosehip OIL,  Would rather not have an oil but the product will be used anyway and I like it.  It is too soon to say what it will do for me since I only started to use it.  Hopefully, it is all Radha said it was.</li>
            <li> I just received my Radha Rosehip Organic Oil earlier this week and my skin LOVES it; it just soaks it right up. I have used it on my face (no oily residue), my hands and my feet. A little goes a long way! I will be a continuing customer of Radha products!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few days and am loving what I&#x27;m seeing!  I&#x27;ve only used it on my hands and arms so far.  I have even used it on a fresh tattoo!  The oil absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  The scent is very natural and doesn&#x27;t clash with my cologne.  I love that the bottle comes with a dropper--a little goes a VERY long way! I&#x27;ve been reading the reviews and will now try the oil on my finicky, combination, blackhead-prone facial skin.  Thank you, Radha, for the opportunity to try such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an Organic Rosehip Oil to help keep my skin from becoming dry and am so glad I found this. Well worth the price, a little goes a long way!  The 4oz bottle will last a long time.  Definitely will repurchase!</li>
            <li> The oil came very fast. I am using it as a night moisturizer. It seems to work really well as long as you only use a tiny amount; the lines around my mouth are less noticeable then they were before.</li>
            <li> Radha Rosehip Oil is so good for my skin. I use it at night and my skin looks fresh and plump in the a.m. and I use less of my day-moisturizer! Initially I was not a fan of the smell but I&#x27;ve heard great things about Rosehip Oil after day 3 I was so glad I used it. I am used to the smell it goes away after awhile. This Rosehip Oil is of finest quality and nourishes my skin like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried(and it&#x27;s so good for you!)</li>
            <li> Like that it is organic and it absorbs well--very good value</li>
            <li> BEWARE - Many people are complaining about the smell. Rosehip oil is not supposed to smell bad. This product is RANCID! I don&#x27;t know if any one of these people commenting have gotten a truly FRESH bottle of Rosehip oil. I am a massage therapist and know when oils are bad.  Unfortunately they go bad quickly.  So I guess it&#x27;s hit or miss with this one.  There&#x27;s no sell-by date on the bottle. Low quality.  Who knows what type of restrictions for organics (or ingredients) they have in Chile also.  Would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have super dry skin and this has really helped.</li>
            <li> I love their organic Rosehip Oil. It&#x27;s heavier than I expected which is a great thing! I have extremely dry (ok mature) skin and when you mix this with a little water your skin feels heavenly smooth! You can&#x27;t beat this great product and the price. I will reorder from them again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the dryness of cold winter days.  I use it on my face daily.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I wanted to give it a few weeks before I commented, but I love this stuff. I&#x27;m getting constant compliments on my skin, and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my fine lines around my eyes and the lines on my forehead. I mix it in with my moisturizer after I wash my face twice a day. It&#x27;s lovely and light and not greasy. Perfect under make up.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love! Love ! Love ! this product. I love the way it feels on my skin. I use it everywhere!</li>
            <li> Such good oil. I use it at night and my face is fresh, plump and moisturized in the a.m. thus using less of my daytime moisturizer. I love this organic oil. So so good!</li>
            <li> I really do love this stuff. Will order again and again. :)</li>
            <li> Love the rosehip essential oil. Using it daily on my face and love the results.&lt;br /&gt;Also using it in essential oil body butter recipe. :)</li>
            <li> This oil is a life saver. I&#x27;ve been only  using this product for a week and half and I can see a difference on my acne scars. It&#x27;s slowly fading it away. I cannot wait for a month using this product to see the results.</li>
            <li> I take a medication that causes a slight rash on various area of my arms and leg. It appears that this Radha Beauty Rosehip Oil is doing an excellent job of calming this rash down (redness has gone in most areas) and in some areas it looks to be gone.). This is after only one (1) weeks use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will purchase an extra bottle(s) of this Radha Beauty Rosehip Oil. I don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
            <li> I do absolutely love this product. I use it at night and the day. I use it under my makeup and it gives such a beautiful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love</li>
            <li> We are SheaWoman Soapery and we use Radha Organic Rosehip Oil in our Body Butters and Creme&#x27; dela Creme&#x27; Hand &amp; Face Lotions. Only the purest oils are even considered for our products and we just love Radha Rosehip and so do our customers.</li>
            <li> I really love good Rosehip Oil and this is indeed a nice one to have on hand! I like the blue bottles this company uses for their essential oils...they present well and I guess for me, I enjoy looking at them because I like the color! The color does provide benefits to protecting the product from degrading as quickly too. Once again, the company is very good to seal the bottle with a screw on lid and provide the extra long dropper to use with the oil. I always like to keep the lid in case I want to close it back up perhaps for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is 100% Organic. It is light-weight as it drips slightly faster than another Rosehip Oil I&#x27;ve used. That part is not really important as far as I know. This is a good sized bottle at four ounces and comes at a good price! It is produced in Chile and bottled in the USA. I cannot discern a smell to the product, but it is a light golden color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil feels good on my skin. I like the feel of it on my fingers as I am applying it and as it goes on my skin. A bit later after applying, I sometimes think it hasn&#x27;t absorbed. I think this is because when I feel the area, it is so soft, but it has absorbed quite well and does not look or feel greasy. For me this is a really healing oil and it is loaded with nutrients that are so good for a person. If you get the chance to research it a bit, you&#x27;ll find it has some wonderful qualities for helping the body such as being full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids. This is great stuff! I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  I HAVE TRIED ONE PRODUCT AFTER ANOTHER AND LEFT HONEST GOOD REVIEWS.  I TRIED THIS PRODUCT AND WAS SO IMPRESSED.  NOTHING HAS EVER MADE MY SKIN FEEL THIS GOOD.  IT IS THE BEST MOISTURIZER I HAVE EVER USED.  IT SMELLS A BIT AT FIRST, BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T LAST LONG.  I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I bought this after doing some research and reading other people&#x27;s review and I love it! I have eczema on my neck so I need extra 3 drops or so to hydrate the dry area. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week and it&#x27;s working great. The itchiness reduced and redness is finally gone. Due to dry/eczema and oily part of my skin, I have a very difficult time finding a facial cream that works  and this solved my problem. I like it so much that I am planning to get one for my mother, too.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Leaves my skin feeling soft. This is my 2nd order of Radha Rosehip oil. I don&#x27;t break out and even better results when I put a few drops of essential oils!!</li>
            <li> It is incredible. I have only used it on my face for a week and my skin already looks brighter. It is not at all sticky and my skin just seems to soak it all up. I have been only using it at night and my face skin definitely seems softer. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived fast and the company representative even called to check if I had arrived and if I had any questions for them. Great service!! Would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> OMG! This stuff is seriously amazing. I can&#x27;t believe it. Let me just say that I was a total skeptic that it could be a universal elixir but after about three weeks of using this oil on my short curly hair, my childhood scared elbows &amp; knees, and my mosquito bitten legs I am  a true believer that it really just may be the Holy Grail...or something very similar. Seriously, I have had a scar on my right elbow from a gnarly fall when I was a kid that I never even thought of trying to get rid of it. However, after rubbing the left over oil that I put in my hair on my arms I noticed that my elbow seemed to be peeling. Then upon closer look I saw that the scar tissue was actually coming off and revealing a new layer of skin. In using this for my naturally curly hair, which often times gets frizzy as it dries, I have not had any frizz! I really can&#x27;t believe how useful this oil is on everything. And to prove a point, I even used it on my Maltese&#x27;s sunburn and guess what happened? The same thing as my elbow. Seriously, I am speechless but so grateful and a no doubt committed consumer of the Organic Rosehip Seed Oil moving forward. Thank you for creating this product and offering the samples. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Radha Rosehip Oil for a few days now, but I can already see an improvement in the tone and clarity of my skin.  I&#x27;m 30 years old and have very sensitive, fair, combination, and acne-prone skin... in a word, FINICKY!  This oil caused no irritation whatsoever! I am surprised at how plump and dewy my skin already looks, and my acne (especially the hard little bumps under the skin on my chin) and scars have noticeably diminished.  I started off using it morning and night, but unfortunately I find the smell very unpleasant.  During the daytime, I found myself thinking &amp;#34;what is that musty, fishy smell?&amp;#34; only to conclude that it was my own face.  (To be fair, I have an extremely acute sense of smell, so a lot of things that bother me wouldn&#x27;t even register to most people.)  So I started using it only at night and mixing in a couple of drops of tea tree oil to mask the odor, then just using plain jojoba in the morning.  I am very satisfied with the results so far and plan on continuing the routine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using my oil a few days,but love how it feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at the results after just a few days, my redness has gone down, acne scaring and dark spots are disappearing, and my current acne is not a cyst anymore the swelling has gone down immensely.. I gave it four stars because I&#x27;ve only had it for so long, I hope it doesn&#x27;t fail me in the long run. Thanks Radha Skincare!!</li>
            <li> How do I begin? I read about Rosehip Oil while I was living abroad in Abu Dhabi. I started having dark spots on my face from the sun, and even from past acne scars. Ive had the product now for nearly 2 weeks, and I can tell that my dark spots are slowly fading. What a relief. Great Price! Fast delivery! Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> I like this product.. I use it frequently.</li>
            <li> I am totally loving this oil. I have seen so much improvement in my complexion over the last 2 weeks. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this Rosehip oil on my face and hands. It does not leave a greasy feeling and it moisturizes my hand longer than lotions would. It has a particular smell right when you put it on but it goes away fairly quickly. Overall, I think this is a good skin product for my sensitive skin because it has no fillers of any kind!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I mix it with my lotion, add a few drops to my bath water and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and silky. I absolutely live it!!</li>
            <li> I got this product to help with some scaring and dark spots on my forearms. It soaks in quickly without an oil residue.While I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to know if it will help elevate the scaring, my skin is looking better. I can recommend this product to those with dry skin or just want to give their skin a little pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality oil. I was using rosehip seed oil from another brand and wanted to give Radha a try. At first I found the smell of Radha oil really awkward as the rosehip seed oil that I was using did not have the smell. I contacted their customer service asking about the smell, and they advised me to throw the oil if I think it is rancid and refunded my money. Their customer service is really amazing. After I did some research, I found that cold pressed rosehip is supposed to smell like the Radha oil does.  This is a very high grade oil that is great for dry skin. My skin feels really soft, has natural glow and looks dewy. My hubby keeps complementing how beautiful I am looking these days..haha... People with dry skin should definitely try this oil.  Must have for great problem free skin.</li>
            <li> I have seasonal roseaca on my cheeks and some on my forehead. I came back from a trip and really knew I needed to calm it down right away. Even my doc&#x27;s script for the cream I had was not working. I have been applying this 2x a day for a week now and it is almost gone. I also started using a mild salacylic 2% wash in addition to the oil.I truly feel this has helped with my overall condition of roseaca and will continue to use it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Awesome product.  Great for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I have only had the organic rosehip oil for a few days, but I am in love. First off, don&#x27;t expect it to smell like roses; it has a unique, pleasant scent and a rich color. A little goes a long way, and it is absorbed into the skin fully; I never feel greasy. I suffer from dry skin, age spots, sun spots/discoloration, and scars -- all of which this oil is helping to diminish, while making my skin soft and supple. I love it - and it&#x27;s organic and all natural, so I feel good about putting it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks but so far I really like it. I add a few drops  with  Neutrogena  daily moisturizer for my face. My husband and I both use it on our hands.</li>
            <li> I am old enough to stop looking for newer, better, latest.  However, I have never seen results like this provided for my skin.  I began using rosehip oil because of all of the recent hype, and decided to give oils a try.  This has a slight fragrance, much like french fries, but quickly dissipates, the softness of my skin does not disappear though.  It takes very little product to accomplish a lot.  What surprised me the most however, was the effect it had on the &amp;#34;coffee stains&amp;#34; on my face and hands, they&#x27;re virtually gone!  And, all I did was mindlessly massage into my hands what was left after applying some to my face.  Fine lines have vanished, and I&#x27;d swear that the dark circles under my eyes have lessened to the point that much less concealer is needed.  I know that everyone has skin that responds differently to different products, but for me, I&#x27;ve hit the jackpot.  Not only will I buy this again, I&#x27;m recommending it to anyone............</li>
            <li> I make my own facial products and this is a great oil to buy. It absorbs well in the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  It&#x27;s very reasonably priced for an  orgaic product.</li>
            <li> I use this on my wrinkles. After one month, people at work are commenting on how healthy I look. I assume they mean the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin softer also seems some of the wrinkles aren&#x27;t so noticeable</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet. Love the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this rosehip oil as it makes my skin hydrated &amp; soft and don&#x27;t feel greasy after apply it.  I use it on my face, neck and body. Definitely will buy again next time. Thanks seller for introduced such a fabulous product. &amp;#60;33 &amp;#60;33...</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00LNOV8JO Radha Beauty Rosehip Oil - 100% Pure Cold Pressed Certified Organic 4 fl. oz. - BEST moisturizer to heal Dry Skin &amp; Fine Lines - Virgin Rose hip Seed Oil For Face and Skin]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get enough of Rose hip oil.  This remarkable natural product has amazing skin rejuvenating and hair conditioning properties. I used on my face before going to bed and on my air after each wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Radha for this amazing oil.</li>
            <li> Great product in a nice bottle.</li>
            <li> Rosehip seed oil is great for overall body moisturizing (not greasy) and also face cleansing. The oil I received was very fresh and the bottle has a long dropper, which I like for oil, easier than a pump. I will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Very light oil, very light fragrance. Blends well with all my EOs for a wonderful and highly absorbable facial moisturizer. I have used this for a week consistently each morning and evening. Not one pimple! Feeling like I am doing my 50 year-old skin a favor.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Thicker than expected, and I added my choice of essential oils, and now my skin is happy, glowing, and firm. The packaging is also beautiful, I love leaving it out on my countertop to enjoy.</li>
            <li> I managed to make it into the tester group for this product when it first came out. I have used other essential oils before but never this brand or oil but I love samples so I figured why not?. I was actually excited when it came. The Radha people really take a lot of care with wrapping the glass bottle which is a nice change compared to some sellers here on Amazon lately! Having had nasty leaky boxes before I appreciated the extra effort that went into making sure it didn&#x27;t arrive broken, though their wrapping was almost too good. The bottle itself was what I consider a full size with a dropper and I expect it to last for a good while. I battle dry skin on my elbows so I immediately applied some and I honestly like this oil. It isn&#x27;t too slick and has no heavy scent but still moisturizes well. Back to school cold season is just about to start here and I think an oil like this will come in handy after the vigorous hand washing and colder dry weather that is bound to happen. If you are a rose hip oil fan you should definitely consider trying this brand.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product... My always red skin is soothed nicely by it when I apply it in the evenings, and I wake with a definite glow. Even though I was not sure what to expect upon purchasing this, I am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Needed to add a more oils to my stash and I must say this oil is great. I love it.</li>
            <li> great product. my skin looks more clear and younger.</li>
            <li> Well, am allergic to perfumes...&amp; this being chemically free, it is a joy for me to use...I have very sensitive skin...I use it on my face, &amp; good for dry feet legs, dry skin, damaged skin, &amp; a beauty aid...Sure beats using Vaseline...Great for taking a bath...I&#x27;m glad I discovered the benefits of this Rosehip Oil...For me it&#x27;s been a Godsend....Though, for some, there may be complaints who don&#x27;t just  like, or take  to the non-fragrant odor...Well, this is the way it is, &amp;  a lot of the chemicals in lotions, etc aren&#x27;t really all that good for you,&amp; some are even known to cause cancer, etc.. &amp;  there is a natural odor with this, though it has so many advantages for your skin, that makes up for that...Am so happy I found this on Amazon, at such a reasonable price....all 4 ounces of this....Quite a bargain, for this, skin health benefit....Your skin will thank you..</li>
            <li> Just use ones ...so far so good, I love it how my skin look....</li>
            <li> This is my new carrier oil for my essential oils. I love it! It absorbs very fast and if you apply it at night, you will wake up with skin smooth like a baby. It has no smell on its own, so I can smell whatever Essential oil I mix it with. So far, I have used it on my face, neck and hands. It will be used on my hubby&#x27;s back and legs, when I will give him a massage.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li> Just received my Rosehip Oil, happy about the large size bottle. I have used Rosehip Oil from another brand &amp; bought this when I ran out. I started using Rosehip Oil after watching Victoria Secret Angel Miranda Kerr talking about it in an interview about her skincare regimen. She said &amp;#34;Rosehip Oil is full of anti oxidants &amp; it works in a cellular level to rejuvenate the skin. Put it on at night &amp; wake up glowing.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how it absorbs in the skin fast &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily. I love knowing that I&#x27;m doing something really food for my skin &amp; it&#x27;s very affordable. I used to buy Josie Maran Argan Oil &amp; it&#x27;s so over priced had enough of that. So happy that I found Rosehip Oil &amp; is now part of my daily anti aging beauty regimen. This is will a repurchase for me for sure.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with some skepticism as to how well it would REALLY work to reduce the appearance of stretch marks, saggy skin, etc.  Boy, was I wrong, and so glad I gave it a try.  I use it daily on my breasts which have always been badly stretch marked due to extreme growth spurts in puberty and have been a real source of self-consciousness.  Additionally, I have been using it on my belly area which has some saggy skin from weight loss.  I also use it at night as a facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I&#x27;m amazed.  My stretch marks are still there but much less visible and the skin on my belly indeed looks far less saggy.  (Keep in mind, I didn&#x27;t lose hundreds of pounds, but around 80 lbs. combined with my age - 47 - so my tummy had some undesirable looseness that made me feel less physically attractive).  After daily application of the rosehip oil, even this area is considerably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also very pleased with the results on my face.  This really hydrates my VERY dry skin, and my lines are very diminished.  For example, the number &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines between my eyebrows are nearly gone (yay!) and the deep lines running from my nose to chin on either side (nasolabial area) are softened and plumped up.  I had the beginnings of deep crow&#x27;s feet that have now virtually disappeared.  My face still retains the character of a life well lived (which I love), but now it looks like I&#x27;m aging gracefully instead of at warp speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no illusions that if I stopped using the product things would revert to normal, but consistent use yields great results.  Love Radha Rosehip Oil and will definitely purchase again.  Also, fantastic customer service, super speedy shipment and impressive after-purchase follow up.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to give this a try.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!  DEFINITELY WILL ORDER MORE ONCE MINE IS GONE!</li>
            <li> Love this so much. I mix my own cleansing/nourishing oil for my face. This tea tree is wonderful and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Except for the odor( which is not so bad), the oil does not have a greasy feel.  Works well for moisturizing and for calming skin redness.</li>
            <li> The oil came well packaged and sealed very well so the top couldn&#x27;t open.  It has almost no scent which is a nice surprise as rose oil can be a bit pungent.  It makes a big difference on my skin: the lines around my eyes shrink away. I use it on my dry arms too, It&#x27;s a little heavier/oilier than another brand I was using, but that can be a matter of taste. That&#x27;s why I give it a 4 star rather than a 5. rating.</li>
            <li> This oil is great. And for the price it definitely can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I love this oil I use it after use of my derma roller my skin is so soft and flawless</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product. The smell is not bad at all. I don&#x27;t even notice it. I&#x27;m 46 and have some acne and I dab this oil on the individual pimples and also on the scabby pimples. It REALLY DOES speed up the healing process! And I don&#x27;t know how, but it takes the inflamed pimples down to a recovery stage. It&#x27;s amazing, really.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t put it over my whole face. Maybe I&#x27;ll try that after the pimples are for sure cleared up. I am dotting it on various scars to see what it might do for them, too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a skeptic when it comes to acne treatments since I&#x27;ve tried so many, but I would definitely recommend this oil for acne healing . I&#x27;ve been using it a for about a week,&lt;br /&gt;PLUS, a tiny drop goes a long way! I am concerned it might go bad since I use so little at a time. Anyone know?  Anyway, this oil is a great little secret!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret this purchase at all. With the little money spent.</li>
            <li> Would order again, really good product, made my face firmer</li>
            <li> I love this product !  I have very dry skin and my skin just absorbs the rose hip oil.  It leaves my skin so soft and after 3 weeks I  have noticed the &amp;#34; parenthesis&amp;#34; around my mouth is not as noticeable.  Thanks so much RADHA !</li>
            <li> I have read reviews of Rosehip oil before, but never believed the hype...until I got my own bottle! This stuff is AMAZING! I used it on my feet as soon as I received it. I have tough skin on my feet due to wearing a lot of heels and wedges and as soon as I put this on, my feet felt a lot smoother. I have also been using this on my face now for 3 days and my face looks brighter too! I will definitely continue using Rosehip oil for a very long time! Thank you Radha for such a quality product!!!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this oil! I have been using it on my psoriasis on my forearm and it is getting rid of it! It is getting rid of the redness, dryness, and splotchiness! I will DEFINITELY continue to buy this oil! HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and using this because I researched that this specific oil is good for stretch marks. Now that I&#x27;m using it I&#x27;m also finding it&#x27;s calming my itchy-all-over skin and healing it! The quality is superb and I would recommend this oil to anyone- especially if your expecting.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I picked up this rosehip oil.  I had never heard of this brand before and I will say that I was a bit apprehensive.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much product I received.  This is not a tiny bottle folks.  We are talking 4 ounces!  So at first when I opened the bottle, there was definitely a kind of weird smell to the oil.  I have never used rosehip oil before so I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect.  This is PURE rosehip oil, no added essential orders or scents...honestly, it kind of smelled of smells &amp;#34;earthy.&amp;#34;  I though for sure I had been duped.  I went online and started searching for &amp;#34;scent of pure rosehip oil&amp;#34; and sure enough it smelled exactly what is should smell like!  I have been using this on my face every night after I wash &amp; tone.  it absorbs very quickly but doesn&#x27;t dry out at all.  The next morning my skin feels super smooth.  I have also noticed a difference in my skin in terms of bounce &amp; elasticity...definitely not as many of those fine little lines we hate to see in the mirror.  I have also been using it as a carrier for my powder masks...I have a few clay and cocoa masks and I use this rosehip oil as the wet ingredient to hydrate the mask for application.  So that gives me double benefits because I am exfoliating, deep cleansing &amp; ultra moisturizing all at the same time...I highly recommend this product and this brand overall.  Great customer service, cruelty free and high quality!  Thank you Radha Beauty!</li>
            <li> I got my product right on time and although I missed the calls, the company followed up to see if I was happy.  I love the product.  The longer I use it the more I like it.  I mix mine with jojoba oil and an essential oil for a face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Best quality rosehip oil I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  The company responds quickly to requests! So let&#x27;s talk about the product.  I used it for 2 days, am and pm, and my Mom came to visit and couldn&#x27;t stop commenting on how my faced looked glowy.  I told her maybe it was the oil but couldn&#x27;t believe a product worked so quickly.  After speaking with Sean, another user, she confirmed that it definitely was the oil. She had the same results.  Now my Mom wants a bottle too.  It&#x27;s great to mix in with essential oils and use as a face cream.  It&#x27;s also great to rub 2 drops in your palm and run thru your hair to control frizz.  I use a silk pillowcase for wrinkle control and this doesn&#x27;t ruin my pillow case at all.  I highly recommend it and the company.  This does not need to be refrigerated but keep it in a dark cool place.</li>
            <li> Product arrived packaged very well. After reading reviews I was skeptical because of so many people saying it smelled horrible and that the oil must have gone bad.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I recieved was not blue like in the picture but a brown glass instead. Still very pretty. After opening it the first thing I did was smell it and to my surprise it had no scent at all, even after applied to skin it has no scent which I love. Also the first few days of using the oils my face broke out just a little but after continuing for a few days my skin cleared up and has been very moisturized ever since I started the oil. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see longer term rests such as wrinkles but home will say. Thank you for a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Have not receiv d yet but looking forward to trying it.  I was told this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I tried this for some red outbursts I get on my skin from time to time. It didn&#x27;t help that (I forget what form of psoriasis it is). However, it did get rid of a small and raised dried skin formation on my finger. The wart–like bump was there for about a year. After a couple of days of applying the rosehip oil, it was gone. I have a bad toenail, and I&#x27;m going to try it on that next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil smells like fish. The odor will die down for the most part after a few hours. Don&#x27;t go to bed with this oil on your face unless you use a towel over your pillowcase(s) as it will smear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rosehip oil for about a year now, but the brand I was using before was not organic. I am so happy with this product. It&#x27;s a huge bottle and a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love product - nice company to do business with</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of great things about Rosehip oil but didn&#x27;t really get the result from this product. It may work for some but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Great product! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great texture. I mix it with my estee lauder night repair serum and its perfection. A lot comes out of the dropper so just squeeze it all out and then there will still be a couple drops that you can use.</li>
            <li> I recently had a total replacement of my right knee. I bought the rosehip seed oil to treat the resulting keloid scar from the surgery.&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product 4 stars because the product arrived on time and intact. As I use the oil and it works for me, I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days but it is already making a huge difference on my skin. I have very dry skin and have been using this on my face and it&#x27;s been working beautifully.  Absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally write reviews about products I return but here goes. I recently purchased this oil to use in a variety of skincare applications. The product arrived quickly in a lovely blue bottle and was well packaged. Sadly, I discovered it was not compatible with my skin type. After speaking to Sean, Radha Beauty&#x27;s customer service rep, he agreed that this oil wasn&#x27;t working for my skin and that I could return it at no additional charge. Wow, nice! I spoke with him for several minutes and will be purchasing a different oil we both believe will work for my skin. Sean offered the kind of customer service missing in today&#x27;s often impersonal shopping experience: personable, polite, and knowledgable. I will order from this company again and hope someone like Sean is around the next time I buy a car :)</li>
            <li> I would like to see their sheet from an independent lab stating this is Rosehip oil.  While in Chile, the Rosehip oil was tanner in color and thicker.  Since their are no regulations, I do not know if this is Rosehip oil without proof. I have been using it every day without any tangible results. I am not saying this is not Rosehip oil.  The company surely has excellent marketing.</li>
            <li> This is the third brand of Rosehip oil that I&#x27;ve tried and this is much different and inferior to the other ones that I&#x27;ve used. The color is that of vegetable oil, unlike the other rosehip oils that were amber colored. It is also lacks the unique scent of the other rosehip oils that I&#x27;ve used. Lastly, it does not absorb into my skin like the other oils I&#x27;ve used before. I am using it as a carrier oil for other stronger essential oils. I caution anyone to purchase this brand of oil because it is vastly different and lacks the quality of other organic rosehip oils.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I have ordered Radha Rosehip oil and I love it. I use it with natural essential oils to help combate acne, and fine lines/wrinkles. I have noticed a marked improvement in my skin. Stellar product.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and I am really loving it. I do not notice any odor when I put this on. I wash my face at night and then add 2-3 drops on my hand and put it on my face, neck, and hands. The next morning when I wake up my skin is always super soft! Seems to be helping to even out my skin tone as well, I don have any major skin tone issues, but my overall complexion seems really nice.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing this product and so far love it! Smells an feels great. Defiantly recommended!</li>
            <li> I received both Radha Rosehip &amp; Peppermint oil and I absolutely love both. I use them after soaking my hands and feet. These oils feel very luxurious and soft on my skin I love it. I will start mixing the oils with sugar for a daily scrub! Great products!</li>
            <li> Sweet baby J...my skin feels amazing and I&#x27;ve barely had this two days. Unless something changes for the worse, I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again, for sure!!!!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it oo early to live a complete review but I haven&#x27;t broke up from it so&lt;br /&gt;I think this is fantastic</li>
            <li> I just received this. I&#x27;ve never purchased rose hip oil before but, considering what it is supposed to look and smell like, I don&#x27;t think what I received is rose hip oil.  The oil in my bottle is very pale yellow with a minimal scent that l</li>
            <li> I have been using Radha Rosehip oil for almost a month, morning and night.  I definately see an improvement in my skin.  I will continue to use your product.</li>
            <li> I am super impressed with this product. I live in the desert so I was looking for a good skin care product to help with my dehydrated face. I put it on my face, neck and chest before bed everynight and in the morning after a shower.  I have been using the product for 4 days and I can already tell a significant difference.  This is one of those products that really stand up to the claim. I have replaced my expensive moisturizer with this and it works perfectly.  Also, this goes on like an oil, but it does absorb quickly, so it will not leave you feeling or looking oily. Miraculous.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice skin oil, light in color and clear, with barely any scent. I found it absorbs rapidly into the skin and leaves it feeling soft and supple without being greasy. Rosehip oil has been found to help reduce scar tissue and stretch marks, and even aid in tissue regeneration in surgical wounds. It provides lipids and moisture to the skin. This would be a great carrier oil to add some therapeutic, healing essential oils to for skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> Ellecent product. This Rosehip oil feels amazing from the momet I put it on. My wife and I have made it a nightly habit to apply this to our face before we go to bed! And o did I mention its organic!</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful, packaging great, arrived on time, will order again!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Really good results.:-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a week or so, and so far so good. Keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> great product, I read reviews before buying it, and it actually works, am glad I found this product before the winters , it  makes my skin really soft and healthy looking specially for cold weather .I will buy it again .</li>
            <li> Wonderful oils! great price</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this oil. It&#x27;s non-greasy and fast absorbent. But I wish it would have a stronger rose fragrance considering it&#x27;s labeled as a 100% rosehip oil. I have been using this product for the last couple of days on my face, my hands, my elbows, and my feet. It dose a great job moisturizing the skin. I also like the price ($10.00 the date of this review). I would thus purchase this product in the future and recommend it to friends. The reason I only give four stars is because it does not really impress me. However, it does get the job done.</li>
            <li> This has been great for both scar prevention/removal for cuts and eczema in my household. It has an oily smell but does not leave an oily residue. It has been more effective than prescription meds for eczema. It has anti-aging properties, though I have not used it that way. This is a great value for a large quantity of organic rose hip oil. We love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! The customer service was also impeccable!</li>
            <li> Perfect! I have combo &amp; sensitive skin &amp; this moisturizes without irritating or causing breakouts!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days, but my face seems to be feeling very soft.  I have sensitive skin and have to be careful of the products that I use, and this product seems to have a very &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; effect on my skin.  I plan on visiting the Radha web site and exploring more uses, such as on my hair.  I will by again.</li>
            <li> The product is ok. It does not have a bad smell as other reviews indicated. As a matter of fact it has no smell. It does make my face feel very soft. I purchased it for two reasons...my son has slightly red/pink checks with little bumps on them (on saw on Dr. Oz that it can be treated with Rosehip Oil) and I have a recent scar above my lip from a cold sore that I picked at. Thinking that the product would help eliminate or even lessen the effect/appearance of both issues, it so far has not. Made the purchase over two weeks now and still have not seen any signs that the product works aside from making my skin feel soft. We both apply it morning and night and so far...nothing. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase from this supplier again. I don&#x27;t want to give up on Rosehip Oil so I will try again with another supplier.</li>
            <li> A must have! Add it to your deep conditioners or a few drops to your face cream. You will be &amp;#34;smack yo baby&#x27;s bottom&amp;#34; soft! I wish I had known about this product years ago. It is making such a difference in my skin and hair especially as a natural. My hair has become incredibly soft overnight with just one application throughout my scalp and hair. I&#x27;ve added it to my homemade shea butter hair mask and I will be using my own products as much as I can. I need to get more of this stuff! It really does absorb fast! So important! Most products only coat the surface of the skin but this stuff goes in deep and does wonders. Some scarring from old blemishes have started to disappear since including it in my regimen!</li>
            <li> Very high quality Rosehip Seed oil. I store the extra in the fridge to keep all of the goodness intact. Works wonderfully as a face oil and for scars/stretch marks. I will be reordering from this company.</li>
            <li> makes my skin glow, does not break me out</li>
            <li> Makes skin SO SOFT and not oily AT ALL!!! Skin glows too after using it - I love this product!</li>
            <li> AMAZING oil ! Itchy go away just 5&#x27; !!!!&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING !!!!</li>
            <li> Light and super gentle on my dry, sensitive skin. Huge value too! Thank you for creating a beautiful product</li>
            <li> i love this product. Non-greasy</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot. It sinks in wonderfully and even though it has a scent, it disappears very quickly. It makes my skin feel really soft. I&#x27;ve used other brands of Rosehip oil and they were lovely too, but, the really selling point of the Radha brand is that you get 4 ounces of the oil. Others top out at 2 ounces. When you&#x27;re only using 6-7 drops twice a day, this is going to last a long time. Highly recommend this product and this company. I have tried their Eye Gel and the Peppermint Oil and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer ever!  This is one of the very few products that I can use on my dry and extremely sensitive skin without any adverse reactions.  Thank you Radha!</li>
            <li> I had never used rosehip oil before and now LOVE it!! The Radha Rosehip Oil is beautiful! It is so soothing, absorbs quickly, and has made my skin super soft!! Truly a beautiful oil!</li>
            <li> Its good for my hair but no changes on skin. I didn&#x27;t see any effect of this oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> NOT good for me, but daughter loved the product. Caused dermatitis and pimples for me... But she loved it to minimize wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling like some oils can. I add my essential oils to it daily for a perfect moisturizer! Sean was a gem while following up with my order.</li>
            <li> Intense moisture, absorbs right away. No greasy residue and a little goes a long way! Definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Works great! It&#x27;s everything I&#x27;ve hoped for. Clear, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> The oil I received smelled old and rancid.  It was not fresh.  I thought with the higher price, I would get a quality product, but was very disappointed.  Amazon is great about refunding defective products; however, I don&#x27;t recommend this brand. Try something else!</li>
            <li> so far I am very happy with this product. Its been a couple of days but it is very moisturizing and makes my skin feel smoother. The smell takes a little getting used to at first but doesn&#x27;t linger</li>
            <li> Amazing, extremely fast shipping and product arrived in excellent condition. Thank you!</li>
            <li> great product and great service&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am saving it for a gift.  I feel sure that it will be just what I want.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich luxurious oil beautifully packaged. I have already seen the results I was looking for. I have tried other rose-hip oils, but they pale in comparison. One of their representative also contacted me to see how I liked it as a follow up to the purchase. That was my first experience with an Amazon purchase. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the way my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrific.  I add a little to my moisturizer and my skin is dewy all day</li>
            <li> Added this to my skin care regimen after Aqua Glycolic and my face looks great. Wonderful combo for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for 6 days  now and I have 2 admit it&#x27;s amazing!!! My face is soft n radiant. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on how beautiful my slim looks. This is a must have and I  will definitely continue 2 use it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite oil.  Really repairs my skin, keeps it soft and is great on my face to my heels!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my order. The product is fresh, it&#x27;s authentic, and arrived promptly. Communication from seller was superb and the package was packed very well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> love love love this!  I now use it as my night moisturizer before bed.  It is oily when you first put it on, and it does take sometime for it to absorb.  However, you wake up with soft and moisturized skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it as my day moisturizer, but it is too heavy under my make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no fragrance, which I like.  I will definitely be ordering another bottle when I run out!</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer under my eyes so far I like it.  And I also use it on my hair it&#x27;s great on my hair</li>
            <li> This stuff has replaced my serum and it does a wonderful job without chemicals. Great customer service!</li>
            <li> As I had used other brand before, I really like this product as it does not have a strong smell at all. Though, the result does take time in each person, I have found this product amazing. Also, the huge amount of this oil make me love it even more.</li>
            <li> good product for rashes and summer mishaps.</li>
            <li> Really good oil! I bought it to mix with jojoba oil and use it on my hair after I wash it, and after about two weeks, I am very impressed. It adds a nice amount of cover without being overly greasy.  Add a few drops of Vitamin C serum to a few drops of this Rosehip oil to dry skin and you&#x27;ll immediately feel a subtle difference. Radha was very easy to buy from and checked in to let me know my item had shipped and to see if I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is not rosehip oil it is vegetable oil. I read that you were supposed to keep rosehip oil in the fridge so I did this. When I took it out it had solidified. The only oil that does this is vegetable oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! Light and rejuvenating! Has already made my skin glow in just a couple days of using!</li>
            <li> Light smell just started using it that&#x27;s y no 5stars yet..but I can tell it helps your skin look youthful ... Oily skin like mines don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li> LOVE this oil! I am reordering product right now! I had surgery with major scaring, nerve damage, etc...I use this oil every morning and night on scar. It has a beautiful light texture, not sticky or greasy. I mix an essential oil for nerve repair in with it, it&#x27;s lovely!! do not expect a rose smell though :-))</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product. I use three drops in my hair after shower, before I add any styling products. My hair is so shiny, and healthy. This product is an A+.</li>
            <li> I do think it probably is a good product, but I saw no results on my skin after almost a month!  My skin needs the moisture, but it did leave me a bit greasy...and my fine hair, around my face, got oilier than usual.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all, not much fragance and it is natural.</li>
            <li> Definitely a keeper and will reorder again. I&#x27;ve been blessed with good genes and my skin has never presented a problem to me. I have used other oils in the past, but never has my skin felt so soft as it does after using this product. It actually feels like the skin of a newborn. Yay!!! Love it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I do love this oil. I bought it to mix with my doTerra essential oils for my face in just to days I have noticed such a difference. I will be buying more of your many different types of oils. Aloha from Kauai</li>
            <li> Very good product. It delivers on its promise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 5 days, but I must say I already love it!  My skin is dry, but many lotions will cause breakouts of little whiteheads. This Rada rosehip oil moisturizes without any problems - without any oily feel.  My makeup goes on smoothly, and stays fresh looking for most of the day.  I have rosacea and this doesn&#x27;t irritate -  and I don&#x27;t need much makeup to give me an even skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried Rosehip Oil and so far it seems to work amazingly. I sometimes wear the oil and nothing else on my face and it gives me just a hint of a honey/amber tone that makes my skin glow. I am Indian and already have darker skin and this oil makes it look radiant. It is very light and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores which is always a concern for me.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I use this every day and my skin feels &amp; looks fabulous!  And I revived my order very quickly too.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great shipping and good smell.</li>
            <li> I had to finish using my last face cream and have only used this the last two nights, but I am extremely impressed so far.  I put it on my face and neck and cannot remember my neck ever feeling so soft!  Thank you so much for making such a great product and for caring about your customers.  I look forward to using this for years to come.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great, high-quality product.</li>
            <li> Using the product a few days.  Skin looks more dewey.  It&#x27;s a lot of product (4-oz) for the money, so I am pleased about that. Not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This oil is nothing like Rosehip oil.....It looks like diluted vegetable oil and is completely odorless. I have to return it as I would not even trust putting it on my face. I have used Rosehip oil for a long time and this is absolutely not it.</li>
            <li> I love all kinds of facial oils, and this a another good one.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to be how pure rosehip oil is described. Also, it broke me out. I dumped it out, cleaned out the bottle and now use the bottle for an organic oil.</li>
            <li> The fine lines on my cheeks are gone with just a few weeks application.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 74 and was told I look 60.  I have told all my friends.</li>
            <li> Everything is great except smell, does soften</li>
            <li> Product is solid, nice consistency and beautiful bottle. My only issue is the dropper. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work upright, I have to tilt the whole dropper when I&#x27;m using it or else it will drip while I&#x27;m transferring it to my other container. Otherwise great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I use it on my face and it gives me a nice glow</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is a part of my daily anti aging routine  and this 4oz bottle is a great value /money saver! My order arrived -securely packed-within the week and exactly as advertised. High quality organic product and professional sellers!</li>
            <li> Product as described, fast delivery! I have used the rose oil for about 10 days and my skin feels really soft. I was hesitant as I did not want that &#x27;oily&#x27; feeling but it absorbs quickly. I did a little research prior to ordering and found the cold press rose hips is the best (which this Radha product is). Using a few drops twice a day from this large bottle should last at least 6 months. You can also use it as an all over body oil as many do according to my research. I highly recommend Radha products.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil for a amazing price. Bought one for 1 once for almost the same price. Use it prior to my night cream.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing oil! I use it at night as a moisturizer (a little bit goes a very long way). As a result, my skin is always smooth and luminous. The best part is that this oil does not break me out. I will definitely purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is fantastic.  It makes my face feel soft and plumps up the skin.  I tried to remove a sun spot a few months ago and it seems like the rosehip oil is speeding up the process - because it is finally starting to disappear. I have used it on my cracked heels, once, and it seemed to help.  I loved it so much, I bought some for my mom, as well.</li>
            <li> I have just discovered the benefits of using rose oil daily. I Can&#x27;t get over the positive effects it already has made on my skin. It hydrates my skin all day! I also use it at night. I had decided on my birthday that I better look into some serious skin products. (As in no more drug store products that never fulfill their promises!) So I tried several \\&quot;dr so and so\\&quot; products all with discouraging results. The most they did was make my skin break out and cost $$$ a half ounce! So when I read about rose hip oil I decided to try it. I am loving the results! My skin looks great !  You might think that putting an oil on your face would make it oily but it does not. Instead of clogging my pores it makes them look smaller while making my face glow!  My daughter was having dry skin this winter and nothing seemed to help. I gave her some rose oil and now she uses it as well. Overall I am so pleased to have found this natural beauty product!!!! Love it! 🌹🌹🌹🌹</li>
            <li> This rose hip oil is thick, orange, with a hearty smell as it is supposed to be.  I have been using rose hip oils for 5 years.  I am in my late 50s and my skin around the eyes and neck is tighter now than it was 5 years ago. As rose hip oils in general become rancid over a certain period of time, I put a little quantity for daily use in a small bottle and I keep the remaining in the refrigerator.  Update on October 2016. I bought the Radha Oil again because I love the combination price/quality.  There are a lot of oils out there but I think that this one is of great quality with a very reasonable price. I love it!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft..</li>
            <li> I really love my Rosehip Oil. It&#x27;s a new product for me. I love how it makes my face feel. I apply it to my face twice a day and slowly seeing results. I&#x27;ve only had my Oil for a week.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it more or less as a whole body oil but especially likes it on her face and heels. She had some surgery that requires gently massaging the incisions and finds it very soothing. She also finds it very effective in keeping her heels from drying and being rough. Needless to say after making two purchases she is sold on both the product and the vendor.</li>
            <li> This may just be the first product which keeps advertised promises:). Now, I&#x27;m very old, so there&#x27;s no hope for the Grand Canyon-like crevices, which line my face, but Radha Rosehip Oil has lessened the redness, and flakiness. I don&#x27;t gaze into the mirror, much, so I don&#x27;t know what&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s doing, to the finer lines; I only know my skin feels better, after a week of using the product. I will definitely keep using Radha Rosehip Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I would give 5 stars, but that would mean I look 60 years younger...and there&#x27;s absolutely NO miracle, for that;).  How about 4 1/2 stars?</li>
            <li> Just started using the Rose Hip Oil!  Very moisturizing and my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> What a wonderful soothing skin treatment.</li>
            <li> I love this oil and the way it feels on my face. My skin is so dry, the oil is instantly absorbed. My face feels smooth and softer. I have been told that I look a lot younger now. I&#x27;m telling everyone how much this oil has helped my skin.</li>
            <li> Another one of my good to luxurious oils I mix with one of the carrier oils (almond, avocado, etc) to moisturize my hair and skin. Great value!</li>
            <li> Great product, great customer service, quickly shipped. I really appreciated the information booklet that was emailed to me about the rose hip oil.</li>
            <li> This product is such a steal.  I&#x27;ve used rosehip oil before, so I know this product is true rosehip oil.  My skin is very smart and can distinguish different oils from one another.  As for it being organic, I can&#x27;t say much about that.  There is no USDA certification.  Either way, for about $15, I got 4 oz of oil, which is a great deal.  Rosehip oil is one of few oils I know works on my skin, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and actually brightens my skin.  How I use it is I warm a few drops of oil between the hands by rubbing, then I gently pat the oil onto my face and decollete.  In the morning, my face would look brighter and not greasy at all.  I also use it on my hair.  Everybody raves about coconut oil and argan oil for hair.  For me both these oils are way too greasy for hair and even for the skin.  Rosehip oil absorbs right into the hair, making my hair shinier, softer, and more manageable.  It works way better when I apply a few drops onto my hair after I shower.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Lovely oil! Asorbs nicely into the skin with no oily residue.  My skin is noticeable softer.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Use it every day on my face and I use it once a week on my hair to condition it.  I very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Your skin will love you for this!</li>
            <li> WOW. This Rosehip oil is great. I have been using it on my face and neck for 4 days and my skins feels amazing! This is my first time using rosehip oil and I am very pleased. I am hoping that with time it will lighten the dark spots on my face. I keep mine in the fridge and use it twice a day. I am going to recommend it to all my friends. such a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and this is a very good grade of oil. What an amazing result it gives on the skin. You so need to try this.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly! Love the product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this oil! I have used this for over a month now. I normally use before going to bed at night, wash my face first, spray with Rosewater then apply a few drops of this Rosehip oil. A little sticky when i apply but it was absorbed in a few minutes. My main skin concern is the dryness, even during summer time. This oil hydrates my skin. I don&#x27;t apply this during the day because I need day cream that has sun protection. I used to feel dryness at the end of the day, but after using this oil I never feel the dryness again (I use the same day cream). I can&#x27;t say if it brightens my skin, I also don&#x27;t have wrinkles, so I don&#x27;t know if this oil can help this or not. Anyway, this oil does what I expected. Definitely recommends it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for a while and I love it so much. I live the area is very dried. This oil is very moisture but not oily. My skin adsorb it by the way. I would highly recommend this products to my friends.</li>
            <li> ~ I have only used the product twice, but Radha has sent me 3 requests to review.  So, I&#x27;m giving a neutral 3 star for quick delivery, annoying company requests for reviews.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it enough to know whether it will improve my skin.  The two times I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve noticed no change in my skin appearance.</li>
            <li> I have a very simple review to write.  I just finished my bottle and it lasted me months-that&#x27;s with daily use.  On my face, twice a day, on my feet, once or twice a day, and pretty much anything else I could think of.  Elbows, toddler cheeks, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to apply it after using a steamy washcloth over my face and misting with a humectant toner.  If I&#x27;m just going to be home for the time being, I leave it at that.  I often don&#x27;t add any other moisturizer.  If I&#x27;m going out into a New Jersey winter with my slightly dry skin, I add another moisturizer over it.  Last winter, my skin would be flaky by the time I got home.  This winter, that has not been a problem.  I have even had my skin referred to as &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; and had people ask me what I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am about to re-order because it dramatically extended the life of my moisturizer, eliminated a need for serums, and is overall an incredible value.  Plus, I love knowing exactly what I&#x27;m putting on my skin and that it&#x27;s healthy to use!!</li>
            <li> Does not work well for my fair, acne-prone skin. Also leaves my hair looking greasy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I used this twice a day for a month and did not see any results as far as scars or wrinkles.  My skin was softer.</li>
            <li> Love it! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Feels marvelous on my skin.  Not greasy at all..........just moisturizing.  My complexion is improving already after only a week.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Used in combination with the dermaroller and broke out like crazy. Don&#x27;t use this if you have any acne at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Radha Rosehip oil for about a week and have already noticed a difference in my skin.  My skin is less dry, smoother and my make up goes on much easier and doesn&#x27;t collect in the fine lines and wrinkles.  I am thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li> I have only been using the oil for a short time now so I can not speak to how it will work on the fine lines and wrinkles, but I can say that the company did provide a very good experience and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I question he authenticity of this oil. Rosehip oil should be orange and has a district smell. This oil reminds me of vegetable oil. I returned this immediately.</li>
            <li> I was using Barbary Fig Oil on my face.  I ran out and it is SO expensive.  I decided to try the Radha rosehip oil.  I have a &amp;#34;sunspot&amp;#34; on my face and some down my neck.  Within less than a week of daily use mixed with my moisturizer and straight on my face at night, I can already see a lightning of the spots.  The only reason I am not giving a 5-star, is that I&#x27;d like to see if it takes it a little further as the fig oil did.</li>
            <li> Its a great product and I would get it again..I use it with my face wash</li>
            <li> Great product I really like it. I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful what I use or I break out. I also have terrible allergies so fragrances set me off as well. This has none of that. It is exactly as advertised. Im so glad that I got to try it out for free because otherwise I probably never would&#x27;ve given it a chance.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!! Its organic, very light, observe quickly, non sticky! Awesome quality!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have extreamy frzzy and dry hair and skin, i apply 2 to 3 drops of rosehip oil into my hair, instantly my hair gets smooth and soft, it tamm hair frizz! With regular use of this i have save my hair from damaging!!&lt;br /&gt;I also use on my face as i have dry skin! i apply very little oil on face it makes my skin super soft!&lt;br /&gt;make sure to use regular!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** i got this product for free to review but the opinion is my own!!</li>
            <li> This has been my go to moisturizer every morning and night for the past few days and it has been great. My skin feels great! I have used some other oils in the past as a moisturizer and have broken out, but so far no breakouts with this one. I would definitely recommend this to someone who wanted to try and oil as a moisturizer. I did recieve this product to review but it is fed something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is so awesome and perfect and amazing and a great value. Rosehip oil is definitely very different from any other oil I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all of them). You can feel the difference in your skin from the moment you apply it, or at least I could. When I&#x27;m using this oil my skin feels plump, supple, and soft in ways it&#x27;s never felt before. *Two thumbs up*</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry skin for years! I have tried so many different kinds of lotions, and not one has worked as well as Radha Rosehip Oil. I have used Radha Rosehip Oil for the past 4 days and you wouldn&#x27;t believe how much of a difference it has made! My body is so soft and smooth!! It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and it is really easy to apply. I love that it comes in a big 4oz bottle with a dropper. I would recommend this product to anyone who has really dry skin!</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail after 3 days. I would have given tis product 5 stars if the smell was more pleasing. It&#x27;s not a terrible smell, just odd and not one I love, so I put a drop of an essential oil to it when I use it. I knew this wasn&#x27;t going to smell like roses as it&#x27;s made out of the hips, not petals, but I was unsure about the smell. When I emailed the supplier about it, they responded in a few hours. They told me the the smell was normal, but if I was&#x27;t satisfied they would give me a refund. I asked about putting it in the fridge, and was told it&#x27;s better to keep it at room temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this along with Jojoba oil and a few drops of an EO, and it seems to be helping my dry skin. I also use it as part of my carrier oil when diluting y EOs.</li>
            <li> Very good product will buy again.,</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and intact.  Mine does not smell rancid like others reported.  I&#x27;ve had the oil just for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using on my face for the past several days.  I&#x27;ve been adding some essential oils and use morning and night.  I&#x27;m looking to get rid of deep wrinkles, crows feet  and freckles/ age spots.  Too soon to notice any results but will try and update when/if I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not leave my face feeling oily.  Well, when first applied it does but then absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using this type of oil so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.</li>
            <li> Love the way the product works; not so crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time. Great oil. Leaves your skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I purchased rosehip. Extremely satisfied. Huge bottle. Will be returning for future purchases.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> really does help with itching.  Use for my sons eczema and it helps his skin.  Great value for the size.  would definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Very sensitive skin and this product works!</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a short while but wanted to say that the service was quick and how much I like the product!  I have been applying to my face a.m and p.m. Feels really nice , does not stay greasy and makes my skin feel soft.  Does not have any smell to it.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE beauty product that i use daily.  I put it on my face at night before going to bed and I wake up glowing.  During the day, I mix a little bit with my moisturizer and it prevents it from looking too oily.  The smell is decent (not bad and not great).  This 4 oz bottle will last for a long time!  Both my husband and I use it twice a day for the last couple weeks, and it looks like we haven&#x27;t made a dent in it.  My skin has never felt so soft and I do believe it&#x27;s helping my fine lines around my eyes the most.  Either way, I feel more beautiful every day that I wear this. I also realized that my skin looks radiant without makeup but if I put do makeup on, it ends up looking duller.....  so I use less makeup because of this product. It&#x27;s absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li> My heels are always rough and cracked because I love going barefoot all the time. This oil works miracles to keep them soft and smooth without leaving a greasy residue that makes me feel like I&#x27;m going to slip and fall!! It leaves a nice sheen on my fingernails too. I am soooo happy to have these wonderful, natural products to replace all the chemical laden products that I used to use! Thank you Radha!!!</li>
            <li> Sinks into skin and hair fast</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT MAKE MY FACE SMOOTH AND SOFT</li>
            <li> very moisturizing and came very quickly.  Just FYI- if you think it will smell like &amp;#34;roses&amp;#34; you will be very disappointed.  The weird smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Another great oil!  Such beneficial and versatile oil.  I would not hesitate for a second about ordering this oil again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have really bad oily skin with pimples and I was worried to use any oil products, because most of oils give me more troubles. But this oil is actually helping to heal pimples faster and make my skin smooth. I can&#x27;t use too much, because this oil is pretty thick and makes my skin sticky,so I use only 3 drops for my entire face. It&#x27;s just a right amount for me. Rosehip sounds like rose smell, but rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> 4 OZ, note the large size for the price of an ounce.  I used it a few days and love the feel on my skin and the glow....</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  I like the dropper enclosed and here&#x27;s to being eternally youthful!!&lt;br /&gt;Dorann</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic for the skin on my face and neck, which is both crazy dry (cracks, flakes, other horrors) and prone to hormonal acne. Rosehip oil is basically a miracle for everything that plagues me—100% fixes the dry skin, 90% clears up the jawline zits. Most moisturizers clog my giant pores, but this absorbs cleanly and instantly. I&#x27;m so grateful to have found it! The Radha brand is great—cold-pressed for maximum vitamins, very handy dropper, really gorgeous thick blue glass bottle that makes me feel good every time I see it on the shelf. I use more of it before bed as a night and eye cream cream, and less in the morning, when I rub in my tinted BB cream on right over it—it actually makes my makeup blend better than without the rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  I can see clear results on my skin!</li>
            <li> Great product will buy again</li>
            <li> Great stuff love it! Best rosehip oil out there:))</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil....it does just what is claimed. Not only will I be purchasing more of the rosehip oil from this company, I also will be purchasing some for both my daughters.</li>
            <li> A very nice size bottle for the price. Orde free. Doesn&#x27;t leave an oil residue. Very light and easy to apply. The applicator dropper seals great so it&#x27;s leak free. Will repurchase. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for using at night.  It is heavy, which is normal for oil.  Too soon to tell results, however so far so good.  The manufacturer has great follow up,, which shows they care if it is working.  I like that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 6 months pregnant and I began to get a red dry and itchy rash on my cheeks on day!  I found this oil by searching Amazon and after the first night of receiving it and using it, it cleared up the redness by the next morning!  Since then it has continued to improve as well as lighten acne scarring.  It did make the patches dry the second day and then they were exfoliated off by cleansing, revealing better skin.  So if your skin gets a little dry in patches give it a day or two and gently exfoliate.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!! And I&#x27;m VERY picky about my skincare products. ;-). Bravo Radha!  I&#x27;m impressed!  I was skeptic of all the 5 star reviews but now I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I scar very easily.  This oil helped heal the wound in record time and it didn&#x27;t leave a scar.  I use it for so many things.  I replaced my $30 for 5oz night time moisturizer and it is doing a better job.  It is a wonderful hand on body moisturizer.  It even works as lip balm.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it works great</li>
            <li> Awesoooome! This is my first purshase of Rosehip oil. This is also my first use.  It leaves my skin soft and subtle even after one week of use! Thanks Radha for this quality product. Please, never be bought into &amp;#34;watering down&amp;#34; your excellent product..</li>
            <li> LOVE this product - its the only thing I&#x27;ve been using for moisture all summer. This particular brand is very light in color and free of odor unlike other brands. While I have to wonder if this indicates that a lot of the good stuff has been stripped out in the processing, it works so nicely that I don&#x27;t wonder for long.</li>
            <li> This oil, mixed with jojoba oil, makes the perfect facial moisturizer for my sensitive/oily/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Packing was good. Only had for a less than a week so haven&#x27;t noticed any results as of yet.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product that it better than sex.Try it you will be completly satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was very eager to try out this rosehip oil and surprised at what 4 oz really looked like. Just a few drops was enough to hydrate my face. Since so little goes such a long way I plan on adding it to some homemade body lotion!&lt;br /&gt;It feels silky, not greasy at all. When I first tried it I keep marveling at how the fingers I used to apply it felt so much softer than the others.&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to see the benefits of this oil over time, so far it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil to use in a skin care recipe and I absolutely love it!! It is lightweight and leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth. I received my order quickly and you cannot beat this price!! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a wonderful moisturizing and healthy skin care oil!</li>
            <li> Completely amazing! It feels wonderful and has the lightest scent of rose.</li>
            <li> Loving it! first time for me to used this product and i&#x27;m loving it already. no need to use a lot, a single drop of it and it will cover your entire face. it leaves my skin so smooth and not dry. definitely will get more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel refreshed when applied right before bedtime.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My first time trying this oil - it works great! My skin tends to be dry these days and it turns more soft and smooth after i apply the oil.  The oil is absorbed into the skin quickly and it wont make you feel greasy!</li>
            <li> I love oud like for you all to know that this product is amazing, now days rosehip seed oil has caught the attention of mant beauty cult followers as well as beauty product companies, so it is becoming difficult to find trusting companies who offers organic, quality rosehip oil. I have searched many websites and wholesalers as that have iether been out of stock or the oil has been refined or non organic. Being that I develope my own brand needing this particular ingredient I have been threw many and I must say I have found my source threw Radha. Thank you so very much and I will be reordering in the near future. Also Radha&#x27;s shipping is quick and secure. Thank you again.</li>
            <li> I had read Rosehip Oil was good for your hair, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how mine would react. My scalp tends to be a little dry after washing. A few drops in the targeted areas and like magic, no more itching after one application.</li>
            <li> Just an update to my review.... I love this oil!  I have been using it for 2 weeks and there is a difference in my skin! So often there is little or no change, this makes a my skin a much better texture and color. I will be reordering!</li>
            <li> The Radha Rosehip oil is as described. I&#x27;ve mixed it with a small amount of vitamin E oil to thin it out, because it is thick and rich. Feels very nice on the skin. Recommended!</li>
            <li> A good size bottle! It soaks into the skin quickly and leaves it feeling soft and supple.  I hope it helps correct sun damage.</li>
            <li> I am 44, this oil seems makes me break out which is odd because I thought it&#x27;s good for mature skin.  I don&#x27;t feel difference after using this. Quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the look of this product. The cobalt blue bottle is beautiful and the dropper makes using it so easy. It is huge and goes a long way. I mix it with a drop of palmarosa, rosewood, and myrrh and apply it to my face. Makes my face feel smooth and look healthy. I have also tried Radha peppermint oil and love that as well. So far impressed with this brand. Order shipped fast and I received it really quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I was also skeptical about the high rating, but I agree. It is changing my skin and I wish someone would have told me about this before I was 31 years old. I have dry skin and this is perfect. I checked it out as I am moving to the mountains and knew my current regiment wouldn&#x27;t be enough. I have stopped using lotion on my face, except sunscreen when needed. It can really be used all over your body though. I do need about 6 drops, not 3 each time, but put it on my neck as well. It took about 10 days to receive, but was packaged properly. I will be buying more and have also bought the vit c serum and eye cream and have no complaints about RADHA. Amazon shipping is the issue and they damaged the metal bottle on one, but this is a nice bottle and glass dropper. Also was very pleasantly surprised that I cannot smell it at all. Others said it was strong, but it is not. Even had others smell it and they didn&#x27;t not detect a smell. Very pleased and paid full price and am not a product tester. Nice to see a product deliver as advertised. Not seen discoloration fade, but only used it for about a week and even if it doesn&#x27;t, and I expect it will, I would still use it.</li>
            <li> Oil makes your skin feel great</li>
            <li> I had never heard of Rosehip Oil until I received a sample from Radha.  This oil is wonderful.  It goes on quickly, is not oily and does not clog my pores.  I use on my face, hands, feet and nails.  It rapidly absorbs and has given me a softer, smoother skin.  The oil mixes with their Coconut oil liquid to make lotions and I also use it to make creams.  Love, love this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for several days, and in this brutal winter, skin constantly barraged by my boyfriend&#x27;s radiator, I have already noticed a huge difference. It absorbs wonderfully, has little to no odor, and makes my skin super soft and hydrated. I am one of those people with an oily t zone, high level of sensitivity, and apparently dehydrated winter cheeks now that I&#x27;m in my thirties. No problems with breakouts or greasiness using this product. Highly recommended. Packaging is pretty to boot!</li>
            <li> I got this to use in a recipe for face serum and love it! It feels wonderful on my skin and has a pleasing mild scent.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write product reviews, but this is one of my favourite products to date! I have recently gotten into oils, and i have found this particular oil makes my skin feel so smooth and soft after i apply. My skin feels moisturized, bright and smooth! I love this stuff, and have bought this for all my friends!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I can see a smoother texture and glow after only five days. I use it morning and night and put it on after my Vit.C serum also from Radha. I will definitely continue to use both!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, lightweight, absorbs quickly, non greasy, no smell. I will purchase product again. 2nd time purchasing</li>
            <li> Amazing skin care product. Nothing has ever made my skin feel so soft and it seems to help with my acne even though I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days. I will definitely purchase this again</li>
            <li> When you used alone it does have a not so wonderful smell.  I use it at night and my husband has never said he smelled something strange.  I also have some mixed with cocnut oil.  Have been using it a couple of weeks and have already seen improvement not only in the texture of my skin but lightening of my age spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Love this Rosehip oil! I have been using it for a short while now and I must say that it has been an awesome experience. I have seen nothing but positive effects on my skin from this. My skin is smoother and clearer (I think even brighter).  I love the way it smells too. The scent helps awaken me in the mornings when I rub it over my face. I definitely would suggest that you try it because your skin will thank you for it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this. The quality is superb and the bottle is beautiful ( I am a lover of anything blue). Can&#x27;t wait to try more products from this company</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good all purpose oil for cleansing and moisturizing skin and hair.  I must say that I was quite impressed with Radha Rosehip Oil...I have used it to cleanse my face (I know adding oil sounds counter-productive, but it is actually really good for skin), used it as a cuticle oil and applied a little bit to the ends of my hair. This product is not scented and I was surprised at the huge bottle, which is a colored glass (prevents breakdown of the oil) and comes with a dropper in the lid. I would definitely order this product again:)</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it on my skin.  I felt the difference on day one and more so after 3 days.  You must try this!</li>
            <li> The subtle scent of this oil is great and I like how it makes my skin feel.  Very soft and smooth.  Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I mix it with my moisturizer with great results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this oil!  It goes on easily, has very little fragrance and does not leave me with a sticky residue.  I have been using it on my hands and it really helps moisturize my skin, even after washing my hands -which I do often.  I have very sensitive skin and I have had no problems whatsoever with this product.  :)  The 4 oz size will go a very long way since I only need a few drops to make my hands moisturized and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to my friends on Facebook as well as to my family.  I am so happy that I found out about this product!!</li>
            <li> what an amazing product, my skin feels so soft and smooth and i&#x27;ve been only using for 3days will definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this product 1 week ago and let me tell you, this is so natural. After a week I started to notice that my stretch marks on my belly has cleared a lot, also my face feels soft and tighter. I will definitely buy more of this great organic Rosehip Oil. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this oil before I wrote this review.  It&#x27;s amazing, I have very dry skin.  Radha Rosehip oil keeps my skin moist all day long.  The oil soaks into the skin, making your skin very silky smooth.  My itchy skin cleared up.  I can&#x27;t wait for winter time to see how rosehip works, winter is dry season in Florida, and dry weather is really bad for my skin.  I will add to this review later.  But for now I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I just received this oil to test out a few days ago but I am already loving it. I had been wanting to try out rosehip oil for a while because I have been hearing so many great things about it so was excited to receive this to test out and review. The product doesn&#x27;t really come with any instructions for use but they do send you an email with a PDF that contains some product information and suggested uses. I am mainly interested in using this on my face for acne scarring, skin dullness, uneven skin tone, and dryness so that is all I have been using it for these past few days. The smell of the oil is not the best but it&#x27;s not that overpowering and dissipates within a few seconds. I was worried it would linger on my face or hands but it definitely goes away as you work it in to the skin. For this product using less is definitely more. The first night I tried it I think I used too many drops and was left with an oily coating on my skin. I have had other products like that and it&#x27;s not too big of a deal because I just use it as a night time moisturizer only and give it the night to really soak into the skin. The next day I used just a drop per each area of my face (right cheek, left cheek, forehead, and nose/chin and had great results. It soaked in quickly and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all. It works great under my makeup as well. I still think I will be adding a few extra drops at night to let more sink into my skin over night. So after just a few days I am pretty impressed with this product. I have already noticed that some of my dryness is lessening and will definitely update how this product is working with me as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This oil feels good on my skin, but have not seen any result yet.  I am sure that it is good for my skin but have not used it long enough to see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Already my second order, very good quality.....has addressed my skin maladies &amp; I have recieved compliments &amp; inquiries regarding how well my skin looks (even from my daughter)!!!</li>
            <li> I was referred to this oil, and I am so glad I did purchase it, it leaves my skin so soft and smooth, it is diminishing my wrinkles at a nice rate, i feel so much better when i use this produce,  there are so many things that u can do with this product,  put a few drops on your hands and rub into your hair after shower, gets rid of Frizz among other things.  Definitely will keep purchasing this product</li>
            <li> best customer service ever, i loveee this rosehip oil my skin looks so much better it is a large amount, me and my mom being using it and she loves it we are getting more as soon as we run out, definately recommend this seller shipping was fast and the product is great.</li>
            <li> I used another brand before, but this gives you more for your money.  The quality is about the same as other brands I have used, but this bottle is much bigger for the same price.  I use the product on my face in the morning and at night.  It&#x27;s best to use after you shower so your pores absorb it better.  The only recommendation for the company would be to use a higher quality dropper.  Overall, I would highly recommend using this product!  Great value!  The company also packaged it very well so there was no chance of the bottle breaking.</li>
            <li> I put some on my face because I have have dry skin and some wrinkles.  It was very moisturizing and made my skin softer and reduced the visibilty of the wrinkles.  I love it and can&#x27;t wait to try it for other uses.  Sean was a terrific help to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Organic Rosehip Seed Oil as my only facial moisturizer for 3 years now;  My initial foray into Rosehip Seed Oil was from a different distributor that sold in chic boutiques;  I love what this product does for my dry, sensitive, aging skin! The Radha Rosehip Oil is identical in every way to the more expensive product with the exception of price.  I am so pleased to have a larger quantity, since I do use it liberally, but for less dollars per ounce than I was previously paying.  I&#x27;ve switched my brand and my loyalty to Radha.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT the REAL DEAL!!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I have super sensitive skin (I&#x27;m asian and 39 yrs old, and the last couple years trying to find anything to moisturize my skin properly without having a reaction or rash has been an expensive nightmare) I have tried pretty much every organic plant oil you can think of: argan, jojoba, coconut, kukui,  almond, squalene, primrose...the list goes on. But out of all of them, this one is the BEST. Might I add that I&#x27;ve used another brand of rose hip oil that claimed to be 100% pure but was scented with rose oil or something to make it smell pretty but wasn&#x27;t listed as an ingredient) and caused me to breakout. I&#x27;m super grateful that I found this...my skin looks years younger just from the last couple days of using it. My skin tone is more even, less inflammation,  clearing blemishes, and smoothing out any scars. Thank you Radha for offering this amazing product ♡!</li>
            <li> I have been using beauty oils for a year or two but they were all from Sephora and therefore overpriced and filled with fragrance, which is not good skincare. I started looking into better options and Rosehip Oil was one of the main things I was seeing. This oil is awesome. It leaves my skin moisturized, I have less little bumps on my face, and more evenness. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week but I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far along with the other products</li>
            <li> I have used rose hip oil from another comp.and this oil is far superior! Low odor and better quality.</li>
            <li> Love the rosehip oil, can tell already the different in my skin texture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome for my eczema and it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing serum I have ever used. It is super pure, has a delicate natural smell (no perfumes), and plumps up the skin to diminish the signs of aging. Best of all, it is so gentle and non-greasy, sinking in fully within an hour; I use it on my young children&#x27;s faces and hands as well as my own.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated without being sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> 10 star all the way,,,,,its fantastic</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I use this oil not only on my face, but all over my body.  It&#x27;s terrific and I will continue ordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this rosehip oil on my face with geranium essential oil and really like the way it absorbs quickly, leaving my face well-moisturized but not greasy.  It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but I think the appearance and health of my skin has improved since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Fast ship! Item as described! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest rose hip oil and a great price. I used it this morning on my hair which was just highlighted and it smoothed my curly hair&lt;br /&gt;out without residue. It feels wonderful on my skin also, and face. I will be ordering this from now on. Beats the price and brand of the local&lt;br /&gt;health food store</li>
            <li> I love it!  It is not super oily and my skin feels softer after I use it.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using rosehip seed oil for a couple of years now as a moisturizer and absolutely love it. All the oils that I have used have been deep golden/amber in color, including the first bottle of Radha Rosehip that I bought.  However, the bottle that I just ordered is very light and clear.  It also doesn&#x27;t have that distinct &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34; smell that rosehip seed oil has.  This oil has no smell at all actually.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s even rosehip seed oil.  If it is, it seems it has been extremely refined.  Very disappointed.  Will be returning.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> Nice moisture---recommended for aging skin</li>
            <li> I have ordered this Rosehip oil in the past and it arrived just as described - in a blue glass bottle, containing a darker colored yellow oil with a slightly nutty scent.  The oil I recently received came in a brown bottle, though it was still labeled Rosehip oil.  The oil was very light colored with no scent.  This is definitely not Rosehip oil and I&#x27;d like to warn others if they receive a light colored, basically unscented oil in a brown bottle, to just return it.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Every year I get winter eczema on my lower legs. Since using the rose-hip oil my legs are healing and I no longer have any dry areas after one week. Thank goodness for Mother Nature and your bottling this oil!</li>
            <li> ordered this by accident, but what a great mistake. it feels great on my skin and we will see what happens with these wrinkles.</li>
            <li> High quality  Rosehip oil for sure. I do a lot  of  work with essential  oils and love this!</li>
            <li> What did I do with my skin before Rosehip Oil!?  Instant moisture with each use.  I was previously using argan oil, but it was too heavy, ended up breaking me out, and I could only use it at night.  I have used rosehip oil morning and night for at least 3 months now, and I&#x27;m still not through half of the bottle.  It sinks right into my skin, and any oily or greasy residue is gone within minutes.  I have not had any problems with makeup melt if I use rosehip oil in the morning before makeup application - if anything, it just helps my makeup look fresh and dewy rather than dry and cakey.  The dropper has been great and mess free.  I also really appreciated the Radha follow up and usage tips.  For my money, this is a great value on a now must-have beauty product.</li>
            <li> I developed an allergic reaction (red blotches) after using this product on my face for a few days. Once I stopped using the oil, my symptoms cleared up. After all the great reviews about being great for sensitive skin, this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I put a little on my face before bed and my skin is completely glowing when I wake up in the morning. Also I added a few drops to my leave in conditioner and in a week I can literally see the roots of my hair thicken! please don&#x27;t ever change the formula of the product because you&#x27;ve struck gold with this one!</li>
            <li> Not actually &amp;#34;certified organic&amp;#34; Rosehip Seed Oil. The oil is clear with no aroma, and does not retain any characteristics of pure unrefined rosehip seed oil.  It is either refined beyond recognition or not actually rosehip seed oil, which should have a mild woody scent and a rich amber color. Its a waste of money. It might as well be mineral oil. I am returning the product because I do not know what I am actually putting on my skin.</li>
            <li> Read online on a blog about young woman with adult acne and nothing worked.  Ditto for me, had it since I was young.  Nothing has ever worked -dermatologists, creams, pills, lotions, make up, cleansers, toner, etc.  They talked about using oil with different percentages of ingredients.  Rosehip was one mentioned.  Never heard of it.  Tried it now for almost a week and love it.  Still working on healing my acne but so far no new acne developments which is a miracle.  The value is good for bottle size.  I like the eye dropper because oil is runny and I&#x27;m able with the dropper to use as little or as much as possible at a time.  The packaging on this was also very well done.  Wrapped up with care, which was good because it it a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;good quality, loved, used in all my lotions, happy happy &amp;#34;, I&#x27;m used for my dry fees , my acne scarfs, and my stretch marks, just add a few drops in all my lotions and my hair masks, loved...</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! Wonder moisterizer for the skin.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer, I use it mostly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;As a 50+ man I look for products that are natural feeling and work to easy the  aging on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it to on hands</li>
            <li> When I got the oil I was excited to try something so inventive. I really liked the bottle. It&#x27;s simple and clear on what the product is. I have been using it for the past week. I love it! It&#x27;s even started to get rid of my scars that I have had since I was a little kid. Thank you so much for this! I would recommend it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin is silky soft, radiant and gives my skin a subtle look plus it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily.  It helps to heal my eczema too! I cant believe it. I would recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this product for free so I can try it out.  I have used it for about a week now and it makes my skin softer I have seen some change as far as wrinkles go I am still going to continue to use it .</li>
            <li> I received this oil in good condition and properly packaged.  The bottle was bigger than I expected, and it came with a regular screw on lid, and a glass dropper as well.  Since receiving this product, I have used a few drops after cleansing and toning my skin, and it seems to be helping to fade some of my scars left from acne.  It has a nice, light texture, that does not feel too greasy when applied to skin.  I did some research on rosehip oil, and its said to be best known for its anti-aging properties, so I plan to concoct an oil cleanser using this oil along with some others to achieve the youthful, dewy skin I so admire.  I did receive this oil at a promotional discount price, but I would definitely pay full price for it, as it can also be used on one&#x27;s hair and scalp to alleviate dandruff as well! Overall great product in nice packaging!</li>
            <li> I received this Rosehip oil with a coupon from the company for being a trusted tester.  This oil is AMAZING!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and my skin is softer and more radiant than ever. I love the way it feels and that it is fragrance free♡</li>
            <li> I received this oil on time.  I was having a dry skin scaly  breakout on my right palm, so I applied the Radha rose hip oil last night. OMG  When I looked at my palm this morning the healing process has started, my dry skin is totally healed on the palm area and two fingers and the other three fingers are almost healed.  Thank you Radha for your miracle oil in a bottle. I love Rosehip oil!</li>
            <li> This is a big bottle and I am impressed by how it makes my skin feel.  It does not have a smell to it and it goes on very light.  You have to let it sink in to your skin before applying makeup a bit, but I am pleased with it.  I like the fact that it is good for my skin and not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the fake reviews fool you, this stuff is garbage.</li>
            <li> Such a great product! I use it on my face every night and my skin has become so soft, smooth and radiant! I know many people under value Certified Organic products, but when looking for oils it&#x27;s is so important to buy organic.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many moisterizers hoping to get the effect I got with just one use of Rosehip. Love it so much and wish I knew of it 10 years ago!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Heals scars, rejuvenates your skin just as advertised. I wholly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of rosehip oil. From my experience, I don&#x27;t think that this product is rosehip oil, never. This product has a very light color and doesn&#x27;t have the unique smell of rosehip oil, which some people wouldn&#x27;t like. Unfortunately it&#x27;s too late for me to return, but I would never buy this one again.  Good lesson learned.</li>
            <li> It does not work well on my skin.  I did not like because I did not see results on my face</li>
            <li> As always amazing stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for about a week so I might be a bit early on the review.  But...so far, it seems to work quite well.  I was amazed by the previous reviews and ordered a bottle for myself and another for my mom.  I&#x27;ve got an irritating condition around my nose and around my scalp line that becomes inflamed and flaky.  This oil seems to help keep it under control.  As I&#x27;ve said, it might be a bit early to tell, so once I&#x27;ve used it for awhile, I&#x27;ll come back and update my experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great product and works as it says it does.  I really love this company and will continue to use their products.  I am a very happy customer. The product also arrived early! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Thank you! Excellent communication, excellent product</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Really quick delivery. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I read lot of review and got confused at first, after I using different rosehip oil and ask someone who using more time now I find out. It maybe not a true but base on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Some people said dark color with fishy smell is real rosehip oil but I beleive that is rancid.&lt;br /&gt;It is not matter of company it is matter of what rosehip oil(rancid or fresh)you received. So good luck.&lt;br /&gt;Left one is light color with nutty smell( this company) - no problem&lt;br /&gt;Rigth one is dark color with fishy smell( other company) - my skin turn red on chick and forehead and little itcy.</li>
            <li> This oil is great! It smells wonderful. I put it on skin (elbow and knees) and hair right after I take a shower. It also absorbs super fast.</li>
            <li> I started using this oil on my elbows, since I was scared i might have a bad reaction, turns out i didn&#x27;t and it has made my elbows really soft. My elbows used to be dry and now they&#x27;re not. I use this product on my face and It makes my skin feel smoother and some acne scars seem to be fading. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Nice smooth and order free. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great for sensitive skin, Leaves my feet super soft. Just an overall great product!</li>
            <li> Very nice oil, leaves my skin hydrated and glowing.</li>
            <li> I am loving this Rosehip Oil from Radha. I already own two other brands but this is by far my favorite. I&#x27;m sure it all depends on your preference and what you will be using it for. I have one brand that the oil is very thin which is good for your face and for the other, the scent is too strong, This brand has no smell at all and if there is, it&#x27;s extremely light. The oil itself has a nice thickness to it, I use it for my knees and ankles so I really love how it moisturizes the really dry and flaky areas of my skin. I try to use it after every shower while my skin is still damp. This way the oil is absorbed into the skin better. I received this bottle for free as a sample to test and offer my honest and unbiased opinion. I absolutely love it! I only wish I took before and after photos since my knees were really dry, flaky, and the skin was really broken. It&#x27;s almost a week now and my knees are healed and almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> Really making a difference, feeling softer and healthier</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage daughter!&lt;br /&gt;She has minor acne but every spot leaves a dark mark on her skin.&lt;br /&gt;So far Rosehip Oil has done an amazing job fading those dark marks......&lt;br /&gt;....but it usually reeks!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was not expecting this product to be any different and have to say how wrong I was!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes there is a little smell to it, but nowhere close to other brands I have purchased so far!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very light and reminds me of soap. We already tried it out and it fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Not that you really notice it to begin with!&lt;br /&gt;I am positively surprised by this product and so is my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;We found a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and packing great!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it only 2 weeks, too soon to see major changes but, it feels great in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This oil absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling. My skin feels very soft and I am starting to see changes&lt;br /&gt;in the area around my nose that was extremely dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Great light oil but very moisturizing, saw noticeable reductions in fine lines around my eyes. This bottle will last a long time too.</li>
            <li> Organic Rosehip Oil from Radha Beauty Products is just splendid. I have used the product since it arrived (08/08/2014) and am able to provide the following review: I developed a heat rash on my neck and used the oil to test it out. By morning, the rash was gone and my skin clear. No more itching, no more redness! I&#x27;ve also used the oil on my elbows, knees, and hands before bed, waking up to softer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and unassuming, the texture is also light, delicate. I am using it on a few scars to see if their appearance is reduced and will report back in a few weeks with an updated report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is really nice and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what else it can do! Thank you, Radha Beauty Products!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how soft it makes my skin when I mix it with my moisturizer. It is a bit too oily for my skin when I use it by itself. I was hoping to see a more dramatic difference in my redness, but all in all, it seems great. It will last me FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil, just use a few drops each time and massage onto face and body.</li>
            <li> The rose hip oil is terrific, and I really like that it is organic and cold-pressed.  It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, smells nice.  Moreover, the company -- Radha -- does a GREAT job of customer service!  They really, REALLY want customer feedback, which is a sure sign of a company that cares about their products and their customers.  They send you a PDF of ways to use the oil when you buy it (via email), which is above and beyond expectations.  Also, the product was well packaged when shipped.  The biggest surprise was the size of the bottle -- I was envisioning a small bottle, like tinctures come it, but this bottle is positively HUGE!  I will be patronizing this company for a long time.  It is clear that they really care about me and their products.</li>
            <li> Lovely product. I use it daily on my face. I will order again, and again. On my second bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer.  This is the first time I have purchased a product numerous times. I have just purchased my 4th bottle, and it will not be my last.  A good product which does what it promises.  The scent is not perfumed, but I don&#x27;t find it objectionable at all.  more like smelling damp earth.</li>
            <li> It is great!!  Love it. Skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> Felt like I had an oil slick on my face, never absorbed and didn&#x27;t do anything. All these great reviews just want the free stuff the company is offering for a positive review.</li>
            <li> I knew nothing about this oil when I received it. I thought it would have a beautiful rose smell... Haha but I&#x27;m not completely disappointed! This has been great for my skin! Especially since I been at the pool and beach a lot this summer. I even use it on my daughter because it doesn&#x27;t leave our skin greasy! The bottle was also huge. Didn&#x27;t expect that</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the size of this bottle. I love knowing it is organic and 100% single-source origin. It is a light, easily and quickly absorbed oil. I am excited to add this to my oil regimen. It isn&#x27;t as fragrant as I expected (I have rose water toner, so I was assuming it would smell similar) but it is still a great product. I look forward to see its results and try more products in the Radha line.</li>
            <li> excellent product I am so happy with the result.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, it seems to do everything it is supposed to do. I&#x27;ve used for about three weeks and where I had rough parts on my forehead are now smooth, it absorbs into your skin well and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
            <li> Feels great on your skin. It&#x27;s not greasy feeling at all. Awesome substitute for chemical filled moisturizers. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of oil. I have ordered from a different manufacturer and the quality just wasn&#x27;t there in the two orders I had made. In fact, the last order I received smelled like rotting mushrooms. But this brand, this brand is great (so far). It barely has any smell which is the way it should be. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for rosehip hip oil,and I have been using this for a week and it feels adequate for my extremely dry skin. It is not greasy thankfully since it is a dry oil. Scent is almost non existent. The only con in my opinion is the applicator I feel as I waste product because it just flows right through the applicator and there&#x27;s not much control over how many drops you can squeeze it just comes flowing it out the tube. Other than that the product lives up to its standards.</li>
            <li> This seems like a really nice product. I have a few spots of eczema on my arms and forehead which seem to be showing some improvement after a few applications. I tried using it after the hyralonic acid serum but it got very oily. That said, it makes my face soft as silk. I&#x27;m happy with the quality &amp; price of this oil.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used rosehip oil, and I really like it so far.  I&#x27;m applying it to my face to help smooth my skin and soothe rosacea.  I still have about the same amount of redness, but it does not cause further irritation.  I love the smooth feel and fast absorption.  It only takes a few drops, which is great to have a big bottle that will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and since stopping nursing in January have had issues with acne on my face. After using this product for a little over a month in combination with a liquid exfoliant, I have seen a significant improvement in the appearance of my skin both in terms of occurrence of new blemishes and the diminishing of acne scars.  Its a bit to heavy to wear during the day under make-up (likely due to my oily skin), but I love it as an overnight moisturizer and it is now part of my nightly routine.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a really great product. I have been searching for a rosehip seed oil product and this one seems to meet my expectations. I have been using it for about a week now on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank Sean, a very friendly and helpful Rhada Beauty Products customer service rep, who answered my questions about the product.</li>
            <li> Great results so far! I&#x27;ve only been using it for no more than a week or two and have received compliments on my skin. I have old and new facial acne scars and I definitely see them getting better. No new breakouts either so far. Will keep using for sure!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil!!!  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and already I have noticed an improvement with my eczema. I only wish I had discovered this oil earlier.</li>
            <li> Love it, very soothing on my face &amp; hands, fragrance isn&#x27;t great but I knew to expect that, nice amber color, like it should be! Came quickly and packaged well!</li>
            <li> This is a miracle oil. I&#x27;ve used it twice a day on my face since I&#x27;ve received it and my face has never looked or felt so healthy and glowing. Very, very happy with Radha Beauty products.</li>
            <li> this oil left my face with a lovely rosey glow and ive been getting complements on how healthy my skin looks.  very comparable to argon oil!  Thumbs up</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff!!!!! ;)</li>
            <li> made me break out. and i usually use oils on my face. nowhere on the bottle does it say organic by the way. no official stamps of purity from what i can see.</li>
            <li> In love with the rosehip oil. Will definitely keep using. Thank you Radha!</li>
            <li> A+++++ Great seller. Great product..</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in the smell. I didn&#x27;t think about the smell of a natural product. Other than that, I love this oil.</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh. Beautifully packaged. Shipped quickly. Will order again when I need it</li>
            <li> Amazing product, the beauty secret all the big corps don&#x27;t want u to know about, it really does work, unbelevable</li>
            <li> Only 3 days and I can tell an amazing difference of the texture and tone of my face, neck and chest!</li>
            <li> I love the oil! As other reviewers have indicated, I put it on before bed and my skin feels amazing in the morning.  I suffer from mild acne as an adult and it does not cause any breakouts.  I will definitely continue to use and reoder when I run our&#x27;/</li>
            <li> Great product. Luv it. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Just a little confused since everyone is talking about the color &amp; smell of their oil - mine basically had NO scent &amp; was almost clear in color, much like the refined/processed oil you would buy in the store. I thought I was was purchasing an unrefined rosehip seed oil. Also, my skin seems to be having a terrible reaction to this oil.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the product. I no longer have dry &amp; flaky areas on my face. My skin feels completely moisturized without being greasy &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to absorb. The only thing that I&#x27;d change is the dropper, it tends to drip/leak out but with that being said, I still wouldn&#x27;t take off a star rating for that because the product itself is awesome. I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Nothing has changed for me yet</li>
            <li> surprise! It makes me bright!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product on my face for a few days, and only applying it at night. However, I love the feel of my skin when I wake up in the morning. Even during this short time, my old blemish scars are appearing lighter than usual. I will very likely start using it in the daytime as well, when my day cream runs out. I appreciate the generously sized bottle the oil comes in, and especially that it&#x27;s  organic. Feels nice on my hands too!</li>
            <li> I use this oil for a week and already noticed difference like it said in the description:  Improves skin&lt;br /&gt; Moisturizes and heals dry, flaky and rough skin&lt;br /&gt; Soothing of Itchy Dry Skin&lt;br /&gt; Treats fine lines and wrinkles  I liked it a lot and will buy again. I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the blue bottle color it said it was but other than that item is as described</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly and great customer service. I hope it does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It keeps my face nice and smooth, not too oily either!  I use it everyday to help decrease my lines.  Great value too!</li>
            <li> wonderful scent and texture, absorbs nicely</li>
            <li> Foremost: Thanks to all the bloggers/reviewers for putting me on to this game changing oil. My face looks less like aged leather and noticeably healthier. I&#x27;d shower in this stuff or drizzle it on salad if they&#x27;d let me (Disclaimer: Don&#x27;t do that last bit before checking in with authorities). No, they didn&#x27;t pay me for this review...at least not yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Experience: Three 2 days and 2nights now of dousing my face with this stuff and not a breakout in sight NOR that pre-breakout nerve pinging tenderness that usually accompanies ever other oil. I&#x27;ve tried black soap, jojoba, castor, grapeseed, coconut, tea tree and just about every other nut oil but my own. I&#x27;m the grown man begrudgingly cringing like a pre-teen from cheek kisses and other such close encounters with my face because in a mere two hours a reaction is prone to erupt. Unfortunately, age hasn&#x27;t tampered feisty breakouts and my dried out skin after this MA winter was in a state of emergency. In a things-can&#x27;t-get-any-worst act of desperation I recently both three new products--witch hazel, a well reviewed lotion, and the as pictured RRO. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just Radha or simply rosehip oil; however, hence forth I&#x27;ll be putting this *ish on everything!</li>
            <li> Love this oil!  I&#x27;ve never used an oil on my face, so I can&#x27;t compare to others but my experience with this product has been exceptional.  I have very dry skin so I use it morning and night - I rub a few drops into my face and forehead before makeup and after washing my face at night.  It&#x27;s hard to explain, but it never feels greasy and yet I can tell it&#x27;s there.  It just makes my skin very soft and has completely taken care of the dryness.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a week but I expect it to continue to work great.</li>
            <li> A very nice product.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> nothing so far but I will continue to use it as it takes time as with all products.</li>
            <li> Not oily on your face. A little goes a long way so a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This oil is great. I had cataract surgery and a rash and breaking out on my face from the eye meds I used for a month. Therosehip oil really helped. Phyllis in Virginia</li>
