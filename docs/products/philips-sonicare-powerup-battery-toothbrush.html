            <li>But it cleans great!</li>
            <li>This does perfectly at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are real happy with our Oralb products but figured for the price we&#x27;d like to give the Sonicare a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For all this, I deduct one star from an otherwise top-notch product.  </li>

            <li>We have been using a plug-in unit for years that we have been very happy with, but it does not lend itself to tavel.</li>

            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li>So that was nice to hear!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased MANY battery operated toothbrushes for my family and, in my opinion, this one is the best of</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easily the best toothbrush I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily the best inexpensive powered toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s a good toothbrush for that price range.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t even as good as one of the inexpensive ones you can buy at the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good look and works well.</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and battery life is good in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Thought this would be a good travel brush.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works, and gives your teeth a good cleaning and does a good job getting between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>3 Stars for good cleaning.</li>
            <li>The price is good and the product is holding up well.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is good for the price.</li>
            <li>Good for traveling.</li>
            <li>The placement of the on/off switch is good.</li>
            <li>So i must be one of the \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; ones with good genes in that regard.</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t that good even as a battery toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The best.very good</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with the cleaning power of the brush--as with the Sonicare DiamondClean</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll find that either are great for cleaning your teeth, certainly better than using a manual.  </li>
            <li>For now, I am very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>After using the Phillips Sonicare Powerup Battery  Powered Toothbrush for a year, I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Amazing value for the price.  </li>
            <li>This Powerup model is sort of the \\&quot;which one does not belong\\&quot; product in the lineup of amazing, but somewhat costly Sonicare electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Great tooth brush--easy to use; comfortable in the mouth; no problems.  </li>
            <li>Yes this is nice if you want to throw the toothbrush in your luggage before going on a trip.</li>
            <li>I also liked the fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting it in a charger.</li>
            <li>But I suggest saving your money and buying a nice Sonicare toothbrush instead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two minute timer is a nice touch as well.</li>
            <li>I use good rechargeable in it, and still get more than a month on a charge.</li>
            <li>This is really the best toothbrush out there.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li>(\\&quot;unpleasant\\&quot; is too kind a word to describe what that feels and sounds like).</li>
            <li>not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does have some nice features - the bristles fade to let you know when you need to replace the head</li>
            <li>I bought one at Sam&#x27;s Club and liked it</li>
            <li>This is a nice power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice version of an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s superior to the Oral-B battery toothbrushes for sure.</li>
            <li>So I was delighted when my son informed me that the Philips toothbrush was \\&quot;fun\\&quot; to use and did a good job of making his mouth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Baby is very good, I like very much.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that my dentist recommended a high quality electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>For a new product, it should be in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Very happy with my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It does feel good in my hand and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The batteries that come with the brush are very good or the brush is very power efficient.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t have the money for fancier models and I honestly feel this brush did a great cleaning job at a very reasonable price point.</li>
            <li>Good cheap sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I think the importance of brushing and flossing is extremely important to good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>Good one and worthly!</li>
            <li>Perfect training and better form for the young ones to learn.</li>
            <li>In general they are excellent.</li>
            <li>Sonicare used to make an E series AA battery toothbrush that was a real, full fledged Sonicare</li>
            <li>will say that my teeth feel smooth, clean &amp; great after using this</li>
            <li>Still, it is probably adequate for a good teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare toothbrush I have at home</li>
            <li>love the product..recommended by my dentist</li>
            <li>I love that it turns off automatically after two minutes too.</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicares for many years.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>To sums things up, better dental checkups and my kids look forward to brushing their teeth, we bought them for all of our kids.</li>
            <li>, the cost is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to receive this one for free in exchange for my honest review, so I thought I couldn&#x27;t lose by trying another model.</li>
            <li>But if I had batteries I&#x27;d use it more than my manual brush.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better for my teeth</li>
            <li>Phillips Sonicare HX3631/02 Power up Battery Toothbrush is an okay electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It might not be 60-dollar-clean but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference.</li>
            <li>A $3 drugstore electric toothbrush would do a better job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it..</li>
            <li>Like most of these type brushes it has a two minute timer and turns off at that point.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I had the opportunity to try this one out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My kids love it even though it, &amp;#34;vibrates your head off&amp;#34;  we will have to say what the dentist says in another 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Yeah it goes at like a bazillion miles per hour, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do better than anything else on the market regardless of price.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I get one every time I go to the dentist, and my teeth are healthy, so I never saw the need to step up.</li>
            <li>has worked just as well for me as the top of the line Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I think the cleaning factor from this out-of-place Sonicare is better than manual brushing, but I would recommend the Sonicare Essence model over this.  </li>
            <li>The Essence cost more, but not a fortune, maybe $80 or so.  </li>
            <li>I have had better powered toothbrushes than this--</li>
            <li>Just OK in my book!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is really good and useful.</li>
            <li>Works much better than the colgate optic one I have been using</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>For only $15 this is a great buy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also of the \\&quot;rare breed\\&quot; that enjoys going to the dentist and having my teeth cleaned because i love how they feel after a good dental exam.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;spin&#x27; movement, just side to side, but I like this toothbrush OK.</li>
            <li>It cleans ok, but the head is way too slim for something like that.    </li>
            <li>Nice look, comfortable feel, quality construction; I like the automatic two minute timer.</li>
            <li>It is a quite nice tool for use which make me clean my tootch every day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice to have a AA-battery powered electric toothbrush for travel, because it&#x27;s cheap to lose and easy to get batteries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had pretty good teeth according to my dentist.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be great for travel and would live up to the Sonicare name.  </li>
            <li>Many reviews said it&#x27;s &amp;#34;not quite as good as a real Sonicare&amp;#34;-</li>
            <li>Thanks fast ship &amp; excellent work.</li>
            <li>teeth are clean!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this toothbrush, but it does clean well!</li>
            <li>I feel clean!</li>
            <li>A friend of mine had purchased one of the high end rechargeable Sonicare models and i always liked using it when i visited as i had purchased my own \\&quot;diamond clean\\&quot; model head</li>
            <li>Much more comfortable to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received as described, fast shipping, good price.</li>
            <li>Mostly, I find them to be very useful when travelling.</li>
            <li>Value above price , good !</li>
            <li>Easy to take with you when traveling.  </li>
            <li>batteries were easy to install.</li>
            <li>B00DS0KP2C Philips Sonicare Hx3631/02 Powerup Battery Toothbrush]] is easy to use, though it did take a couple of days of practice to learn to manipulate the brush around my mouth without banging my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I use a rechargeable at home, but find the charger to be a hassle on longer trips, so this is an easy, inexpensive, convenient solution.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the battery cover is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>The vibration is too strong and I am concerned it could crack a tooth.</li>
            <li>There is some merit in this claim; it IS a strong vibration.</li>
            <li>Given the opportunity to review this, I agreed for no other reason than to satisfy my curiosity (and at a sub-$20 price point, it&#x27;s an attractive \\&quot;try</li>
            <li>It vibrates at a really high speed and does a good job of cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if you are not 100% satisfied we&#x27;ll give you a full refund.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>model comes with a nice easy grip body, safe on the teeth bristles and it&#x27;s ready to go when its out of the package (make sure the batteries are fresh).  </li>
            <li>The product is fine but beware.</li>
            <li>Works just fine its a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Comparing this price to some higher priced versions, this is definitely the best bang for your buck--all the benefit of Sonicare, without the Sonicare</li>
            <li>This is definitely better than the super cheap ones from WalMart.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s the primary purpose that I can see.  </li>
            <li>This is a regular battery operated (2 AAs, included) brush, which is great for some uses.  </li>
            <li>This runs like what it is, a cheap knock off</li>
            <li>It does a great, sonic cleaning for a low price.  </li>
            <li>Now i have tried many different battery-powered toothbrushes folks and the Oral-B was quite good considering there \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; brush heads seem to focus on each tooth separately.</li>
            <li>It feels a lot different than the high end Sonicare products (vibration wise), but I did not get good life out of those.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful...</li>
            <li>My teeth are smooth and clean feeling after every brushing.</li>
            <li>Understanding there is a significant difference in price points, I didn&#x27;t expect the level of the Elite, but this brush isn&#x27;t even close.</li>
            <li>To compare it against $65 toothbrushes is foolish and pointless, because it is far-and-away the best bang-for-buck toothbrush you can buy.</li>
            <li>my teeth felt extremely clean after each brushing and the feeling lasted all day.</li>
            <li>They efficiently clean your teeth, and they massage your gums.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this until I upgrade to a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Sonicare, I&#x27;m just surprised that a company that makes such an excellent product would put their name on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this brush makes my mouth feel so clean</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how clean my teeth look and feel.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this item..</li>
            <li>At first I was really freaked out about keeping them clean, so I&#x27;m happy to say that this electric toothbrush works much, MUCH better than my regular manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My gums don&#x27;t get quite the massage that a more powerful sonic care provides, but this is still way better than a manual toothbrush or an old style electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing compared to my old manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>And unlike my old Sonicare, it feels like a really nice massage on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>, the movement would stop (even with full charge, of course).</li>
            <li>Kind of loud.</li>
            <li>Really cleaned my teeth, just love it.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>The Spinbrush was able to clean them out decently.    </li>
            <li>And i&#x27;m telling everyone right now how important that is to getting rid of a myriad of oral hygiene issues.</li>
            <li>how well you clean them - there is just so much spit and toothpaste you can clean off!  </li>
            <li>Not as great as the other ones in the Phillips</li>
            <li>it is a good toothbrush, but spend a little more for a rechargable one.</li>
            <li>It does clean my teeth better than my brush, but my brush doesn&#x27;t need new batteries every couple of weeks</li>
            <li>The first couple days it was fine.</li>
            <li>this Sonicare does the job adequately.  </li>
            <li>and it did an amazing job cleanings his teeth, and later that evening we realized that women can have a fantastic experience as well........</li>
            <li>One word caution, compared to my older electric toothbrush, this one has more power.  </li>
            <li>it took one use of this model to quickly understand why some people don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Tremendous bargain</li>
            <li>When in reality it&#x27;s probably THE BEST battery operated brush to hit the market at least right now.</li>
            <li>However, the instructions state to hold the brush lightly against your teeth, and if you do this the brush cleans very effectively without being too harsh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light, even with the batteries</li>
            <li>and we as parents have the [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean +</li>
            <li>Purchased this for an extensive European trip KNOWING that it would be great because my daily Philips Sonicare Elite is great.</li>
            <li>They are considered disposable and at this price point, I&#x27;m sure lots of people just buy new ones when the batteries die even though they are replaceable - as are the heads.</li>
            <li>and there is absolutely zero staining on the ligatures (I was told that color stains easily).</li>
            <li>The batteries do ok but the ones it came with burned out pretty fast.</li>
            <li>The movement seems quite powerful and adequate.</li>
            <li>My brushing regimen is to manual brush in the morning, and use the Sonicare at night (after flossing first, of course!).  </li>
            <li>teeth feel clean, no chargers to mess with, and fairly inexpensive not a bad deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth were.</li>
            <li>The brush has only one setting (unlike my Sonicare DiamondClean, which has five), and switches off on its own after two minutes of use if you do not shut it off</li>
            <li>This brush, however, is 1/10 the price of that deluxe model (but doesn&#x27;t come with a case and two brush heads and such fanciness).&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, recommended.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s worth it, I can take or leave it...</li>
            <li>Know it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The one drawback would be that I also brush my tongue, but even with the toothbrush turned off, I don&#x27;t feel as effective in that area, because of the smaller head.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s powerful.  </li>
            <li>This kind, that takes AA batteries, lasts longer than the regular Sonicare toothbrushes</li>
            <li>It is a double cheesburger deluxe toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It easily turns back on and easily shuts off with a push of the button.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as their other powered toothbrushes (their rechargeable models come to mind)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly surprised there aren&#x27;t more five star reviews, but like I said I haven&#x27;t compared this to any of the higher dollar ones.</li>
            <li>The handle is ergonomic and not hard to use, and battery is still fine after a month of use.</li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d love it, but every time I&#x27;d barely touch my teeth with it</li>
            <li>People with smaller mouth, like children, can&#x27;t really use this effectively</li>
            <li>I will say, however, that if you are still using a manual brush and looking for something better without having to drop of lot of money, this might be a decent \\&quot;tweener\\&quot; brush until your ready for the real thing.</li>
            <li>I had to be very gentle so that my head didn&#x27;t shake.</li>
            <li>I like this tooth brush very much.</li>
            <li>Thank you  very much.</li>
            <li>But other than that this toothbrush gives a much better cleaning than a cheap spinbrush.</li>
            <li>How many different ways can a toothbrush vibrate?</li>
            <li>This is my first time use electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It takes two AA batteries, and I just changed them for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>got one of these brushes as a stocking stuffer for Christmas, and I&#x27;m pretty impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I give it a much higher rating if it weren&#x27;t for the design.</li>
            <li>Perhaps to initiate someone to using a non-manual brush for the first time?  </li>
            <li>Of course the fact that the entire top and sides of the head are exposed plastic is</li>
            <li>for durability --- I was pretty worried when I opened up the battery compartment and parts</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li>comfortable but sounds loudly</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist was blown away when I came in for my first appointment after picking up a sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This thing really goes!</li>
            <li>The brush action is much slower and not as strong.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s ready use right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think the amount of hard vibration (not at all like the smooth vibration from the real Sonicare products) is good for your teeth.</li>
            <li>While this works better than a manual toothbrush, I fail to see why this model should be more appealing to consumers than the classic rechargeable version.</li>
            <li>Good Value for the price and in my opinion works as effectively, if not better, that their higher priced rechargeable model.</li>
            <li>hoping to see a positive difference.</li>
            <li>Much, much better than manual brushing by a long shot.</li>
            <li>I actually like the simplicity of the design--one button, easy grip handle, medium-size brush head, everything pretty much as it should be.</li>
            <li>However, i must say i&#x27;ve also been very particular in taking care of my teeth considering</li>
            <li>I love that I can run my tongue across my teeth when I&#x27;m done and feel the smooth clean that I&#x27;ve never experienced before.  </li>
            <li>However, after years of trying just about every other kind of toothbrush out there and not receiving the same clean feeling I got from my Sonicare, I decided to try Sonicare again.</li>
            <li>just fine, even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it takes little getting used to, but once you do, it cleans teeth rather nicely.</li>
            <li>The brushing action really works the gums and leaves a fresh tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>Still, I can&#x27;t believe how much you&#x27;re getting for $15.00.</li>
            <li>I would call the sound level moderate.</li>
            <li>dont have time to keep checking that getting ready for the job..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years, and after reading the reviews on this one I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>One final note, some people may assume that reviews in exchange for free products are favorably biased.</li>
            <li>The Philips toothbrush has the power needed to thoroughly scrub your teeth, though not so much as to damage.</li>
            <li>then this one will surprise you by how fast the brushes</li>
            <li>it is  NOTHING like a real Sonicare.</li>
            <li>2 min timer  really helps me.</li>
            <li>It sounds like a weedeater and shakes and rattles your whole head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do yourself a favor, invest in a real Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Though this has a much lower price tag initally, a very simple calculation of cost of batteries over the lifetime for this model makes it far more costly in terms of dollars and, of course, environmental impact.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably give up on it soon and go back to use my sonicare advanced brush.</li>
            <li>The brush head moves much slower, and it is quite noisy by comparison.</li>
            <li>So you have to \\&quot;wield\\&quot; it more carefully.  </li>
            <li>also found that the toothbrush attachment itself was shorter than on the Sonicare brush I use at home, which was not as comfortable while brushing in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While, the unit costs about 50% more than low-end electric toothbrushes available at my local box store, those did not come with the money back guarantee that Phillips offers for this brush - \\&quot;Use SonicCare PowerUp for 90 days</li>
            <li>Do you really want to have to continue to buy batteries for this device?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am a bit paranoid about using an electric brush at all, let alone one that has so much vibration.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;~vibration is extremely fast...</li>
            <li>It really bugs me too.  </li>
            <li>You really, really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really a mistake for Phillips to put the Sonicare label on it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I would much prefer to spend $15 on one of these once a year than have a $200 toothbrush that recharges</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is cleaning so much as resetting your teeth in your jaw.</li>
            <li>I would also like to note that my brush head doesn&#x27;t fit properly onto my brush.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, or for some reason need a product that is more quiet, I would skip this model and pony up for the DiamondClean brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always needed a soft toothbrush, but the standard head that comes with this is fine and the difference in my teeth is remarkable - much cleaner with far less work.  </li>
            <li>brushing action of this brush is good, better than manual brushing, which is oh so difficult.  </li>
            <li>It does not get teeth as clean - especially near the gum line - as a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I was particularly interested in this toothbrush because the instructions said it was safe to use with braces, and I wanted to give it to my teenage son who currently has braces.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare toothbrush cleans my teeth better than ANY other toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, manual, electric or battery.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re only affecting a small space at a time therefore adding more time to the brushing to make sure you get every tooth.</li>
            <li>This product is OK for the $15 price point, competing with the other inexpensive motorized toothbrushes in that range.</li>
            <li>As long as it works, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Both styles seem to clean just fine, so not sure which is better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>brush works well and my teeth are brushed better than with my regular brush though the vibration was sometimes too much for me...</li>
            <li>The product works with normal toothpastes and really gives one a well-scrubbed feeling.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t expect the same performance out of these that you get out of the full featured plug-in units.</li>
            <li>I also discovered this is not safe to use if you have any kind of cut in your mouth</li>
            <li>One was fine, the second one was completely opened.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, those who are used to the higher-priced Sonicare toothbrushes probably will have a lot of gripes about this one, but it is also worth pointing out that my dentist has been trying to get me to switch to Sonicare for years, and the high price (at the time, mostly at least $100) has been enough of a deterrent for me not to do it.  </li>
            <li>Good quality and the brush is not too soft or hard.</li>
            <li>Most of the time there is a large drop in brush power after the first few brushes while this one is pretty constant.    </li>
            <li>Price point is decent.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is adequate for occasional use, and I prefer it to the comparable Oral-B (rotating) battery operated model.</li>
            <li>And I particularly like the built in timer, which keeps me \\&quot;honest\\&quot; - no skimping on the time as I might otherwise</li>
            <li>Rechargeable batteries (not included) seem to last more than a month with 2 regular users.</li>
            <li>I have a more expensive Sonicare that has more brushing options and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I know that there are many that are much more expensive; perhaps I will try one sometime.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as a regular electric and if you used it full time it would ultimately cost more to use than an initially more expensive rechargeable model.  </li>
            <li>If they made a version of this brush with a wider head with some sort of rubber on the back and a little less vibration strength, it would probably be a perfect brush.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to see how long a new set of fresh batteries can survive, but I can imagine having to change batteries maybe 5-6 times during the year.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend spending a little more money and buying one of the lower end sonicare toothbrushes with a rechargable battery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing, too, because this brush is only marginally better than a manual toothbrush and can hardly be recommended for anyone other than a manual toothbrush devotee who needs to improve their oral hygiene but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li>You will note other reviewers found the vibration too strong.</li>
            <li>I will admit that the battery operated toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have the same feel or amount of power that the more expensive rechargeable toothbrushes have, but it is still stronger than a manual toothbrush or the spinbrush, which one reviewer compared it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Powerup, my teeth feel really clean and plaque free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having spent most of my life with a manual toothbrush, I have to digress for a moment on the Sonicare generally.  </li>
            <li>if this in normal or</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good travel toothbrush, but I&#x27;m really not happy with it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been curious if a Sonicare is right for you but haven&#x27;t been willing to make a $100 gamble to try it, I&#x27;d say give this model a shot.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how this compares to other electric toothbrushes, because this is the only one I&#x27;ve liked enough to consistently use.</li>
            <li>When my 12 year old Sonicare Elite finally bit the dust, I bought the power up as a quick replacement.</li>
            <li>only thing that bothered me about this toothbrush (which is probably why it works so well) is that it really rattles my teeth -- much more than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>However it does clean my teeth very well, even better than the expensive sonicare brushes I used to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the battery operated tooth brush business</li>
            <li>I have never had a toothbrush that exceeds 10 dollars before, closest I have had is a Spinbrush, which will soon by sidelined to make way for this new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It runs for quite awhile on one set of new batteries.  </li>
            <li>But the recommendation is to always use new alkalines.</li>
            <li>And just like I had planned it, the new one shuts itself off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I forced myself to use it for a couple months because I&#x27;m a cheap guy, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>The only knock that I would give is that you will need extra AA batteries available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the both rechargeable Sonicares and the replaceable battery Extreme Sonicare, this new product doesn&#x27;t compare to them at all, it feels more like a generic brand electric toothbrush than a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s priced (just under $20 at this time) much higher than similar brushes.</li>
            <li>It runs automatically for 2 minutes, and I have learned that I had been brushing my teeth far shorter than 2 minutes!</li>
            <li>Just had a dental cleaning and my dentist said my gums look really healthy - and that&#x27;s a rarity for me as I have always had problems with them in the past.</li>
            <li>for a two-pack), and the brush will automatically power off about two minutes (2:05, to be exact, and yes I timed it several times) to let you know you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>The vibration of this model is a lot more than the Essence models that I usually buy.  </li>
            <li>is a little to strong.</li>
            <li>A minor annoyance really, but a beep or something certainly would suffice to let you know that you&#x27;re reached the &amp;#34;acceptable level&amp;#34; of tooth cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a GREAT tongue cleaner as well always remember folks to clean your tongue even if you gag a bit doesn&#x27;t matter your scraping off all the bad icky junk in your mouth that just stays there even though your teeth are clean.</li>
            <li>it vibrates, but is very weak and still requires a fair amount of manual brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This model&#x27;s brush does not come with a brush head cover, which is weird, but I just put a manual travel toothbrush cover over it, and it fit fine.  </li>
            <li>I believed that many of the bad reviews were from many people who were expecting a $200 brush for $15 and shrugged it off.</li>
            <li>Some may think the battery version doesn&#x27;t compare to the wall plug versions, but, to me, if it were any more powerful I&#x27;d find it uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to someone who really wants a Sonicare toothbrush but can&#x27;t afford the pricy ones.</li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t find the unit too loud, although if you use it at 6:50 am like</li>
            <li>Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]] ($100).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and loudly it sounds like my husband is shaving when he uses it.</li>
            <li>Having owned several different powered toothbrushes, I expected a lot more from Sonicare than this.</li>
            <li>far as my results go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I doubt that anything will completely eliminate it, but it no longer smells like something crawled into my mouth and died while I was sleeping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charging unit plugs directly into your wall socket.</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering one from Phillips directly to get what I wanted..HX 3300.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if Sonicare offers refills in the compact size.  </li>
            <li>The price wasn&#x27;t marked on either, so I don&#x27;t know what the refills cost.oday and the replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li>The price wasn&#x27;t marked on either, so I don&#x27;t know what the refills cost.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to this sort of thing, then it might be a deal-breaker for you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely water-proof, so never worry about the battery.</li>
            <li>I fixed it, but it will fall out every time I change batteries.</li>
            <li>There really should have been some sort of rubber object along the back.</li>
            <li>The whole family has one and our dentist noticed at our next checkups.</li>
            <li>I was really irritated, and went online to buy a different brand of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>However, with a few days of practice, the only part that ever touches my teeth any more is the brush.  </li>
            <li>The only thing you should note is that it is kind of big relative to other electric toothbrushes in its class.  </li>
            <li>Let me say up-front that this is my first time using anything other than your garden-variety normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But the main reason I decided to try this electric toothbrush, is that I recently became an adult first-time-braces-wearer.</li>
            <li>Basically wasted the purchase price and never got to find out if the thing would actually clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not something that particularly bothers me, and my rating reflects my basic indifference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Blue or Orange are exactly the same just a matter of color - if color is no issue for you go for price.</li>
            <li>Actually, I think one could get some good use out of this as a cleaning device, maybe on tile grout or hard to reach places around your kitchen and bathroom sinks and faucets.</li>
            <li>But really, this one is for travel or being without electricity for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>I am convinced that the price difference will quickly pay for itself over buying these little batteries.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush Sonic which has rubber bumpers on the side of the large brush head for the same price as this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super rough sounding and super hard vibrating both in your hand and in your mouth.</li>
            <li>only using it about 10 times, the bristles are changing color like it needs a new head</li>
            <li>It is unlike any of the other higher end models of Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>If you have horizontal electrical sockets (next to each other instead of one on top of the other)</li>
            <li>, I have used in the past so am familiar with the brand and style.</li>
            <li>Consider how much you&#x27;ve spent on toothbrushes in the last 12 years and it suddenly becomes reasonable.</li>
            <li>The vibrations are a little too powerful at times.</li>
            <li>The head is large and the action is up and down</li>
            <li>You really are better off buckling down and buying a serious rechargeable toothbrush and just staying away from this thing.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find anything better that uses only a battery and is so simple to travel with.</li>
            <li>Honestly to those folks, all i can say is how hard are you pressing down when using this brush...?</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it is wishful thinking or not, but it seems that my teeth seem slicker after using this brush versus my old standard one.</li>
            <li>But after several months&#x27; brushing, I noticed that it may be causing some swelling of my gum near the teeth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s loud, and is an instant headache for me.</li>
            <li>I came to it with very low expectations, and have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I came to it with very low expectations, and have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I then attempted to insert the batteries, and found the metal piece that the batteries rest on was bent over double, and fell out completely.</li>
            <li>I am barely even putting the brush against my teeth.    </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t nearly as nice as my wife&#x27;s expensive rechargeable model.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s adequate for a trip if you don&#x27;t want to worry about carrying the charger or needing electrical adapters, but I&#x27;m sticking with the regular model for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to other powered brushes that apparently use a higher frequency, but my engineering background told me the frequency was too low the moment I put it in my mouth -</li>
            <li>Why did I wait so long to get a new one?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first \\&quot;powered\\&quot; toothbrush I have tried, so I don&#x27;t know if the experience would be the same with other types or brands.</li>
            <li>a whole other issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just beware that you&#x27;ll need to be more careful with this brush, to not let the hard plastic head touch your teeth while you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li>You really need to open your mouth wide to avoid these contacts</li>
            <li>It vibrates so hard that it gave me a headache, and the entire time I used it my teeth never felt clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first set of batteries seem to last for about 6 weeks, perhaps a little longer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a power toothbrush for a reason folks so you DON&#x27;T have to exert any extra pressure i would be willing to bet that&#x27;s why a lot of folks are giving this new brush such negative reviews.</li>
            <li>The back of the brush has no rubber coating on it, so I often found the bare plastic bumping into the teeth opposite where I was cleaning</li>
            <li>This is not as small as some of the electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve seen, but it is much more narrow than a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>(I had a nearly-healed small bite mark on the inside of my lip that this thing ripped right open with no pressure exerted in the direction of the cut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find this one at such a low price, and was worried that it might not clean like my old one did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth noting that the complaints about noise and teeth being rattled by hard plastic are quite valid.  </li>
            <li>9 out of 10 times the reason folks have bad breath even though there teeth are white is because there NOT brushing there tongues good enough or even at all.</li>

            <li> This is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am happy that I have buy it.</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with it.pretty worried, based on the reviews</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> The fact that I can travel with it is great.</li>
            <li> For someone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend $100 on a toothbrush this is a great option.</li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> So that was nice to hear!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased MANY battery operated toothbrushes for my family and, in my opinion, this one is the best of</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easily the best toothbrush I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily the best inexpensive powered toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s a good toothbrush for that price range.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t even as good as one of the inexpensive ones you can buy at the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good look and works well.</li>
            <li> I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and battery life is good in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a good travel brush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works, and gives your teeth a good cleaning and does a good job getting between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 3 Stars for good cleaning.</li>
            <li> The price is good and the product is holding up well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Good for traveling.</li>
            <li> The placement of the on/off switch is good.</li>
            <li> So i must be one of the \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; ones with good genes in that regard.</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t that good even as a battery toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The best.very good</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the cleaning power of the brush--as with the Sonicare DiamondClean</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll find that either are great for cleaning your teeth, certainly better than using a manual.  </li>
            <li> For now, I am very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> After using the Phillips Sonicare Powerup Battery  Powered Toothbrush for a year, I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Amazing value for the price.  </li>
            <li> This Powerup model is sort of the \\&quot;which one does not belong\\&quot; product in the lineup of amazing, but somewhat costly Sonicare electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Great tooth brush--easy to use; comfortable in the mouth; no problems.  </li>
            <li> Yes this is nice if you want to throw the toothbrush in your luggage before going on a trip.</li>
            <li> I also liked the fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting it in a charger.</li>
            <li> But I suggest saving your money and buying a nice Sonicare toothbrush instead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two minute timer is a nice touch as well.</li>
            <li> I use good rechargeable in it, and still get more than a month on a charge.</li>
            <li> This is really the best toothbrush out there.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li> (\\&quot;unpleasant\\&quot; is too kind a word to describe what that feels and sounds like).</li>
            <li> not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does have some nice features - the bristles fade to let you know when you need to replace the head</li>
            <li> I bought one at Sam&#x27;s Club and liked it</li>
            <li> This is a nice power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice version of an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s superior to the Oral-B battery toothbrushes for sure.</li>
            <li> So I was delighted when my son informed me that the Philips toothbrush was \\&quot;fun\\&quot; to use and did a good job of making his mouth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Baby is very good, I like very much.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that my dentist recommended a high quality electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> For a new product, it should be in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It does feel good in my hand and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The batteries that come with the brush are very good or the brush is very power efficient.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have the money for fancier models and I honestly feel this brush did a great cleaning job at a very reasonable price point.</li>
            <li> Good cheap sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I think the importance of brushing and flossing is extremely important to good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Good one and worthly!</li>
            <li> Perfect training and better form for the young ones to learn.</li>
            <li> In general they are excellent.</li>
            <li> Sonicare used to make an E series AA battery toothbrush that was a real, full fledged Sonicare</li>
            <li> will say that my teeth feel smooth, clean &amp; great after using this</li>
            <li> Still, it is probably adequate for a good teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush I have at home</li>
            <li> love the product..recommended by my dentist</li>
            <li> I love that it turns off automatically after two minutes too.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicares for many years.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> To sums things up, better dental checkups and my kids look forward to brushing their teeth, we bought them for all of our kids.</li>
            <li> , the cost is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to receive this one for free in exchange for my honest review, so I thought I couldn&#x27;t lose by trying another model.</li>
            <li> But if I had batteries I&#x27;d use it more than my manual brush.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better for my teeth</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare HX3631/02 Power up Battery Toothbrush is an okay electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It might not be 60-dollar-clean but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> A $3 drugstore electric toothbrush would do a better job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it..</li>
            <li> Like most of these type brushes it has a two minute timer and turns off at that point.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I had the opportunity to try this one out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My kids love it even though it, &amp;#34;vibrates your head off&amp;#34;  we will have to say what the dentist says in another 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Yeah it goes at like a bazillion miles per hour, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do better than anything else on the market regardless of price.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I get one every time I go to the dentist, and my teeth are healthy, so I never saw the need to step up.</li>
            <li> has worked just as well for me as the top of the line Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I think the cleaning factor from this out-of-place Sonicare is better than manual brushing, but I would recommend the Sonicare Essence model over this.  </li>
            <li> The Essence cost more, but not a fortune, maybe $80 or so.  </li>
            <li> I have had better powered toothbrushes than this--</li>
            <li> Just OK in my book!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is really good and useful.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the colgate optic one I have been using</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> For only $15 this is a great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also of the \\&quot;rare breed\\&quot; that enjoys going to the dentist and having my teeth cleaned because i love how they feel after a good dental exam.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;spin&#x27; movement, just side to side, but I like this toothbrush OK.</li>
            <li> It cleans ok, but the head is way too slim for something like that.    </li>
            <li> Nice look, comfortable feel, quality construction; I like the automatic two minute timer.</li>
            <li> It is a quite nice tool for use which make me clean my tootch every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to have a AA-battery powered electric toothbrush for travel, because it&#x27;s cheap to lose and easy to get batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had pretty good teeth according to my dentist.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be great for travel and would live up to the Sonicare name.  </li>
            <li> Many reviews said it&#x27;s &amp;#34;not quite as good as a real Sonicare&amp;#34;-</li>
            <li> Thanks fast ship &amp; excellent work.</li>
            <li> teeth are clean!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this toothbrush, but it does clean well!</li>
            <li> I feel clean!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had purchased one of the high end rechargeable Sonicare models and i always liked using it when i visited as i had purchased my own \\&quot;diamond clean\\&quot; model head</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received as described, fast shipping, good price.</li>
            <li> Mostly, I find them to be very useful when travelling.</li>
            <li> Value above price , good !</li>
            <li> Easy to take with you when traveling.  </li>
            <li> batteries were easy to install.</li>
            <li> B00DS0KP2C Philips Sonicare Hx3631/02 Powerup Battery Toothbrush]] is easy to use, though it did take a couple of days of practice to learn to manipulate the brush around my mouth without banging my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I use a rechargeable at home, but find the charger to be a hassle on longer trips, so this is an easy, inexpensive, convenient solution.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the battery cover is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> The vibration is too strong and I am concerned it could crack a tooth.</li>
            <li> There is some merit in this claim; it IS a strong vibration.</li>
            <li> Given the opportunity to review this, I agreed for no other reason than to satisfy my curiosity (and at a sub-$20 price point, it&#x27;s an attractive \\&quot;try</li>
            <li> It vibrates at a really high speed and does a good job of cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if you are not 100% satisfied we&#x27;ll give you a full refund.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> model comes with a nice easy grip body, safe on the teeth bristles and it&#x27;s ready to go when its out of the package (make sure the batteries are fresh).  </li>
            <li> The product is fine but beware.</li>
            <li> Works just fine its a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Comparing this price to some higher priced versions, this is definitely the best bang for your buck--all the benefit of Sonicare, without the Sonicare</li>
            <li> This is definitely better than the super cheap ones from WalMart.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s the primary purpose that I can see.  </li>
            <li> This is a regular battery operated (2 AAs, included) brush, which is great for some uses.  </li>
            <li> This runs like what it is, a cheap knock off</li>
            <li> It does a great, sonic cleaning for a low price.  </li>
            <li> Now i have tried many different battery-powered toothbrushes folks and the Oral-B was quite good considering there \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; brush heads seem to focus on each tooth separately.</li>
            <li> It feels a lot different than the high end Sonicare products (vibration wise), but I did not get good life out of those.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful...</li>
            <li> My teeth are smooth and clean feeling after every brushing.</li>
            <li> Understanding there is a significant difference in price points, I didn&#x27;t expect the level of the Elite, but this brush isn&#x27;t even close.</li>
            <li> To compare it against $65 toothbrushes is foolish and pointless, because it is far-and-away the best bang-for-buck toothbrush you can buy.</li>
            <li> my teeth felt extremely clean after each brushing and the feeling lasted all day.</li>
            <li> They efficiently clean your teeth, and they massage your gums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this until I upgrade to a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Sonicare, I&#x27;m just surprised that a company that makes such an excellent product would put their name on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this brush makes my mouth feel so clean</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how clean my teeth look and feel.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this item..</li>
            <li> At first I was really freaked out about keeping them clean, so I&#x27;m happy to say that this electric toothbrush works much, MUCH better than my regular manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My gums don&#x27;t get quite the massage that a more powerful sonic care provides, but this is still way better than a manual toothbrush or an old style electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing compared to my old manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> And unlike my old Sonicare, it feels like a really nice massage on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> , the movement would stop (even with full charge, of course).</li>
            <li> Kind of loud.</li>
            <li> Really cleaned my teeth, just love it.</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush was able to clean them out decently.    </li>
            <li> And i&#x27;m telling everyone right now how important that is to getting rid of a myriad of oral hygiene issues.</li>
            <li> how well you clean them - there is just so much spit and toothpaste you can clean off!  </li>
            <li> Not as great as the other ones in the Phillips</li>
            <li> it is a good toothbrush, but spend a little more for a rechargable one.</li>
            <li> It does clean my teeth better than my brush, but my brush doesn&#x27;t need new batteries every couple of weeks</li>
            <li> The first couple days it was fine.</li>
            <li> this Sonicare does the job adequately.  </li>
            <li> and it did an amazing job cleanings his teeth, and later that evening we realized that women can have a fantastic experience as well........</li>
            <li> One word caution, compared to my older electric toothbrush, this one has more power.  </li>
            <li> it took one use of this model to quickly understand why some people don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Tremendous bargain</li>
            <li> When in reality it&#x27;s probably THE BEST battery operated brush to hit the market at least right now.</li>
            <li> However, the instructions state to hold the brush lightly against your teeth, and if you do this the brush cleans very effectively without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light, even with the batteries</li>
            <li> and we as parents have the [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean +</li>
            <li> Purchased this for an extensive European trip KNOWING that it would be great because my daily Philips Sonicare Elite is great.</li>
            <li> They are considered disposable and at this price point, I&#x27;m sure lots of people just buy new ones when the batteries die even though they are replaceable - as are the heads.</li>
            <li> and there is absolutely zero staining on the ligatures (I was told that color stains easily).</li>
            <li> The batteries do ok but the ones it came with burned out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The movement seems quite powerful and adequate.</li>
            <li> My brushing regimen is to manual brush in the morning, and use the Sonicare at night (after flossing first, of course!).  </li>
            <li> teeth feel clean, no chargers to mess with, and fairly inexpensive not a bad deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth were.</li>
            <li> The brush has only one setting (unlike my Sonicare DiamondClean, which has five), and switches off on its own after two minutes of use if you do not shut it off</li>
            <li> This brush, however, is 1/10 the price of that deluxe model (but doesn&#x27;t come with a case and two brush heads and such fanciness).&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, recommended.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s worth it, I can take or leave it...</li>
            <li> Know it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The one drawback would be that I also brush my tongue, but even with the toothbrush turned off, I don&#x27;t feel as effective in that area, because of the smaller head.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s powerful.  </li>
            <li> This kind, that takes AA batteries, lasts longer than the regular Sonicare toothbrushes</li>
            <li> It is a double cheesburger deluxe toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It easily turns back on and easily shuts off with a push of the button.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as their other powered toothbrushes (their rechargeable models come to mind)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly surprised there aren&#x27;t more five star reviews, but like I said I haven&#x27;t compared this to any of the higher dollar ones.</li>
            <li> The handle is ergonomic and not hard to use, and battery is still fine after a month of use.</li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;d love it, but every time I&#x27;d barely touch my teeth with it</li>
            <li> People with smaller mouth, like children, can&#x27;t really use this effectively</li>
            <li> I will say, however, that if you are still using a manual brush and looking for something better without having to drop of lot of money, this might be a decent \\&quot;tweener\\&quot; brush until your ready for the real thing.</li>
            <li> I had to be very gentle so that my head didn&#x27;t shake.</li>
            <li> I like this tooth brush very much.</li>
            <li> Thank you  very much.</li>
            <li> But other than that this toothbrush gives a much better cleaning than a cheap spinbrush.</li>
            <li> How many different ways can a toothbrush vibrate?</li>
            <li> This is my first time use electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It takes two AA batteries, and I just changed them for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> got one of these brushes as a stocking stuffer for Christmas, and I&#x27;m pretty impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I give it a much higher rating if it weren&#x27;t for the design.</li>
            <li> Perhaps to initiate someone to using a non-manual brush for the first time?  </li>
            <li> Of course the fact that the entire top and sides of the head are exposed plastic is</li>
            <li> for durability --- I was pretty worried when I opened up the battery compartment and parts</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> comfortable but sounds loudly</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist was blown away when I came in for my first appointment after picking up a sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This thing really goes!</li>
            <li> The brush action is much slower and not as strong.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s ready use right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think the amount of hard vibration (not at all like the smooth vibration from the real Sonicare products) is good for your teeth.</li>
            <li> While this works better than a manual toothbrush, I fail to see why this model should be more appealing to consumers than the classic rechargeable version.</li>
            <li> Good Value for the price and in my opinion works as effectively, if not better, that their higher priced rechargeable model.</li>
            <li> hoping to see a positive difference.</li>
            <li> Much, much better than manual brushing by a long shot.</li>
            <li> I actually like the simplicity of the design--one button, easy grip handle, medium-size brush head, everything pretty much as it should be.</li>
            <li> However, i must say i&#x27;ve also been very particular in taking care of my teeth considering</li>
            <li> I love that I can run my tongue across my teeth when I&#x27;m done and feel the smooth clean that I&#x27;ve never experienced before.  </li>
            <li> However, after years of trying just about every other kind of toothbrush out there and not receiving the same clean feeling I got from my Sonicare, I decided to try Sonicare again.</li>
            <li> just fine, even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it takes little getting used to, but once you do, it cleans teeth rather nicely.</li>
            <li> The brushing action really works the gums and leaves a fresh tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> Still, I can&#x27;t believe how much you&#x27;re getting for $15.00.</li>
            <li> I would call the sound level moderate.</li>
            <li> dont have time to keep checking that getting ready for the job..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years, and after reading the reviews on this one I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> One final note, some people may assume that reviews in exchange for free products are favorably biased.</li>
            <li> The Philips toothbrush has the power needed to thoroughly scrub your teeth, though not so much as to damage.</li>
            <li> then this one will surprise you by how fast the brushes</li>
            <li> it is  NOTHING like a real Sonicare.</li>
            <li> 2 min timer  really helps me.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a weedeater and shakes and rattles your whole head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do yourself a favor, invest in a real Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Though this has a much lower price tag initally, a very simple calculation of cost of batteries over the lifetime for this model makes it far more costly in terms of dollars and, of course, environmental impact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably give up on it soon and go back to use my sonicare advanced brush.</li>
            <li> The brush head moves much slower, and it is quite noisy by comparison.</li>
            <li> So you have to \\&quot;wield\\&quot; it more carefully.  </li>
            <li> also found that the toothbrush attachment itself was shorter than on the Sonicare brush I use at home, which was not as comfortable while brushing in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While, the unit costs about 50% more than low-end electric toothbrushes available at my local box store, those did not come with the money back guarantee that Phillips offers for this brush - \\&quot;Use SonicCare PowerUp for 90 days</li>
            <li> Do you really want to have to continue to buy batteries for this device?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am a bit paranoid about using an electric brush at all, let alone one that has so much vibration.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;~vibration is extremely fast...</li>
            <li> It really bugs me too.  </li>
            <li> You really, really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really a mistake for Phillips to put the Sonicare label on it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I would much prefer to spend $15 on one of these once a year than have a $200 toothbrush that recharges</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is cleaning so much as resetting your teeth in your jaw.</li>
            <li> I would also like to note that my brush head doesn&#x27;t fit properly onto my brush.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, or for some reason need a product that is more quiet, I would skip this model and pony up for the DiamondClean brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always needed a soft toothbrush, but the standard head that comes with this is fine and the difference in my teeth is remarkable - much cleaner with far less work.  </li>
            <li> brushing action of this brush is good, better than manual brushing, which is oh so difficult.  </li>
            <li> It does not get teeth as clean - especially near the gum line - as a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was particularly interested in this toothbrush because the instructions said it was safe to use with braces, and I wanted to give it to my teenage son who currently has braces.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare toothbrush cleans my teeth better than ANY other toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, manual, electric or battery.  </li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re only affecting a small space at a time therefore adding more time to the brushing to make sure you get every tooth.</li>
            <li> This product is OK for the $15 price point, competing with the other inexpensive motorized toothbrushes in that range.</li>
            <li> As long as it works, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Both styles seem to clean just fine, so not sure which is better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> brush works well and my teeth are brushed better than with my regular brush though the vibration was sometimes too much for me...</li>
            <li> The product works with normal toothpastes and really gives one a well-scrubbed feeling.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect the same performance out of these that you get out of the full featured plug-in units.</li>
            <li> I also discovered this is not safe to use if you have any kind of cut in your mouth</li>
            <li> One was fine, the second one was completely opened.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, those who are used to the higher-priced Sonicare toothbrushes probably will have a lot of gripes about this one, but it is also worth pointing out that my dentist has been trying to get me to switch to Sonicare for years, and the high price (at the time, mostly at least $100) has been enough of a deterrent for me not to do it.  </li>
            <li> Good quality and the brush is not too soft or hard.</li>
            <li> Most of the time there is a large drop in brush power after the first few brushes while this one is pretty constant.    </li>
            <li> Price point is decent.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is adequate for occasional use, and I prefer it to the comparable Oral-B (rotating) battery operated model.</li>
            <li> And I particularly like the built in timer, which keeps me \\&quot;honest\\&quot; - no skimping on the time as I might otherwise</li>
            <li> Rechargeable batteries (not included) seem to last more than a month with 2 regular users.</li>
            <li> I have a more expensive Sonicare that has more brushing options and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I know that there are many that are much more expensive; perhaps I will try one sometime.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as a regular electric and if you used it full time it would ultimately cost more to use than an initially more expensive rechargeable model.  </li>
            <li> If they made a version of this brush with a wider head with some sort of rubber on the back and a little less vibration strength, it would probably be a perfect brush.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be interested to see how long a new set of fresh batteries can survive, but I can imagine having to change batteries maybe 5-6 times during the year.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend spending a little more money and buying one of the lower end sonicare toothbrushes with a rechargable battery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing, too, because this brush is only marginally better than a manual toothbrush and can hardly be recommended for anyone other than a manual toothbrush devotee who needs to improve their oral hygiene but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> You will note other reviewers found the vibration too strong.</li>
            <li> I will admit that the battery operated toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have the same feel or amount of power that the more expensive rechargeable toothbrushes have, but it is still stronger than a manual toothbrush or the spinbrush, which one reviewer compared it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Powerup, my teeth feel really clean and plaque free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having spent most of my life with a manual toothbrush, I have to digress for a moment on the Sonicare generally.  </li>
            <li> if this in normal or</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good travel toothbrush, but I&#x27;m really not happy with it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been curious if a Sonicare is right for you but haven&#x27;t been willing to make a $100 gamble to try it, I&#x27;d say give this model a shot.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how this compares to other electric toothbrushes, because this is the only one I&#x27;ve liked enough to consistently use.</li>
            <li> When my 12 year old Sonicare Elite finally bit the dust, I bought the power up as a quick replacement.</li>
            <li> only thing that bothered me about this toothbrush (which is probably why it works so well) is that it really rattles my teeth -- much more than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> However it does clean my teeth very well, even better than the expensive sonicare brushes I used to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the battery operated tooth brush business</li>
            <li> I have never had a toothbrush that exceeds 10 dollars before, closest I have had is a Spinbrush, which will soon by sidelined to make way for this new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It runs for quite awhile on one set of new batteries.  </li>
            <li> But the recommendation is to always use new alkalines.</li>
            <li> And just like I had planned it, the new one shuts itself off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I forced myself to use it for a couple months because I&#x27;m a cheap guy, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> The only knock that I would give is that you will need extra AA batteries available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the both rechargeable Sonicares and the replaceable battery Extreme Sonicare, this new product doesn&#x27;t compare to them at all, it feels more like a generic brand electric toothbrush than a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s priced (just under $20 at this time) much higher than similar brushes.</li>
            <li> It runs automatically for 2 minutes, and I have learned that I had been brushing my teeth far shorter than 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> Just had a dental cleaning and my dentist said my gums look really healthy - and that&#x27;s a rarity for me as I have always had problems with them in the past.</li>
            <li> for a two-pack), and the brush will automatically power off about two minutes (2:05, to be exact, and yes I timed it several times) to let you know you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> The vibration of this model is a lot more than the Essence models that I usually buy.  </li>
            <li> is a little to strong.</li>
            <li> A minor annoyance really, but a beep or something certainly would suffice to let you know that you&#x27;re reached the &amp;#34;acceptable level&amp;#34; of tooth cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a GREAT tongue cleaner as well always remember folks to clean your tongue even if you gag a bit doesn&#x27;t matter your scraping off all the bad icky junk in your mouth that just stays there even though your teeth are clean.</li>
            <li> it vibrates, but is very weak and still requires a fair amount of manual brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model&#x27;s brush does not come with a brush head cover, which is weird, but I just put a manual travel toothbrush cover over it, and it fit fine.  </li>
            <li> I believed that many of the bad reviews were from many people who were expecting a $200 brush for $15 and shrugged it off.</li>
            <li> Some may think the battery version doesn&#x27;t compare to the wall plug versions, but, to me, if it were any more powerful I&#x27;d find it uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to someone who really wants a Sonicare toothbrush but can&#x27;t afford the pricy ones.</li>
            <li> : I don&#x27;t find the unit too loud, although if you use it at 6:50 am like</li>
            <li> Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]] ($100).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and loudly it sounds like my husband is shaving when he uses it.</li>
            <li> Having owned several different powered toothbrushes, I expected a lot more from Sonicare than this.</li>
            <li> far as my results go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I doubt that anything will completely eliminate it, but it no longer smells like something crawled into my mouth and died while I was sleeping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charging unit plugs directly into your wall socket.</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering one from Phillips directly to get what I wanted..HX 3300.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Sonicare offers refills in the compact size.  </li>
            <li> The price wasn&#x27;t marked on either, so I don&#x27;t know what the refills cost.oday and the replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> The price wasn&#x27;t marked on either, so I don&#x27;t know what the refills cost.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to this sort of thing, then it might be a deal-breaker for you.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely water-proof, so never worry about the battery.</li>
            <li> I fixed it, but it will fall out every time I change batteries.</li>
            <li> There really should have been some sort of rubber object along the back.</li>
            <li> The whole family has one and our dentist noticed at our next checkups.</li>
            <li> I was really irritated, and went online to buy a different brand of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> However, with a few days of practice, the only part that ever touches my teeth any more is the brush.  </li>
            <li> The only thing you should note is that it is kind of big relative to other electric toothbrushes in its class.  </li>
            <li> Let me say up-front that this is my first time using anything other than your garden-variety normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But the main reason I decided to try this electric toothbrush, is that I recently became an adult first-time-braces-wearer.</li>
            <li> Basically wasted the purchase price and never got to find out if the thing would actually clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something that particularly bothers me, and my rating reflects my basic indifference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Blue or Orange are exactly the same just a matter of color - if color is no issue for you go for price.</li>
            <li> Actually, I think one could get some good use out of this as a cleaning device, maybe on tile grout or hard to reach places around your kitchen and bathroom sinks and faucets.</li>
            <li> But really, this one is for travel or being without electricity for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that the price difference will quickly pay for itself over buying these little batteries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush Sonic which has rubber bumpers on the side of the large brush head for the same price as this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super rough sounding and super hard vibrating both in your hand and in your mouth.</li>
            <li> only using it about 10 times, the bristles are changing color like it needs a new head</li>
            <li> It is unlike any of the other higher end models of Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> If you have horizontal electrical sockets (next to each other instead of one on top of the other)</li>
            <li> , I have used in the past so am familiar with the brand and style.</li>
            <li> Consider how much you&#x27;ve spent on toothbrushes in the last 12 years and it suddenly becomes reasonable.</li>
            <li> The vibrations are a little too powerful at times.</li>
            <li> The head is large and the action is up and down</li>
            <li> You really are better off buckling down and buying a serious rechargeable toothbrush and just staying away from this thing.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find anything better that uses only a battery and is so simple to travel with.</li>
            <li> Honestly to those folks, all i can say is how hard are you pressing down when using this brush...?</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it is wishful thinking or not, but it seems that my teeth seem slicker after using this brush versus my old standard one.</li>
            <li> But after several months&#x27; brushing, I noticed that it may be causing some swelling of my gum near the teeth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s loud, and is an instant headache for me.</li>
            <li> I came to it with very low expectations, and have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I came to it with very low expectations, and have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I then attempted to insert the batteries, and found the metal piece that the batteries rest on was bent over double, and fell out completely.</li>
            <li> I am barely even putting the brush against my teeth.    </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t nearly as nice as my wife&#x27;s expensive rechargeable model.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s adequate for a trip if you don&#x27;t want to worry about carrying the charger or needing electrical adapters, but I&#x27;m sticking with the regular model for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other powered brushes that apparently use a higher frequency, but my engineering background told me the frequency was too low the moment I put it in my mouth -</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to get a new one?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first \\&quot;powered\\&quot; toothbrush I have tried, so I don&#x27;t know if the experience would be the same with other types or brands.</li>
            <li> a whole other issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just beware that you&#x27;ll need to be more careful with this brush, to not let the hard plastic head touch your teeth while you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li> You really need to open your mouth wide to avoid these contacts</li>
            <li> It vibrates so hard that it gave me a headache, and the entire time I used it my teeth never felt clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first set of batteries seem to last for about 6 weeks, perhaps a little longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a power toothbrush for a reason folks so you DON&#x27;T have to exert any extra pressure i would be willing to bet that&#x27;s why a lot of folks are giving this new brush such negative reviews.</li>
            <li> The back of the brush has no rubber coating on it, so I often found the bare plastic bumping into the teeth opposite where I was cleaning</li>
            <li> This is not as small as some of the electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve seen, but it is much more narrow than a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> (I had a nearly-healed small bite mark on the inside of my lip that this thing ripped right open with no pressure exerted in the direction of the cut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find this one at such a low price, and was worried that it might not clean like my old one did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is worth noting that the complaints about noise and teeth being rattled by hard plastic are quite valid.  </li>
            <li> 9 out of 10 times the reason folks have bad breath even though there teeth are white is because there NOT brushing there tongues good enough or even at all.</li>
            <li> It vibrates hard enough on a fresh battery that the hard plastic side (opposite the brush) can really rattle your teeth if it impacts them.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no guessing about whether or not I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth long enough.  </li>
            <li> The Essence charge should last about two weeks, but when they get older, after a few years, the charge doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> The brush movements are harsh and decidedly not subtle.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the issue, it&#x27;s the fact that for some people the brush head is too small and there is no rubber on the sides or top of the brush head which causes the very small brush head to constantly bump up against your teeth, hence the vibration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, whenever the head (not the brush part, but the hard plastic) touched my teeth, it literally felt like a jack hammer in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much when I got this toothbrush in the mail, especially after using the very pricey Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush, which I rated five stars and can&#x27;t afford to continue using (refills are expensive).</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve tried using the $5 battery gizmos that can be found at Walmart &#x3D; really bad&lt;br /&gt;Today, my kids all use the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> how long they will last.  </li>
            <li> Power toothbrushes have come a long way since the ones I used as a child back in the 60s/70s.  </li>
            <li> They just aren&#x27;t engineered to last very long.</li>
            <li> Work well and last for very long time before changing battery</li>
            <li> One issue I had with previous rechargeable toothbrushes was finding a place for the stand near a plugin.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, and I expected better of Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Compared to my Spinbrush Pro Clean, it&#x27;s a lot harder to reach the smaller areas because of the Philip&#x27;s thin head.</li>
            <li> This feels quite different, rough and vibrates differently.  </li>
            <li> So I tried to carefully keep my mouth open enough so that I would not do that.</li>
            <li> When I first used a Sonicare toothbrush many years ago, I hated it because it felt like my entire skull was vibrating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of scary to try to get into hard to reach spots as it&#x27;s possible that the brush is going to vibration the heck out of your tooth if it touches it with the back.</li>
            <li> First off, I had to train myself to angle it in the proper position so that it wouldn&#x27;t rattle against my teeth (not a pleasant feeling).</li>
            <li> It definitely gets my teeth clean, but is just too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This all said, i wanted something exactly like the cleaning tool they use during my check-ups but on a daily basis or at the very least something close to it.</li>
            <li> Some of my teeth became sensitive after using this one, even though I was careful to apply as little pressure as possible.</li>
            <li> But that is a minor thing.</li>
            <li> Long ago I bought an electric toothbrush from one of the tv shopping channels.</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of Sonicare toothbrushes, which I have been using for about 18 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;~the brush part itself is about a kids size, not adult--</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, you can put run down batteries in it and it will still work until the batteries are totally gone, at which point it just stops.  </li>
            <li> The negative reviews on this product are plentiful and scathing, but for the most part, I have been pleasantly surprised by the overall performance of this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite carrying the Sonicare moniker, my expectations for this device were not very high.</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple of weeks, it works well overall, when compared to other battery toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The battery has lasted and it feels cleaner than a regular toothbrush, however I use an Oral-B for years and the round brush is much smaller than the oval Sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li> However it did not live up to the Sonicare name.  </li>
            <li> I know what Santa is putting in every single Christmas stocking at Grandma&#x27;s house</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, you have to be careful not to touch the back of the brush head against your teeth...</li>
            <li> Toothbrush works well and was almost half the price of the big retail chain.  </li>
            <li> In other words, sort of a limited use.  </li>
            <li> For the sake of expediency, it is yet to be determined, and there are no more indications of how long batteries last when you use them (say six minutes a day) from the product description, nor</li>
            <li> But no, they were only gone after using this brush a few times.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the OralB, but that&#x27;s not really relevant.  </li>
            <li> I intensely disliked it, for several reasons.</li>
            <li> brush also seems to vibrate in a wide area - eyeballing it, it seems to be 130-140% the still brush head&#x27;s coverage.</li>
            <li> Not smooth like my last Sonicare.</li>
            <li> perfect，and not very expensive。</li>
            <li> Everything is just so rough.</li>
            <li> I prefer softer bristles -- these were just too rough.</li>
            <li> but we don&#x27;t have enough \\&quot;dental promotion\\&quot; of brushing the tongue everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always taken care of oral hygiene, but there is really no substitute for a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Eventually after using it for almost two weeks now, my teeth feel really sore and it keeps getting worse each time I use this brush.</li>
            <li> Rather than being forced to use the old fashioned non-powered toothbrushes, we&#x27;ve been using Arm &amp; Hammer battery operated units that work anywhere with 2 AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see the many annoying quirks this brush has.    </li>
            <li> the small metal clip-on that the negative and positive heads of the battery touch, keeps moving out of place</li>
            <li> But if you look at my review history you will see that I, like other Vine reviewers call it like I see it.</li>
            <li> Stick with the Extreme if you want a replaceable battery Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Sticks out and blocks the other socket</li>
            <li> I let the reviewing deadline on this product pass by quite a bit, because of concerns I had about its durability, among other things.  </li>
            <li> The biggest difference, other than battery cost, is the &amp;#34;violence&amp;#34; of the vibration.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is only the seller I got them from, or if it is all of them.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that can vibrates sometimes off of my teeth at certain angles which is a little uncomfortable, but overall I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I almost worried about it hitting hard enough to break my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I too assumed that whoever mentioned &amp;#34;it rattled my brain&amp;#34; was simply brushing too hard, quite the contrary.</li>
            <li> Actually hurts my teeth if I happen to bump them with the hard plastic frame of the bristles.</li>
            <li> The entire stem up to the brush vibrates, so if you let it touch your teeth (hard to avoid)</li>
            <li> What a surprise; this is not worth $2.00.</li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> If and when this one gives up the ghost, I probably will consider investing the extra money for at least this one feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I get my bottom teeth too close while brushing my top teeth, or vise-versa, the hard side of the toothbush head buzzes painfully on the other teeth.</li>
            <li> only (slight) negative is that it is battery powered.</li>
            <li> Now I simply/gently move it up and down and let the brush do all the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to recommend this for travelers, students and those who don&#x27;t want to throw down money on a rechargeable electric toothbrush set.  </li>
            <li> I also like that the toothbrush automatically shuts down after two minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li> It vibrates and if you accidentally touch other teeth with the backside of the head, the vibrating plastic head hurts!</li>
            <li> really disappointed that its not ready to pick up and clean when its time to brush and run  to work.</li>
            <li> I expected this model to be a loud, uncomfortable piece of semi-uselessness.</li>
            <li> I give it 4.5 stars, with half a star deducted for the vibration and noise.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase this Sonicare toothbrush because the one I previously had stopped working without notice.</li>
            <li> slight is the auto-shutoff at 2 min.  </li>
            <li> B001H0GC04 Black &amp; Decker MS800B Mouse Detail Sander With Dust Collection]].</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s louder, heavier, and it probably doesn&#x27;t work as well, but it was also less than $20</li>
            <li> I can hold it down, but once I let go it hovers over the brush itself by a little bit.    </li>
            <li> not good for something that constantly vibrates in use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised how uncomfortable it is, by comparison.</li>
            <li> If anything was going to remove the little specks/bumps off my teeth, I would think that would do the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite the little motor this thing has inside of it.  </li>
            <li> Brushing my teeth has also become a little simpler as there is no need to scrub your teeth with this brush.</li>
            <li> The brush was weak, I might as well have been using a manual toothbrush, especially considering the bulk that it adds to my bathroom things packed while</li>
            <li> your dental cleanings will be all the proof you need once you&#x27;ve started using this little power house of a brush.</li>
            <li> and i can never tell if the batteries are dead or this piece is out of place again.</li>
            <li> Problem is, the harsh vibrations fling toothpaste &amp; saliva all over the place.</li>
            <li> I had bought quite a few brushes in advance, which is why I did buy it again.</li>
            <li> Batteries would not fit, once in on/off</li>
            <li> I picked this up as a spare &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrush and I&#x27;ve used it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> Well after a few visits i was sold on Sonicare being my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; toothbrush system instead of Oral-B.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pretty worried, based on the reviews, that this toothbrush was going to be awful in nearly every respect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you right now you will NOT be disappointed and</li>
            <li> Minus three stars because it sucks to use it!</li>
            <li> Not sure how to transport it when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t a clue, but the results and value make me resolve never to buy an ordinary toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure they should call this a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The heads are annoyingly small</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is what Philips had in mind,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I prefer the compact brush head size anyway, because I have a small mouth, and maneuvering a regular sized brush in my mouth is difficult.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s just too, for want of a better word, violent!</li>
            <li> Plus, now we only throw away the small heads when they are bad (less landfill).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bristles are much too hard; always a bad thing using hard bristles on your gums!</li>
            <li> Vibrates so hard</li>
            <li> When it works, it sounds like a chainsaw in your mouth and vibrate really hard.</li>
            <li> Hard to find but just what we needed.</li>
            <li> I use the Sonicare Powercare Battery Powered Toothbrush at least 2 times a day</li>
            <li> I just move the brush slowly along my teeth and let the brush do the work and my results have been great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean it will hurt the baby, but it is just noisy.</li>
            <li> The brush head is very small.  </li>
            <li> The back of this brush sometimes hits my teeth which is very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing subtle about what Philips Sonicare Battery-operated toothbrush does for your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to get around the back of the molars.  </li>
            <li> But the brushing itself was such a bad experience for me</li>
            <li> The bristles fall out while I&#x27;m brushing which is beyond frustrating.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews beforehand, and was beginning to think that this was a worthless, low-performance piece of junk which would not last 4-5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> This is a poor mockery of Sonicare-</li>
            <li> Neither drawback is dramatic or a deal-breaker for me, and the brush rates:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neither drawback is dramatic or a deal-breaker for me, and the brush rates:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of you have complained that it&#x27;s \\&quot;jarring\\&quot; to use and it makes your mouth numb or what not.</li>
            <li> , that this toothbrush was going to be awful in nearly every respect.  </li>
            <li> The power is very low, the bristles are weak, and the very worst thing is that it has no cover for the bristles.</li>
            <li> Having had a previous battery Sonicare before, I was really disappointed in this model.</li>
            <li> but sadly those seem to be discontinued.    </li>
            <li> I am shocked that Philips Sonicare would put their name behind this product.</li>
            <li> Kinda made my mouth numb.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really awkward to grasp and take off of the charging stand without dropping it.</li>
            <li> My lips were actually numb after using it.</li>
            <li> My morning breath isn&#x27;t as bad as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> ; I have bad gum disease &amp; this brush</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this item as all it did was vibrate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sonicare devotee, that&#x27;s why I was so disappointed by this brush.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re expecting performance like the rechargeable Sonicare models, you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The benefit of this Powerup is that it is battery operated, and does not need a charger base when traveling for longer periods of time.  </li>
            <li> Then you need to pack the charger base, which is just another thing to remember.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed; Have been using Sonicare products for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> you get zapped with a nasty buzz.</li>
            <li> In my experience, power toothbrushes get nasty no matter</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great feeling，good service</li>
            <li> When I change the batteries, the shell bellow also depart from the upper body! I do like this feeling!</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush I have at home so much, I thought I&#x27;d pick this one up to take with me for when I&#x27;m away from home.  The bristles fall out while I&#x27;m brushing which is beyond frustrating.  I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this item as all it did was vibrate. I gave it two stars because 1) it did the job of cleaning teeth 2) the heads are removable for cleaning/replacing.</li>
            <li> Soni Ouch !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for travel as I use the regular Sonicare plug in for home use.  This battery version is too aggressive. The vibration is too strong and I am concerned it could crack a tooth. I threw it out.</li>
            <li> love the product..recommended by my dentist</li>
            <li> When I first used a Sonicare toothbrush many years ago, I hated it because it felt like my entire skull was vibrating. However, after years of trying just about every other kind of toothbrush out there and not receiving the same clean feeling I got from my Sonicare, I decided to try Sonicare again. I was very surprised to find this one at such a low price, and was worried that it might not clean like my old one did. But it cleans great! And unlike my old Sonicare, it feels like a really nice massage on my teeth and gums. I love that it turns off automatically after two minutes too. I would definitely recommend this to someone who really wants a Sonicare toothbrush but can&#x27;t afford the pricy ones.</li>
            <li> Easily the best toothbrush I have ever owned.  I am a smoker, and this toothbrush has noticeably reduced the stains on my teeth (combined with Arm&amp;Hammer Whitening Toothpaste).  The only thing you should note is that it is kind of big relative to other electric toothbrushes in its class.  Still, I can&#x27;t believe how much you&#x27;re getting for $15.00.</li>
            <li> I like it！It took a week for me to get used.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for an extensive European trip KNOWING that it would be great because my daily Philips Sonicare Elite is great. What a surprise; this is not worth $2.00. The power is very low, the bristles are weak, and the very worst thing is that it has no cover for the bristles. I cannot imagine any company manufacturing a toothbrush without a cover.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicares for many years. In general they are excellent. Having had a previous battery Sonicare before, I was really disappointed in this model. In use the earlier ones felt just like the rechargeable ones. This feels quite different, rough and vibrates differently.  I would not buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice. I like it</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric toothbrush but have been intrigued ever since I saw one at the Dentist office. So when I had the opportunity to get this low-cost one, I jumped at it. Being a new-bee, it took some getting used to using an electronic toothbrush. First off, I had to train myself to angle it in the proper position so that it wouldn&#x27;t rattle against my teeth (not a pleasant feeling). Next I had to unlearn the vigorous back and forth/up/down hand motion that I used with a standard brush. Now I simply/gently move it up and down and let the brush do all the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it is wishful thinking or not, but it seems that my teeth seem slicker after using this brush versus my old standard one. And that&#x27;s saying a lot since I shocked the dental hygienist when I showed her how vigorously I brush my teeth. If anything was going to remove the little specks/bumps off my teeth, I would think that would do the job. But no, they were only gone after using this brush a few times. So after several days of using it - I am sold! I like electronic toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I don&#x27;t know what the nay-sayers are complaining about in comparing this against the more expensive Sonic brushes. How many different ways can a toothbrush vibrate? This does perfectly at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only (slight) negative is that it is battery powered. Yes this is nice if you want to throw the toothbrush in your luggage before going on a trip. But I would rather have had a rechargeable brush - no having to handle batteries etc. But that is a minor thing. In my opinion, the pluses outweigh the negatives.</li>
            <li> If you, like me, read the reviews of the Sonicare battery-operated toothbrush with dismay, this review is for you. I didn&#x27;t expect much when I got this toothbrush in the mail, especially after using the very pricey Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush, which I rated five stars and can&#x27;t afford to continue using (refills are expensive). I expected this model to be a loud, uncomfortable piece of semi-uselessness. I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SET UP: Mercifully, batteries come with this toothbrush, and set up takes five seconds. The brush has only one setting (unlike my Sonicare DiamondClean, which has five), and switches off on its own after two minutes of use if you do not shut it off sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE: I don&#x27;t find the unit too loud, although if you use it at 6:50 am like I just did today you will probably wake up family members. I would call the sound level moderate. I actually like the simplicity of the design--one button, easy grip handle, medium-size brush head, everything pretty much as it should be. You will note other reviewers found the vibration too strong. There is some merit in this claim; it IS a strong vibration. Kinda made my mouth numb. However, the instructions state to hold the brush lightly against your teeth, and if you do this the brush cleans very effectively without being too harsh. I was very satisfied with the cleaning power of the brush--as with the Sonicare DiamondClean my teeth felt extremely clean after each brushing and the feeling lasted all day. This brush, however, is 1/10 the price of that deluxe model (but doesn&#x27;t come with a case and two brush heads and such fanciness).&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, recommended. If you have sensitive teeth, or for some reason need a product that is more quiet, I would skip this model and pony up for the DiamondClean brush. I just don&#x27;t have the money for fancier models and I honestly feel this brush did a great cleaning job at a very reasonable price point. I give it 4.5 stars, with half a star deducted for the vibration and noise. Neither drawback is dramatic or a deal-breaker for me, and the brush rates:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE: Bducted for the vibration and noise. Neither drawback is dramatic or a deal-breaker for me, and the brush rates:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE: B</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> the small metal clip-on that the negative and positive heads of the battery touch, keeps moving out of place and i can never tell if the batteries are dead or this piece is out of place again. not good for something that constantly vibrates in use. really disappointed that its not ready to pick up and clean when its time to brush and run  to work. dont have time to keep checking that getting ready for the job..sad,because it cleans well when the metal piece stays in place</li>
            <li> This is my first time use electric toothbrush. Not bad</li>
            <li> works great, my dentist is happy</li>
            <li> I tried the toothbrush for around 3 days before I gave up. It definitely gets my teeth clean, but is just too uncomfortable. If I get my bottom teeth too close while brushing my top teeth, or vise-versa, the hard side of the toothbush head buzzes painfully on the other teeth. So I tried to carefully keep my mouth open enough so that I would not do that. Problem is, the harsh vibrations fling toothpaste &amp; saliva all over the place. My chin, my shirt, on the bathroom sink &amp; mirror. It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating. I&#x27;m going to go back to my regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first \\&quot;powered\\&quot; toothbrush I have tried, so I don&#x27;t know if the experience would be the same with other types or brands.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve tried using the $5 battery gizmos that can be found at Walmart &#x3D; really bad&lt;br /&gt;Today, my kids all use the [[ASIN:B003UKKH6O Oral-B Vitality Prowhite Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]] ($26) and we as parents have the [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]] ($100).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are real happy with our Oralb products but figured for the price we&#x27;d like to give the Sonicare a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;+ This is definitely better than the super cheap ones from WalMart.&lt;br /&gt;+ It vibrates at a really high speed and does a good job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;+ I like it has a 2-minute timer then auto-turns off&lt;br /&gt;+ It&#x27;s pretty light, even with the batteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;- It vibrates and if you accidentally touch other teeth with the backside of the head, the vibrating plastic head hurts! You really need to open your mouth wide to avoid these contacts&lt;br /&gt;- Big brush head. People with smaller mouth, like children, can&#x27;t really use this effectively&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t come with any sort of travel case. Not sure how to transport it when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUTRAL:&lt;br /&gt;* It vibrates, whereas the $26 OralB turns the head. Both styles seem to clean just fine, so not sure which is better.&lt;br /&gt;* I use rechargeable batteries, so it doesn&#x27;t matter if the Philips batteries it comes with run out or not. Just remember to take a backup set of batteries with you if traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: It&#x27;s a good toothbrush for that price range.</li>
            <li> As part of my participation in the Amazon Vines program, I received this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite the little motor this thing has inside of it.  If I turn it on before I put it in my mouth, the toothpaste tends to be thrown off the bristles.  The vibrating head will occasionally strike a tooth.  For all this, I deduct one star from an otherwise top-notch product.  My teeth feel cleaner than with one of the store bought battery powered toothbrushes.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Vibrates so hard and loudly it sounds like my husband is shaving when he uses it.</li>
            <li> Having owned several different powered toothbrushes, I expected a lot more from Sonicare than this. It does not get teeth as clean - especially near the gum line - as a standard toothbrush. It isn&#x27;t even as good as one of the inexpensive ones you can buy at the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are much too hard; always a bad thing using hard bristles on your gums! Think this is one of those times where Sonicare needs to go back to the drawing board!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. I gave this to my daughter and she loves it! It works SO well, their dental check-ups have been greatly improved!! It does make her teeth feel alot cleaner than using a regular toothbrush. She says it tickles her teeth and she looks forward to using it twice and day.  To sums things up, better dental checkups and my kids look forward to brushing their teeth, we bought them for all of our kids.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daddy, he likes it.</li>
            <li> good look and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years, and after reading the reviews on this one I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I will admit that the battery operated toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have the same feel or amount of power that the more expensive rechargeable toothbrushes have, but it is still stronger than a manual toothbrush or the spinbrush, which one reviewer compared it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Powerup, my teeth feel really clean and plaque free. My gums don&#x27;t get quite the massage that a more powerful sonic care provides, but this is still way better than a manual toothbrush or an old style electric toothbrush. I also liked the fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting it in a charger. One issue I had with previous rechargeable toothbrushes was finding a place for the stand near a plugin. Don&#x27;t have to worry about that with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel clean, no chargers to mess with, and fairly inexpensive not a bad deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing subtle about what Philips Sonicare Battery-operated toothbrush does for your teeth and gums.  They efficiently clean your teeth, and they massage your gums.  It doesn&#x27;t replace flossing, but it is a sure-fire way to stimulate cleaner teeth and healthier gums.  After only a week, they look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember buying a rechargeable (or was it just electric?) version of this product, and I loved it.  I would rather recharge it or plug it into an outlet than buy batteries.  They provide two AA batteries in the package, but I have no idea how long they will last.  For the sake of expediency, it is yet to be determined, and there are no more indications of how long batteries last when you use them (say six minutes a day) from the product description, nor in any customer reviews I&#x27;ve yet read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a price of (rounding) $15.00, the cost is outstanding.  I don&#x27;t remember what happened to my electric Sonicare toothbrush, but if my memory serves me correctly, I shelled out about $60.00, and I was happy with my purchase.  Why did I wait so long to get a new one?  I haven&#x27;t a clue, but the results and value make me resolve never to buy an ordinary toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Long ago I bought an electric toothbrush from one of the tv shopping channels. They raved about it on tv and I thought I&#x27;d love it, but every time I&#x27;d barely touch my teeth with it, the movement would stop (even with full charge, of course). It just didn&#x27;t work well. So I never bought another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I had the opportunity to receive this one for free in exchange for my honest review, so I thought I couldn&#x27;t lose by trying another model. But the main reason I decided to try this electric toothbrush, is that I recently became an adult first-time-braces-wearer. I got the ceramic braces with matching tooth color ligatures. I&#x27;ve had them on for almost a month now and there is absolutely zero staining on the ligatures (I was told that color stains easily). At first I was really freaked out about keeping them clean, so I&#x27;m happy to say that this electric toothbrush works much, MUCH better than my regular manual toothbrush. My teeth are smooth and clean feeling after every brushing. I can&#x27;t say how this compares to other electric toothbrushes, because this is the only one I&#x27;ve liked enough to consistently use. Bottom line, after having used this, if I suddenly found myself without it, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy a replacement. Oh, and battery life is good in my opinion. It takes two AA batteries, and I just changed them for the first time yesterday. I got about three weeks at 3x per day use out of the batteries that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can think of, is as one reviewer said, it will rattle your brains, but I found that a lighter took care of that for me. I&#x27;m honestly surprised there aren&#x27;t more five star reviews, but like I said I haven&#x27;t compared this to any of the higher dollar ones. One final note, some people may assume that reviews in exchange for free products are favorably biased. But if you look at my review history you will see that I, like other Vine reviewers call it like I see it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the battery operated tooth brush business so I may not know what I&#x27;m talking about...&lt;br /&gt;this brush works well and my teeth are brushed better than with my regular brush though the vibration was sometimes too much for me... I had to be very gentle so that my head didn&#x27;t shake. This may be what one is supposed to do and I don&#x27;t know...&lt;br /&gt; It does clean my teeth better than my brush, but my brush doesn&#x27;t need new batteries every couple of weeks and I&#x27;m lazy. But if I had batteries I&#x27;d use it more than my manual brush. I guess it&#x27;s worth it, I can take or leave it... but it&#x27;s better for my teeth, I can tell, they were obviously cleaner.</li>
            <li> Power toothbrushes have come a long way since the ones I used as a child back in the 60s/70s.  The Philips toothbrush has the power needed to thoroughly scrub your teeth, though not so much as to damage. I was particularly interested in this toothbrush because the instructions said it was safe to use with braces, and I wanted to give it to my teenage son who currently has braces.  As any parent of an orthodontia-laden child knows, getting your child to ensure proper brushing and flossing with braces is an almost insurmountable task.  So I was delighted when my son informed me that the Philips toothbrush was \\&quot;fun\\&quot; to use and did a good job of making his mouth feel clean.  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> The brushing action really works the gums and leaves a fresh tingly feeling. Much, much better than manual brushing by a long shot. The product works with normal toothpastes and really gives one a well-scrubbed feeling. The handle is ergonomic and not hard to use, and battery is still fine after a month of use. Price point is decent. I cannot find anything to be disatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare HX3631/02 Power up Battery Toothbrush is an okay electric toothbrush.  Not as good as their other powered toothbrushes (their rechargeable models come to mind) this Sonicare does the job adequately.  Not as great as the other ones in the Phillips family.&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with a nice easy grip body, safe on the teeth bristles and it&#x27;s ready to go when its out of the package (make sure the batteries are fresh).  The brush head will let you know when i needs to be replaced by it&#x27;s bristle color.  If you&#x27;re not used to the actions of an electric toothbrush then this one will surprise you by how fast the brushes move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to recommend this for travelers, students and those who don&#x27;t want to throw down money on a rechargeable electric toothbrush set.  But I suggest saving your money and buying a nice Sonicare toothbrush instead.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase this Sonicare toothbrush because the one I previously had stopped working without notice. I had bought quite a few brushes in advance, which is why I did buy it again. As long as it works, it&#x27;s fine. But if this one stops, I will find another brand.</li>
            <li> I have never had a toothbrush that exceeds 10 dollars before, closest I have had is a Spinbrush, which will soon by sidelined to make way for this new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got one of these brushes as a stocking stuffer for Christmas, and I&#x27;m pretty impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me get this out there:&lt;br /&gt;It vibrates like hell. I don&#x27;t find this as a problem until the neck of the toothbrush accidentally contacts your teeth, in that instance you are rewarded with quite a rattle all throughout your skull. Subtract one star off that for me; but hey, it might serve as an extra wake up in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as my results go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are clean! That&#x27;s all I can ask for. It might not be 60-dollar-clean but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference. Brushing my teeth has also become a little simpler as there is no need to scrub your teeth with this brush. I just move the brush slowly along my teeth and let the brush do the work and my results have been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two minute timer is a nice touch as well.</li>
            <li> Works just like the rechargeable version. Easy to take with you when traveling.  Kind of loud.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare toothbrush cleans my teeth better than ANY other toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, manual, electric or battery.  I love that I can run my tongue across my teeth when I&#x27;m done and feel the smooth clean that I&#x27;ve never experienced before.  I also like that the toothbrush automatically shuts down after two minutes of brushing.  There&#x27;s no guessing about whether or not I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth long enough.  Something I didn&#x27;t expect...  My morning breath isn&#x27;t as bad as it used to be.  I doubt that anything will completely eliminate it, but it no longer smells like something crawled into my mouth and died while I was sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that bothered me about this toothbrush (which is probably why it works so well) is that it really rattles my teeth -- much more than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  When I first started using it, whenever the head (not the brush part, but the hard plastic) touched my teeth, it literally felt like a jack hammer in my mouth.  I almost worried about it hitting hard enough to break my teeth.  However, with a few days of practice, the only part that ever touches my teeth any more is the brush.  Like I said, that&#x27;s probably one of the reasons it works so well; just beware that you&#x27;ll need to be more careful with this brush, to not let the hard plastic head touch your teeth while you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li> I am shocked that Philips Sonicare would put their name behind this product. I bought it for travel. Many reviews said it&#x27;s &amp;#34;not quite as good as a real Sonicare&amp;#34;- it is  NOTHING like a real Sonicare. It vibrates so hard that it gave me a headache, and the entire time I used it my teeth never felt clean. A $3 drugstore electric toothbrush would do a better job.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It feels a lot different than the high end Sonicare products (vibration wise), but I did not get good life out of those.  The rechargeable Sonicares would only last me about 6 months, then no longer hold a charge.  This one, with it&#x27;s changeable batteries works well.  I use good rechargeable in it, and still get more than a month on a charge.</li>
            <li> There is a place in the world for battery charged toothbrushes. Mostly, I find them to be very useful when travelling. We have been using a plug-in unit for years that we have been very happy with, but it does not lend itself to tavel. Rather than being forced to use the old fashioned non-powered toothbrushes, we&#x27;ve been using Arm &amp; Hammer battery operated units that work anywhere with 2 AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the Arm &amp; Hammer units, this Sonocare unit performs equally well. You can&#x27;t expect the same performance out of these that you get out of the full featured plug-in units. They just aren&#x27;t engineered to last very long. They are considered disposable and at this price point, I&#x27;m sure lots of people just buy new ones when the batteries die even though they are replaceable - as are the heads.</li>
            <li> My husband has used it once for his teeth and it did an amazing job cleanings his teeth, and later that evening we realized that women can have a fantastic experience as well........ 5 stars from me.  What a bonus appliance to have around.</li>
            <li> It works great and is a great price for the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the both rechargeable Sonicares and the replaceable battery Extreme Sonicare, this new product doesn&#x27;t compare to them at all, it feels more like a generic brand electric toothbrush than a Sonicare.  It&#x27;s very under-powered and has a starkly lower frequency bristle movement compared to the others.  Dissappointing, seems like Philips is just trying to cash in on the Sonicare brand.  Stick with the Extreme if you want a replaceable battery Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure they should call this a Sonicare.  It is unlike any of the other higher end models of Sonicare.  The brush action is much slower and not as strong.  Still, it is probably adequate for a good teeth cleaning.  It runs for quite awhile on one set of new batteries.  Oddly enough, you can put run down batteries in it and it will still work until the batteries are totally gone, at which point it just stops.  And that&#x27;s without a noticeable rundown in speed.  But the recommendation is to always use new alkalines.</li>
            <li> battery powered toothbrush,i like this design.enjoy it</li>
            <li> The product is fine but beware. There is no electrical cord. The charging unit plugs directly into your wall socket. If you have horizontal electrical sockets (next to each other instead of one on top of the other) the shaver lies sideways instead of standing up.  Sticks out and blocks the other socket and it&#x27;s really awkward to grasp and take off of the charging stand without dropping it. I give it a much higher rating if it weren&#x27;t for the design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.. Does a great job &amp; the. 2 min timer  really helps me. .. I bought. 3 of them ...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed; Have been using Sonicare products for years. Thought this would be a good travel brush. Batteries would not fit, once in on/off button wouldn&#x27;t work. Since I bought it about a month ago I no longer have the receipt for a return. Basically wasted the purchase price and never got to find out if the thing would actually clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sonicare devotee, that&#x27;s why I was so disappointed by this brush. When my 12 year old Sonicare Elite finally bit the dust, I bought the power up as a quick replacement. Understanding there is a significant difference in price points, I didn&#x27;t expect the level of the Elite, but this brush isn&#x27;t even close. It sounds like a weedeater and shakes and rattles your whole head. That being said, my teeth still feel cleaner than a regular toothbrush. I&#x27;ll continue to use this until I upgrade to a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Sonicare, I&#x27;m just surprised that a company that makes such an excellent product would put their name on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor, invest in a real Sonicare.  Know it&#x27;s pricey, but it&#x27;s well worth the money.  Consider how much you&#x27;ve spent on toothbrushes in the last 12 years and it suddenly becomes reasonable.</li>
            <li> As the description says this is a battery operated toothbrush and there isn&#x27;t an option to plug it in.  It comes with two AA batteries so it&#x27;s ready use right out of the box.  The brush head is very small.  Like most of these type brushes it has a two minute timer and turns off at that point.  This helps you gauge whether you&#x27;ve brushed an area the recommended two minutes.  It easily turns back on and easily shuts off with a push of the button.  There&#x27;s nothing especially unique about this toothbrush though there&#x27;s also nothing wrong with it besides the small brush but it&#x27;s priced (just under $20 at this time) much higher than similar brushes.</li>
            <li> While this works better than a manual toothbrush, I fail to see why this model should be more appealing to consumers than the classic rechargeable version. Though this has a much lower price tag initally, a very simple calculation of cost of batteries over the lifetime for this model makes it far more costly in terms of dollars and, of course, environmental impact. I don&#x27;t think Phillips thought this one all the way through. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist has often suggested that I use an electric toothbrush, but I never did. I&#x27;m glad I had the opportunity to try this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries were easy to install. The toothbrush is not too bulky or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth definitely feel cleaner after using this toothbrush. It runs automatically for 2 minutes, and I have learned that I had been brushing my teeth far shorter than 2 minutes! I&#x27;m still working up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback would be that I also brush my tongue, but even with the toothbrush turned off, I don&#x27;t feel as effective in that area, because of the smaller head. This is not as small as some of the electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve seen, but it is much more narrow than a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When it works, it sounds like a chainsaw in your mouth and vibrate really hard. I have been using it from 4 month of pregnancy till 9 months. Every time I use it, it wakes up the baby in my womb and makes her kick. I don&#x27;t mean it will hurt the baby, but it is just noisy. However it does clean my teeth very well, even better than the expensive sonicare brushes I used to use. But after several months&#x27; brushing, I noticed that it may be causing some swelling of my gum near the teeth. I&#x27;ll probably give up on it soon and go back to use my sonicare advanced brush.</li>
            <li> My kids love it even though it, &amp;#34;vibrates your head off&amp;#34;  we will have to say what the dentist says in another 6 months.  hoping to see a positive difference.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is adequate for occasional use, and I prefer it to the comparable Oral-B (rotating) battery operated model. But if you&#x27;re expecting performance like the rechargeable Sonicare models, you will be disappointed.  The brush head moves much slower, and it is quite noisy by comparison. It also does not come with a cover for the brush part.  It does shut off after the proper brushing time, but does not have the &amp;#34;stutter&amp;#34; to mark the time into quarters that the regular Sonicare models have, It&#x27;s adequate for a trip if you don&#x27;t want to worry about carrying the charger or needing electrical adapters, but I&#x27;m sticking with the regular model for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Buy a friend, but he has not got a hand.</li>
            <li> Used the more expensive Sonic for years but switched to this as I had replacement heads for it. It works just as well...especially for the price. Just had a dental cleaning and my dentist said my gums look really healthy - and that&#x27;s a rarity for me as I have always had problems with them in the past. So that was nice to hear!</li>
            <li> Received as described, fast shipping, good price.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this toothbrush.  The head is large and the action is up and down and it&#x27;s powerful.  The plastic back of the brush will rattle your teeth when it touches them.  It&#x27;s impossible to get around the back of the molars.  I thought I might lose a filling.  Spend the extra money and get the $40 Sonicare battery powered unit.  I got one of those and threw this one in the trash.</li>
            <li> Works just fine its a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The heads are annoyingly small so you&#x27;re only affecting a small space at a time therefore adding more time to the brushing to make sure you get every tooth. Also you can&#x27;t adjust the power/speed and the one setting that it does have is a little to strong.</li>
            <li> This is really the best toothbrush out there.  Yeah it goes at like a bazillion miles per hour, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do better than anything else on the market regardless of price.&lt;br /&gt;Only slight is the auto-shutoff at 2 min.  I always make it to brushing my front teeth just as it shuts off.  A minor annoyance really, but a beep or something certainly would suffice to let you know that you&#x27;re reached the &amp;#34;acceptable level&amp;#34; of tooth cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a keeper.  Can&#x27;t imagine ever needing or wanting another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I picked this up as a spare &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrush and I&#x27;ve used it for a few months.  The battery has lasted and it feels cleaner than a regular toothbrush, however I use an Oral-B for years and the round brush is much smaller than the oval Sonicare brush.  The back of this brush sometimes hits my teeth which is very uncomfortable.  I will replace it with an Oral-B just because of the size of the brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. I&#x27;ve purchased MANY battery operated toothbrushes for my family and, in my opinion, this one is the best of it&#x27;s kind. I think you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find anything better that uses only a battery and is so simple to travel with. My entire family can use one unit with 4 changeable heads and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Some may think the battery version doesn&#x27;t compare to the wall plug versions, but, to me, if it were any more powerful I&#x27;d find it uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Baby is very good, I like very much.</li>
            <li> I like this tooth brush very much. One word caution, compared to my older electric toothbrush, this one has more power.  So you have to \\&quot;wield\\&quot; it more carefully.  It vibrates hard enough on a fresh battery that the hard plastic side (opposite the brush) can really rattle your teeth if it impacts them.  So it takes little getting used to, but once you do, it cleans teeth rather nicely.</li>
            <li> We have a Sonicare toothbrush at home that plugs into the wall and we have used for years that works so well.  I thought this would be great for travel and would live up to the Sonicare name.  However it did not live up to the Sonicare name.  The brush was weak, I might as well have been using a manual toothbrush, especially considering the bulk that it adds to my bathroom things packed while travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that the toothbrush attachment itself was shorter than on the Sonicare brush I use at home, which was not as comfortable while brushing in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before this [[ASIN:B00DS0KP2C Philips Sonicare Hx3631/02 Powerup Battery Toothbrush, Blue]] arrived on my doorstep a couple of weeks ago.  My interest was piqued even further when my daughter told me that this is the electric toothbrush her dentist recommended at her last visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B00DS0KP2C Philips Sonicare Hx3631/02 Powerup Battery Toothbrush]] is easy to use, though it did take a couple of days of practice to learn to manipulate the brush around my mouth without banging my teeth.  I&#x27;ve always needed a soft toothbrush, but the standard head that comes with this is fine and the difference in my teeth is remarkable - much cleaner with far less work.  Impressively so.  And I particularly like the built in timer, which keeps me \\&quot;honest\\&quot; - no skimping on the time as I might otherwise do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While, the unit costs about 50% more than low-end electric toothbrushes available at my local box store, those did not come with the money back guarantee that Phillips offers for this brush - \\&quot;Use SonicCare PowerUp for 90 days and if you are not 100% satisfied we&#x27;ll give you a full refund.\\&quot;  I suspect I won&#x27;t be collecting a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - I should have tried one of these YEARS ago!  I know what Santa is putting in every single Christmas stocking at Grandma&#x27;s house this year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned and used both Sonicare and OralB electric toothbrushes.  I personally prefer the OralB, but that&#x27;s not really relevant.  Research electronic brushes and you&#x27;ll find that either are great for cleaning your teeth, certainly better than using a manual.  It&#x27;s about preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, the issue with this model is that it&#x27;s battery operated.  It&#x27;s not as powerful as a regular electric and if you used it full time it would ultimately cost more to use than an initially more expensive rechargeable model.  So why bother with this?  I can only see one use: Take this when you don&#x27;t want to lose your more expensive electric model or when you&#x27;re going to be without reliable electricity, but will have access to AA batteries. Overseas travel, camping, etc.  In other words, sort of a limited use.  However, it does have a use.  Not sure if this is what Philips had in mind, but that&#x27;s the primary purpose that I can see.  I don&#x27;t know why someone would bother with this model otherwise.  Perhaps to initiate someone to using a non-manual brush for the first time?  Maybe.  But really, this one is for travel or being without electricity for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Let me say up-front that this is my first time using anything other than your garden-variety normal toothbrush. I get one every time I go to the dentist, and my teeth are healthy, so I never saw the need to step up. Given the opportunity to review this, I agreed for no other reason than to satisfy my curiosity (and at a sub-$20 price point, it&#x27;s an attractive \\&quot;try it out\\&quot; option for those in the market).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it. I intensely disliked it, for several reasons. I can&#x27;t compare it to other powered brushes that apparently use a higher frequency, but my engineering background told me the frequency was too low the moment I put it in my mouth - it&#x27;s loud, and is an instant headache for me. The back of the brush has no rubber coating on it, so I often found the bare plastic bumping into the teeth opposite where I was cleaning (\\&quot;unpleasant\\&quot; is too kind a word to describe what that feels and sounds like). I also discovered this is not safe to use if you have any kind of cut in your mouth (I had a nearly-healed small bite mark on the inside of my lip that this thing ripped right open with no pressure exerted in the direction of the cut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush also seems to vibrate in a wide area - eyeballing it, it seems to be 130-140% the still brush head&#x27;s coverage. I&#x27;m not sure if this in normal or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush does have some nice features - the bristles fade to let you know when you need to replace the head (currently the heads go for ~$15 for a two-pack), and the brush will automatically power off about two minutes (2:05, to be exact, and yes I timed it several times) to let you know you&#x27;re done. But the brushing itself was such a bad experience for me these feature were moot.</li>
            <li> it took one use of this model to quickly understand why some people don&#x27;t like it. I too assumed that whoever mentioned &amp;#34;it rattled my brain&amp;#34; was simply brushing too hard, quite the contrary. it&#x27;s not the intensity of the brush that&#x27;s the issue, it&#x27;s the fact that for some people the brush head is too small and there is no rubber on the sides or top of the brush head which causes the very small brush head to constantly bump up against your teeth, hence the vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a larger mouth and you prefer a larger brush head, this is not for you. Now they may offer a larger brush attachment but I have not looked in to that. Of course the fact that the entire top and sides of the head are exposed plastic is a whole other issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush Sonic which has rubber bumpers on the side of the large brush head for the same price as this one. It also has interchangeable heads, runs on two AA batteries, but does not have a shutoff timer. I can count...</li>
            <li> Amazing value for the price.  My teeth are several shades whiter and I actually look forward to brushing my teeth twice daily now.</li>
            <li> It is a quite nice tool for use which make me clean my tootch every day. I am happy that I have buy it.</li>
            <li> Not the Sonicare I was expecting.. Not smooth like my last Sonicare. Does not run on sonic vibrations but on slower mechanical movement.  Actually hurts my teeth if I happen to bump them with the hard plastic frame of the bristles. I wanted a battery operated brush so I didn&#x27;t have to pack around a charger.. I ended up ordering one from Phillips directly to get what I wanted..HX 3300.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that for under $20 you are getting a basic level electric toothbrush. The toothbrush works, and gives your teeth a good cleaning and does a good job getting between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am not fond of is that it does not have rechargeable batteries. I would highly recommend spending a little more money and buying one of the lower end sonicare toothbrushes with a rechargable battery. I am convinced that the price difference will quickly pay for itself over buying these little batteries. Do you really want to have to continue to buy batteries for this device?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is a good toothbrush, but spend a little more for a rechargable one.</li>
            <li> Tremendous bargain; I have bad gum disease &amp; this brush has worked just as well for me as the top of the line Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of Sonicare toothbrushes, which I have been using for about 18 years.  This Powerup model is sort of the \\&quot;which one does not belong\\&quot; product in the lineup of amazing, but somewhat costly Sonicare electric toothbrushes.  This is a regular battery operated (2 AAs, included) brush, which is great for some uses.  The vibration of this model is a lot more than the Essence models that I usually buy.  I have quite a bit of dental work (veneers, crowns, etc.) so I am a bit paranoid about using an electric brush at all, let alone one that has so much vibration.  Also this brush is quite a bit noisier than the Essence model, so if noise is a problem, forget this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushing action of this brush is good, better than manual brushing, which is oh so difficult.  My brushing regimen is to manual brush in the morning, and use the Sonicare at night (after flossing first, of course!).  I think the cleaning factor from this out-of-place Sonicare is better than manual brushing, but I would recommend the Sonicare Essence model over this.  The Essence cost more, but not a fortune, maybe $80 or so.  The benefit of this Powerup is that it is battery operated, and does not need a charger base when traveling for longer periods of time.  The Essence charge should last about two weeks, but when they get older, after a few years, the charge doesn&#x27;t last as long.  Then you need to pack the charger base, which is just another thing to remember.  I would use this brush for travel.  Plus, I wouldn&#x27;t be upset if my luggage was lost or stolen and this was in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model&#x27;s brush does not come with a brush head cover, which is weird, but I just put a manual travel toothbrush cover over it, and it fit fine.  I prefer the compact brush head size anyway, because I have a small mouth, and maneuvering a regular sized brush in my mouth is difficult.  I don&#x27;t know if Sonicare offers refills in the compact size.  I saw a display of these Powerups at Walmart today and the replacement brushes.  The price wasn&#x27;t marked on either, so I don&#x27;t know what the refills cost.oday and the replacement brushes.  The price wasn&#x27;t marked on either, so I don&#x27;t know what the refills cost.</li>
            <li> I have had better powered toothbrushes than this--Just OK in my book!&lt;br /&gt;I will say that my teeth feel smooth, clean &amp; great after using this but....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~the brush part itself is about a kids size, not adult--too small&lt;br /&gt;~if you touch any tooth with the back of the brush, it seems your tooth will break&lt;br /&gt;~vibration is extremely fast...almost stressful brushing with this&lt;br /&gt;~after only using it about 10 times, the bristles are changing color like it needs a new head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my family was asking what the noise was when the back of the brush part hit my teeth, makes quite a noise!  It really bugs me too.  I don&#x27;t like this toothbrush, but it does clean well! 3 Stars for good cleaning.</li>
            <li> I use a rechargeable at home, but find the charger to be a hassle on longer trips, so this is an easy, inexpensive, convenient solution.</li>
            <li> it is really good and useful.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the colgate optic one I have been using</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush--easy to use; comfortable in the mouth; no problems.  I have only had it for about a month--so we we see how it hold up......</li>
            <li> I bought one at Sam&#x27;s Club and liked it so I came to amazon to get my kids one. And just like I had planned it, the new one shuts itself off after 2 minutes. Perfect training and better form for the young ones to learn. Plus, now we only throw away the small heads when they are bad (less landfill). Rechargeable batteries (not included) seem to last more than a month with 2 regular users.</li>
            <li> You really, really get what you pay for. This runs like what it is, a cheap knock off, it&#x27;s really a mistake for Phillips to put the Sonicare label on it. It&#x27;s super rough sounding and super hard vibrating both in your hand and in your mouth. I forced myself to use it for a couple months because I&#x27;m a cheap guy, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it. I really don&#x27;t think the amount of hard vibration (not at all like the smooth vibration from the real Sonicare products) is good for your teeth. Some of my teeth became sensitive after using this one, even though I was careful to apply as little pressure as possible.</li>
            <li> This kind, that takes AA batteries, lasts longer than the regular Sonicare toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I let the reviewing deadline on this product pass by quite a bit, because of concerns I had about its durability, among other things.  The negative reviews on this product are plentiful and scathing, but for the most part, I have been pleasantly surprised by the overall performance of this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, those who are used to the higher-priced Sonicare toothbrushes probably will have a lot of gripes about this one, but it is also worth pointing out that my dentist has been trying to get me to switch to Sonicare for years, and the high price (at the time, mostly at least $100) has been enough of a deterrent for me not to do it.  Anyone still using a manual toothbrush will find the low price of this toothbrush to be quite the incentive to switch over, and the performance at this price point (I think) is considerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for durability --- I was pretty worried when I opened up the battery compartment and parts immediately started falling out.  I had read the reviews beforehand, and was beginning to think that this was a worthless, low-performance piece of junk which would not last 4-5 weeks.  It has been almost two months now, and everything seems to be holding together just fine, even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first set of batteries seem to last for about 6 weeks, perhaps a little longer.  I&#x27;ll be interested to see how long a new set of fresh batteries can survive, but I can imagine having to change batteries maybe 5-6 times during the year.  I can see where a rechargeable unit would be preferable.  If and when this one gives up the ghost, I probably will consider investing the extra money for at least this one feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth noting that the complaints about noise and teeth being rattled by hard plastic are quite valid.  If you are sensitive to this sort of thing, then it might be a deal-breaker for you.  It&#x27;s not something that particularly bothers me, and my rating reflects my basic indifference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty worried, based on the reviews, that this toothbrush was going to be awful in nearly every respect.  I came to it with very low expectations, and have been pleasantly surprised.  I am quite happy with it.pretty worried, based on the reviews, that this toothbrush was going to be awful in nearly every respect.

            <li> I ordered 2 of these for gifts and received them today.  One was fine, the second one was completely opened.  The entire backing was ripped off.  For a new product, it should be in perfect condition. Very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> Work well and last for very long time before changing battery</li>
            <li> It does what I want it to.</li>
            <li> My Son bought the rechargable version.  The biggest difference, other than battery cost, is the &amp;#34;violence&amp;#34; of the vibration.  This unit is a force of nature attacking your teeth and gums.  I truly believe it is the best toothbrush I have ever had but I will someday pony up the cash for the upgrade.</li>
            <li> This is a nice power toothbrush. I know a lot of the reviews said it wasn&#x27;t sonicare or whatever but this brush makes my mouth feel so clean and I just love it. The batteries do ok but the ones it came with burned out pretty fast. I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice version of an electric toothbrush. The price is good and the product is holding up well. Good quality and the brush is not too soft or hard.</li>
            <li> comfortable but sounds loudly</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! The fact that I can travel with it is great. Really cleaned my teeth, just love it.</li>
            <li> Thanks fast ship &amp; excellent work. Thank you  very much.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is good for the price. I use it during the day at work while I have a more expensive electric toothbrush at home.  My only complaint is that can vibrates sometimes off of my teeth at certain angles which is a little uncomfortable, but overall I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> perfect，and not very expensive。</li>
            <li> Very happy with my new toothbrush.  It arrived quiclly and was put into immediate use.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I wore out my Oral-B and picked up this Philips to replace it. I&#x27;m very surprised how uncomfortable it is, by comparison. The entire stem up to the brush vibrates, so if you let it touch your teeth (hard to avoid) you get zapped with a nasty buzz. On the Oral-B, only the brush head moves. Much more comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to have a AA-battery powered electric toothbrush for travel, because it&#x27;s cheap to lose and easy to get batteries. I just don&#x27;t recommend this one. On the plus side, the battery cover is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It does a great, sonic cleaning for a low price.  In my experience, power toothbrushes get nasty no matter how well you clean them - there is just so much spit and toothpaste you can clean off!  I would much prefer to spend $15 on one of these once a year than have a $200 toothbrush that recharges and I have to keep maintaining.  And, I think it does the same job!  When I first started using it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth were.</li>
            <li> Good cheap sonic toothbrush. Like other reviewers have said, you have to be careful not to touch the back of the brush head against your teeth... But other than that this toothbrush gives a much better cleaning than a cheap spinbrush. For only $15 this is a great buy! For someone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend $100 on a toothbrush this is a great option.</li>
            <li> Best battery operate toothbrush. Good for traveling.</li>
            <li> Value above price , good !</li>
            <li> Very good product, very satisfied!</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is fairly priced, and functional! It&#x27;s completely water-proof, so never worry about the battery. Good one and worthly!</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this item..</li>
            <li> Best $14 electric toothbrush on the market. To compare it against $65 toothbrushes is foolish and pointless, because it is far-and-away the best bang-for-buck toothbrush you can buy. Suck it up, haters.</li>
            <li> Despite carrying the Sonicare moniker, my expectations for this device were not very high. It&#x27;s a good thing, too, because this brush is only marginally better than a manual toothbrush and can hardly be recommended for anyone other than a manual toothbrush devotee who needs to improve their oral hygiene but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. That&#x27;s because compared to a \\&quot;real\\&quot; electronic toothbrush, like the [[ASIN:B004M1BO3U Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 EasyClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] that I am used to, this is like brushing your teeth with a hairbrush attached to a [[ASIN:B001H0GC04 Black &amp; Decker MS800B Mouse Detail Sander With Dust Collection]]. The brush movements are harsh and decidedly not subtle. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is cleaning so much as resetting your teeth in your jaw. Everything is just so rough. Actually, I think one could get some good use out of this as a cleaning device, maybe on tile grout or hard to reach places around your kitchen and bathroom sinks and faucets. You really are better off buckling down and buying a serious rechargeable toothbrush and just staying away from this thing. I will say, however, that if you are still using a manual brush and looking for something better without having to drop of lot of money, this might be a decent \\&quot;tweener\\&quot; brush until your ready for the real thing. Then you can use this as a cleaning tool, like I&#x27;m going to.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good travel toothbrush, but I&#x27;m really not happy with it. I prefer softer bristles -- these were just too rough. And it&#x27;s just too, for want of a better word, violent! My lips were actually numb after using it. It does feel good in my hand and is easy to use. The placement of the on/off switch is good. I do prefer rechargeable over battery-operated, too, just for the environment. I have a more expensive Sonicare that has more brushing options and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had pretty good teeth according to my dentist. I&#x27;ve only got one crown in my head, never had to wear braces, and ALL my wisdom teeth came in. So i must be one of the \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; ones with good genes in that regard. However, i must say i&#x27;ve also been very particular in taking care of my teeth considering we ALL only have ONE SET. I think the importance of brushing and flossing is extremely important to good oral hygiene. I&#x27;m also of the \\&quot;rare breed\\&quot; that enjoys going to the dentist and having my teeth cleaned because i love how they feel after a good dental exam. This all said, i wanted something exactly like the cleaning tool they use during my check-ups but on a daily basis or at the very least something close to it. Now i have tried many different battery-powered toothbrushes folks and the Oral-B was quite good considering there \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; brush heads seem to focus on each tooth separately. However, after finding out about this Sonicare Powerup battery operated brush i didn&#x27;t hesitate to make the switch a permanent one. A friend of mine had purchased one of the high end rechargeable Sonicare models and i always liked using it when i visited as i had purchased my own \\&quot;diamond clean\\&quot; model head so i could use the brush myself. Well after a few visits i was sold on Sonicare being my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; toothbrush system instead of Oral-B. The only difference between the two systems was the size difference of the Sonicare compared to the smaller Oral-B but that wasn&#x27;t going to be a deal breaker for me. When this battery operated Sonicare Powerup brush came out i IMMEDIATELY bought it and have been using it ever since. The power of this brush compared to the Oral-B battery operated brushes is like night and day folks...!!! Some of you have complained that it&#x27;s \\&quot;jarring\\&quot; to use and it makes your mouth numb or what not. Honestly to those folks, all i can say is how hard are you pressing down when using this brush...? It&#x27;s a power toothbrush for a reason folks so you DON&#x27;T have to exert any extra pressure i would be willing to bet that&#x27;s why a lot of folks are giving this new brush such negative reviews. When in reality it&#x27;s probably THE BEST battery operated brush to hit the market at least right now. So for anyone out there looking to make the switch over to this brush but are hesitant because of these \\&quot;negative\\&quot; Amazon reviews DON&#x27;T BE. I&#x27;m telling you right now you will NOT be disappointed and your dental cleanings will be all the proof you need once you&#x27;ve started using this little power house of a brush. It&#x27;s also a GREAT tongue cleaner as well always remember folks to clean your tongue even if you gag a bit doesn&#x27;t matter your scraping off all the bad icky junk in your mouth that just stays there even though your teeth are clean. 9 out of 10 times the reason folks have bad breath even though there teeth are white is because there NOT brushing there tongues good enough or even at all. We focus a lot on the necessity to floss and brush 2x a day but we don&#x27;t have enough \\&quot;dental promotion\\&quot; of brushing the tongue everyday. And i&#x27;m telling everyone right now how important that is to getting rid of a myriad of oral hygiene issues.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been curious if a Sonicare is right for you but haven&#x27;t been willing to make a $100 gamble to try it, I&#x27;d say give this model a shot. It isn&#x27;t nearly as nice as my wife&#x27;s expensive rechargeable model. It&#x27;s louder, heavier, and it probably doesn&#x27;t work as well, but it was also less than $20 and it&#x27;s amazing compared to my old manual toothbrush. It&#x27;s easily the best inexpensive powered toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Sonicare Essence -- left at a hotel room -- with this version.  While lot of reviewers complain about the power of the vibrations in this model, I found the speed to be acceptable.  Comparing this price to some higher priced versions, this is definitely the best bang for your buck--all the benefit of Sonicare, without the Sonicare price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having spent most of my life with a manual toothbrush, I have to digress for a moment on the Sonicare generally.  My dental hygienist was blown away when I came in for my first appointment after picking up a sonic toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve always taken care of oral hygiene, but there is really no substitute for a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;spin&#x27; movement, just side to side, but I like this toothbrush OK. The movement seems quite powerful and adequate.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, and I expected better of Sonicare. I ordered 4, and the packaging was partially open on all 4. Strike one.I just pulled one out of its packaging and noticed there was no brush head protector. Strike two. I then attempted to insert the batteries, and found the metal piece that the batteries rest on was bent over double, and fell out completely. I fixed it, but it will fall out every time I change batteries. Strike three. I do not recommend this product. I&#x27;m not sure if it is only the seller I got them from, or if it is all of them. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is a double cheesburger deluxe toothbrush. You get what u pay for.  The entire head vibrates so its like brushing with a jack hammer when the shaft touches your teeth. It provides a dizzying sensation during use. I am used to the more expensive models and this one provides a very different experience than those. (5) Five stars because it is a tooth brush and it does brush your teeth.  (-3) Minus three stars because it sucks to use it!</li>
            <li> Good Value for the price and in my opinion works as effectively, if not better, that their higher priced rechargeable model. Yes you have to replace the batteries but not that often despite twice daily use. It is compact for travel. The Blue or Orange are exactly the same just a matter of color - if color is no issue for you go for price.</li>
            <li> The vibrations are a little too powerful at times. The first couple days it was fine. Eventually after using it for almost two weeks now, my teeth feel really sore and it keeps getting worse each time I use this brush.I am barely even putting the brush against my teeth.    A reviewer mentions that it rattled their head. I don&#x27;t experience that.    It&#x27;s kind of scary to try to get into hard to reach spots as it&#x27;s possible that the brush is going to vibration the heck out of your tooth if it touches it with the back. There really should have been some sort of rubber object along the back. I occasionally had it hit my tooth and it felt/sounded like someone took a jackhammer to my mouth. I have to turn it off whenever I want to change the part of my mouth I want to brush so I don&#x27;t hit my teeth by accident with the brush.    It cleans ok, but the head is way too slim for something like that.    I would also like to note that my brush head doesn&#x27;t fit properly onto my brush. I can hold it down, but once I let go it hovers over the brush itself by a little bit.    The batteries that come with the brush are very good or the brush is very power efficient. Most of the time there is a large drop in brush power after the first few brushes while this one is pretty constant.    I believed that many of the bad reviews were from many people who were expecting a $200 brush for $15 and shrugged it off. I&#x27;m starting to see the many annoying quirks this brush has.    Compared to my Spinbrush Pro Clean, it&#x27;s a lot harder to reach the smaller areas because of the Philip&#x27;s thin head. I tried getting the inside side of my teeth with the Philip&#x27;s and it left a lot of junk on my teeth and missed a lot of spots. The Spinbrush was able to clean them out decently.    If they made a version of this brush with a wider head with some sort of rubber on the back and a little less vibration strength, it would probably be a perfect brush.    Update: After days of tooth pain, I used my Spinbrush lastnight instead and I do not have any tooth pain anymore.</li>
            <li> This thing really goes! Not like drugstore battery brushes. Very powerful...I feel clean!</li>
            <li> Toothbrush works well and was almost half the price of the big retail chain.  Recently started using these at the dentist&#x27;s recommendation and wish I had started sooner</li>
            <li> Hard to find but just what we needed. Works great</li>
            <li> The whole family has one and our dentist noticed at our next checkups. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is OK for the $15 price point, competing with the other inexpensive motorized toothbrushes in that range. It&#x27;s a basic battery operated toothbrush that vibrates. What is is NOT however is a Sonicare. I purchased this for travel, not wanting to bring my Sonicare and charger halfway around the world for a month in places that don&#x27;t always have convenient AC outlets. This is a poor mockery of Sonicare-it vibrates, but is very weak and still requires a fair amount of manual brushing. It just isn&#x27;t that good even as a battery toothbrush. Sonicare used to make an E series AA battery toothbrush that was a real, full fledged Sonicare but sadly those seem to be discontinued.    Update: After using it for a couple of weeks, it works well overall, when compared to other battery toothbrushes. It&#x27;s superior to the Oral-B battery toothbrushes for sure. But it&#x27;s still NOT a Sonicare. Manage your expectations and it might work for you.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush I ordered was blue, but I received an orange one. Also, the package was not properly sealed. It was obvious it wasn&#x27;t used, but I almost threw it away. I won&#x27;t be reordering. The toothbrush works well, I have used in the past so am familiar with the brand and style.</li>
            <li> Bought this for travel as I didn&#x27;t want to take my electric sonicare on the road.  For a battery powered device....works quite well and I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note it is big and a bit bulky for travel, no travel bag, etc...but can&#x27;t beat it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;To avoid a possible, turn on in my luggage, I remove one battery when traveling and leave it in my toiletry kit...and just pop it in when I get to my hotel, etc....</li>
            <li> Wonderful. The best.very good</li>
            <li> I am very happy that my dentist recommended a high quality electric toothbrush. I am amazed at how clean my teeth look and feel. The quality of this item also amazes me for the $12 price. Nice look, comfortable feel, quality construction; I like the automatic two minute timer. Can&#x27;t imagine going back to a regular toothbrush after using this. I know that there are many that are much more expensive; perhaps I will try one sometime.  For now, I am very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work. I tested the battery, and then realized there was no silver piece where you put the battery. I was really irritated, and went online to buy a different brand of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After using the Phillips Sonicare Powerup Battery  Powered Toothbrush for a year, I am very satisfied with the results. This toothbrush is an addition to one that I have had for a while. The only knock that I would give is that you will need extra AA batteries available. I use the Sonicare Powercare Battery Powered Toothbrush at least 2 times a day and I have to replace the batteries every 3 weeks. I could buy an electrical toothbrush that would eliminate the battery problem. My call- huh!</li>
