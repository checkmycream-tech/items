            <li>After the first month, I really did see the difference--my face appears more dewy, lines and pores seem minimized.  </li>
            <li>I say definitely worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks so young and smooth!</li>
            <li>but I have tried serums from most major cosmetics line.</li>
            <li>It feels very nourishing !</li>

            <li>I will definitely be repurchasing this product and I would most certainly recommend it to anyone who is looking for immediate results</li>
            <li>It has a delicate pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Makes a noticeable difference in deep lines, blurs fine ones.  </li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t enjoy is that you&#x27;re supposed to pump the product into your hand and mix in your palm before patting into your face.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a real product .</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable .</li>
            <li>My skin is so much brighter and smoother...</li>
            <li>Thanks for sending it so fast.</li>
            <li>I use other Clarins products but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>so excited and looking forward to seeing  further results with this serum.</li>
            <li>One of the main ingredients is mineral oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, all my friends have gotten on board with this.</li>
            <li>It DEFINITELY has evened my skin tone out, it leaves my skin with a Dewey glow and seems to have faded the appearance of my fine lines and my tiny freckles.</li>
            <li>New product.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I used a hydrating fluid and even that didn&#x27;t work, in winter I had to use too much of it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve had no issues at all with it.</li>
            <li>I have used Clarins for nearly 25 years and do recommend it.</li>
            <li>and the shipment was very fast than the expected time...</li>
            <li>I am constantly dry and this product helps my moisturizer soak in  and really smooths out your face.  </li>
            <li>This serum tightens and tones my skin like no other.  </li>
            <li>My favorite serum ever.&lt;br /&gt;Better than TNS and less than half the price.</li>

            <li> My fault for not reading the ingredients before buying, but I never thought a high end product product from Clarins would put out a product that actually sucks moisture out of the skin. :(</li>
            <li> Less expensive when ordered here and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> With this serum my skin hasn&#x27;t broken out as some would expect from the mineral oil and has my skin the softest it&#x27;s been in years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some say that the mineral oil in this product makes it bad for your skin.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite serum ever.&lt;br /&gt;Better than TNS and less than half the price.</li>
            <li> Some say that the mineral oil in this product makes it bad for your skin. They say that mineral oil doesn&#x27;t allow your skin to breathe.  I don&#x27;t understand how the serum works but I have tried serums from most major cosmetics line. With this serum my skin hasn&#x27;t broken out as some would expect from the mineral oil and has my skin the softest it&#x27;s been in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not fragrance free if you&#x27;re allergic. It has a delicate pleasant scent. I say definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t enjoy is that you&#x27;re supposed to pump the product into your hand and mix in your palm before patting into your face. Which seems like a waste of serum. But overall good serum.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a real product . The price is reasonable . I will order it again the next time</li>
            <li> I use this regularly and it has made a difference in my skin tone.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum I ever bought!!  My skin is so much brighter and smoother...</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that works on my combination skin. I have tried national, boutique, organic, and French brands. Whenever I use any product on my face, the dry areas flake and oily ones get too oily. I used a hydrating fluid and even that didn&#x27;t work, in winter I had to use too much of it. I don&#x27;t know how I got into Clarins. I went to a counter and decided to try it out. This product is the only one that works for my combination skin and balances everything out. My skin is no longer flaky, I use this in summer and winter day and night. A lot of people use it at night in summer but I use this serum because if I use a cream or lotion it makes my skin feel a bit tight. This one is perfect. It also makes my skin glow if I use it regularly day and night. I use other Clarins products but this one is my favorite. For other things (exfoliator, face wash, etc.) I try other brands but not for a serum. I usually don&#x27;t do 5 star reviews but this one I had to. After many many years I finally found the one product that works on my combination skin in all seasons.</li>
            <li> I love using this on my face!  After the first month, I really did see the difference--my face appears more dewy, lines and pores seem minimized.  This is my new best friend for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 1/2 weeks and I can already see an improvement with my skin. It DEFINITELY has evened my skin tone out, it leaves my skin with a Dewey glow and seems to have faded the appearance of my fine lines and my tiny freckles. I have sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve had no issues at all with it. I love the way it smells, it smells like roses and 2 pumps is all it takes to cover my entire face and neck. I&#x27;m still a newbie with this product and Im so excited and looking forward to seeing  further results with this serum. I will definitely be repurchasing this product and I would most certainly recommend it to anyone who is looking for immediate results</li>
            <li> great product,very happy</li>
            <li> Quick shipment and good price!</li>
            <li> I have used this and other clarin products for a number of years.  This serum tightens and tones my skin like no other.  I am never without it.  I would suggest using AM and PM.  Just a small tab will work for the face and neck.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product.  I am constantly dry and this product helps my moisturizer soak in  and really smooths out your face.  It feels very nourishing !</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the results of Clarins Double serum. I went through a tight spot when I didn&#x27;t have wrinkle cream for a few months, I&#x27;m turning 45 this month and I&#x27;m happy to have my youthful looking skin back after using Clarins. Most days I even wore it alone with out day cream and my skin felt fresh and moisturized. I would definetly recommend trying it your self and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The best serum ever. My skin looks so young and smooth!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year now, after being introduced to me at the Clarins counter. I use this with my Lumiere eye cream and it has done wonders on the look and feel of my skin. Less expensive when ordered here and delivered on time. LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Best anti aging product available</li>
            <li> I love Clarine&#x27;s products. I have been using them for years. I have very sensitive skin but their products never bothers my skin and I think they works well. I love this, feels good on and my skin grow.</li>
            <li> I have used Clarins for nearly 25 years and do recommend it. Product is very good.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased an anti aging product twice. IT IS AMAZING!  Makes a noticeable difference in deep lines, blurs fine ones.  Highly recommend, all my friends have gotten on board with this.</li>
            <li> One of the main ingredients is mineral oil. I didn&#x27;t realize that when I bought it and now feel stuck with it. My fault for not reading the ingredients before buying, but I never thought a high end product product from Clarins would put out a product that actually sucks moisture out of the skin. :(</li>
            <li> Been using this since it came out and it&#x27;s my every day serum. I have very dry skin and this keeps it under control in combination with my moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Visible results in jus three weeks..its a wonder product...and the shipment was very fast than the expected time...</li>
            <li> My girl loves this stuff I bought 3 because it&#x27;s such a good price.</li>
            <li> I love this product very much.  Thanks for sending it so fast.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.  New product.  On time.</li>
