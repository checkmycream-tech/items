            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great product! :-)</li>
            <li>The skin is tighten and bright.</li>
            <li>The serum seems to be as good as the eye cream by this company.  </li>
            <li>not as good as 22 percent vitamin C</li>
            <li>But I am learning and the bottle is not as full!!!</li>
            <li>More as time goes by! ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li>So far it works great!</li>
            <li>This serum contains healing and effective ingredients that produce results, more than most C serums...</li>
            <li>but I would like to see this product do more</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to see any more improvement after longer use.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the fast delivery of the product, and the company is really interested in making sure the customer is satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and makeup applies smoothly over it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I will continue with the product and see if it has an effect on sagging, which is my primary concern.  </li>
            <li>Absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>It soaks quickly into my skin with no greasy residue or stinging.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin is not dry and it has a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I tried it last night and my skin seemed to drank it and wanted more!    </li>
            <li>I can see a difference in my skin right away.  </li>
            <li>I was not seeing results right the way, but I was not using it 2x either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 yrs old, &amp; I am excited to see how the serum improves my skin!</li>
            <li>I like it very much even if I waisted a lot because of the irregular pump.</li>
            <li>I love the eye cream and it has made a difference, so I am looking forward to the serum doing the same</li>
            <li>I really like it and have been getting compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really luv it.</li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer.</li>
            <li>I have been applying the vitamin c serum on my face for a few days now and can honestly say that my skin feels softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>However it does not bother my sensitive skin as many other serums have done.  </li>
            <li>I am only using the product for a few days, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>but it is too soon to tell how well it will be working on this almost 72 year old skin!  </li>
            <li>Skin feels so soft after applying.</li>
            <li>I use it as the first layer, before I put on other serums and oils.</li>
            <li>Right now it is too soon to tell, but I do like the tight feeling as soon as it goes on.  </li>
            <li>My skin loves this product; I have used it for 5 days now, morning and night before I put my usual concoction of creams and potions on, and my skin feels more plump and firm.</li>

            <li> i have bought two other products from different companies and was not satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not been using it for very long yet.  </li>
            <li> One thing I do not like is how thin the liquid is as it makes it hard to accurately place it on my skin and neck</li>

            <li> I am trying to use it up on other areas of skin, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, but I believe my skin is softer!</li>
            <li> I put it on every night and every morning after cleansing and before any other products are applied.</li>
            <li> I am going to try other products from this company.</li>
            <li> It is going to replace my other serum.</li>
            <li> I hope that help with my dark spots (hormonal and sun damanged areas).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped dark pigmentation from acne scarring fade and also has made my skin feel a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> When you push down you never know where it will end, the liquid bounce from your finger to ....</li>
            <li> and I think I spilled a lot of it through my fingers because it is such a thin liquid.</li>
            <li> This unfortunately makes me break out, so I can&#x27;t use it on my face.  </li>
            <li> my skin isn&#x27;t THAT bad for my age</li>

            <li> I received my serum in just a couple of days. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, but I believe my skin is softer! I&#x27;m 60 yrs old, &amp; I am excited to see how the serum improves my skin! More as time goes by! ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> This is my second try with this product...still waiting for some results. ..my skin isn&#x27;t THAT bad for my age but I would like to see this product do more</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I was not seeing results right the way, but I was not using it 2x either. Few weeks after purchasing I am finally seing the results. My skin is not dry and it has a nice glow. I hope that help with my dark spots (hormonal and sun damanged areas).</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  I put it on every night and every morning after cleansing and before any other products are applied.</li>
            <li> So far it works great! It&#x27;s helped dark pigmentation from acne scarring fade and also has made my skin feel a lot smoother. Great product! :-)</li>
            <li> i have been looking for vitamin c serum for a while. i have bought two other products from different companies and was not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Finally i found one i like. I am going to try other products from this company.</li>
            <li> not as good as 22 percent vitamin C</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  My skin looks radiant after only 10 days. I am looking forward to seeing progressive results.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like it very much even if I waisted a lot because of the irregular pump. When you push down you never know where it will end, the liquid bounce from your finger to .... But I am learning and the bottle is not as full!!! I wish I had a refill for all the liquid gone!!!! But is good, really good!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful serum. I really luv it. It do works for the wrinkle and I see the beautiful results in one week. The skin is tighten and bright. Luv it. I totally  recommend it.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working quite well. Expect to purchase another bottle....</li>
            <li> my skin has improved a lot. I recommend the product</li>
            <li> My skin loves this product; I have used it for 5 days now, morning and night before I put my usual concoction of creams and potions on, and my skin feels more plump and firm. It soaks quickly into my skin with no greasy residue or stinging.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see any more improvement after longer use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the reason of helping a burned spot on my forehead. I missed a spot some years ago when applying sunscreen I am 66 years old and have tried other remedies to help heal that area. The product does seem to heal and moisturize the area and my entire face after shaving. I also apply it in the evening as instructed and hope to see some improvement as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;It has only been three days since I started and you can definitely see and feel the difference. Very easy to apply and dries quickly. I wait fifteen minutes and then apply a lotion on my face and neck as instructed by Integral Trading.</li>
            <li> I am only using the product for a few days, but so far so good. I use it as the first layer, before I put on other serums and oils. I use it am and pm.  It has not caused any breakouts. I will continue with the product and see if it has an effect on sagging, which is my primary concern.  Right now it is too soon to tell, but I do like the tight feeling as soon as it goes on.  I was impressed with the fast delivery of the product, and the company is really interested in making sure the customer is satisfied.</li>
            <li> Its been a couple of weeks and this product works...My skin is much clearer. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like in another couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I tried it last night and my skin seemed to drank it and wanted more!    It is going to replace my other serum. I will give this product 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> I like the idea of what is in this product but it is too soon to tell how well it will be working on this almost 72 year old skin!  One thing I do not like is how thin the liquid is as it makes it hard to accurately place it on my skin and neck and I think I spilled a lot of it through my fingers because it is such a thin liquid.</li>
            <li> very good service and great product</li>
