            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this color!!!!</li>
            <li>But you have to Apply many coats!</li>
            <li>I saw this mail polish on a friend.i was so in love with it that i just had to buy it!</li>
            <li>Glad I found it again!</li>
            <li>All of them are fab in their own way, however.</li>
            <li>I love this color I own a salon</li>
            <li>and It is one of the most popular colors here.</li>
            <li>I ordered this polish online assuming that it was the authentic opi color.  </li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t be able to read the number..</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li>it seemed more \\&quot;Barbie</li>
            <li>I ordered two more bottles.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this color on my toes in the summer.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>After doing some research it turns out that this is a replica of the original color.  </li>
            <li>This is a original OPI polish..</li>
            <li>All the original polish have bar code numbers on the handle the seller sratch the numbers off</li>
            <li>I am almost out of my original bottle.</li>
            <li>(at first I was okay with that because I figured I would just clean my cuticles up with a q-tip</li>
            <li>I originally had this in the Nicki Minaj sampler from my salon, but had to splurge on the full bottle.</li>
            <li>I received this right away and in tact!</li>
            <li>I love OPI as it has great lasting potential, which you just cant get with the cheap walmart brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually very pretty</li>
            <li>I got this shade today and really love it as a pretty light pink shade for spring.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very cool light pink....</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>but it is exactly what I wanted for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I pretty much wiped off all the polish and put the bottle away, probably never to be used again.</li>
            <li>Thus far, I have bought this and the glitter one from her collection in the full bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close to a bubble gum shade with a bit more pink.</li>
            <li>By the end my cuticles were covered with so much polish that they were beyond q-tip repair).</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item here on Amazon, and definitely got a full bottle, unlike another reviewer.</li>
            <li>Super pretty shade of pink....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Anyone find a nice soft pink that isn&#x27;t opaque and yet doesn&#x27;t dry looking streaky or chalky please let me know!</li>
            <li>Love this polish works great if you use a base coat would only need two coats  </li>
            <li>This is definitely Nicki Minaj&#x27;s signature shade of pink, which, not being a huge girly girl, I wondered how I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>You really need to apply 3 coats for total coverage, which is why it gets 4 stars and not 5.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a digital camera and have an older model cell phone.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but the bottle arrived over half empty.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t find a true soft pink once dry.</li>
            <li>I have over a hundred O.P.I. Polishes which I have been using on my fingers and toes religiously for as long as I can remember, so I know the O.P.I. brand and products very, very well.</li>
            <li>I am really digging it, though, it pops just enough to be visible without being totally in your face.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a pretty summer pink.</li>
            <li>Such a pretty baby pink color.</li>

            <li> Such a pretty baby pink color.</li>
            <li> Pink Friday has such a watery consistency that from the moment you apply your first stroke, it runs down and settles into your cuticles</li>
            <li> but then I realized I needed roughly 3 coats to smooth the streakiness that the polish leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Aside from the occasional \\&quot;what was I thinking when I picked this color?\\&quot; regret, I have never used an O.P.I. polish that I didn&#x27;t like...until Pink</li>
            <li> I am a medium-complexioned black woman and this color on my toes is the ultimate show-stopper, especially in the winter with my booties with the toes out...</li>
            <li> O.P.I last for so long compared to any other polishes and every girl needs a bautiful pink color!</li>
            <li> So it says pink Friday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite reviews about the watery consistency of this polish, I wanted to try this bubblegum pink color</li>
            <li> Oh and the bubblegum pink color everyone was raving about -</li>
            <li> This is most defiantly not the real thing it is horrible quality</li>
            <li> Just as I expected!</li>
            <li> Also, you could not tell that the bottle was half empty from the outside, so I&#x27;m not sure that a photo would have even showed it.</li>
            <li> When I received the polish it looked a little lighter than i expected.  </li>
            <li> This is not the real pink Friday</li>
            <li> I hated the color plus it looked really similar to another color I already had.</li>
            <li> get me wrong...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s FAKE the seller put a fake sticker on the bottom!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s a bad color</li>
            <li> so bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s FAKE!!</li>

            <li> I got this shade today and really love it as a pretty light pink shade for spring.  You really need to apply 3 coats for total coverage, which is why it gets 4 stars and not 5.  It goes on smooth and shiny.  I love OPI as it has great lasting potential, which you just cant get with the cheap walmart brands.</li>
            <li> I ordered this polish online assuming that it was the authentic opi color.  When I received the polish it looked a little lighter than i expected.  After doing some research it turns out that this is a replica of the original color.  It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s a bad color, it&#x27;s just not legit!</li>
            <li> If I could give no stars I will.. This is not the real pink Friday it&#x27;s FAKE the seller put a fake sticker on the bottom!! So it says pink Friday. This is a original OPI polish.. All the original polish have bar code numbers on the handle the seller sratch the numbers off so you won&#x27;t be able to read the number.. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!! It&#x27;s FAKE!! I didn&#x27;t read the reviews when I purchase it. I wish I would&#x27;ve. I would&#x27;ve saved $8</li>
            <li> Super pretty shade of pink.... Just as I expected! It&#x27;s a very cool light pink.... But you have to Apply many coats!</li>
            <li> OPI quality is great but I can&#x27;t find a true soft pink once dry. Anyone find a nice soft pink that isn&#x27;t opaque and yet doesn&#x27;t dry looking streaky or chalky please let me know!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color, but the nail polish chips the day after. This is most defiantly not the real thing it is horrible quality</li>
            <li> I saw this mail polish on a friend.i was so in love with it that i just had to buy it! Turns out when I put it on my nails I hated the color plus it looked really similar to another color I already had. I would say just save your money it&#x27;s not all that great!</li>
            <li> I love the product, but the bottle arrived over half empty. I emailed the seller and they would not do anything about it without a picture. I don&#x27;t have a digital camera and have an older model cell phone. Also, you could not tell that the bottle was half empty from the outside, so I&#x27;m not sure that a photo would have even showed it. This experience will definitely deter me from purchasing this type of product over the internet again in the future. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color. it&#x27;s such a pretty summer pink. It&#x27;s close to a bubble gum shade with a bit more pink. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product. As always with OPI nail polish, the color lasted for weeks without chipping.</li>
            <li> I have over a hundred O.P.I. Polishes which I have been using on my fingers and toes religiously for as long as I can remember, so I know the O.P.I. brand and products very, very well. Aside from the occasional \\&quot;what was I thinking when I picked this color?\\&quot; regret, I have never used an O.P.I. polish that I didn&#x27;t like...until Pink Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite reviews about the watery consistency of this polish, I wanted to try this bubblegum pink color so bad. I wish I had listened to the reviews. Pink Friday has such a watery consistency that from the moment you apply your first stroke, it runs down and settles into your cuticles (at first I was okay with that because I figured I would just clean my cuticles up with a q-tip but then I realized I needed roughly 3 coats to smooth the streakiness that the polish leaves behind. By the end my cuticles were covered with so much polish that they were beyond q-tip repair). I pretty much wiped off all the polish and put the bottle away, probably never to be used again. Oh and the bubblegum pink color everyone was raving about - it seemed more \\&quot;Barbie Peach Flesh\\&quot; color. Oh well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong...O.P.I. still has a great track record with me. I just can&#x27;t give a thumbs up for this polish. It just didn&#x27;t have that O.P.I. quality.</li>
            <li> I am a medium-complexioned black woman and this color on my toes is the ultimate show-stopper, especially in the winter with my booties with the toes out...yummy! I originally had this in the Nicki Minaj sampler from my salon, but had to splurge on the full bottle. Thus far, I have bought this and the glitter one from her collection in the full bottle. All of them are fab in their own way, however.</li>
            <li> I am almost out of my original bottle. I like this color a lot. I ordered two more bottles.  I have to agree with someone else&#x27;s comment.  It is lighter that it shows up in the picture.</li>
            <li> Love this polish works great if you use a base coat would only need two coats  got here in time</li>
            <li> Such a pretty baby pink color. O.P.I last for so long compared to any other polishes and every girl needs a bautiful pink color!</li>
            <li> I love to use this color on my toes in the summer. It looks really great when you have a bit of a tan.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly what I wanted. Had my nails done in this colour at the salon and had to get one for myself!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely Nicki Minaj&#x27;s signature shade of pink, which, not being a huge girly girl, I wondered how I&#x27;d like. I am really digging it, though, it pops just enough to be visible without being totally in your face. I&#x27;m a REALLY big fan of it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item here on Amazon, and definitely got a full bottle, unlike another reviewer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and I like the color. It&#x27;s actually very pretty and of course my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this color I own a salon and It is one of the most popular colors here. Everyone loves it!! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it again!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this color!!!! just cant get enough of it! not a fan of manaj herself but this color is a different story!!</li>
            <li> I received this right away and in tact! Have not used yet but it is exactly what I wanted for my daughter.</li>
