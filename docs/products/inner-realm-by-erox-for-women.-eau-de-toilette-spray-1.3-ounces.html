            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>and I just thought they were the best, however, Inner Realm is much better than them!</li>
            <li>My favorite scent for years</li>
            <li>Love this and the men love it too.</li>
            <li>I had so many compliments on how it smelled and had everyone asking what it was.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I plan to wear it when I go out for exercise tomorrow and wish it could attract people: )  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve traveled to many places and have not been able to find it.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>\\&quot;LOVE IT\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>perfume is excellent, smell very soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>Very light &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>It has a calming and soothing smell that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>So I was excited to see that I could purchase it.  </li>
            <li>I had used the original Realm 15 years ago</li>
            <li>It most certainly WAS NOT what it was reported to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>During special times I&#x27;ve given them as presents; that&#x27;s when i found them at the stores</li>
            <li>and it has a nice soft citrus mix with a touch of flowers.</li>
            <li>I preferred the older version better.  </li>
            <li>The amazing thing is that I would spray alittle in the morning and it would last all day.</li>
            <li>Seems to work more on women than men as far as attraction.</li>
            <li>I really hope I can find some of the original</li>
            <li>It was exacty what I expected and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>If you want a perfume that&#x27;s long lasting with a beautiful floral scent...</li>
            <li>Very soft scent refreshingly light.</li>
            <li>Consequently, a little goes a long way, so this also makes this cologne a great bargain!</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on a daily basis as this is my signature cologne.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Inner Realm for many years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>strong advice is to refuse to accept any open box item or any item that does not smell as it should from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this one again when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li>This is not the original Inner Realm product.  </li>
            <li>If the product comes in a box that is not a blue box then it is not the original.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is not sweet and smells like some nice natural herbs...</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I recieved a \\&quot;skunked\\&quot; box, but the perfume did NOT smell nice.  </li>
            <li>and so I was excited to see this new Inner Realm.  </li>
            <li>It is such a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>The main store I used to buy them was at Perfumania.  </li>
            <li>Pheromones or not, men really respond and comment positively on the Inner Realm scent for hours after application.  </li>
            <li>Although the fragrance blend is very light, it has a subtle, feminine scent that really lingers.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using Inner Realm</li>
            <li>Wife love this hard to get</li>
            <li>Overly flowery, like an old old lady.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It is hard to find, but when I do I usually get it at a great price.</li>

            <li> it was just not for me, the smell is a little to me like the old jean nate....</li>
            <li> To get a little extra attention from the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> This one is not the same as the other ones.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Been wearing this perfume for years.  Love it!  The price is good too!</li>
            <li> I think this must have been sitting on a shelf somewhere for years.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> this scent is very subtle but packs a punch.  wherever i go men as well as women ask me what i am wearing.  inner realm has become my signature scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using Inner Realm for years. it is the only perfume that I use. People ask me what I am wearing because it is not that common and it has a nice soft citrus mix with a touch of flowers. Very soft scent refreshingly light. It is not one of those overpowering perfumes that you smell a mile away. It seems to always make people around you feel pleasant. I know it makes me feel good when I put it on. It is such a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent for years</li>
            <li> I received a box of Inner Realm. It smelled terrible, just terrible. It most certainly WAS NOT what it was reported to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read numerous product reviews on Amazon with claims that the perfumes were fake. I always dismissed these, assuming that people did not know what they were talking about. However, I can assure you that Amazon is selling either fake perfumes or bad perfumes, and this is not the first time that I received a bad item from Amazon. Clearly, something is wrong with the suppliers that they use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My strong advice is to refuse to accept any open box item or any item that does not smell as it should from Amazon. If necessary, order a $1-$3 sample from one of the perfume vendors to compare. For me, moving forward any beauty item that I receive is under the microscope.</li>
            <li> Love this and the men love it too. Every time I wear this I seem. To get a little extra attention from the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> I ordered Inner Realm a few weeks ago and I&#x27;m almost down to the last drops. It was exacty what I expected and was very pleased with it. It has a calming and soothing smell that&#x27;s not too strong. The amazing thing is that I would spray alittle in the morning and it would last all day. I will definately be ordering another bottle soon. I had so many compliments on how it smelled and had everyone asking what it was. If you want a perfume that&#x27;s long lasting with a beautiful floral scent... you&#x27;ve gotta order this.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find this perfume anymore.  So I was excited to see that I could purchase it.  It came in the time they said it would with no problems.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Inner Realm for many years and really like it.  I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> It smells great,I have been using this perfume for a very long my husband gave this to me for my B&#x27;day</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Inner Realm and I just love it. I used to use Marc Jacobs fragrance like Lola, Daisy and some regular ones for years and I just thought they were the best, however, Inner Realm is much better than them! The fragrance is not sweet and smells like some nice natural herbs...I plan to wear it when I go out for exercise tomorrow and wish it could attract people: )  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I had used the original Realm 15 years ago and so I was excited to see this new Inner Realm.  I have never smelled Inner Realm before but previous reviews stating that it was \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; and \\&quot;light\\&quot; I thought I&#x27;d give this a spin.  I am not sure if I recieved a \\&quot;skunked\\&quot; box, but the perfume did NOT smell nice.  Overly flowery, like an old old lady.  I thought I would give it a try knowing that sometimes perfumes can smell very different once they interact with your body chemistry.  Still not smelling good.  Will return product.</li>
            <li> Wife love this hard to get</li>
            <li> Although the fragrance blend is very light, it has a subtle, feminine scent that really lingers.  Pheromones or not, men really respond and comment positively on the Inner Realm scent for hours after application.  Consequently, a little goes a long way, so this also makes this cologne a great bargain! The compliments make me forget (for a moment) that I&#x27;m not a 20-something anymore!!</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume that I wear.  Smells wonderful.  I get a lot of compliments when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shipper.  Great product.</li>
            <li> perfume is excellent, smell very soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t what I like to smell or smell like and no one in my family likes it either.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have worn it for years.  I do think that recently they changed the scent.  I preferred the older version better.  You will not be sorry if you purchase it.</li>
            <li> Incorrect product sent and quality of product didn&#x27;t meet our expectation. Shipped on time but disappointed to see a different product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Inner Realm (the lavender box) for years.  During special times I&#x27;ve given them as presents; that&#x27;s when i found them at the stores but the stores do not sell them anymore.  The main store I used to buy them was at Perfumania.  I&#x27;ve traveled to many places and have not been able to find it.  Sometimes, I&#x27;m puzzled that they stopped selling them at the stores.  It&#x27;s a great product and it&#x27;s a product that when I use to use it everyone would ask me &amp;#34;what I had one&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s how good this cologne/Eau De Toilette Spray is.  I also wish they made in in oil.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents. I will certainly buy this one again when I&#x27;m out. Came just as described. Love it</li>
            <li> \\&quot;LOVE IT\\&quot;. If you are not a fan of floral colognes, then this is a must try. Very light &amp; clean. I do have to say that scent smells different on different people. I get many compliments on a daily basis as this is my signature cologne. And can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I am sending this back it was just not for me, the smell is a little to me like the old jean nate....yes! I said it to me it smelled loud, old and bad...I like soft subtle fragrances. When I opened the box my daughter said I can smell that from here, and she was sitting on the couch, it does not smell like what you would use.</li>
            <li> This one is not the same as the other ones. I thing this is the knock off of other ones.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of Inner Realm, however, it does nothing else. Seems to work more on women than men as far as attraction. This makes me wonder if the scents were mixed up.</li>
            <li> This is not the original Inner Realm product.  If the product comes in a box that is not a blue box then it is not the original.  The one I received came in a pink box and I really do not like it at all. I really hope I can find some of the original product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRIOR REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to find, but when I do I usually get it at a great price. I recommend it to anyone that already knows what this line smells like.</li>
