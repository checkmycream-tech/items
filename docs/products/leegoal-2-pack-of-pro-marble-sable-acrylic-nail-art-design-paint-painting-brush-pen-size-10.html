            <li>the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>and I am used to a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li>Broke first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The handles are caps, which is cool, but I sculpted a few nails to see how they did and the acrylic gets totally stuck in the bristles and the nice fine point</li>

            <li> to clean and delicate brush.</li>
            <li> I feel like it should have a little more of a pointier tip, but there not a good quality brushes at all</li>
            <li> this is not exactly what i&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> so I could try other acrylic brands.</li>
            <li> too bad, because I was so excited to get these in the mail...</li>
            <li> Very small to be #10 see pictures comparing a ten (finger pointing) with these not #10</li>
            <li> I like them but the acrylic I brought made it mess up already.</li>
            <li> I would say they are a little smaller than an 8 and very thin flat brushes.</li>
            <li> She never going to send your merchandise, or answer them so don&#x27;t waste your time and your money.</li>
            <li> They are firm and the tops come off so you can enclose them and make them compact.</li>
            <li> At least they came in hard plastic tubes that I can use for other brushes.</li>
            <li> They are small for a size 10.</li>
            <li> Everything that looked metal was either very thin (you could bend with your finger) or actually coated plastic.</li>
            <li> They lose their shape and it&#x27;s hard to use acrylic wi this</li>
            <li> Yes, they&#x27;re cheap but these were awful.</li>
            <li> Terrible, when I received the product both of them were broken</li>
            <li> Terrible quality.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Horrible brushes!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i never use it since i bought it....this is not exactly what i&#x27;m looking for. but it look nice not just what i was looking for acrylic nail brush.</li>
            <li> These are garbage. The first use the metal fell off and left the tip inside my mono jar.</li>
            <li> Used it once and i couldnt use it again.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. Yes, they&#x27;re cheap but these were awful. Everything that looked metal was either very thin (you could bend with your finger) or actually coated plastic. Would never, ever repurchase. Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Shipping took couple weeks but I am happy with my purchase. These are way nicer than I thought. I thought they would be light cheap plastic and they are not, these or the cost are outstanding, and I will be buying more for back up. Great quality, easy to clean, pretty, durable....love</li>
            <li> I dont think this sable hair is real.. The brush clumped up and was not repairable.  I won&#x27;t waist my money if i was you.</li>
            <li> They are small for a size 10. I would say they are a little smaller than an 8 and very thin flat brushes.</li>
            <li> After waiting I finally got them I just so happy there here there great nail brushes to do acrylic with.</li>
            <li> I bought these so I could try other acrylic brands. They will serve the purpose well. I will probably not buy again because I only needed them for that purpose. I&#x27;ve been a nail tech for 24 years and I am used to a higher quality brush. If you are a beauty school student and trying lots of different products, these are perfect. I would have ordered them in bulk for my students when I was teaching beauty school. They are good enough quality for the novice sculptor and a great price so you can use a fresh brush on each product and not cross contaminate your monomers.</li>
            <li> Brush is very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> These work great, but the brush fell off the handle of one of them after only a few uses so I had to glue it back on</li>
            <li> I received these amazing brushes right away.  They are the best I have found for acrylic nails and the price was very reasonable.  I would recommend them to any nail tech.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I luv these brushes, I&#x27;ve been doing my own acrylic nails but ended up throwing away the brush at the end until I gave these a shot,and they are perfect,easy to handle and apply the acrylic,definitely will be purchasing more soon,very easy to clean,just perfect&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend them</li>
            <li> That are really good I really like them. Now I can do my nail designs how I want them .</li>
            <li> Do not buy. Broke first time I used it. All the hair just came out. Pluss they took over a month to even get here</li>
            <li> These work great for what I use them, the only complaint is that it&#x27;s quite difficult to clean them. They get the job done though.</li>
            <li> too bad, because I was so excited to get these in the mail...an hour ago. The handles are caps, which is cool, but I sculpted a few nails to see how they did and the acrylic gets totally stuck in the bristles and the nice fine point they came to is completely gone and doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;ll return any time soon. It&#x27;s so frayed I can&#x27;t get it back into the cap. At least they came in hard plastic tubes that I can use for other brushes. Don&#x27;t bother with these - guess I&#x27;ll have to spend $40 on a good brush.</li>
            <li> This brush didn&#x27;t get through a full set of nails before I had to switch to a different one. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Ordered just 8 days ago and I have received already! Great looking brushes,  thank you!</li>
            <li> I just ordered this two days ago and I live in columbia Missouri when do you think they will come in?</li>
            <li> I bought this for cosmetology school. I was very happy with my purchase. It came in within the time I was given.</li>
            <li> Fancy cheap brush that is hard to clean because the acrylic just sticks to it. and doesn&#x27;t perform well. Very small to be #10 see pictures comparing a ten (finger pointing) with these not #10</li>
            <li> Realy good for Acrylic design it can make flower french everything You want easy to clean and delicate brush. I like it</li>
            <li> I like them but the acrylic I brought made it mess up already. So make sure you use good acrylic. And it came in no time.</li>
            <li> These brushes make it easy to apply acrylic. We&#x27;ll worth the money. Fast delivery, just as described. The brushes make it easy and fast.</li>
            <li> Was happy when I got them after using them they aren&#x27;t to good. They lose their shape and it&#x27;s hard to use acrylic wi this</li>

            <li> gift to my manicurist she loves them</li>
            <li> Thief, thief and, thief. There isn&#x27;t another word for her. She never going to send your merchandise, or answer them so don&#x27;t waste your time and your money.</li>
            <li> Looks ok haven&#x27;t used them yet little flimsy</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t get this no wonder why they are so cheap.. To me I don&#x27;t like the shape of the brush it&#x27;s self I feel like it should have a little more of a pointier tip, but there not a good quality brushes at all</li>
            <li> These brushes are nicely made and so far have been the best brushes I own. It made my acrylic application so much easier. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> i use these for my glitter mixes. so if the glitter get stuck its ok because i can always buy more. they are a geat price to how well they work with acrylic nails</li>
            <li> very practical n totally meet my expectations, will order again. And very economic product and qualitie very good, easy to store.</li>

            <li> These are really crappy. I didnt expect much because they were so cheap but they arent worth the money. Put the couple bucks toward better quality brushes</li>

            <li> thanks for these great brushes. I love them. I use them to do my nails, and my granddaughter&#x27;s. Make sit so much easier.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are firm and the tops come off so you can enclose them and make them compact. Great product and a super great deal!</li>
            <li> These brushes broke before I even had a chance to use them</li>
            <li> Wonderful brushes get the job done make sure you was all your brushes when your done I&#x27;ve screwed like four of mine up because I didn&#x27;t. The handle also is the lid to the brush so they don&#x27;t get rewend</li>
