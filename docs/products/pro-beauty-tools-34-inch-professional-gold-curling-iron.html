            <li>Good value for the money, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>But it is by far the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>

            <li>Love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Possibly more.</li>
            <li>I love the gold curling irons much better than the silver ones</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this curling iron for this reason alone.</li>
            <li>Does a great job and gets super hot!</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>I agree, this is the best curling iron I have ever used; but the plastic end that you hold on to burned and broke off after less than 8 months</li>
            <li>My straight hair has a nice curl.</li>
            <li>so if this is important this is not the model for you .</li>
            <li>This thing has a long cord which she loves and works great.  </li>
            <li>is an update to my original review:  </li>
            <li>Gets the job done quickly as well.</li>
            <li>This curling iron gets the job done quickly without burning my hair.</li>
            <li>Just as described - heats up quickly, highest setting is very hot, doesnt frizz or &#x27;scorch&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li>It gets VERY hot.</li>
            <li>I have a used a ton of irons and this one is by far my favorite  </li>
            <li>But, it didn&#x27;t/doesn&#x27;t last as long as you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, good luck!</li>
            <li>This performs just fine as far as curling irons go.</li>
            <li>She melted a plastic bag with the first one.</li>
            <li>It is hot, hot, hot or you can adjust the temp.</li>
            <li>This is the first curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had that I haven&#x27;t had to turn it to the highest setting to get it to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I paid good money for this iron; I love it, but now it is useless.  </li>
            <li>I found that this certain product really did it for me!</li>
            <li>My curls stay, it heats quickly, and its completely trustworthy.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and just the right size for very short hair.</li>
            <li>I have straight straight hair and it curls and stays all day.</li>
            <li>However, not everyone wants to or can do this.  </li>
            <li>Always heats up fast, is priced reasonably.</li>
            <li>I plug it in before I brush my teeth and when I&#x27;m done (or even sooner), its ready to go.</li>
            <li>My hair is stick straight and very stubborn about wanting to curl.</li>
            <li>The cord swivels freely and plenty long.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what a Brit who travels in the Americas frequently needs.</li>
            <li>I opened up this curling iron and ALMOST sent it right back because I thought it was too skinny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many hair curlers in my life, and with my naturally curly hair (and extremely frizzy), and with it being super thick, none of the others worked.</li>
            <li>I have paid almost $100 for a CHI curling iron that completely pales in comparison to the performance, and design of this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I have old curling irons that are years old and still working with ends in tact.  </li>
            <li>The clamp is super tight even on my short and really thick hair and the tip actually stays cool enough for you to be able to hold on to it without burning.  </li>
            <li>After only about 6 months (if that), it started working intermittently, and sometimes would only work if the power cord was positioned in a certain way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, cord is plenty long, overall very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To make a long story short…I found the problem and fixed it myself!  </li>
            <li>The only reason I found myself getting a new one is because in the one I have now, the wiring is starting to short.</li>

            <li> Since I&#x27;m mechanically inclined, and it was already broken, I decided to take it apart and, possibly fix it, or, at the very least, find out what the problem was.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I hard to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>

            <li> Excellent. I have straight straight hair and it curls and stays all day.</li>
            <li> Exactly what a Brit who travels in the Americas frequently needs. Saves taking even more adaptors with me. Just what I wanted and excellent service too. Thank you.</li>

            <li> Great! curls stay in nicely and doesn&#x27;t fry hair!</li>
            <li> Great price!  Great item!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many hair curlers in my life, and with my naturally curly hair (and extremely frizzy), and with it being super thick, none of the others worked. I found that this certain product really did it for me! I&#x27;ve had it for maybe a year now? Possibly more. But it is by far the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had. My curls stay, it heats quickly, and its completely trustworthy. The only reason I found myself getting a new one is because in the one I have now, the wiring is starting to short. Oh well. Its a little nothing compared to all the greatness this styling tool gives me.</li>
            <li> I love the gold curling irons much better than the silver ones&lt;br /&gt;Works well and would buy another one for sure&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> My hair NEVER used to curl with a curling iron this curling iron works perfect! Either can&#x27;t have tight curls or beach and waves.</li>
            <li> This thing has a long cord which she loves and works great.  This is our second one.  She melted a plastic bag with the first one.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and it worked great! My straight hair has a nice curl.</li>
            <li> A great iron for the price. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Heats quickly and just the right size for very short hair.</li>
            <li> The ideal curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have paid almost $100 for a CHI curling iron that completely pales in comparison to the performance, and design of this curling iron.  It is hot, hot, hot or you can adjust the temp. lower.  The cord swivels freely and plenty long.  The clamp is super tight even on my short and really thick hair and the tip actually stays cool enough for you to be able to hold on to it without burning.  I have a used a ton of irons and this one is by far my favorite  Wish I had found this a few hundred dollars ago.</li>
            <li> I would def buy this again!</li>
            <li> I had one of these before for a long time; it finally gave out so I hard to replace it.  Didn&#x27;t even consider changing brands.  Works excellent and I use it every day!&lt;br /&gt;This is an update to my original review:  although I like the way it performed, I think that the overall design of it is somewhat flawed when it comes to the power cord.  After only about 6 months (if that), it started working intermittently, and sometimes would only work if the power cord was positioned in a certain way.  Eventually, it stopped working at all.  Since I&#x27;m mechanically inclined, and it was already broken, I decided to take it apart and, possibly fix it, or, at the very least, find out what the problem was.&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short…I found the problem and fixed it myself!  It works great now…. However, not everyone wants to or can do this.  So, if you&#x27;re looking for a product that will last a while, I would suggest that, unless you&#x27;re mechanically inclined, you might want to try a model other than this one.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong…while it was worked (before it was repaired) it was great!  But, it didn&#x27;t/doesn&#x27;t last as long as you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, good luck!</li>
            <li> Just as described - heats up quickly, highest setting is very hot, doesnt frizz or &#x27;scorch&#x27; hair.  Has held up for almost a year.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, cord is plenty long, overall very comfortable to use.  It doesn&#x27;t have auto-off, which I would have deducted for, but I knew that when I purchased.  Definitely prefer over a much more expensive item purchased at local drug store.</li>
            <li> This performs just fine as far as curling irons go. What I like best about this is the cord. The cord is covered with a non twist covering. Love this curling iron for this reason alone.</li>
            <li> Always heats up fast, is priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> Gifted it and it turned out great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of curling irons in the 30 years I&#x27;ve been curling my hair. This is the best one yet. It heats up very quickly. I plug it in before I brush my teeth and when I&#x27;m done (or even sooner), its ready to go. It grips my very thin, fine hair well. It gets VERY hot. This is the first curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had that I haven&#x27;t had to turn it to the highest setting to get it to curl my hair. My hair is stick straight and very stubborn about wanting to curl. This curling iron gets the job done quickly without burning my hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> I agree, this is the best curling iron I have ever used; but the plastic end that you hold on to burned and broke off after less than 8 months and they will not refund or replace.  I paid good money for this iron; I love it, but now it is useless.  You can&#x27;t curl without using the tip to hold on to.  I have old curling irons that are years old and still working with ends in tact.  This was not worth what I paid if 8 MONTHS s the only use I get out of it. I don&#x27;t know which bothers me the most; the cost, the lack of long term performance or the failure of SOMEONE  to stand behind this product and give me some satisfaction.  Probably the latter.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR IF YOU DO BEWARE!!</li>
            <li> I have a shorter, angled bob and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a curling iron that gives me loose waves without looking too matronly. I opened up this curling iron and ALMOST sent it right back because I thought it was too skinny. Wrong! Perfect curls and waves, and don&#x27;t have to turn up the heat all the way. Loving the style it gives my hair!</li>
            <li> Good value for the money, easy to use.  It does not have an auto shut off so if this is important this is not the model for you .</li>
