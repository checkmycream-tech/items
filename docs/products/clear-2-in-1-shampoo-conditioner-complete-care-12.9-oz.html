    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with all of them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very impressed with this brand of men&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like this packaging - although it is very attractive to look at.  </li>
            <li>It turned out to be the best decision I have ever made in regards to my hair/scalp</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and seems to work well for a 2 in 1 product.</li>
            <li>Very  nice.</li>
            <li>smells great and works good</li>
            <li>smells so good great stocking stuffer or just because gift.</li>
            <li>I know tea tree is a good counter for germs and bacteria, but men should understand that tea tree oil raises our estrogen levels and should be avoided, just like soy and soy beans/edamame.</li>
            <li>It also smells good.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my son to try and he loved it.</li>
            <li>He loved the 2 in 1 aspect of it.</li>
            <li>Good riddance scalp and hair \\&quot;mood</li>
            <li>Loved the way it made my hair and scalp feel.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite 2n1 Shampoo/Conditioner products!</li>
            <li>Still, I couldn&#x27;t convince my husband to try it, so I used it on my Own shorter hair.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>nice shampoo specialy after the pool or the beach</li>
            <li>The anti-dandruff approach is the best choice for my husband, though he doesn&#x27;t suffer anything really requiring clinical strength.</li>
            <li>My spouse does not spend a lot of time on his hair, yet he likes his hair to look nice.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I find that the inclusion of a conditioner is handy, saving a step.</li>
            <li>so you are kind of just stuck waiting on gravity.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, like I said, and it does feel nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice having both shampoo and conditioner in one.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a pleasant herbal, minty scent and does a good job cleaning the hair and scalp and rinses clean despite being a shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely, rinses easily and smells good.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t take the cap off very easily to access the contents</li>
            <li>Clear Men&#x27;s Scalp therapy is a good product with a pleasant smell and good lather.  </li>
            <li>A fine shampoo/conditioner, smells nice and leaves hair nice.</li>
            <li>Not the greatest innovation in shampoo in the last year, but it works nicely.  </li>
            <li>He says it leaves his hair clean and is as good as anything else out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This has worked so much better than head and shoulders for me in stopping my dandruff.</li>
            <li>Like most people, I get a bit of dandruff now and then.</li>
            <li>OK, it&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner in one.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves  nice smooth hair (mines shoulder length) without that greasy feeling</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the 2/1 worked OK.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Notably it did not linger my hair.</li>
            <li>My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better.</li>
            <li>This product is comparable to Head and Shoulders with the difference being that this has more lather and a more pleasing scent.  </li>
            <li>: It smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>its okay.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this shampoo smells.  </li>
            <li>is much better about this stuff</li>
            <li>I HAVE DANDRUFF smell, but more of an Aveda-type scent.</li>
            <li>shampoo cleans well and the conditioning component is light and effective.</li>
            <li>try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it</li>
            <li>This product was better than most.</li>
            <li>pyrithione zinc will work best if the shampoo is massaged thoroughly into the scalp and left in place for a while before rinsing.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s performance for those who have more severe cases of dandruff.</li>
            <li>It is most likely not the best choice for more severe cases of dandruff, but for mild conditions it works nicely.</li>
            <li>The lather - in this kind - is not quite as luxurious as the shampoo alone, but once you get it lathering it is fairly rich.  </li>
            <li>Just a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>and I think that this will last a great deal longer than the others and also continue to be more effective.</li>
            <li>I still had some itching, but no flaking.&lt;br /&gt;The added conditioner means your hair is very soft; which is great if you need conditioner.</li>
            <li>This has a much more refreshing, modern, botanical scent from the tea tree, mint, and ginseng (honestly, I don&#x27;t know how ginseng smells, so I&#x27;d pin it more on the tea tree and mint).</li>
            <li>The active ingredient in the product is 1% pyrethione zinc which for me cleanses my scalp perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Hello to clean, nourished, fortified hair and a repaired, comfortable, healthy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all it does a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The thing about dandruff shampoo is that most of them feel like you are spreading peanut butter in your hair and smell pretty foul on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, so it&#x27;s a huge let-down when the contents end-up in the box and not in my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo dispenses freely but in a controlled way and lathers up well.</li>
            <li>As for my scalp, I have been itch and flake free since the beginning of my use of this product and it has never felt healthier.</li>
            <li>They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far.</li>
            <li>it smells great, and works better than other brands.</li>
            <li>It left my hair clean and great smelling, and no itch -</li>
            <li>Great for men (as marketed - or short women&#x27;s hair), not so great for long hair.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m confident in my opinion that you&#x27;ll most likely be just as satisfied with your results after using this product as I am.</li>
            <li>it keeps your hair clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and light, neither feminine or masculine.</li>
            <li>Clean floral?</li>
            <li>Shampoo gets my hair thoroughly clean and the built-in conditioner leaves</li>
            <li>I feel like the shampoo can&#x27;t clean well because of the conditioner, and the conditioner can&#x27;t condition well because of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>The lather was nice and rich, and it takes very little product to get a good lather build.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(For reference, pretty much any Pyrithione Zinc 1% dandruff shampoo, from the fancy stuff to the store brand, is equally effective in eliminating my dandruff.</li>
            <li>I just wish the travel size was easier to find since I tend to end up carrying a full bottle with me when traveling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It leaves my hair much softer than most 2 in 1.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not only does the job of controlling my dandruff, but feels and smells good.</li>
            <li>The sensation it gave my scalp was very soothing and enjoyable.</li>
            <li>The pretty smell is strong when I put it on my hair but when I am done</li>
            <li>The smell was a bit strong at first</li>
            <li>After just one week this of using this product, it has made and KEPT my hair clean, soft, healthy, and free of excess oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crisp and clean smelling, with a light citrusy note, not medicinal like a lot of hippy dippy tea tree shampoos.</li>
            <li>definitely has worked much better than Head and Shoulders for me :)</li>
            <li>I think it would be best suited for men with very short hair or women with thinner-textured short hair.</li>
            <li>If you have mild dandruff, and you are looking for a 2-in-1 anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;chemically,\\</li>
            <li>This is a great bargain product that treats the average case of dandruff problems, and the shampoo/conditioner combination doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling in the hair.  </li>
            <li>This Clear \\&quot;Complete Care 2in1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner\\&quot; works well to clean my hair and control my dandruff, while leaving a fairly pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t scratch for about a week after using and he smelled really good, just like the shampoo, for almost just as long.</li>
            <li>around good product for men with scalp itch and minor dandruff, as well as for dogs with itchy skin issues.</li>
            <li>For a \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; product, this has an appealingly clean, light scent, not at all like the heavy cologne scents many men&#x27;s products have, making it suitable for anyone in the family.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and healthy smelling without being overly masculine or feminine.  </li>
            <li>We generally choose Head and Shoulders or a \\&quot;store brand\\&quot; knock off, and find that this Clear shampoo is just as effective, but has a much better smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and because it does have a more masculine</li>
            <li>verdict was that the Clear 2/1 works OK.  </li>
            <li>The scent was fresh and invigorating.  </li>
            <li>So it will be up to you to determine the if the cost is worth it to you to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>but I figured it was worth a</li>
            <li>In my experience, none of them eliminate dandruff, but most all of them reduce it considerably.</li>
            <li>Then after reading many reviews on here, I decided to make the commitment and purchased the Complete Care 2-in-1</li>
            <li>The Clear Men Scalp Therapy smells wonderful as well, and it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice light fragrance and really clears up dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt the need to express my personal joy and opinions about a shampoo before but this is a product worthy of my personal 5-star rating.</li>
            <li>shampoo lathers nicely and leaves my hair somewhat \\&quot;dryer\\&quot; than most other conditioning shampoos, which is good for my very short hair but not to my son&#x27;s liking since he has fairly a long and full head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great for me as have no more issues.</li>
            <li>Some things I&#x27;ve loved (shampoos/conditioners) and some things I&#x27;ve been a bit less</li>
            <li>My husband has been using CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Complete Care 2in1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for about a month now, and seems to feel kind of ambivalent about it.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>As my hair is naturally fine and soft, the conditioner made it droopy.</li>
            <li>This particular type (the complete care with shampoo and conditioner) is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>Price was better than local stores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT, unless you have dandruff and believe the label, it may be better value to get a generic shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It has 10 nutrients- all that help nourish my hair ;)</li>
            <li>My favorite of the ten?</li>
            <li>The lather is middle of the road, ok to use, but not abundant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use conditioners and am not into shampoos that have \\&quot;pretty smells.\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure a seperate conditioner may be in order, but for me personally, I only use this product when washing my hair.  </li>
            <li>desired results and first impressions at the start of using the product</li>
            <li>at my local carrier store which happened to be buy one, get one free (an added bonus)!</li>
            <li>this magic in a bottle for yourself and see how it works for your current hair conditions.</li>
            <li>I have always liked the idea of shampoo and conditioner in one product, but usually found the results to be less than great.</li>
            <li>: Before running out to my nearest carrier store, I went to the Clear website and did my research on what their product variations claimed to do and found that the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Complete Care 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner claimed to be the best solution for my desired results; to have a soft, touchable head of hair that was deeply cleansed and free of excess oil and residue, as well as a healthier, nourished scalp free of my occasional flakes and itch.</li>
            <li>It also keeps his face clean and clear too.</li>
            <li>Ok, call me sexist, but I really expected this particular shampoo to smell more masculine.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products to help with  my scalp and most shampoos left my hair dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>After seeing the Clear Men anti-dandruff shampoo commercial for the two thousandth time I finally convinced myself to give it a try, regardless of saying \\&quot;looks like a great shampoo, but Idon&#x27;t have dandruff...</li>
            <li>figured I would try this shampoo, as well as other Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoos,  based on the reviews and see if it was as good as my store brand shampoo and coal tar shampoo.</li>
            <li>(personally I want to smell  like a man I don&#x27;t want a strong scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has tea tree oil and mint in it, and some other essential oils that make a really  nice clean, sorta herbal smell.  </li>
            <li>If you had short hair or needed 1 bottle to take to the gym, this would be fine.  </li>
            <li>For him, as an anti-dandruff it seemed to be as effective &amp; his head &amp; shoulders shampoo, but with an additional conditioner, he thought that his hair was a little \\&quot;lighter\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The first use was a pleasant experience to say the least!</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to actually leak and the buildup isn&#x27;t hurting anything and is easy enough to clean.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to try it in the womens.</li>
            <li>It is a fresh, masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Really can&#x27;t speak to the promised dandruff relief as I don&#x27;t have that issue and hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t count on much conditioning however.</li>
            <li>They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I much prefer the separate shampoo and conditioner for performance.  </li>
            <li>, I may switch my shampoo preference to this product because I like it so much.</li>
            <li>If you have/had similar problems that I did before my start of using Clear Men Complete Care 2-in-1, then you&#x27;ll most likely be enjoying a healthy head of hair in the near future as well.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>But this product really does the trick without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>Not too much because tea tree has a very step g odor.</li>
            <li>After several weeks of using Clear Men Scalp Therapy, my husband and I have this to say:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Works much better for me than other brands.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s effective for dandruff and itch control - but past that I really didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of benefit with it.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it suds up very well, and has a decent scent</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean enough, and conditioned enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a 24 year old male with no history of hair loss in my family I started truly becoming concerned about the health of my scalp from the amount of hair</li>
            <li>It smells nicer than the brands of anti-dandruff shampoo he has used before, with none of the medicinal smells that really turn me off, but it is only adequate at the anti-dandruff part.  </li>
            <li>I switched over to Clear Men Scalp Therapy when I first heard about, so I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now.</li>
            <li>This 2in1 shampoo and conditioner from CLEAR works pretty well.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a new men&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner combo!</li>
            <li>Most shampoos I&#x27;ve tried only last for about 12 hours</li>
            <li>It does a decent job of controlling dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I could find it at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>great on dandruff (possibly a little slower than other brands, but not much).&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair clean for a very long time and 24 hours after cleaning, my hair does not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much soy by-products in processed foods that to use tea tree oil is just adding another ingredient into raising our estrogen level and a manufacturer of men&#x27;s products should know this and find another natural product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the smell.</li>
            <li>The result after my first time using this 2-in-1 was a very soft and clean head of hair with no weigh down.</li>
            <li>However, my hair is fine and very short (for a woman), so anyone with longer or coarser hair might not experience the same thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find this at a Walmart when I was helping cleanup after hurricane sandy in New Jersey.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it lathers very well with only a small amount, and seems to clean my hair and treat my scalp at the same time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is slightly floral, but neither strong nor feminine.</li>
            <li>Clear doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>Amazon usually does better than this.</li>
            <li>someone with longer hair (I have pretty short hair)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a bit fan of 2-in-1 hair care products.</li>
            <li>I love that this has the added ingredient tea tree because I use tea tree oil to help control my dry scalp, so I know this will help alleviate his dry scalp and dandruff</li>
            <li>Personally, price is important to me for such a product, so only really desireable if competitively priced.</li>
            <li>Some hair care products that bring amazing results for one individual may not produce the same results to another individual, even if the situation is the same.</li>
            <li>he gave me a sample bottle of this Clear Men Scalp Therapy.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell the difference between the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoos I tried.</li>
            <li>Instead, it has a bit of a floral overtone - not that men can&#x27;t smell flowery, but it surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>appreciate the fact that it combines both a shampoo and conditioner, and as far as dandruff, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft, but \\&quot;not too</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li>My brother used to battle the flake when his hair was longer and he used old fashioned styling product (think sticky hair tonic).  </li>
            <li>My son said he didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between the shampoo and the combined shampoo and conditioner that he tried, but since the price is the same it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use the one with the added conditioner.</li>
            <li>Natural Mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as controlling dandruff, it does just about as well as Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old son has had dandruff problems for years.</li>
            <li>MEN SCALP THERAPY Complete Care 2in1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner</li>
            <li>For starters, this has the same active ingredient (Pyrithione Zinc) and concentration (1%) as every other dandruff shampoo, so if they&#x27;re effective for you, this will be too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic, not the usual 70s</li>
            <li>I personally normally use a seperate shampoo and conditioner at the same time, but with this product I have found that I don&#x27;t need the seperate conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying out a lot of this new line of hair care products, owning multiple shampoos, conditioners, scalp treatments &amp; hair balms.  </li>
            <li>but it dissipated pretty quickly afterwards and when my hair was completely dry there was no more lingering</li>
            <li>bottle is not recyclable in my area, although I know other areas can recycle the higher plastic</li>
            <li>design makes it easier to control how much you get each time (no really, it does, not a marketing gimmick or something).&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Final and current results after some months of use: I&#x27;ll just sum this part up by saying that this Complete Care 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner from ClearMen is now a mainstay in my shower.</li>
            <li>Even within just a few hours of taking a fresh shower.</li>
            <li>The New Clear Men Scalp Therapy Complete Care 2 in 1 Anti Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner looked perfect for my teenage soon who has terrible dandruff problems but he has to alternate between different anti-dandruff shampoos because after awhile they just stop working on him.</li>
            <li>However, the smell here is not overwhelming, and the next day after use, my hair still smells clean and not medicated.  </li>
            <li>I will admit  the ginseng, mint and tea tree ingredients that are listed on this product made me a little nervous as did the \\&quot;pretty smell\\&quot;</li>
            <li>certainly is an acceptable, relatively inexpensive alternative to other products out there.  </li>
            <li>After the initial switch-over period, my dandruff started to lessen right away (same as usual) and it&#x27;s been completely gone since then.</li>
            <li>: I have a short, thick, pretty normal head of hair (Caucasian) with occasional itchy scalp and flakes.</li>
            <li>with other Clear products i&#x27;ve tried, the conditioner is very light, and left my hair a little bit fluffy.</li>
            <li>combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient, pyrithione zinc, has antibacterial and antifungal properties and is commonly used to treat many different disorders of the skin.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have really commented on saying whether or not my scalp was soothed or nourished at the time, (probably because of all the damage that previous products did), but if I ever had an idea as to what a soothed and nourished scalp felt like, I definitely felt it.</li>
            <li>start to kill my hair after using it non-stop for more than a few weeks like other brands (i.e. I can use the shampoo daily without having to switch like with other brands).&lt;br /&gt;-Lathers</li>
            <li>The plastic is very hard and it&#x27;s hard to get a good squeeze on it to force the product out even though the bottle sits inverted and gravity should have it all going to the bottom...</li>
            <li>I added a few drops or pure tea tree oil to the bottle for added antibacterial benefit.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little much, but</li>
            <li>Probably not as conditioning as a heavy separate rinse, but certainly does the job--especially for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> and I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with all of them.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very impressed with this brand of men&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like this packaging - although it is very attractive to look at.  </li>
            <li> It turned out to be the best decision I have ever made in regards to my hair/scalp</li>
            <li> It has a great smell and seems to work well for a 2 in 1 product.</li>
            <li> Very  nice.</li>
            <li> smells great and works good</li>
            <li> smells so good great stocking stuffer or just because gift.</li>
            <li> I know tea tree is a good counter for germs and bacteria, but men should understand that tea tree oil raises our estrogen levels and should be avoided, just like soy and soy beans/edamame.</li>
            <li> It also smells good.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my son to try and he loved it.</li>
            <li> He loved the 2 in 1 aspect of it.</li>
            <li> Good riddance scalp and hair \\&quot;mood</li>
            <li> Loved the way it made my hair and scalp feel.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite 2n1 Shampoo/Conditioner products!</li>
            <li> Still, I couldn&#x27;t convince my husband to try it, so I used it on my Own shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> nice shampoo specialy after the pool or the beach</li>
            <li> The anti-dandruff approach is the best choice for my husband, though he doesn&#x27;t suffer anything really requiring clinical strength.</li>
            <li> My spouse does not spend a lot of time on his hair, yet he likes his hair to look nice.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I find that the inclusion of a conditioner is handy, saving a step.</li>
            <li> so you are kind of just stuck waiting on gravity.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, like I said, and it does feel nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice having both shampoo and conditioner in one.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a pleasant herbal, minty scent and does a good job cleaning the hair and scalp and rinses clean despite being a shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> It lathers up nicely, rinses easily and smells good.</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t take the cap off very easily to access the contents</li>
            <li> Clear Men&#x27;s Scalp therapy is a good product with a pleasant smell and good lather.  </li>
            <li> A fine shampoo/conditioner, smells nice and leaves hair nice.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest innovation in shampoo in the last year, but it works nicely.  </li>
            <li> He says it leaves his hair clean and is as good as anything else out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This has worked so much better than head and shoulders for me in stopping my dandruff.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I get a bit of dandruff now and then.</li>
            <li> OK, it&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner in one.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves  nice smooth hair (mines shoulder length) without that greasy feeling</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the 2/1 worked OK.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Notably it did not linger my hair.</li>
            <li> My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better.</li>
            <li> This product is comparable to Head and Shoulders with the difference being that this has more lather and a more pleasing scent.  </li>
            <li> : It smells lovely.  </li>
            <li> its okay.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo smells.  </li>
            <li> is much better about this stuff</li>
            <li> I HAVE DANDRUFF smell, but more of an Aveda-type scent.</li>
            <li> shampoo cleans well and the conditioning component is light and effective.</li>
            <li> try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it</li>
            <li> This product was better than most.</li>
            <li> pyrithione zinc will work best if the shampoo is massaged thoroughly into the scalp and left in place for a while before rinsing.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s performance for those who have more severe cases of dandruff.</li>
            <li> It is most likely not the best choice for more severe cases of dandruff, but for mild conditions it works nicely.</li>
            <li> The lather - in this kind - is not quite as luxurious as the shampoo alone, but once you get it lathering it is fairly rich.  </li>
            <li> Just a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> and I think that this will last a great deal longer than the others and also continue to be more effective.</li>
            <li> I still had some itching, but no flaking.&lt;br /&gt;The added conditioner means your hair is very soft; which is great if you need conditioner.</li>
            <li> This has a much more refreshing, modern, botanical scent from the tea tree, mint, and ginseng (honestly, I don&#x27;t know how ginseng smells, so I&#x27;d pin it more on the tea tree and mint).</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in the product is 1% pyrethione zinc which for me cleanses my scalp perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Hello to clean, nourished, fortified hair and a repaired, comfortable, healthy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all it does a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thing about dandruff shampoo is that most of them feel like you are spreading peanut butter in your hair and smell pretty foul on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s a huge let-down when the contents end-up in the box and not in my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo dispenses freely but in a controlled way and lathers up well.</li>
            <li> As for my scalp, I have been itch and flake free since the beginning of my use of this product and it has never felt healthier.</li>
            <li> They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far.</li>
            <li> it smells great, and works better than other brands.</li>
            <li> It left my hair clean and great smelling, and no itch -</li>
            <li> Great for men (as marketed - or short women&#x27;s hair), not so great for long hair.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m confident in my opinion that you&#x27;ll most likely be just as satisfied with your results after using this product as I am.</li>
            <li> it keeps your hair clean.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and light, neither feminine or masculine.</li>
            <li> Clean floral?</li>
            <li> Shampoo gets my hair thoroughly clean and the built-in conditioner leaves</li>
            <li> I feel like the shampoo can&#x27;t clean well because of the conditioner, and the conditioner can&#x27;t condition well because of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The lather was nice and rich, and it takes very little product to get a good lather build.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(For reference, pretty much any Pyrithione Zinc 1% dandruff shampoo, from the fancy stuff to the store brand, is equally effective in eliminating my dandruff.</li>
            <li> I just wish the travel size was easier to find since I tend to end up carrying a full bottle with me when traveling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It leaves my hair much softer than most 2 in 1.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not only does the job of controlling my dandruff, but feels and smells good.</li>
            <li> The sensation it gave my scalp was very soothing and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> The pretty smell is strong when I put it on my hair but when I am done</li>
            <li> The smell was a bit strong at first</li>
            <li> After just one week this of using this product, it has made and KEPT my hair clean, soft, healthy, and free of excess oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crisp and clean smelling, with a light citrusy note, not medicinal like a lot of hippy dippy tea tree shampoos.</li>
            <li> definitely has worked much better than Head and Shoulders for me :)</li>
            <li> I think it would be best suited for men with very short hair or women with thinner-textured short hair.</li>
            <li> If you have mild dandruff, and you are looking for a 2-in-1 anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;chemically,\\</li>
            <li> This is a great bargain product that treats the average case of dandruff problems, and the shampoo/conditioner combination doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling in the hair.  </li>
            <li> This Clear \\&quot;Complete Care 2in1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner\\&quot; works well to clean my hair and control my dandruff, while leaving a fairly pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t scratch for about a week after using and he smelled really good, just like the shampoo, for almost just as long.</li>
            <li> around good product for men with scalp itch and minor dandruff, as well as for dogs with itchy skin issues.</li>
            <li> For a \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; product, this has an appealingly clean, light scent, not at all like the heavy cologne scents many men&#x27;s products have, making it suitable for anyone in the family.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean and healthy smelling without being overly masculine or feminine.  </li>
            <li> We generally choose Head and Shoulders or a \\&quot;store brand\\&quot; knock off, and find that this Clear shampoo is just as effective, but has a much better smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and because it does have a more masculine</li>
            <li> verdict was that the Clear 2/1 works OK.  </li>
            <li> The scent was fresh and invigorating.  </li>
            <li> So it will be up to you to determine the if the cost is worth it to you to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> but I figured it was worth a</li>
            <li> In my experience, none of them eliminate dandruff, but most all of them reduce it considerably.</li>
            <li> Then after reading many reviews on here, I decided to make the commitment and purchased the Complete Care 2-in-1</li>
            <li> The Clear Men Scalp Therapy smells wonderful as well, and it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice light fragrance and really clears up dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt the need to express my personal joy and opinions about a shampoo before but this is a product worthy of my personal 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> shampoo lathers nicely and leaves my hair somewhat \\&quot;dryer\\&quot; than most other conditioning shampoos, which is good for my very short hair but not to my son&#x27;s liking since he has fairly a long and full head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great for me as have no more issues.</li>
            <li> Some things I&#x27;ve loved (shampoos/conditioners) and some things I&#x27;ve been a bit less</li>
            <li> My husband has been using CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Complete Care 2in1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for about a month now, and seems to feel kind of ambivalent about it.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> As my hair is naturally fine and soft, the conditioner made it droopy.</li>
            <li> This particular type (the complete care with shampoo and conditioner) is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li> Price was better than local stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT, unless you have dandruff and believe the label, it may be better value to get a generic shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It has 10 nutrients- all that help nourish my hair ;)</li>
            <li> My favorite of the ten?</li>
            <li> The lather is middle of the road, ok to use, but not abundant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use conditioners and am not into shampoos that have \\&quot;pretty smells.\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure a seperate conditioner may be in order, but for me personally, I only use this product when washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> desired results and first impressions at the start of using the product</li>
            <li> at my local carrier store which happened to be buy one, get one free (an added bonus)!</li>
            <li> this magic in a bottle for yourself and see how it works for your current hair conditions.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the idea of shampoo and conditioner in one product, but usually found the results to be less than great.</li>
            <li> : Before running out to my nearest carrier store, I went to the Clear website and did my research on what their product variations claimed to do and found that the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Complete Care 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner claimed to be the best solution for my desired results; to have a soft, touchable head of hair that was deeply cleansed and free of excess oil and residue, as well as a healthier, nourished scalp free of my occasional flakes and itch.</li>
            <li> It also keeps his face clean and clear too.</li>
            <li> Ok, call me sexist, but I really expected this particular shampoo to smell more masculine.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products to help with  my scalp and most shampoos left my hair dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> After seeing the Clear Men anti-dandruff shampoo commercial for the two thousandth time I finally convinced myself to give it a try, regardless of saying \\&quot;looks like a great shampoo, but Idon&#x27;t have dandruff...</li>
            <li> figured I would try this shampoo, as well as other Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoos,  based on the reviews and see if it was as good as my store brand shampoo and coal tar shampoo.</li>
            <li> (personally I want to smell  like a man I don&#x27;t want a strong scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has tea tree oil and mint in it, and some other essential oils that make a really  nice clean, sorta herbal smell.  </li>
            <li> If you had short hair or needed 1 bottle to take to the gym, this would be fine.  </li>
            <li> For him, as an anti-dandruff it seemed to be as effective &amp; his head &amp; shoulders shampoo, but with an additional conditioner, he thought that his hair was a little \\&quot;lighter\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The first use was a pleasant experience to say the least!</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to actually leak and the buildup isn&#x27;t hurting anything and is easy enough to clean.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to try it in the womens.</li>
            <li> It is a fresh, masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t speak to the promised dandruff relief as I don&#x27;t have that issue and hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t count on much conditioning however.</li>
            <li> They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I much prefer the separate shampoo and conditioner for performance.  </li>
            <li> , I may switch my shampoo preference to this product because I like it so much.</li>
            <li> If you have/had similar problems that I did before my start of using Clear Men Complete Care 2-in-1, then you&#x27;ll most likely be enjoying a healthy head of hair in the near future as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> But this product really does the trick without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> Not too much because tea tree has a very step g odor.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of using Clear Men Scalp Therapy, my husband and I have this to say:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Works much better for me than other brands.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s effective for dandruff and itch control - but past that I really didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of benefit with it.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it suds up very well, and has a decent scent</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean enough, and conditioned enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a 24 year old male with no history of hair loss in my family I started truly becoming concerned about the health of my scalp from the amount of hair</li>
            <li> It smells nicer than the brands of anti-dandruff shampoo he has used before, with none of the medicinal smells that really turn me off, but it is only adequate at the anti-dandruff part.  </li>
            <li> I switched over to Clear Men Scalp Therapy when I first heard about, so I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now.</li>
            <li> This 2in1 shampoo and conditioner from CLEAR works pretty well.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a new men&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner combo!</li>
            <li> Most shampoos I&#x27;ve tried only last for about 12 hours</li>
            <li> It does a decent job of controlling dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I could find it at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> great on dandruff (possibly a little slower than other brands, but not much).&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair clean for a very long time and 24 hours after cleaning, my hair does not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much soy by-products in processed foods that to use tea tree oil is just adding another ingredient into raising our estrogen level and a manufacturer of men&#x27;s products should know this and find another natural product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the smell.</li>
            <li> The result after my first time using this 2-in-1 was a very soft and clean head of hair with no weigh down.</li>
            <li> However, my hair is fine and very short (for a woman), so anyone with longer or coarser hair might not experience the same thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find this at a Walmart when I was helping cleanup after hurricane sandy in New Jersey.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it lathers very well with only a small amount, and seems to clean my hair and treat my scalp at the same time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is slightly floral, but neither strong nor feminine.</li>
            <li> Clear doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Amazon usually does better than this.</li>
            <li> someone with longer hair (I have pretty short hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a bit fan of 2-in-1 hair care products.</li>
            <li> I love that this has the added ingredient tea tree because I use tea tree oil to help control my dry scalp, so I know this will help alleviate his dry scalp and dandruff</li>
            <li> Personally, price is important to me for such a product, so only really desireable if competitively priced.</li>
            <li> Some hair care products that bring amazing results for one individual may not produce the same results to another individual, even if the situation is the same.</li>
            <li> he gave me a sample bottle of this Clear Men Scalp Therapy.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell the difference between the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoos I tried.</li>
            <li> Instead, it has a bit of a floral overtone - not that men can&#x27;t smell flowery, but it surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> appreciate the fact that it combines both a shampoo and conditioner, and as far as dandruff, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft, but \\&quot;not too</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li> My brother used to battle the flake when his hair was longer and he used old fashioned styling product (think sticky hair tonic).  </li>
            <li> My son said he didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between the shampoo and the combined shampoo and conditioner that he tried, but since the price is the same it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use the one with the added conditioner.</li>
            <li> Natural Mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as controlling dandruff, it does just about as well as Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old son has had dandruff problems for years.</li>
            <li> MEN SCALP THERAPY Complete Care 2in1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner</li>
            <li> For starters, this has the same active ingredient (Pyrithione Zinc) and concentration (1%) as every other dandruff shampoo, so if they&#x27;re effective for you, this will be too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic, not the usual 70s</li>
            <li> I personally normally use a seperate shampoo and conditioner at the same time, but with this product I have found that I don&#x27;t need the seperate conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out a lot of this new line of hair care products, owning multiple shampoos, conditioners, scalp treatments &amp; hair balms.  </li>
            <li> but it dissipated pretty quickly afterwards and when my hair was completely dry there was no more lingering</li>
            <li> bottle is not recyclable in my area, although I know other areas can recycle the higher plastic</li>
            <li> design makes it easier to control how much you get each time (no really, it does, not a marketing gimmick or something).&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Final and current results after some months of use: I&#x27;ll just sum this part up by saying that this Complete Care 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner from ClearMen is now a mainstay in my shower.</li>
            <li> Even within just a few hours of taking a fresh shower.</li>
            <li> The New Clear Men Scalp Therapy Complete Care 2 in 1 Anti Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner looked perfect for my teenage soon who has terrible dandruff problems but he has to alternate between different anti-dandruff shampoos because after awhile they just stop working on him.</li>
            <li> However, the smell here is not overwhelming, and the next day after use, my hair still smells clean and not medicated.  </li>
            <li> I will admit  the ginseng, mint and tea tree ingredients that are listed on this product made me a little nervous as did the \\&quot;pretty smell\\&quot;</li>
            <li> certainly is an acceptable, relatively inexpensive alternative to other products out there.  </li>
            <li> After the initial switch-over period, my dandruff started to lessen right away (same as usual) and it&#x27;s been completely gone since then.</li>
            <li> : I have a short, thick, pretty normal head of hair (Caucasian) with occasional itchy scalp and flakes.</li>
            <li> with other Clear products i&#x27;ve tried, the conditioner is very light, and left my hair a little bit fluffy.</li>
            <li> combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient, pyrithione zinc, has antibacterial and antifungal properties and is commonly used to treat many different disorders of the skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have really commented on saying whether or not my scalp was soothed or nourished at the time, (probably because of all the damage that previous products did), but if I ever had an idea as to what a soothed and nourished scalp felt like, I definitely felt it.</li>
            <li> start to kill my hair after using it non-stop for more than a few weeks like other brands (i.e. I can use the shampoo daily without having to switch like with other brands).&lt;br /&gt;-Lathers</li>
            <li> The plastic is very hard and it&#x27;s hard to get a good squeeze on it to force the product out even though the bottle sits inverted and gravity should have it all going to the bottom...</li>
            <li> I added a few drops or pure tea tree oil to the bottle for added antibacterial benefit.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little much, but</li>
            <li> Probably not as conditioning as a heavy separate rinse, but certainly does the job--especially for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I put my old Pantene hair care routine to rest and started experimenting with other different products and treatments in an attempt to remedy my hair and scalp conditions.</li>
            <li> He has fine hair, so \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; could mean fly-away, but in this case, it combed down &amp; looked the same as it did with the H&amp;S product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoos I tried have Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%) as the active ingredient</li>
            <li> I would buy it if it were less expensive than Head and Shoulders, but would not seek it out to purchase based on it&#x27;s own middle of the road merit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long hair though, and the conditioning aspect of this combo version wasn&#x27;t enough to suit me.</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s a tall bottle with a weird shape, it doesn&#x27;t tip over easily,</li>
            <li> One day my hair would go from feeling coarse and dry with an itchy scalp and</li>
            <li> used it a few times for my dog too, who also has periods of dandruff from time to time and it left his coat soft, sleek and shiny.</li>
            <li> So having used this product for the past 2 months, here is a breakdown of my personal experience with my past hair and scalp conditions, my desired results when I first started using the product, and the final results of my hair and scalp conditions after having used this Clear Men Scalp Therapy Complete Care 2-in-1 for the past 2 months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s dandruff is moderate but he has to wash his hair everyday just to keep it under control, but with the Clear Mean Scalp Therapy Shampoo his hair is free from dandruff and he is not constantly scratching his head everyday from irritation as he had with the other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It rinsed out clean and left behind no residue and got rid of a lot of previous product build-up.</li>
            <li> I buy this shampoo here because it&#x27;s not available anywhere near me</li>
            <li> This is really a minor deal...</li>
            <li> I was increasingly losing when washing and drying my hair, I firmly told myself it was time to take action.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s hair is coarse but short, so the conditioner didn&#x27;t matter to him at all.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this product would probably come down to a price comparison.</li>
            <li> Must-have for dry scalps.</li>
            <li> One just helped control dandruff while another had conditioner as well and another was for a dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t know whether my hair/scalp is oily or dry.  </li>
            <li> I found that it left my hair a bit heavy feeling compared to the female version, so if you have thinning hair, this might bulk it up a bit.</li>
            <li> A little herbal due to the Bio-Nutrium 10, but still masculine.</li>
            <li> bottle is not slippery and the shape makes it easy to work with, not at all awkward no matter what it looks like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found the conditioning effects minimal and thought my hair felt and looked dry after use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard before that adding conditioner to shampoo does not really work because the shampoo just washes it out.</li>
            <li> Using various products from brands ranging from Suave to Paul Mitchell and almost every other brand in between, including Head &amp; Shoulders, I had little to no improvement.</li>
            <li> I feel like that when the bottle gets down to the last fourth it is hard to get it out of the bottle due to the bottle&#x27;s design.  </li>
            <li> alas, one would probably only use this product to address dry scalp and flaking issues, and we noticed no improvement on either after several days of use.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way</li>
            <li> : On my hair, which is very long (caucasian) and thick, it left a bit to be desired.  </li>
            <li> When he ran out and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores, duh check Amazon, he bought a dandruff shampoo that made his scalp itch and his face so dry and red.</li>
            <li> other brands like head and shoulders and store brands make my head itch and give me scalp sore.</li>
            <li> Use it every other day and no flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zeb</li>
            <li> have been using for the past several years.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other reviews on how this product works</li>
            <li> If I can use this instead of my two other shampoos I will save money as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last past the shower, either, so men needn&#x27;t worry about smelling girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nothing bad or consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I edited the review since I realized the title didn&#x27;t really sound like what I thought of the product.</li>
            <li> He has a slight dandruff problem because of the hard water we have in our house, so this definitely helped with that too.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it tends to leave my roots feeling slightly oily and can weigh down my thick hair even though its short.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo has a faint smell of mint and the same after smell of other dandruff shampoos (reminiscent of Head and Shoulders shampoo).  </li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of using this product I noticed less dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m experiencing some dandruff still, it&#x27;s much less than before.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The 2/1 seems to have a slight floral note, but it seemed to not bother my spouse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had less build up, and no dandruf.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve actually spent a lot of time considering the magic of that, pathetic I know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp conditions used to go through some random and major \\&quot;mood swings\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> As the title asks, what has happened to the usual protective packaging provided by Amazon?</li>
            <li> (in the past, he wouldn&#x27;t use a floral bath gel).  </li>
            <li> usually use a store brand anti-dandruff shampoo with a shampoo that has coal tar in it to treat my dandruff.</li>
            <li> The scent is faintly herbal and the feel is like regular shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more scattered strands of hair on the floor from washing, drying and styling.</li>
            <li> then the very next day my hair would feel oily, weighed down and dirty.</li>
            <li> No more dandruff for me!</li>
            <li> It does not leave behind any residue and does help with scalp itch.</li>
            <li> The conditioning aspect is nothing to write home about, but it rinses out without leaving behind an oily or soapy residue.  </li>
            <li> and then my hair begins to feel dirty again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> smells great and works good</li>
            <li> This has worked so much better than head and shoulders for me in stopping my dandruff. The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but I wish it was a stronger minty smell.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I get a bit of dandruff now and then. I used to just alternate between Head &amp; Shoulders and some regular shampoo (i.e. alternating between a regular shampoo and anti-dandruff). I switched over to Clear Men Scalp Therapy when I first heard about, so I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now. After the initial switch-over period, my dandruff started to lessen right away (same as usual) and it&#x27;s been completely gone since then. Here are my list of pros-cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Works great on dandruff (possibly a little slower than other brands, but not much).&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t start to kill my hair after using it non-stop for more than a few weeks like other brands (i.e. I can use the shampoo daily without having to switch like with other brands).&lt;br /&gt;-Lathers really well.&lt;br /&gt;-Lid design makes it easier to control how much you get each time (no really, it does, not a marketing gimmick or something).&lt;br /&gt;-The bottle is not slippery and the shape makes it easy to work with, not at all awkward no matter what it looks like.&lt;br /&gt;-Even though it&#x27;s a tall bottle with a weird shape, it doesn&#x27;t tip over easily, no idea how that works (I&#x27;ve actually spent a lot of time considering the magic of that, pathetic I know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The bottle does get some buildup on the lid and where the lid meets the bottle, I&#x27;m on my 2nd or 3rd bottle and they&#x27;ve all done it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to actually leak and the buildup isn&#x27;t hurting anything and is easy enough to clean. I think if the bottle were positioned under where the shower head drips, I would probably never even see it.&lt;br /&gt;-The bottle is not recyclable in my area, although I know other areas can recycle the higher plastic numbers.&lt;br /&gt;-I have an occasional flake, but nothing bad or consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I edited the review since I realized the title didn&#x27;t really sound like what I thought of the product.</li>
            <li> I know tea tree is a good counter for germs and bacteria, but men should understand that tea tree oil raises our estrogen levels and should be avoided, just like soy and soy beans/edamame. There&#x27;s so much soy by-products in processed foods that to use tea tree oil is just adding another ingredient into raising our estrogen level and a manufacturer of men&#x27;s products should know this and find another natural product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose to avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Ok, call me sexist, but I really expected this particular shampoo to smell more masculine. Instead, it has a bit of a floral overtone - not that men can&#x27;t smell flowery, but it surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the fact that it combines both a shampoo and conditioner, and as far as dandruff, it gets the job done. Still, I couldn&#x27;t convince my husband to try it, so I used it on my Own shorter hair. I found that it left my hair a bit heavy feeling compared to the female version, so if you have thinning hair, this might bulk it up a bit.</li>
            <li> The New Clear Men Scalp Therapy Complete Care 2 in 1 Anti Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner looked perfect for my teenage soon who has terrible dandruff problems but he has to alternate between different anti-dandruff shampoos because after awhile they just stop working on him. My son&#x27;s dandruff is moderate but he has to wash his hair everyday just to keep it under control, but with the Clear Mean Scalp Therapy Shampoo his hair is free from dandruff and he is not constantly scratching his head everyday from irritation as he had with the other shampoos. I also noticed that he no longer has dandruff flakes on his shirts and I fully appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this has the conditioner added so that he can get everything he needs all included. I love that this has the added ingredient tea tree because I use tea tree oil to help control my dry scalp, so I know this will help alleviate his dry scalp and dandruff and I think that this will last a great deal longer than the others and also continue to be more effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different versions of this shampoo and I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with all of them. This particular type (the complete care with shampoo and conditioner) is probably my favorite. It keeps my hair clean for a very long time and 24 hours after cleaning, my hair does not feel greasy at all. Most shampoos I&#x27;ve tried only last for about 12 hours and then my hair begins to feel dirty again. A little of this product goes a long way and I&#x27;m very impressed with this brand of men&#x27;s shampoo. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My husband has scaly scalp and this is the only shampoo that actually cleans his scalp without drying it. It also keeps his face clean and clear too. When he ran out and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores, duh check Amazon, he bought a dandruff shampoo that made his scalp itch and his face so dry and red. I&#x27;m ready to try it in the womens.</li>
            <li> Had some itchy scalp with flakes earlier this year. Also, had same condition in my goatee at times. I had went to the dermatologist to have some moles removed. Asked him for a recommendation...he gave me a sample bottle of this Clear Men Scalp Therapy. Used for 2 weeks or so and problems were gone so bought this size here. Price was better than local stores. Works great for me as have no more issues.</li>
            <li> Having some dandruff issues and bought this to see if it would help.  After about 2 weeks of using this product I noticed less dandruff.  Although I&#x27;m experiencing some dandruff still, it&#x27;s much less than before.  Smells nice.</li>
            <li> use every day or every 2 days. gets you rid of dandruff after 3 uses. and gives your hair strength and clanliness. I have used it for 3 years now, and could never replace it. definitely has worked much better than Head and Shoulders for me :)</li>
            <li> nice shampoo specialy after the pool or the beach it keeps your hair clean.</li>
            <li> Must-have for dry scalps. Works much better for me than other brands. I just wish the travel size was easier to find since I tend to end up carrying a full bottle with me when traveling.</li>
            <li> smells so good great stocking stuffer or just because gift.</li>
            <li> As the title asks, what has happened to the usual protective packaging provided by Amazon? I buy this shampoo here because it&#x27;s not available anywhere near me, so it&#x27;s a huge let-down when the contents end-up in the box and not in my hair. Amazon usually does better than this.</li>
            <li> This is my only anti dandruff shampoo i&#x27;ll ever buy again. it smells great, and works better than other brands. other brands like head and shoulders and store brands make my head itch and give me scalp sore. Clear doesn&#x27;t! No more dandruff for me!</li>
            <li> The anti-dandruff approach is the best choice for my husband, though he doesn&#x27;t suffer anything really requiring clinical strength. This is a great bargain product that treats the average case of dandruff problems, and the shampoo/conditioner combination doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling in the hair.  Very  nice.</li>
            <li> OK, it&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner in one.  Not the greatest innovation in shampoo in the last year, but it works nicely.  Shampoo twice and it leaves  nice smooth hair (mines shoulder length) without that greasy feeling you get from some conditioners.  Use it every other day and no flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zeb Kantrowitz</li>
            <li> This Clear \\&quot;Complete Care 2in1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner\\&quot; works well to clean my hair and control my dandruff, while leaving a fairly pleasant scent. We generally choose Head and Shoulders or a \\&quot;store brand\\&quot; knock off, and find that this Clear shampoo is just as effective, but has a much better smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers nicely and leaves my hair somewhat \\&quot;dryer\\&quot; than most other conditioning shampoos, which is good for my very short hair but not to my son&#x27;s liking since he has fairly a long and full head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended, with the caveat above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> This 2in1 shampoo and conditioner from CLEAR works pretty well. It lathers up nicely, rinses easily and smells good. It is a fresh, masculine scent. It does not leave behind any residue and does help with scalp itch. It is most likely not the best choice for more severe cases of dandruff, but for mild conditions it works nicely. It makes your hair soft, but \\&quot;not too soft,\\&quot; my son says. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for longer hair, as the conditioning properties just aren&#x27;t there and because it does have a more masculine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it a few times for my dog too, who also has periods of dandruff from time to time and it left his coat soft, sleek and shiny. He didn&#x27;t scratch for about a week after using and he smelled really good, just like the shampoo, for almost just as long. It didn&#x27;t irritate him at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around good product for men with scalp itch and minor dandruff, as well as for dogs with itchy skin issues. 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  It does what it promises and I will buy it again.  Highly Recommended.  It also smells good.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a faint smell of mint and the same after smell of other dandruff shampoos (reminiscent of Head and Shoulders shampoo).  However, the smell here is not overwhelming, and the next day after use, my hair still smells clean and not medicated.  Really can&#x27;t speak to the promised dandruff relief as I don&#x27;t have that issue and hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> My spouse does not spend a lot of time on his hair, yet he likes his hair to look nice.  Consequently, this 2/1 anti-dandruff shampoo seemed to be the answer for his morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the 2/1 worked OK. For him, as an anti-dandruff it seemed to be as effective &amp; his head &amp; shoulders shampoo, but with an additional conditioner, he thought that his hair was a little \\&quot;lighter\\&quot;. He has fine hair, so \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; could mean fly-away, but in this case, it combed down &amp; looked the same as it did with the H&amp;S product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2/1 seems to have a slight floral note, but it seemed to not bother my spouse (in the past, he wouldn&#x27;t use a floral bath gel).  The smell seemed to dissipate over the course of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict was that the Clear 2/1 works OK.  Spouse would buy it again if the price were competitive with his H&amp;S.</li>
            <li> This shampoo dispenses freely but in a controlled way and lathers up well. It has no offensive odor. All in all it does a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, unless you have dandruff and believe the label, it may be better value to get a generic shampoo. Maybe even dish soap would work as well?</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised with this product.  It has a great smell and seems to work well for a 2 in 1 product.</li>
            <li> I get it every month. I love it.</li>
            <li> This will be my shampoo henceforth.</li>
            <li> My brother used to battle the flake when his hair was longer and he used old fashioned styling product (think sticky hair tonic).  Since then he has cut his hair short and uses no styling aids.  He likes this shampoo/conditioning combo.  He says it leaves his hair clean and is as good as anything else out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it even though it is supposedly designed for men.  The scent was fresh and invigorating.  Notably it did not linger my hair. Although the convenience of a shampoo/conditioner is tempting, it is counter-intuitive.  I found the conditioning effects minimal and thought my hair felt and looked dry after use.  When I used a separate conditioner on the ends in addition to this shampoo, my was looked and felt nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This certainly is an acceptable, relatively inexpensive alternative to other products out there.  I wouldn&#x27;t count on much conditioning however.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice light fragrance and really clears up dry scalp.  My only complaint is that it tends to leave my roots feeling slightly oily and can weigh down my thick hair even though its short.  I think it would be best suited for men with very short hair or women with thinner-textured short hair.</li>
            <li> This anti-dandruff shampoo contains Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), which is the same anti-dandruff ingredient found in Head and Shoulders shampoos. Head and Shoulders is the shampoo my family (husband and sons) have been using for the past several years. They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far. My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better. They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard before that adding conditioner to shampoo does not really work because the shampoo just washes it out. My son said he didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between the shampoo and the combined shampoo and conditioner that he tried, but since the price is the same it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use the one with the added conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It is a 2 in 1! SO convenient.&lt;br /&gt;-It leaves my hair much softer than most 2 in 1.&lt;br /&gt;-Scalp immediately is soothed- but it doesn&#x27;t tingle.&lt;br /&gt;-Great consistency, spreads easily.&lt;br /&gt;-It has 10 nutrients- all that help nourish my hair ;) My favorite of the ten? Natural Mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-None that I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this one out if you&#x27;re looking for a new men&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner combo!</li>
            <li> After several weeks of using Clear Men Scalp Therapy, my husband and I have this to say:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just ok. The smell is nice and light, neither feminine or masculine. The lather is middle of the road, ok to use, but not abundant.&lt;br /&gt;As far as controlling dandruff, it does just about as well as Head and Shoulders. I still had some itching, but no flaking.&lt;br /&gt;The added conditioner means your hair is very soft; which is great if you need conditioner. As my hair is naturally fine and soft, the conditioner made it droopy. My husband&#x27;s hair is coarse but short, so the conditioner didn&#x27;t matter to him at all.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this product would probably come down to a price comparison. I would buy it if it were less expensive than Head and Shoulders, but would not seek it out to purchase based on it&#x27;s own middle of the road merit.</li>
            <li> A fine shampoo/conditioner, smells nice and leaves hair nice. Plus, I find that the inclusion of a conditioner is handy, saving a step. Personally, price is important to me for such a product, so only really desireable if competitively priced.</li>
            <li> Clear Men&#x27;s Scalp therapy is a good product with a pleasant smell and good lather.  It does a decent job of controlling dandruff.  Overall, I have no complaints from the product given I could find it at a decent price.  For now, we will probably just stick Head and Shoulders Men&#x27;s Hair Endurance because it&#x27;s what my husband likes and he doesn&#x27;t like it when I change brands on him.  No complaints with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is comparable to Head and Shoulders with the difference being that this has more lather and a more pleasing scent.  I feel like both work the same though.  So it will be up to you to determine the if the cost is worth it to you to give this a try.  There are plenty of other reviews on how this product works so let me focus on another aspect of this product that maybe hasn&#x27;t been looked at... Packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like this packaging - although it is very attractive to look at.  I feel like that when the bottle gets down to the last fourth it is hard to get it out of the bottle due to the bottle&#x27;s design.  The plastic is very hard and it&#x27;s hard to get a good squeeze on it to force the product out even though the bottle sits inverted and gravity should have it all going to the bottom... I still feel like it takes forever to get that last bit out.  This is really a minor deal... but you can&#x27;t take the cap off very easily to access the contents so you are kind of just stuck waiting on gravity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out a lot of this new line of hair care products, owning multiple shampoos, conditioners, scalp treatments &amp; hair balms.  Some things I&#x27;ve loved (shampoos/conditioners) and some things I&#x27;ve been a bit less impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this, in order to review it, but since it is marketed towards men - I enlisted my husband to give his opinion too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine: It smells lovely.  Floral?  Clean floral? I swear there was another shampoo that has a similar scent but I can&#x27;t place it.&lt;br /&gt;His: \\&quot;It&#x27;s....nice.  A bit flower&#x27;y for a guy shampoo.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine: On my hair, which is very long (caucasian) and thick, it left a bit to be desired.  It smells nice, like I said, and it does feel nice but since it is only a shampoo - it would not work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His: \\&quot;I&#x27;m keeping this!  I like it!  The smell is a little much, but its okay.  My hair feels clean.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it.  Great for men (as marketed - or short women&#x27;s hair), not so great for long hair.</li>
            <li> Works similar to Head &amp; Shoulders. It&#x27;s nice having both shampoo and conditioner in one. Gets you out of the shower faster. The &#x27;tingle&#x27; you get on your scalp is comparable to Head &amp; Shoulders. Solid product.</li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo smells.  It&#x27;s clean and healthy smelling without being overly masculine or feminine.  It has tea tree oil and mint in it, and some other essential oils that make a really  nice clean, sorta herbal smell.  The lather - in this kind - is not quite as luxurious as the shampoo alone, but once you get it lathering it is fairly rich.  I found that it was not conditioning enough for me.  It left my hair clean and great smelling, and no itch - it&#x27;s effective for dandruff and itch control - but past that I really didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of benefit with it. I much prefer the separate shampoo and conditioner for performance.  If you had short hair or needed 1 bottle to take to the gym, this would be fine.  I&#x27;ve got long hair though, and the conditioning aspect of this combo version wasn&#x27;t enough to suit me.</li>
            <li> For starters, this has the same active ingredient (Pyrithione Zinc) and concentration (1%) as every other dandruff shampoo, so if they&#x27;re effective for you, this will be too.  While it contains botanical ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t rely on them for the dandruff-fighting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is much better about this stuff is the smell! It&#x27;s fantastic, not the usual 70s Dad dandruff shampoo smell or the 1920s Grandpa medicinal pine tar smell. This has a much more refreshing, modern, botanical scent from the tea tree, mint, and ginseng (honestly, I don&#x27;t know how ginseng smells, so I&#x27;d pin it more on the tea tree and mint). It&#x27;s crisp and clean smelling, with a light citrusy note, not medicinal like a lot of hippy dippy tea tree shampoos. Either way, it doesn&#x27;t have the I HAVE DANDRUFF smell, but more of an Aveda-type scent. For a \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; product, this has an appealingly clean, light scent, not at all like the heavy cologne scents many men&#x27;s products have, making it suitable for anyone in the family. Definitely gender-neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo cleans well and the conditioning component is light and effective. Probably not as conditioning as a heavy separate rinse, but certainly does the job--especially for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For reference, pretty much any Pyrithione Zinc 1% dandruff shampoo, from the fancy stuff to the store brand, is equally effective in eliminating my dandruff. If you have clinical needs &amp; the off-the-shelf stuff won&#x27;t do for you, this probably won&#x27;t, either.)</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoos.  Each did something different. One just helped control dandruff while another had conditioner as well and another was for a dry scalp.  All worked well for me, this one included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a store brand anti-dandruff shampoo with a shampoo that has coal tar in it to treat my dandruff. I don&#x27;t use conditioners and am not into shampoos that have \\&quot;pretty smells.\\&quot; In short I want to keep my dandruff under control and that is about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t know whether my hair/scalp is oily or dry.  It seems to change at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I would try this shampoo, as well as other Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoos,  based on the reviews and see if it was as good as my store brand shampoo and coal tar shampoo. I will admit  the ginseng, mint and tea tree ingredients that are listed on this product made me a little nervous as did the \\&quot;pretty smell\\&quot; but I figured it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased. This seems to be keeping my dandruff under control without having to use a second product. All the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoos I tried have Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%) as the active ingredient and this seems to get the job done. The pretty smell is strong when I put it on my hair but when I am done I don&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this shampoo. If I can use this instead of my two other shampoos I will save money as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Shampoos I tried. They all look alike and smell the same and  have ginsing, mint and tea tree as well as the Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%).  They all worked. My suggestion would be find the one that you think matches your needs and try it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it lathers very well with only a small amount, and seems to clean my hair and treat my scalp at the same time.  I personally normally use a seperate shampoo and conditioner at the same time, but with this product I have found that I don&#x27;t need the seperate conditioner.  The active ingredient in the product is 1% pyrethione zinc which for me cleanses my scalp perfectly.  I&#x27;ve had less build up, and no dandruf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone with longer hair (I have pretty short hair) I&#x27;m sure a seperate conditioner may be in order, but for me personally, I only use this product when washing my hair.  I like the fact that it suds up very well, and has a decent scent (personally I want to smell  like a man I don&#x27;t want a strong scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months (a couple differnet varieties) and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it, I may switch my shampoo preference to this product because I like it so much.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old son has had dandruff problems for years. I tried this product and within four days his dandruff was gone. The Clear Men Scalp Therapy smells wonderful as well, and it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem finding a dandruff shampoo that worked. In my experience, none of them eliminate dandruff, but most all of them reduce it considerably. The thing about dandruff shampoo is that most of them feel like you are spreading peanut butter in your hair and smell pretty foul on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Complete Care 2in1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner not only does the job of controlling my dandruff, but feels and smells good. The scent is faintly herbal and the feel is like regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shampoo gets my hair thoroughly clean and the built-in conditioner leaves it feeling like hair should. I have always liked the idea of shampoo and conditioner in one product, but usually found the results to be less than great. This product cleans, treats and conditions at the same time and in the proper proportions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a bit fan of 2-in-1 hair care products. I feel like the shampoo can&#x27;t clean well because of the conditioner, and the conditioner can&#x27;t condition well because of the shampoo. This product was better than most. My hair felt clean enough, and conditioned enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with other Clear products i&#x27;ve tried, the conditioner is very light, and left my hair a little bit fluffy. However, my hair is fine and very short (for a woman), so anyone with longer or coarser hair might not experience the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is slightly floral, but neither strong nor feminine. It doesn&#x27;t last past the shower, either, so men needn&#x27;t worry about smelling girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas, one would probably only use this product to address dry scalp and flaking issues, and we noticed no improvement on either after several days of use.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my son to try and he loved it. He loved the 2 in 1 aspect of it. He hates to have to condition his hair separately in the shower. He thinks conditioner is just for girls. He has a slight dandruff problem because of the hard water we have in our house, so this definitely helped with that too. It has a nice smell to it. Not a girly smell or anything. Just a nice clean smell. So overall I like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a pleasant herbal, minty scent and does a good job cleaning the hair and scalp and rinses clean despite being a shampoo and conditioner combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient, pyrithione zinc, has antibacterial and antifungal properties and is commonly used to treat many different disorders of the skin. Long-term use has even been shown to moderately increase hair count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pyrithione zinc will work best if the shampoo is massaged thoroughly into the scalp and left in place for a while before rinsing.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Complete Care 2in1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for about a month now, and seems to feel kind of ambivalent about it.  It smells nicer than the brands of anti-dandruff shampoo he has used before, with none of the medicinal smells that really turn me off, but it is only adequate at the anti-dandruff part.  The conditioning aspect is nothing to write home about, but it rinses out without leaving behind an oily or soapy residue.  If you have mild dandruff, and you are looking for a 2-in-1 anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;chemically,\\&quot; this may well be the product you are looking for.  But if, like my husband, you need a stronger formula than you will need to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite 2n1 Shampoo/Conditioner products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt the need to express my personal joy and opinions about a shampoo before but this is a product worthy of my personal 5-star rating. Some hair care products that bring amazing results for one individual may not produce the same results to another individual, even if the situation is the same. So having used this product for the past 2 months, here is a breakdown of my personal experience with my past hair and scalp conditions, my desired results when I first started using the product, and the final results of my hair and scalp conditions after having used this Clear Men Scalp Therapy Complete Care 2-in-1 for the past 2 months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair and scalp before using the product: I have a short, thick, pretty normal head of hair (Caucasian) with occasional itchy scalp and flakes. I&#x27;ve never suffered from noticeable dandruff so I&#x27;ve always ignored anti-dandruff shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners. My hair and scalp conditions used to go through some random and major \\&quot;mood swings\\&quot;. One day my hair would go from feeling coarse and dry with an itchy scalp and then the very next day my hair would feel oily, weighed down and dirty. Even within just a few hours of taking a fresh shower. As a 24 year old male with no history of hair loss in my family I started truly becoming concerned about the health of my scalp from the amount of hair I was increasingly losing when washing and drying my hair, I firmly told myself it was time to take action. So I put my old Pantene hair care routine to rest and started experimenting with other different products and treatments in an attempt to remedy my hair and scalp conditions. Using various products from brands ranging from Suave to Paul Mitchell and almost every other brand in between, including Head &amp; Shoulders, I had little to no improvement. After seeing the Clear Men anti-dandruff shampoo commercial for the two thousandth time I finally convinced myself to give it a try, regardless of saying \\&quot;looks like a great shampoo, but Idon&#x27;t have dandruff... so I&#x27;ll pass\\&quot; over and over to myself. It turned out to be the best decision I have ever made in regards to my hair/scalp health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My desired results and first impressions at the start of using the product: Before running out to my nearest carrier store, I went to the Clear website and did my research on what their product variations claimed to do and found that the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Complete Care 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner claimed to be the best solution for my desired results; to have a soft, touchable head of hair that was deeply cleansed and free of excess oil and residue, as well as a healthier, nourished scalp free of my occasional flakes and itch. Then after reading many reviews on here, I decided to make the commitment and purchased the Complete Care 2-in-1 at my local carrier store which happened to be buy one, get one free (an added bonus)! The first use was a pleasant experience to say the least! The smell is fantastic! A little herbal due to the Bio-Nutrium 10, but still masculine. The lather was nice and rich, and it takes very little product to get a good lather build. The sensation it gave my scalp was very soothing and enjoyable. It rinsed out clean and left behind no residue and got rid of a lot of previous product build-up. The result after my first time using this 2-in-1 was a very soft and clean head of hair with no weigh down. I couldn&#x27;t have really commented on saying whether or not my scalp was soothed or nourished at the time, (probably because of all the damage that previous products did), but if I ever had an idea as to what a soothed and nourished scalp felt like, I definitely felt it. The smell was a bit strong at first but it dissipated pretty quickly afterwards and when my hair was completely dry there was no more lingering scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final and current results after some months of use: I&#x27;ll just sum this part up by saying that this Complete Care 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner from ClearMen is now a mainstay in my shower. After just one week this of using this product, it has made and KEPT my hair clean, soft, healthy, and free of excess oil. As for my scalp, I have been itch and flake free since the beginning of my use of this product and it has never felt healthier. No more scattered strands of hair on the floor from washing, drying and styling. My hair is here to stay! Good riddance scalp and hair \\&quot;mood swings\\&quot;. Hello to clean, nourished, fortified hair and a repaired, comfortable, healthy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this magic in a bottle for yourself and see how it works for your current hair conditions. If you have/had similar problems that I did before my start of using Clear Men Complete Care 2-in-1, then you&#x27;ll most likely be enjoying a healthy head of hair in the near future as well. I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s performance for those who have more severe cases of dandruff. But I&#x27;m confident in my opinion that you&#x27;ll most likely be just as satisfied with your results after using this product as I am.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I have tried so many products to help with  my scalp and most shampoos left my hair dry and unmanageable. But this product really does the trick without damaging my hair. Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I find this at a Walmart when I was helping cleanup after hurricane sandy in New Jersey. Loved the way it made my hair and scalp feel. I&#x27;ve always used conditioner and still had flakes. Used head and shoulders, still had flakes. This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that got rid of the flakes and itchy scalp. I added a few drops or pure tea tree oil to the bottle for added antibacterial benefit. Not too much because tea tree has a very step g odor. Next up will be jojoba oil for added moisture.</li>
    </ol>
