            <li>It works really good becoz my hair is so dry.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have never found a product that made my hair so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>They always ask what perfume are you wearing, which always catches me off guard because i rarely have&lt;br /&gt;perfume</li>
            <li>nice big bottle...</li>
            <li>Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used for my thin, sometimes frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I HAVE VERY COARSE CURLY HAIR &amp; MY NEW HAIR STYLIST INTRODUCED ME TO THIS AMAZING PRODUCT !&lt;</li>
            <li>The service is quick and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Love it, I will be ordering this in the future.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>but it is real!</li>
            <li>The first time I used the oil</li>
            <li>it make your hair feel very new and fresh</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s gotten so popular and so pricey that I&#x27;m looking for other products.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair nice and silky, its much easyer to brush my hair when its wet, it drys faster and looks so shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and the natural curl is more defined.</li>
            <li>healthy feel to dry and brittle hair.</li>
            <li>the bottle is huge; will probably last a couple years.</li>
            <li>I really like the size of the bottle</li>
            <li>This oil makes my hear shine so much without flattening or making my hair oily.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight.</li>
            <li>REALLY DRENCH MY HAIR IN IT.</li>
            <li>but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil Treatment lives up to our every expectation, and we will continue to use as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>RECEIVED AN E-MAIL CONFIRMATION STATING THIS TO BE TRUE &amp; MY CREDIT CARD CHARGED $163.15 FOR THE ENTIRE PURCHASE.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down too much</li>
            <li>It is light and blends well into wet hair</li>
            <li>I have been using this hair oil for a few years and love it.</li>
            <li>dont waste money buying this just buy cheaper ones they work better.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without it</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product  </li>
            <li>I cant live without it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>And I live in a humid area.</li>
            <li>but it certainly removes all of the dried out frizziness that winter brings as well as maintains the right amount of moisture for the very humid summer months (I live in Virginia).</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft but not heavy--no oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>frequently get a perm.</li>
            <li>Well, there is -- there is definitely a reason my Moroccanoil cost 4X as much as the generics.  </li>
            <li>The oil makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>really the only styling product i use</li>
            <li>About once a week I liberally apply it to my hair and night and wash it out in the morning and my hair is so soft and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li>It took a little more than three weeks to arrive which is very long for amazon</li>
            <li>BUT TO MY DISMAY A FEW DAYS LATER , ANOTHER E-MAIL CONFIRMED THAT 4 BOXES OF MoroccanOil Oil Treatment (6.8oz./200ml), WERE BEING SHIPPED TO ME &amp; MY CREDIT CARD</li>
            <li>I first shampoo my hair, rinse and then apply a few drops of Moroccan oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair with no body whatsoever.</li>

            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> but it is real!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the oil</li>
            <li> it make your hair feel very new and fresh</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s gotten so popular and so pricey that I&#x27;m looking for other products.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair nice and silky, its much easyer to brush my hair when its wet, it drys faster and looks so shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and the natural curl is more defined.</li>
            <li> healthy feel to dry and brittle hair.</li>
            <li> the bottle is huge; will probably last a couple years.</li>
            <li> I really like the size of the bottle</li>
            <li> This oil makes my hear shine so much without flattening or making my hair oily.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight.</li>
            <li> REALLY DRENCH MY HAIR IN IT.</li>
            <li> but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil Treatment lives up to our every expectation, and we will continue to use as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED AN E-MAIL CONFIRMATION STATING THIS TO BE TRUE &amp; MY CREDIT CARD CHARGED $163.15 FOR THE ENTIRE PURCHASE.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down too much</li>
            <li> It is light and blends well into wet hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair oil for a few years and love it.</li>
            <li> dont waste money buying this just buy cheaper ones they work better.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without it</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product  </li>
            <li> I cant live without it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> And I live in a humid area.</li>
            <li> but it certainly removes all of the dried out frizziness that winter brings as well as maintains the right amount of moisture for the very humid summer months (I live in Virginia).</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft but not heavy--no oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> frequently get a perm.</li>
            <li> Well, there is -- there is definitely a reason my Moroccanoil cost 4X as much as the generics.  </li>
            <li> The oil makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> really the only styling product i use</li>
            <li> About once a week I liberally apply it to my hair and night and wash it out in the morning and my hair is so soft and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li> It took a little more than three weeks to arrive which is very long for amazon</li>
            <li> BUT TO MY DISMAY A FEW DAYS LATER , ANOTHER E-MAIL CONFIRMED THAT 4 BOXES OF MoroccanOil Oil Treatment (6.8oz./200ml), WERE BEING SHIPPED TO ME &amp; MY CREDIT CARD</li>
            <li> I first shampoo my hair, rinse and then apply a few drops of Moroccan oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair with no body whatsoever.</li>
            <li> A hair dresser showed it to me a couple of years ago when I complained that I couldn&#x27;t find a product that would smooth my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> This size will last me a LONG time and when you figure it out, cost about 1/2 what I pay at the salon.</li>
            <li> Use it nightly especially on the ends of my long hair.</li>
            <li> and it took so long to come</li>
            <li> so it trends to be dry and breaks a lot.  </li>
            <li> MOROCCAN OIL HELPS MY HAIR DRY FASTER &amp; LEAVES IT FEELING &amp; LOOKING SILKY &amp; SHINY</li>
            <li> you dry hair out.</li>
            <li> it feels like im not putting anything and leaves my hair dry. ..</li>
            <li> I then rinse it out and towel dry my hair .</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin problems</li>
            <li> I have used it on dry hair as well as on damp hair after I shampoo and either way works works well with my hair.</li>
            <li> Use it on my wet hair and brush it through and then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> or I use a little on dry hair before I use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Arrived days before expected</li>
            <li> so I only have to order it a few times a year.</li>
            <li> Expensive and worth it.</li>
            <li> then that, not much else</li>
            <li> APPLY IT TO MY WET HAIR , BEFORE USING MY DIFFUSER BLOW DRYER.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M STILL HOPING THAT IT WAS JUST A PARTIAL ORDER THAT HAD BEEN SENT.  </li>
            <li> , i use it on the ends of my hair to help keep my hair from getting damaged while combing when its wet.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It was really expected</li>
            <li> My dry brittle hair loves it!!  </li>
            <li> It is pricey, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other styling product.</li>
            <li> I tried other CVS type versions of Moroccan oil</li>
            <li> Leaves no residue like other hair moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of other oil treatments, and none of them compare to how well this works.  </li>
            <li> Use everyday and say goodbye to dry unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> This blows away any other product I have ever used on my hair--I have thick, coarse hair that I have to straighten after drying.  </li>
            <li> I will also use a little on wet hair before styling sometimes and if after styling I&#x27;ve still got some flyaways</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not even half way empty!</li>
            <li> and I now need to use less other hair products while I style my hair.</li>
            <li> Makes it easier to detangle my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, colored, fragile, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be fake because there are many fake sellers on amazon</li>
            <li> It works wonders on my dry, brittle, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Apply a little before blow drying then a little after.</li>
            <li> I have a thick mane of hair with a cowlip in the back that is hard to control.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely not authentic.</li>
            <li> I use this after washing my hair or as an intensive treatment pre washing it, every 2 weeks i would apply this  from root to tips and put it up in a bun and cover it with a plastic cap and leave it on for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve found that can manage my hair without looking artificial.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;THE BAD &amp; SAD NEWS IS .....</li>
            <li> It has a horrible smell and makes your hair sticky and frizzy!  </li>

            <li> smells amazing, great product, great price-- the bottle is huge; will probably last a couple years. I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years. I have never found a product that made my hair so soft and healthy. It is a must have product. And the smell... It is heavenly.</li>
            <li> Works well on my frizzy hair. Smells really nice and makes my hair look very healthy and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I have used many products before from wax, paste, to gel and this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used I like the way it leaves my hair feeling unlike wax or gel.</li>
            <li> We have ordered this many time before.  Moroccan Oil Treatment lives up to our every expectation, and we will continue to use as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I love it.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my hear shine so much without flattening or making my hair oily. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for that extra glow and healthy feel to dry and brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Makes it easier to detangle my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without it ;-) I use this oil on my hair and on my skin. Expensive and worth it.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use Moroccan Oil and it is wonderful! It keeps our fine hair shiny and the ends healthy. It has a wonderful scent too. Our stylists both have commented on the improvement in our hair. The larger size pump bottle is great for dispensing a set amount.</li>
            <li> I put this on my face twice a day!  My skin loves it!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and not too greasy.  Pricy though.</li>
            <li> Adds a lot of body and shine. Very lightweight.</li>
            <li> Good.There is no need to say~~~!! ^3^</li>
            <li> I have curly hair so it trends to be dry and breaks a lot.  Since I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan oil my hair has been more manageable and pliable.  I don&#x27;t use any other styling product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother and she said she liked it:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other then that, not much else I can say besides that she tells me it is very good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair oil for a few years and love it. I have medium length fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down too much but it certainly removes all of the dried out frizziness that winter brings as well as maintains the right amount of moisture for the very humid summer months (I live in Virginia). The scent is also wonderfully woody instead of fruity like so many hair products.</li>
            <li> This blows away any other product I have ever used on my hair--I have thick, coarse hair that I have to straighten after drying.  It makes my hair soft but not heavy--no oily feeling.  also keeps frizz to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY COARSE CURLY HAIR &amp; MY NEW HAIR STYLIST INTRODUCED ME TO THIS AMAZING PRODUCT !&lt;br /&gt;I APPLY IT TO MY WET HAIR , BEFORE USING MY DIFFUSER BLOW DRYER.  MOROCCAN OIL HELPS MY HAIR DRY FASTER &amp; LEAVES IT FEELING &amp; LOOKING SILKY &amp; SHINY AND DEFINITELY ELIMINATES THE FRIZZ.&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WHEN I FOUND THIS PRODUCT ONLINE FOR THE 2nd TIME TO ORDER IN IT&#x27;S LARGEST SIZE AT A FANTASTIC PRICE........I WAS SOOOOOOOO EXCITED !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD &amp; SAD NEWS IS .....I THOUGHT I ORDERED, BOUGHT &amp; PAID FOR THE LAST 13 BOXES LEFT IN STOCK.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL CONFIRMATION STATING THIS TO BE TRUE &amp; MY CREDIT CARD CHARGED $163.15 FOR THE ENTIRE PURCHASE.  BUT TO MY DISMAY A FEW DAYS LATER , ANOTHER E-MAIL CONFIRMED THAT 4 BOXES OF MoroccanOil Oil Treatment (6.8oz./200ml), WERE BEING SHIPPED TO ME &amp; MY CREDIT CARD WAS CHARGED $50.20.  I DID RECEIVE THE 4 BOXES IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, BUT I&#x27;M STILL HOPING THAT IT WAS JUST A PARTIAL ORDER THAT HAD BEEN SENT.  I&#x27;M STILL VERY INTERESTED IN BUYING THIS SIZE BOTTLE AT THE SAID PRICE OF $12.55  EA.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT &amp; REALLY DRENCH MY HAIR IN IT. SO PLEASE CAN YOU CHECK INTO THIS MATTER FOR ME.  I WOULD SO APPRECIATE IT &amp; WOULD STILL LOVE TO BE ABLE TO BUY THE REST OF THE ORDER THAT I PLACED ONLINE .&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU,&lt;br /&gt;BERNADETTE MANGO</li>
            <li> I use this after washing my hair or as an intensive treatment pre washing it, every 2 weeks i would apply this  from root to tips and put it up in a bun and cover it with a plastic cap and leave it on for at least an hour. sometimes i even apply it between washes towards the ends of my hair when i feel my ends need a bit of moisture push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With continuos use you will find your hair to be softer, silkier and much more shine.</li>
            <li> The MoroccanOil treatment works great, i use it on the ends of my hair to help keep my hair from getting damaged while combing when its wet. It makes my hair silky soft and it has a wonderful soft scent that smells great. I always get compliments about&lt;br /&gt;how good i smell. They always ask what perfume are you wearing, which always catches me off guard because i rarely have&lt;br /&gt;perfume on and i forget about the treatment in my hair that smell so good.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product  I have very dry, colored, fragile, thin hair. This has restored my hair to a healthy, no-frizz appearance.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She was super excited because of how affordable it is and the quantity/size is something that you can&#x27;t purchase at a regular retail store.</li>
            <li> nice product, smells better than other oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great for dry split ends smoothers you dry hair out.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my hair type, use sparingly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the original.. qr code was scratched.</li>
            <li> The best thing ever for any type of hair</li>
            <li> Ive been using cheap versions of this and loved them then I dicided to splurge and get this expensive one thinking it would be better. I regret paying it it doesn&#x27;t do anything to my hair it feels like im not putting anything and leaves my hair dry. .. dont waste money buying this just buy cheaper ones they work better.</li>
            <li> Got it when they said I would. It was not damanged, and it had not been opened. It works wonders on my dry, brittle, thick hair. I have bought this product I think now 5 times. I cant live without it. And have not found anything better. Belive me I have tried just about everthing out there.</li>
            <li> It took a little more than three weeks to arrive which is very long for amazon so that&#x27;s why I am giving it a 3. The product itself is what it says it is and smells &amp; works great leaving your hair soft. I thought it might be fake because there are many fake sellers on amazon and it took so long to come but it is real!</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this at the salon for a smaller bottle but same price. This size will last me a LONG time and when you figure it out, cost about 1/2 what I pay at the salon.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased a smaller travel size bottle at a spa in Chicago.&lt;br /&gt; The first time I used the oil I noticed a big difference in the texture and feel of my hair. I have color treated hair, that gets frizzy in humid weather and Moroccan hair treatment oil has made my hair feel softer, smother and shinier. I first shampoo my hair, rinse and then apply a few drops of Moroccan oil treatment. I massage it in and leave it in while I finish my shower. I then rinse it out and towel dry my hair . My hair has more healthy body and I now need to use less other hair products while I style my hair.I love this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so nice .my hair damaged cause of  frequently get a perm. but now my hair is shining thank you.</li>
            <li> The cheaper alternatives just don&#x27;t compare. If you&#x27;re going to try Arran oil, pay the money and get Moroccan oil. It improves dryness, breakage and all over improves the health of your hair.</li>
            <li> I love it but the pump would not work!</li>
            <li> Nothing better for your hair.  Helps to keep your hair smooth and healthy looking without being greasy.</li>
            <li> After using a &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; brand of argan oil for a few years, I finally decided to splurge on the real thing and see if there is any difference.  Well, there is -- there is definitely a reason my Moroccanoil cost 4X as much as the generics.  It is thicker, but absorps better into the hair so that there is no oily appearance, even if you accidentally use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Very good value</li>
            <li> Love this Moroccan oil. I use it in my hair and on my skin. My hair is so soft and the natural curl is more defined.</li>
            <li> It works really good becoz my hair is so dry. I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE the Moroccan Oil for my hair. But it&#x27;s gotten so popular and so pricey that I&#x27;m looking for other products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product. I was worried about purchasing online but this is the real deal. I have purchasd twice from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this product it smells and works phenomenally!</li>
            <li> Love Moroccon Oil product.</li>
            <li> Great Product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very happy great deal</li>
            <li> Excellent value - quick to ship...</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used this product for years.  We love the smell and what it does for our hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan oil for many years and it is wonderful. Have tried &amp;#34;other brands&amp;#34;, but they do not compare with the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;.  My hair is smooth and shiny and healthy, even with living on the beach with many years of hair color. Have recommended this product to friends and family. It has a wonderful fragrance and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  A hair dresser showed it to me a couple of years ago when I complained that I couldn&#x27;t find a product that would smooth my hair without weighing it down.  This one does.  It is pricey, but a little goes a long way.  I tried other CVS type versions of Moroccan oil and they made my hair look oily so I came back to this product.</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s great for the hair and smell is nice.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the order to be delivered so quickly, especially during the Christmas Holidays. I bought this for my wife and she loves the product. I can also tell that it has made a noticeable difference in the way her hair shines and the texture. It&#x27;s well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great price, quick shopping, EXCELLENT product!  Will definitely buy from again!</li>
            <li> it is wonderful for the body and hair!!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look lovely and perfect. Good choice!</li>
            <li> the best oil for my hear</li>
            <li> The best! stopped using conditioner on my hair!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOVE MOROCCANOIL!!&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it for years, anyone I know that uses it loves it.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair nice and silky, its much easyer to brush my hair when its wet, it drys faster and looks so shiny.</li>
            <li> My dry brittle hair loves it!!  The oil makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not authentic.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product.  Use it on my wet hair and brush it through and then blow dry.  Leaves a great shine and straight hair.</li>
            <li> The lady that cuts my mop of hair recommended this stuff, and I am sold on it.  I have a thick mane of hair with a cowlip in the back that is hard to control.  This stuff imparts body and trainability to your hair and also looks and smells good.  One bottle lasts the better part of a year.  This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve found that can manage my hair without looking artificial.  RJB.</li>
            <li> This works with Keratinzed hair that needs sulfate free shampoos. Leaves no residue like other hair moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Great product but the bottle arrived open and leaking</li>
            <li> feels great on my hair.. nice big bottle... really the only styling product i use</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I would drink it if I could.  It is THE solution for fine, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair with no body whatsoever. I use about 3 squirts of this every morning after I wash my hair. It takes out the tangles, does away with any static, and leaves my hair shiny and full of body. Most people can&#x27;t believe I actually put oil on my thin hair, but it&#x27;s a miracle treatment for me!</li>
            <li> SILKY SMOOTH BEAUTIFUL HAIR!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and I don&#x27;t get split ends anymore since I started using MoroccanOil</li>
            <li> i love this use all the time</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this product.</li>
            <li> My second bottle.. i love this oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Works perfect and came quickly</li>
            <li> It was really expected</li>
            <li> I have waist-length hair, and I appreciate the value of MoroccanOil Oil Treatment in keeping my hair healthy and shiny.  Two added &amp;#34;pluses&amp;#34; are that the oil smells nice without being overbearing and hair dries faster with MoroccanOil than without it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of other oil treatments, and none of them compare to how well this works.  About once a week I liberally apply it to my hair and night and wash it out in the morning and my hair is so soft and frizz-free.  I will also use a little on wet hair before styling sometimes and if after styling I&#x27;ve still got some flyaways, I&#x27;ll put some on.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.  And it smells great!</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 Love this product but the price of the product has gone up by $20 from when I first started purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about to price itself out of a customer.  Argon oil is a fraction of the price of Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> A must use product for healthy hair</li>
            <li> This is not MoroccanOil.  It has a horrible smell and makes your hair sticky and frizzy!  Do not order this!  And it is not returnable! I have used Moroccan Oil for years and know the distinct wonderful smell - this is not it.</li>
            <li> it make your hair feel very new and fresh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mocorccan Oil for quite some time now and absolutely love it.  It smells so good and make your hair shine.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  I use it every day on my curly hair and the oil definatley make it shinny and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love Moroccan Oil - use it on my face, in my hair, on my neck. I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin problems</li>
            <li> I looove this oil. The smell is amazing and it leaves my hair so manageable. I have used it on dry hair as well as on damp hair after I shampoo and either way works works well with my hair.</li>
            <li> Great. There are no bad hair days with this product. Apply a little before blow drying then a little after. Use everyday and say goodbye to dry unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used for my thin, sometimes frizzy hair. Would recommend to anyone. And I live in a humid area.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, as described!</li>
            <li> Great product!  My hairs holds a curl so much better when I use the Moroccan Oil first.  All the ladies in my family are hooked after I shared this with them</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever!</li>
            <li> Use it nightly especially on the ends of my long hair. Just wonderful</li>
            <li> I had no problem with receiving the MoroccanOil in the mail. This is a great product to tone down frizz without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> It works really well, helps from fly always &amp; keep hair frizz free</li>
            <li> Works fantastic on the hair. I love the smell, even ordered the body cream.</li>
            <li> Wife enjoys products, easy to use bottle</li>
