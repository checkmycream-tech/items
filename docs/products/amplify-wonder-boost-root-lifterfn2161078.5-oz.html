            <li>Great stuff!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that I can purchase through Amazon!</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t give me that incredible boost as I heard that it would.  </li>
            <li>Great product for boosting hair and helping to make it stay styled after shampooing.</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>I will continue to order more as needed!!</li>
            <li>Used this product before successfully, but my hair has changed because of illness and no longer responds to the product.</li>
            <li>Every time I find one that is good they have a tendency to discontinue it.  </li>
            <li>Really good product you should try it...</li>
            <li>Its a good booster fo rthe price.</li>
            <li>it does seem to give me good lift when used with a hair dryer</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The best one ever was Take Me Higher foam mouse by Matrix.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked this product by Matrix.  </li>
            <li>Good product, but like the discontinued version better, as I achieved more volume with that one, even my hairdresser said.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Pricing on Amazon certainly made me happy as well.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>use this product all the time in my hair love it</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Too many words needed to state great product and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>so I can spray where I need root lifting the most.</li>
            <li>so I only use 3-4 squirts and it is perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>My mousse works better than that.</li>
            <li>i love it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Love it, I saw it advertized in a magazine, and thought I&#x27;s try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>Dry or damp hair, it works excellent both ways.</li>
            <li>I really did need this for my hair after reading the reviews because it seems like it would be a good product.  </li>
            <li>I use Wonder Boost where I need it most when I style it, right along my hair part and on the top of my head</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and use this sparingly.</li>
            <li>My fine hair is thinning out and this product gives it a lot of body, creating lots of volume and making me look like I am 50 again in terms of hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>hair is fairly fine, shoulder length</li>
            <li>, The tiny directional nozzle is great for getting to the roots too.</li>
            <li>This is newer packaging but stil same great product.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for an everyday or office look.</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance which is very mild and pleasant, and I am particularly sensitive to overpowering fragrances</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel a bit \\&quot;gooky\\&quot; and, more importantly, doesn&#x27;t give much of a lift.</li>
            <li>I finally found a product I think would be good</li>
            <li>It has given my fine hair some much needed volume.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I think having the product in the hair (in a sense making the freshly clean hair &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;) it helps keep your roots up throughout the day when you scrunch your hair up with your hands to give it volume.</li>
            <li>and I rarely \\&quot;process\\&quot; it (no highlights or perms, etc).</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s yet another hair care product that&#x27;s going to sit on my shelf, rarely used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>give this product 2 stars because the bottle it comes in is very user friendly and travels well.</li>
            <li>This is a great amplifying product for those of us with baby fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair, and this product makes me look like I have more hair and holds it that way!</li>
            <li>helps give me some much needed volume!</li>
            <li>This is the first root lifter that DOESN&#x27;T make my scalp itch or flake.</li>
            <li>This is the best volumizer for thin hair!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is easily weighed down by products, but this gives my hair the lift and volume I want without residue or stiffness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this note to post a positive comment as well as fill up space for the editors.  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair enough lift and control to make my hair easy to style.</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t rate the product since I never did receive it after waiting and waiting and e-mails on where is my hair product.  </li>
            <li>This hair product doesn&#x27;t do much for a root boost...</li>
            <li>It gives my very fine hair a little lift.</li>
            <li>Great hair product for folks with thin hair!</li>
            <li>however I have developed a very itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because the product I love must be bought at the salon (not available online).</li>
            <li>I definitely feel like my roots are lifted when I first use it</li>
            <li>It gave me only a slight bit of volume more than what I normally have.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and expected this to really help give it a boost of volume (I already use the Matrix volume boosting shampoo &amp; conditioner).  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone with a sensitive scalp wanting a noticeable but not super huge hair.</li>
            <li>But if you have fine hair, this can be too heavy.</li>
            <li>, so I can truly say it is just enough fragrance, but not too much.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair that only plays dead.  </li>
            <li>Item originally arrived in a bubble envelope with a broken pump so it was unusable until I received a new pump (which they did send to me).  </li>
            <li>I found Wonder Boost Root Lifter by Matrix at my local grocery store, so it has clearly gone from salon only to access for all!</li>

            <li> What lift it does give me doesn&#x27;t last long either.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slight root lifter for sensitive scalp, but still noticeable lift.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it can be really difficult to get the look I want in my hair style.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple other Root Lifter sprays and none work as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> I use this product after washing my hair and then blow dry the roots upwards to create some volume.</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight hair and this root boost</li>
            <li> I have used the product for several years, but it is not readily available except at salons.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months, and I think I&#x27;ll be using it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Live this stuff works wonders on thin hair.</li>
            <li> Other products just weighed my hair down, but not this stuff.  </li>
            <li> What minor root lift it does provide is usually gone after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Usually like mAtrix</li>
            <li> It has become hard for me to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find a Matrix product that works for me.  </li>
            <li> Worse, it builds up.</li>
            <li> Sticky and smells weird ...</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the results at all.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this root lifter on my thin, lifeless hair, and we were both amazed at the results!  </li>
            <li> so doesnt make my air look dirty</li>
            <li> just makes hair crunchie :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to realize that I&#x27;d overlooked the fact this is a spray and is not a foam.</li>
            <li> I was very very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Excellent delivery, great product!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. But if you have fine hair, this can be too heavy. I have fine hair and use this sparingly.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months, and I think I&#x27;ll be using it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It is light but helps give my thin hair body.  It beats the Florida heat and is not &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Matrix all around is an awesome product! I have thin, straight hair and this root boost helps give me some much needed volume! without it my hair would be flat to my head. I would recommend this product and this seller to anyone looking for a great root raiser! I will continue to order more as needed!!</li>
            <li> use this product all the time in my hair love it</li>
            <li> Live this stuff works wonders on thin hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this note to post a positive comment as well as fill up space for the editors.  Great product and fast shipping.  Too many words needed to state great product and fast shipping.  I prefer to simply use the stars review without filling up character space.</li>
            <li> This is a great amplifying product for those of us with baby fine, thin hair. It really helps.I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;tike this product ! Sticky and smells weird ... Didn&#x27;t seem to make my hair any fuller ... Usually like mAtrix</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this to me over a year ago. I have fine hair that is easily weighed down by products, but this gives my hair the lift and volume I want without residue or stiffness. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slight root lifter for sensitive scalp, but still noticeable lift. Dry or damp hair, it works excellent both ways. This is the first root lifter that DOESN&#x27;T make my scalp itch or flake. I recommend this to everyone with a sensitive scalp wanting a noticeable but not super huge hair.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t rate the product since I never did receive it after waiting and waiting and e-mails on where is my hair product.  I really did need this for my hair after reading the reviews because it seems like it would be a good product.  Very hard to find a Matrix product that works for me.  Every time I find one that is good they have a tendency to discontinue it.  The best one ever was Take Me Higher foam mouse by Matrix.  I wish if the discontinue a product they would replace it with something else equivalent to it. I finally found a product I think would be good and I never did receive it.  I was very very disappointed.  I was refunded my money but did not take the place of the product which I still need.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for several years, but it is not readily available except at salons.  It&#x27;s great that I can purchase through Amazon!</li>
            <li> This hair product doesn&#x27;t do much for a root boost...just makes hair crunchie :( Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this product by Matrix.  It gives a lite lift and bdy without weigh and without drying he hair.  It isnt gummy so doesnt make my air look dirty, The tiny directional nozzle is great for getting to the roots too. It has become hard for me to find in stores.  This is newer packaging but stil same great product.</li>
            <li> I use this product each time I shampoo! I found Wonder Boost Root Lifter by Matrix at my local grocery store, so it has clearly gone from salon only to access for all! I have fine hair and it can be really difficult to get the look I want in my hair style. I use both the Wonder Boost by Matrix and Biolage Medium Hold Mousse by Matrix for day to day hair care. Every time I shampoo I use Wonder Boost where I need it most when I style it, right along my hair part and on the top of my head and I use the Mousse on my hair tips. This is perfect for an everyday or office look. For a night on the town I use Wonder Boost on all my hair roots. It gives just enough lift to make me feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the hair stylist. I like the targeted applicator so I can spray where I need root lifting the most. I really like the fragrance which is very mild and pleasant, and I am particularly sensitive to overpowering fragrances, so I can truly say it is just enough fragrance, but not too much. It smells like a spring day to me! This is an excellent product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My fine hair is thinning out and this product gives it a lot of body, creating lots of volume and making me look like I am 50 again in terms of hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It has given my fine hair some much needed volume.  I&#x27;m amazed!</li>
            <li> Great product for boosting hair and helping to make it stay styled after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I use this product after washing my hair and then blow dry the roots upwards to create some volume. I definitely feel like my roots are lifted when I first use it &amp; I think having the product in the hair (in a sense making the freshly clean hair &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;) it helps keep your roots up throughout the day when you scrunch your hair up with your hands to give it volume. I like this product &amp; will keep using.</li>

I have long, fine hair and expected this to really help give it a boost of volume (I already use the Matrix volume boosting shampoo &amp; conditioner).  I was not impressed with the results at all.  It gave me only a slight bit of volume more than what I normally have.  What lift it does give me doesn&#x27;t last long either.  Not a product I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really good product you should try it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple other Root Lifter sprays and none work as well as this one.  Pricing on Amazon certainly made me happy as well.</li>
            <li> Good product, but like the discontinued version better, as I achieved more volume with that one, even my hairdresser said.</li>
            <li> This is the best volumizer for thin hair!</li>
            <li> Gives my hair volume and makes it look thicker.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years, but it has become too expensive to buy it at my salon.  It gives my very fine hair a little lift.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I will reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this root lifter on my thin, lifeless hair, and we were both amazed at the results!  Other products just weighed my hair down, but not this stuff.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair, and this product makes me look like I have more hair and holds it that way!</li>
            <li> If your looking for that extra volume and life this will do the job. Its a good booster fo rthe price.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist. It gives my hair enough lift and control to make my hair easy to style. I have fine hair so I only use 3-4 squirts and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Although this is called &amp;#34;Total Results&amp;#34;, I had zero results.  I have baby fine hair that only plays dead.  I was hoping for a bit of volume at the roots.  I was so hoping it would work.</li>
            <li> Works just as exprected.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  But it didn&#x27;t give me that incredible boost as I heard that it would.  I&#x27;m not so pleased with it.  My mousse works better than that.</li>
            <li> Used this product before successfully, but my hair has changed because of illness and no longer responds to the product.</li>
            <li> Great hair product for folks with thin hair!</li>
            <li> Have been using it along time and it works for me.  I have very thin and fine hair both.</li>
            <li> product was as described and arrived at the time they said it would. i love it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the product I love must be bought at the salon (not available online). I was disappointed to realize that I&#x27;d overlooked the fact this is a spray and is not a foam. But I was prepared to accept that, if it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fairly fine, shoulder length and I rarely \\&quot;process\\&quot; it (no highlights or perms, etc). I do blow-dry daily. This product makes my hair feel a bit \\&quot;gooky\\&quot; and, more importantly, doesn&#x27;t give much of a lift. What minor root lift it does provide is usually gone after a couple of hours. Worse, it builds up. So if I use this product, then within a couple of days I have to use a clarifying shampoo just to get this product&#x27;s buildup out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s yet another hair care product that&#x27;s going to sit on my shelf, rarely used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 2 stars because the bottle it comes in is very user friendly and travels well.</li>
            <li> Love it, I saw it advertized in a magazine, and thought I&#x27;s try it. I&#x27;m glad I did. Thank you</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my hairdresser,  it does seem to give me good lift when used with a hair dryer however I have developed a very itchy scalp.  It goes away after not using it for several days so I have concluded this is the culprit!</li>
