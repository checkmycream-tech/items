            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>wonderfully-</li>
            <li>I love the ingredient list, all the herbs that are wonderful for hair.</li>
            <li>A good cleanser for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good perfume and texture.</li>
            <li>It works great and protects my precious color.  </li>
            <li>but this conditioner is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Cleansed my hair and make it look nice and shiny but took all the grease out.</li>
            <li>It absolutely does a wonderful job on your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, color-treated hair</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>Worked well for itchy scalp, but I don&#x27;t think it works any better than just using diluted cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>I have shiny, bouncy healthy hair because of this product.</li>
            <li>Using this with John Masters shampoo &amp; conditioner and hair is lovely.</li>
            <li>Love the herbs in the formula too.</li>
            <li>I loved the product after the first use.</li>
            <li>Their sulfate, paraben, silicone and cruelty free, so what&#x27;s not to love.  </li>
            <li>It smells strong and even after shampooing it remains.</li>
            <li>My hair is processes (colored) and fine.</li>
            <li>These products keep my hair shiny, strong, frizz free and my color glows.  </li>
            <li>free clarifying shampoo, also with ACV.  </li>
            <li>Every once in a while I can find SM buy 1 get 1 free, and then I stock up.  </li>
            <li>My hair came out clean and so shiny, i kept walking by the mirror and smiling to my image.</li>
            <li>I use this on the weekends to clean out any product build-up.  </li>
            <li>Truly helps to make my scalp feel clean and refreshed...</li>
            <li>When I mixed my own concoction of cider vinegar and organic rosemary, it worked much better and more gently.  </li>
            <li>I use 1 capfull with a 1/2 bottle full of a 16oz.</li>
            <li>And the smell goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>smell is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean and leaves my hair really shiny and free of styling product and hairspray buildup.  </li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written</li>
            <li>and I have a whole bottle of it!</li>
            <li>Great product for finishing ph balance, smells a little like cider vinegar the primary ingredient, but not nearly as much as using cider vinegar straight.</li>
            <li>so much better than using a clarifying shampoo which tends to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>It comes in a large bottle for $11 at Walgreens, CVS, Target and Sally Beauty Supply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a rinse, not a traditional cream conditioner (you add a capful of the stuff to warm water, then pour the mixture on your hair, let it sit for 3 minutes and finally rinse it out).  </li>
            <li>It seems like I need to use a lot more shampoo with other brands, and then it takes much rinsing to get it all out.</li>
            <li>It also brought back the natural curl to my hair and the morning after, my hair is full of body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased to say the least.</li>
            <li>gross, right?  </li>
            <li>While the shampoo and detangler alone make my hair very soft; the addition of the hair clarifier, it was noticeably intensified.</li>
            <li>I use well water that has a high mineral content, blond and 55+ years old.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time last night ...</li>
            <li>We have hard water where we reside, and the Masters shampoo and conditioner seems to work ok with it.</li>
            <li>I use organic shampoo and conditioner, but this rinse makes my hair so soft-</li>
            <li>I never tried Masters products and knew I needed to strip the old chemicals out before using natural/organic products.  </li>
            <li>I never keep hair down when i work, but now i cant make myself to put it on a ponytail, its so pretty!</li>
            <li>It has completely replaced my daily conditioner and the smell doesn&#x27;t stick around--my husband will testify to that.  </li>

            <li> wonderful product for my  scalp  issues. helps treat dandruff. smell is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Worked well for itchy scalp, but I don&#x27;t think it works any better than just using diluted cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> Does smell like vinegar but as long as It is all rinsed out there is no oder left.  Cleansed my hair and make it look nice and shiny but took all the grease out.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time last night ... along with JMO&#x27;s zinc &amp; sage shampoo and his citrus &amp; neroli detangler. While the shampoo and detangler alone make my hair very soft; the addition of the hair clarifier, it was noticeably intensified. It also brought back the natural curl to my hair and the morning after, my hair is full of body. I&#x27;m pretty pleased to say the least. And I didn&#x27;t think the smell was anything terrible; if you&#x27;ve gone the DIY route, you&#x27;ll know how strong apple cider vinegar can be, and this is very mild compared. And the smell doesn&#x27;t linger, either ... at least for me, I didn&#x27;t notice it. Am planning on using weekly. FYI, I used a capful of this paired with a capful of distilled water for my mixture.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written but this conditioner is my favorite!  I have very fine, color-treated hair so it&#x27;s difficult to find a conditioner that makes it shine and doesn&#x27;t make my hair fall flat.  I was skeptical about this product at first because:  1) The unconventional set-up.  It&#x27;s really a rinse, not a traditional cream conditioner (you add a capful of the stuff to warm water, then pour the mixture on your hair, let it sit for 3 minutes and finally rinse it out).  2) The stuff smells like apple cider vinegar--gross, right?  But now, I&#x27;m a believer!  It has completely replaced my daily conditioner and the smell doesn&#x27;t stick around--my husband will testify to that.  I have shiny, bouncy healthy hair because of this product.</li>
            <li> This is glorified herbal vinegar.</li>
            <li> A good cleanser for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I loved the product after the first use. My hair came out clean and so shiny, i kept walking by the mirror and smiling to my image. I never keep hair down when i work, but now i cant make myself to put it on a ponytail, its so pretty! Great product! I wish they can make it in a larger bottle.  And the smell goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product for finishing ph balance, smells a little like cider vinegar the primary ingredient, but not nearly as much as using cider vinegar straight. Using this with John Masters shampoo &amp; conditioner and hair is lovely. I&#x27;ll have to come back and add comments after I give this product some time. I use well water that has a high mineral content, blond and 55+ years old. My hair is processes (colored) and fine. I love the ingredient list, all the herbs that are wonderful for hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I use this as a hair rinse twice a week (john masters recommends not overdoing it, can cause scalp to get a little dry).  Softens, smooths and conditions my hair and scalp wonderfully- I have medium-fine long hair.  I use organic shampoo and conditioner, but this rinse makes my hair so soft- like I just came from the salon.  Love the herbs in the formula too.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but I like it. We have hard water where we reside, and the Masters shampoo and conditioner seems to work ok with it. It seems like I need to use a lot more shampoo with other brands, and then it takes much rinsing to get it all out.</li>
            <li> I never tried Masters products and knew I needed to strip the old chemicals out before using natural/organic products.  This is too drying.  When I mixed my own concoction of cider vinegar and organic rosemary, it worked much better and more gently.  I will never use this again and I have a whole bottle of it!</li>
            <li> very similar to Raw Apple Cider....dig?</li>
            <li> My scalp itches a lot so I was trying to figure out what do use and I came accross this.  I use this on the weekends to clean out any product build-up.  It really does not smell bad and it does make my hair clean and shine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that this product did as it was suppposed to. It claims to help seal your hair color in so it lasts longer. It smells strong and even after shampooing it remains. I give it 1 star because I did not like this product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! Truly helps to make my scalp feel clean and refreshed...so much better than using a clarifying shampoo which tends to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> If this shampoo is supposed to be for color treated hair, why does it have sulfates?  The last thing I want is to watch my expensive color go down the drain.  Granted, apple cider vinegar does remove buildup but the sulfates negate any benefit.  I&#x27;ve found a much better, and less expensive, alternative:  Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil sulfate free clarifying shampoo, also with ACV.  It works great and protects my precious color.  It smells fresh and clean and leaves my hair really shiny and free of styling product and hairspray buildup.  It comes in a large bottle for $11 at Walgreens, CVS, Target and Sally Beauty Supply.  This product line is usually in the section for African American hair care, but any hair type can benefit, I&#x27;m proof of that.  My hair is medium in texture and slightly wavy so dryness and frizz and always a problem.  I use the raw shea butter shampoo/conditioner/mask or the Manuka Honey formula.  I use the Jamaican shampoo about once a week.  These products keep my hair shiny, strong, frizz free and my color glows.  Their sulfate, paraben, silicone and cruelty free, so what&#x27;s not to love.  Every once in a while I can find SM buy 1 get 1 free, and then I stock up.  This Masters shampoo is so so, but the last thing I want is to compromise the staying power of my hair color.  Besides, it smells like salad!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good perfume and texture.I like it.&lt;br /&gt;But When it&#x27;s dicreased, I&#x27;m disappointed that&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not easy to put out.</li>
            <li> I was surprise when I heard that using apple cider vinager for the hair would work.  Saw this product on amazon and figured what do I have to loose.  It absolutely does a wonderful job on your hair.  I could not believe how my hair comes out after blow drying it on the days I use this cleanser.  I use it on Saturdays.  I use 1 capfull with a 1/2 bottle full of a 16oz. water bottle that I punched a hole on the lid (I have a short bob that is close to the head in the back).  Only draw back is the smell after.  You notice it for a few hours after you blow dry.  But the plus out weighs the minus.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel silky. Also, I think it keeps the gray hair away.</li>
            <li> This took all them moisture out of my hair and I just couldn&#x27;t get past the smell of the cider.</li>
