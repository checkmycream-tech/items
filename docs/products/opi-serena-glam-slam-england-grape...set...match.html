            <li>I keep it because it was more of a hassle to return it.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>Awesome color again by OPI but make sure you double or even triple coat</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>all in all I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It is a bit sheer though and looks best with 3 coats.</li>
            <li>Literally the color I&#x27;ve waited for all my life.  :-)  </li>
            <li>My favorite of all the polishes that I&#x27;ve purchased this year.</li>
            <li>Either way you use it,you will love it.</li>
            <li>I love that amazon has the OPI colors after they are no longer on the shelf.</li>
            <li>I got many complements on this nail polish when I wore it.</li>
            <li>Love the color of this nail polish.</li>
            <li>My favorite OPI color now.</li>
            <li>I just love this color.  </li>
            <li>This is the best purple polish I have used so far ,this is very purple with a hint of sparkle the color is shimmery and looks even better in the sun light I used three coats along with a top coat!</li>
            <li>I honestly think this would compliment warm undertones and really any shade of skin.</li>
            <li>The shade is gorgeous and there is a shimmer/sparkle to the polish, but not too much that it looks like a kid should be wearing it.  </li>
            <li>The color is divine but it chips easily.</li>
            <li>Not too light or obnoxious neon purple.  </li>
            <li>There are sparkles that reflects light which makes the finish</li>
            <li>A true grape purple color with sparkle, I&#x27;m also now wearing it all the time on my fingers and toes.</li>
            <li>If you love the color purple like I do, you should really try this.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty, sparkly just as you see in picture.  </li>
            <li>I used it on top of a darker color polish, and one coat of this on top of the dark almost black polish came out beautifully.</li>
            <li>Strong and vibrant purple.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the example but still is very pretty.</li>
            <li>It is slightly shimmery and looks gorgeous in the sunlight.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty, very purpley purple.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast.</li>
            <li>and it arrived here very fast.</li>
            <li>The purple is deep and rich and the sparkles really make it pretty and feminine.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I must own at least 10 purples that I felt (at the time) that they would be THIS color</li>
            <li>(For reference, I&#x27;m white, practically clear in fact, with cool undertones.)  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ve all been too dark or too bright or such an odd shade that it didn&#x27;t look right with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not at all a refection on the OPI products...they are great!</li>
            <li>My only dislike about it is the consistency of the polish; it&#x27;s very watery and required 3 coats before getting it to the desired coverage.</li>
            <li>Only slight criticism is that two or three coats are  needed for the full effect.</li>
            <li>I received this nail polish a little while back, and it had been watered down or filled with nail polish remover so much so that it wouldn&#x27;t actually paint the nail.</li>
            <li>This gel polish is much, much nicer than other purples I have tried.  </li>

            <li> As always, OPI delivers a complex, long lasting color that sparkles!</li>
            <li> Its one of those colors that looks purple from one angle and dark metallic pink from another..</li>
            <li> BUT not so dark that it would be mistaken for black.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as dark as pictured, but a &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34; purple nevertheless!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time to order before it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with,  </li>
            <li> give it one star, not for the product itself but because the seller offers terrible customer service.</li>
            <li> but I am somewhat disappointed with OPI on this one.</li>

            <li> ITS THE BEST THANKS A LOT DEAR  I WILL DEAL WITH U GUYS LATER&lt;br /&gt;REGARDS THANKS A LOT AGAIN  .</li>
            <li> This polish was perfect for my special occasion to match my purple dress. A true grape purple color with sparkle, I&#x27;m also now wearing it all the time on my fingers and toes. Also a great buy. Only slight criticism is that two or three coats are  needed for the full effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the color I&#x27;m not happy with,  it was the was I received my product. The package was wrapped with one sheet of paper and the polish was all over the bottle,  OMG I was so upset.  I keep it because it was more of a hassle to return it. So upset.</li>
            <li> Perfect color.  Its one of those colors that looks purple from one angle and dark metallic pink from another.. Love it.. Perfect quality product and a great color for the toes!</li>
            <li> Sent it to a girlfriend, she painted her toes and fingers and sent me pics. I like the color and she liked it.</li>
            <li> This is the best purple polish I have used so far ,this is very purple with a hint of sparkle the color is shimmery and looks even better in the sun light I used three coats along with a top coat!</li>
            <li> Awesome color again by OPI but make sure you double or even triple coat it so it will show nicely. Doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the example but still is very pretty.</li>

            <li> Like it.  Different from the advertisement though in person.</li>
            <li> The color is divine but it chips easily. Requires 3 coats for good coloring. I am not going to return it but I am somewhat disappointed with OPI on this one.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect purple.  Not too light or obnoxious neon purple.  BUT not so dark that it would be mistaken for black.  A definite purple, not on the red side or blue side.  Literally the color I&#x27;ve waited for all my life.  :-)  I must own at least 10 purples that I felt (at the time) that they would be THIS color and they&#x27;ve all been too dark or too bright or such an odd shade that it didn&#x27;t look right with my skin tone.  (For reference, I&#x27;m white, practically clear in fact, with cool undertones.)  I honestly think this would compliment warm undertones and really any shade of skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this polish! It truly looks just like the picture. Strong and vibrant purple. My favorite of all the polishes that I&#x27;ve purchased this year.</li>
            <li> OPI makes great nail polish. This is no exception. This purple is splendid and rich. There are sparkles that reflects light which makes the finish regal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it one star, not for the product itself but because the seller offers terrible customer service. After a month of waiting to receive the order they couldn&#x27;t figure out where it went. Still no resolution after almost 6 weeks. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not at all a refection on the OPI products...they are great!</li>
            <li> Great color and a must have. Don&#x27;t waste time to order before it&#x27;s gone! The purple can be worn for toes or finger nails. Either way you use it,you will love it. Recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, sparkly just as you see in picture.  Looking forward to wearing this fall .  I love that amazon has the OPI colors after they are no longer on the shelf.</li>
            <li> Not quite as dark as pictured, but a &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34; purple nevertheless!</li>
            <li> I got many complements on this nail polish when I wore it. The color is gorgeous and has the perfect amount of sparkle to it. My only dislike about it is the consistency of the polish; it&#x27;s very watery and required 3 coats before getting it to the desired coverage.</li>
            <li> Love the color of this nail polish. The purple is deep and rich and the sparkles really make it pretty and feminine. My favorite OPI color now.</li>
            <li> I just love this color.  The shade is gorgeous and there is a shimmer/sparkle to the polish, but not too much that it looks like a kid should be wearing it.  If you love the color purple like I do, you should really try this.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The polish also lasted several days without having to be touched up.  Definitely one of my favorites by OPI.</li>
            <li> I received this nail polish a little while back, and it had been watered down or filled with nail polish remover so much so that it wouldn&#x27;t actually paint the nail. I had to trash it.</li>
