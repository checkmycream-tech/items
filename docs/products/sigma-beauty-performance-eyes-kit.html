            <li>I love these brushes, they make applying my make up so much easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve written a full review of this Performance Eye Kit on my blog at [...]</li>
            <li>These brushes have proven to be good (not great), but a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>I already had the essential kit and wanted more brushes for the eyes as they are what I focus on the most.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, I feel like a professional now.</li>
            <li>I was constantly trying to find new makeup brushes that would help me create a beautiful look on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m SO glad I bought new brushes.</li>
            <li>Love my new sigma brushes.. and they came in a timely fashion..</li>
            <li>and I can definitely say I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more from Sigma!</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes aren&#x27;t worth the expense though.</li>
            <li>Really worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Also, shipping was SUPER fast!</li>
            <li>&quot; Yeah right.</li>
            <li>i just loved this new kit, its just what i was looking for, they are smaller</li>
            <li>I have small eye and always have a hard time to put makeup on, but after I bought this kit is so much easy is the best brushs I had used just love</li>
            <li>They are basically smaller versions of brushes you most likely already own.</li>
            <li>I have small eye and these work great for me to achieve an eyeshadow look.</li>
            <li>This set of brushes are soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without them!!!</li>
            <li>After having the Mrs. Bunny collection for a few months I was ready for some more Sigma brushes because they are such great quality.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what I want</li>
            <li>This kit has smaller brushes for more defined eye makeup application.</li>
            <li>really recommend for people who are looking for makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>Would like to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast delivery was to me in the UK!</li>
            <li>The performance eye kit is exactly what I needed to add detail and perfection to my eye makeup technique.</li>
            <li>so I can have my first use.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li>These are my  first Sigma brushes and I am so glad I finally have them.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>i have been wanting to get sigma brushes for a long time i purchased these and they are very soft and different brushes i love them and quick delivery :)</li>
            <li>Makeup applies very well &amp; they wash with ease.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li>They came perfectly no broken brushes.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the Sigma Performance Eyes Kit</li>
            <li>so much Sigma.</li>
            <li>When I opened these they didn&#x27;t look like much to me.</li>
            <li>These just really get in there and do the job.</li>
            <li>So much for quality</li>
            <li>They are soft enough to feel amazing on the skin yet firm enough to be able to apply the amount of pressure needed to blend and smooth out make up products.</li>
            <li>The small brushes make it easy to do a precise makeup application on the eyes.</li>
            <li>They are soft and easy to clean, and seem like they will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the tight lining brush.</li>
            <li>Definitely high quality.</li>
            <li>all pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>plus the E30 and E35; in order to save some money and get more brushes for almost the same price, I got the kit plus the other 2 brushes I needed it.  </li>
            <li>I recently splurged on some higher end makeup</li>
            <li>My first and last Sigma purchase.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when Sigma came out with such a unique collection of small detail brushes!</li>
            <li>My only issue is that the blending brushes take a little more effort to blend in product.  </li>
            <li>Do not hold back because you think the price is a bit much.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and the brushes do not shed.</li>
            <li>It looks so professional.</li>
            <li>I bought the P80 and Kabuki round top foundation brush months ago and use it every time I do makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have now used these for several weeks</li>
            <li>The brush heads are very small and are used to make very detailed eye looks.</li>
            <li>This set has every brush needed to produce a full eye make up down to the smallest detail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first precision kit I&#x27;ve come across so far, and I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I can achieve a simple or very detailed look with very little effort on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are very inexpensive compared to other name brands, but they work very well.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that the handle of the same brush, despite having the holographic \\&quot;USA\\&quot; on it, also has \\&quot;Made in PRC\\&quot; etched (almost) unnoticeably near the end.</li>
            <li>Long story short, I mainly use the 4 brushes I wanted and the E30 and not every day...</li>
            <li>They make the eye make up &#x27;look&#x27; quiet professional and definitely easier to do.</li>

            <li> Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li> These are my  first Sigma brushes and I am so glad I finally have them.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> i have been wanting to get sigma brushes for a long time i purchased these and they are very soft and different brushes i love them and quick delivery :)</li>
            <li> Makeup applies very well &amp; they wash with ease.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> They came perfectly no broken brushes.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the Sigma Performance Eyes Kit</li>
            <li> so much Sigma.</li>
            <li> When I opened these they didn&#x27;t look like much to me.</li>
            <li> These just really get in there and do the job.</li>
            <li> So much for quality</li>
            <li> They are soft enough to feel amazing on the skin yet firm enough to be able to apply the amount of pressure needed to blend and smooth out make up products.</li>
            <li> The small brushes make it easy to do a precise makeup application on the eyes.</li>
            <li> They are soft and easy to clean, and seem like they will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the tight lining brush.</li>
            <li> Definitely high quality.</li>
            <li> all pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> plus the E30 and E35; in order to save some money and get more brushes for almost the same price, I got the kit plus the other 2 brushes I needed it.  </li>
            <li> I recently splurged on some higher end makeup</li>
            <li> My first and last Sigma purchase.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when Sigma came out with such a unique collection of small detail brushes!</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the blending brushes take a little more effort to blend in product.  </li>
            <li> Do not hold back because you think the price is a bit much.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and the brushes do not shed.</li>
            <li> It looks so professional.</li>
            <li> I bought the P80 and Kabuki round top foundation brush months ago and use it every time I do makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have now used these for several weeks</li>
            <li> The brush heads are very small and are used to make very detailed eye looks.</li>
            <li> This set has every brush needed to produce a full eye make up down to the smallest detail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first precision kit I&#x27;ve come across so far, and I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I can achieve a simple or very detailed look with very little effort on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are very inexpensive compared to other name brands, but they work very well.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that the handle of the same brush, despite having the holographic \\&quot;USA\\&quot; on it, also has \\&quot;Made in PRC\\&quot; etched (almost) unnoticeably near the end.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I mainly use the 4 brushes I wanted and the E30 and not every day...</li>
            <li> They make the eye make up &#x27;look&#x27; quiet professional and definitely easier to do.</li>
            <li> the handles are pink, not black - and one which isn&#x27;t even intended for eye application.</li>
            <li> I intend on buying every single last brush from this company!</li>
            <li> Shipping was a day earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> and now I am just waiting for them to dry</li>
            <li> I opened it and, lo, not only were two brushes missing, but they&#x27;d been replaced by others that are supposedly from a different Sigma line that isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;Performance\\&quot; line -</li>
            <li> but the ones for shadows have been used every single day since I got them!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I was never fully satisifed with the results I had with other brushes, even those specifically designed by cosmetic companies to be used with their products.</li>
            <li> whenever I&#x27;m in a rush to work, which is almost everyday, I only use the small crease brush and smudge brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The box had been shut clumsily - the tabs creased and splitting - which is suspect enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just saying that if you are not a PRO, or you are just normal random person looking for brushes for your eye makeup, go for the other sigma eye kit instead of this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other impersonators.</li>
            <li> I  bought it because of my small eyes, besides I wanted other 4 brushes from the kit.</li>
            <li> I use less of my makeup with these brushes!</li>
            <li> They are small brushes which is PREFECT for precision and detail.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not like this product; I had to return it because it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> very poor quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Upon closer inspection, I found that one of the stowaway brushes has a dirty, sticky substance on the handle and chalky, glittery powder (presumably makeup) in the bristles.</li>
            <li> OMG, was I wrong!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wish there was more of a variety of eyeshadow brushes...all pretty much the same.  I was looking for not all blending brushes.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Sigma brushes when I went to Makeup School.  They are very inexpensive compared to other name brands, but they work very well. My only issue is that the blending brushes take a little more effort to blend in product.  But it&#x27;s a very good brush for the price.</li>
            <li> i just loved this new kit, its just what i was looking for, they are smaller then the others, but its just perfect to do fancy makes.... i would recomend it 100%...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t started using these yet, but I know I&#x27;ll love them. I bought the P80 and Kabuki round top foundation brush months ago and use it every time I do makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have now used these for several weeks and I love them. They do exactly what I want and I have many choices of what brush to use to do what I want. ( I tend to experiment with colors.)</li>
            <li> Recently purchased the sigma beauty performance eyes kit and have finally tried them out for a girls night out dinner. I&#x27;m a big fan of the E21 smudge and E47 crease brushes. They make the eye make up &#x27;look&#x27; quiet professional and definitely easier to do. Overall, very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time as promised.  The brushes are made in the USA and although I haven&#x27;t experimented too much with them they appear to be very good quality.  I&#x27;m excited to begin practicing and playing with my eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> Sigma makeup brushes are amazing. But this kit is also a must. It&#x27;s the first precision kit I&#x27;ve come across so far, and I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a very long time. The small brushes make it easy to do a precise makeup application on the eyes. Great great great product !! I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I own several of Sigma&#x27;s makeup brushes and they not only are a great price but also provide great quality. This kit has smaller brushes for more defined eye makeup application. A great add to my basic kit. The brushes are numbered and have the description for application on them which makes using them fool proof. I will be ordering more brushes from this company and continue telling my friends, family, and customers about them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic! I have been looking for brushes like these for years! I&#x27;ll tell you what makes them so awesome, these were designed for detail work in the eye area. They are basically smaller versions of brushes you most likely already own. They were very precise in applying color and their blending ability was good as well. Very pleased with these brushes, this was my first time trying a Sigma product and I can definitely say I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> These brushes are FANTASTIC. My favorites are the crease brushes which changed the way I applied eye-shadow. Perfect for hooded eyes like mine. These help pack on color perfectly. I have nothing but good things to say.</li>
            <li> In love with these brushes. The are great for an makeup artist kit. There has been no shedding, after many washes. I will be buying more Sigma Brushes.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without them!!! the brushes are soft and very good for detail eye makeups! really recommend for people who are looking for makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> Definitely high quality. Some of the brushes aren&#x27;t worth the expense though. No shedding. Shipping was a day earlier than I expected. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product unless you really don&#x27;t know how to do makeup. This is a great set for beginners.</li>
            <li> As described on the box, it is a kit meant for makeup professionals. I  bought it because of my small eyes, besides I wanted other 4 brushes from the kit. plus the E30 and E35; in order to save some money and get more brushes for almost the same price, I got the kit plus the other 2 brushes I needed it.  Long story short, I mainly use the 4 brushes I wanted and the E30 and not every day... whenever I&#x27;m in a rush to work, which is almost everyday, I only use the small crease brush and smudge brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying the brushes don&#x27;t work, because they do, they are great brushes. I&#x27;m just saying that if you are not a PRO, or you are just normal random person looking for brushes for your eye makeup, go for the other sigma eye kit instead of this one. GOOD LUCK!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush set. I specifically wanted it for the E11 eyeliner brush. The others are just a bonus. I see why many beauty bloggers and gurus use them. Would like to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> These brushes have proven to be good (not great), but a good value for the money.  You get a lot of brushes at a modest price, so in that regard they have performed as expected.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brushes and I am telling you now these are worth every damn penny! Do not hold back because you think the price is a bit much. If you want amazing blending brushes these are the answer. I can&#x27;t even describe how amazing my makeup comes out when I use them. I intend on buying every single last brush from this company!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie when it comes to eye makeup and after watching a bunch of makeup tutorials and people saying wonderful things about these brushes I&#x27;ve decided to get them and it was one of the best buys!&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used the ones for the waterline yet but the ones for shadows have been used every single day since I got them!&lt;br /&gt;I love them and highly recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li> Ok I love these brushes! &amp; Use them e v e r y day! Makeup applies very well &amp; they wash with ease.  I may just have to order another set for backup.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit for the purpose of getting better at applying eye make-up.  I love the brushes.  They are soft and easy to clean, and seem like they will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they make applying my make up so much easier. The quality is amazing and I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast delivery was to me in the UK! I&#x27;ve written a full review of this Performance Eye Kit on my blog at [...] Thank you Sigma and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast, and the products are AMAZING!! Even better than described I cannot wait to play with them!! All seven of the brushes came in pristine condition. I especially like the E11 for putting on eyeliner with precision!! Absolutely in love with these products!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! I already had the essential kit and wanted more brushes for the eyes as they are what I focus on the most. The performance eye kit is exactly what I needed to add detail and perfection to my eye makeup technique. I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> This came early/on time. All the brushes in the kit were included. They came perfectly no broken brushes. Well packaged, and came with plastic protectors. I&#x27;m really pleased with these Sigma brushes, and they are a must. It didn&#x27;t come with a free gift but that&#x27;s okay. Overall super happy.</li>
            <li> I was constantly trying to find new makeup brushes that would help me create a beautiful look on my eyes.  I have always had difficulty with applying eyeliner and I was never fully satisifed with the results I had with other brushes, even those specifically designed by cosmetic companies to be used with their products. Thanks to the Sigma Performance Eyes Kit I can achieve a simple or very detailed look with very little effort on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this set of brushes!</li>
            <li> There are no brushes better than sigma. Seems to be one for any possible look you can think of.  A couple of these brushes are similar to others I have but I still happy to be using them.  Best quality brushes. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other impersonators. Also, shipping was SUPER fast!</li>
            <li> This kit is perfect for elaborate makeup looks. Really worth every penny. Excellent quality, great size for perfect precision, small eyes, etc. Very easy to use, I feel like a professional now.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes for my daughter.  She told me they are fantastic and allow her to be more precise than ever.</li>
            <li> I just received my brushes today! After having the Mrs. Bunny collection for a few months I was ready for some more Sigma brushes because they are such great quality. I unpacked my new Performance brushes and they are all so soft and shaped perfectly. I was really excited about the pamphlet that comes with the brushes because it tells you what each brush is used for. I have already washed my brushes with baby shampoo (there was no hair loss!) and now I am just waiting for them to dry so I can have my first use. I know that because they are Sigma quality they will be great brushes. I was so excited when Sigma came out with such a unique collection of small detail brushes! Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li> This set of brushes are soft and easy to work with. I have small eye and these work great for me to achieve an eyeshadow look.</li>
            <li> I bought these from the retailer etailz, which is an authorized retailer by Sigma, and I received low quality fakes.</li>
            <li> I thought I had good brushes until I received the Sigma brushes. I have a brush for every type of application. They are so soft and the brushes do not shed. The case is the icing on the cake. It looks so professional. I am very happy with my purchase. I have returned for additional brushes.</li>
            <li> I just recieved by Sigma Performance Eye Kit in the mail today. I have fallen in love with each brush. Each brush has a speciality to create a unique eye look. My favorite is the tight lining brush. The brush heads are very small and are used to make very detailed eye looks. The shipping was very fast. I am beyond pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT it is wounderful products&lt;br /&gt;it is SIGMA no one can deny it&lt;br /&gt;thank u . .&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> very poor quality brushes. smaller than pictured or described. It will not hold powder, pigment or shadow properly and you will have all shadow fall on your face/cheek area. All in all a fall-out nightmare.</li>
            <li> These are my  first Sigma brushes and I am so glad I finally have them. I will definitely be ordering more. They arrived sooner than I thought and such great quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not like this product; I had to return it because it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have small eye and always have a hard time to put makeup on, but after I bought this kit is so much easy is the best brushs I had used just love thank u so much Sigma.</li>
            <li> When I opened these they didn&#x27;t look like much to me. OMG, was I wrong! I recommend these to anyone and everyone! I recently splurged on some higher end makeup and I&#x27;m SO glad I bought new brushes. I needed too. The application is just effortless with these. I will definitely be purchasing more from Sigma! If you&#x27;re on the fence about these, just jump in. You won&#x27;t regret it. They are small brushes which is PREFECT for precision and detail. And the color payout is great too! I use less of my makeup with these brushes! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes. I have 3 sets of these!</li>
            <li> I love all!!! This kit makes your makeup shocking, The precision that provides Eyes Kit Performance, and best quality than mac brushes</li>
            <li> Love my new sigma brushes.. and they came in a timely fashion.. Happy new year to me! A great price for a good quality product.</li>
            <li> أنا مرة أخرى لأكثر! انها لا تحصل على أفضل من ذلك. سأفعل، وسوف نكون سعداء لشرائها مرة أخرى.&lt;br /&gt;هل أقول أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة. يا &amp;#34;حسنا أنا لا أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are the best on the market. They don&#x27;t soak up the product and makeup glides on effortlessly! I love, love, love these brushes!</li>
            <li> i have been wanting to get sigma brushes for a long time i purchased these and they are very soft and different brushes i love them and quick delivery :)</li>
            <li> This set of eight brushes is wonderful! They are soft enough to feel amazing on the skin yet firm enough to be able to apply the amount of pressure needed to blend and smooth out make up products. This set has every brush needed to produce a full eye make up down to the smallest detail. What is even better is the brushes are labeled on the stick part of the brush as to what they are used for, so there is no need to memorize which brush is for what. I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> These are fantastic brushes for ladies with smaller eyes (like myself) or anyone that likes a great precision set. These just really get in there and do the job. Awesome quality and definitely a good price for all that you get. I do wish that they came with a brush roll, case or cup though. Otherwise, perfection!</li>
            <li> Will preface this by saying I didn&#x27;t even bother trying the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box had been shut clumsily - the tabs creased and splitting - which is suspect enough. I opened it and, lo, not only were two brushes missing, but they&#x27;d been replaced by others that are supposedly from a different Sigma line that isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;Performance\\&quot; line - the handles are pink, not black - and one which isn&#x27;t even intended for eye application. Upon closer inspection, I found that one of the stowaway brushes has a dirty, sticky substance on the handle and chalky, glittery powder (presumably makeup) in the bristles. Not to mention that the handle of the same brush, despite having the holographic \\&quot;USA\\&quot; on it, also has \\&quot;Made in PRC\\&quot; etched (almost) unnoticeably near the end. So much for quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the Sigma site for its authorised Amazon distributors, and yes, I purchased from a listed seller. The sticker on the box says \\&quot;hand checked by sigma beauty.\\&quot; Yeah right. My first and last Sigma purchase.</li>
