            <li>He says it is the best one he has ever had.  </li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s the best one he has ever owned.</li>

            <li>I chose this product because I have had Norelcos before and had good results, however this article is without a doubt the best I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Great product for the money.</li>
            <li>If you have never used a shaver before, this is a great one to start with.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of power, provides a great shave and gets close to my nose.  </li>
            <li>best I ever had, much better than my braun.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting an excellent shave at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>the price is fair.</li>
            <li>good close shave not like the aquatec.</li>
            <li>It never gave me one good shave in the 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the delivery time and condition of the product.</li>
            <li>Prefer over foil shavers I own - Braun and Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Requires more time to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>not as close as a blade, but effective - and bloodless.</li>
            <li>It immediately gave me a nice close shave , proving itâ€™s not me or my method of shaving</li>
            <li>Wifey did good &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Replacing a Norelco I&#x27;ve had for decades, this model is lighter, much quieter, and gives me an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>Husband loves the nice close shave, smoothness with no irritation and that it&#x27;s cordless.  </li>
            <li>The shave I got from this electric shaver is the best shave I have ever had as an adult</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first rotary shaver, and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>However, this one requires a very light touch for a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the shaver...</li>
            <li>He always said he wouldn&#x27;t get a Norelco, but this surely changed his mind.</li>
            <li>Does not have as many openings in the heads that capture the beard.</li>
            <li>Does everything I want and more.</li>
            <li>BETTER</li>
            <li>I am still learning how to use it and more satisfied each time.&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li>It was ok, but it never got close around my nose.  </li>
            <li>This shaver should give you a good shave the first time you use it .</li>
            <li>new gives me a great shave every time.</li>
            <li>This is my third Norelco razor and like it&#x27;s predecessors it has proven to be a very good purchase.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s thinking about switching to this full time and ditching the razor blades all together!</li>
            <li>It was charged, which allowed me to be able to uee it right away, although I plugged it in to be sure it would stay running for some time.</li>
            <li>It is a fine shaver.  </li>
            <li>Simple, functional, holds a good charge, shaves pretty good....</li>
            <li>and he love it, powerful shaver</li>
            <li>Works great and is quiet too.  </li>
            <li>so far so good with this one.reminds</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought this shaver was because I dropped my low-end Norelco shaver that I really wasn&#x27;t very happy with.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is quiet, the charge lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li>I only paid $25, but now that I know how good this model is I would pay full retail for it.</li>
            <li>me of all my other great norelcos had in the past.guess</li>
            <li>Not the razor of the 80&#x27; which lasted 3 Decades and cut super close quickly.</li>
            <li>It shaves close and does it quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, fast, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>This is a much better shaver than the older Norelco that I have been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s of high quality and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The head flips up on a hinge for blow/tap cleaning, and snaps back nicely.  </li>
            <li>10 days so far on initial charge, so battery life seems great.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Norelco razor for many years.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver about a month ago, and so far am quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Huge value for the money, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Close comfortable shave, fast and easy to clean shaver for&lt;br /&gt;a low price.  </li>
            <li>I recommend the razor for your needs at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years, but I finally had to throw it in the trash.  </li>
            <li>and I suspect it will only get better.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First I bought a Wahl.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still counting to see how long charge lasts, but all signs are good so far.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco 5861XL works far better .</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for years but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to do near as good of a job as all the other Norelco&#x27;s I have purchased</li>
            <li>I have used norelco shavers for last 20 years long lasting,durable and good</li>
            <li>it gives a fast and close shave.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t care about being able to get it wet, but I do like the trimmer that is part of the shaver.  </li>
            <li>The shave is reasonably close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the low battery light has not turned on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very close shave every time I use it.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves this razor.  </li>
            <li>but it absolutely blew us away.</li>
            <li>It was loud and powerful sounding.  </li>
            <li>So be sure your drain popup is partially closed, so nothing drops into the drain.</li>
            <li>This razor is light in weight and quiet.</li>
            <li>If left off the cord for 4-5 days, it seems to hold a good charge, but I have not let it fully run down.</li>
            <li>This razor is WAY better than the Braun that I used to use, and it costs 30% less.  </li>
            <li>How a company like Norelco that has made good quality products for such a long time , can put out such a piece of junk like the 7380XL  shaver it beyond me ?</li>
            <li>After many years of use the battery is dead but it still works using a cord and plugging it in.</li>
            <li>Still a fine product when compared to other choices.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say how the more expensive shavers work, as I needed the popup clipper, which this one has, and rotary blades as it also has.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver came very quickly, and packaged with everything indicated.</li>
            <li>I bought this electric razor for my father who needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, but if you tap too hard when the shaving head is open, the blades and metal guards can come out.</li>
            <li>It is OK and does the job, but no better than that.</li>
            <li>My old one still works but it is very old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few Norelco shavers, and this one works just fine.</li>
            <li>left me with too much stubble</li>
            <li>Have had Norelco&#x27;s for years, but this is the quietest and closest shaving razor of any of them so far.  </li>
            <li>had for 45 days and so far I like it</li>
            <li>So far (about 8 shaves)</li>
            <li>I bought this Norelco for my father to replace his old razor</li>
            <li>His old Norelco was 8 years old and would not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>He said it is quiet when on but still shaves as close as a straight edge razor.  </li>
            <li>It replaced an older model of the same brand.  </li>
            <li>If you are a regular cordless shaver user I highly recommend this shaver.  </li>
            <li>It works very well but does take longer than my previous unit to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li>No more snow, I&#x27;m free to go.</li>
            <li>I finally had to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Bought as an alternate to an early morning razor....</li>
            <li>May take a little time to get used to new cut but works very well.</li>
            <li>It is extremely quiet and at first I feared that it was not very powerful.  </li>
            <li>It has a very fast smooth cutting speed.  </li>

            <li> Bought as an alternate to an early morning razor....</li>
            <li> May take a little time to get used to new cut but works very well.</li>
            <li> It is extremely quiet and at first I feared that it was not very powerful.  </li>
            <li> It has a very fast smooth cutting speed.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly and keeps its charge long (at least a week).</li>
            <li> It is an improvement over some other Remington (I tried and used for a couple of years and gave up on it), but not at all over my old Philips shaver, which I used for 30 (!)</li>
            <li> After going over my neck whiskers the other day about 7 or 8 times with the 7380XL and still having them not cut , I decided to dig out my old Norelco 5861XL and try it .</li>
            <li> i hope it lasts as long as the last one which lasted 7 years until the trimmer stopped working.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal in the long run.</li>
            <li> Charge last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> A  step down from my  old 8000 series, but works great.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m old school but could care less of using an electric razor</li>
            <li> Long battery life.</li>
            <li> and holds the charge for a long time.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have always used a Norelco shaver. My old one still works but it is very old so I keep it as a backup.&lt;br /&gt;The new gives me a great shave every time. A single charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The shaver is quiet, the charge lasts for a good while. it gives a fast and close shave. i hope it lasts as long as the last one which lasted 7 years until the trimmer stopped working. I am pleased with the shaver...the price is fair.</li>
            <li> left me with too much stubble</li>
            <li> Husband says that it is the best shave he has had in years.  He always said he wouldn&#x27;t get a Norelco, but this surely changed his mind.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of Norelco Razors recently from Amazon Web link and they were all arrived on time as promised. The razors were the product as promised, too. great !!</li>
            <li> Not the razor of the 80&#x27; which lasted 3 Decades and cut super close quickly. Still a fine product when compared to other choices. I am very satisfied with the delivery time and condition of the product. It works very well but does take longer than my previous unit to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Have had Norelco&#x27;s for years, but this is the quietest and closest shaving razor of any of them so far.  The head flips up on a hinge for blow/tap cleaning, and snaps back nicely.  10 days so far on initial charge, so battery life seems great.  Huge value for the money, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Does the job but seems like it takes a lot of time to get a close shave as compared to other norelco shavers that I have owned.</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco razor and like it&#x27;s predecessors it has proven to be a very good purchase. May take a little time to get used to new cut but works very well. I recommend the razor for your needs at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> beyond expectations.  A  step down from my  old 8000 series, but works great.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  Close comfortable shave, fast and easy to clean shaver for&lt;br /&gt;a low price.  Prefer over foil shavers I own - Braun and Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The best for me.&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco has been my shaver of choice for years.  It shaves close and does it quickly.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and does not have the quality feel of my last Norelco razor. Does not have as many openings in the heads that capture the beard. Requires more time to get a good shave. It does shave close.</li>
            <li> This razor is WAY better than the Braun that I used to use, and it costs 30% less.  It&#x27;s quiet, fast, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> This is a much better shaver than the older Norelco that I have been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care about being able to get it wet, but I do like the trimmer that is part of the shaver.  Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> got rid of norelco aquatec razor owned for 4 months and purchased this one. had for 45 days and so far I like it alot. good close shave not like the aquatec.I have used norelco shavers for last 20 years long lasting,durable and good close shaves. so far so good with this one.reminds me of all my other great norelcos had in the past.guess i&#x27;m old school but could care less of using an electric razor you can shave wet with?if your gonna use that use a blade not an electric razor!! all companies seem to be going that way stupid far as i&#x27;m concerned.if that&#x27;s the way it will be in the future and I hope not i&#x27;ll be turning into a blade and not electric.aquatec said it&#x27;&#x27;ll do both ways. wet and dry.nope lousy for shaving dry that&#x27;s why I purchased the 7380.</li>
            <li> Does everything I want and more. Quiet. Long battery life. I don&#x27;t have a tough beard, but I just needed something for daily use.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to do near as good of a job as all the other Norelco&#x27;s I have purchased</li>
            <li> not as close as a blade, but effective - and bloodless. and holds the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I used the Norelco 7380XL for the 3 week period that they suggest , which is ridicules . This shaver should give you a good shave the first time you use it . It never gave me one good shave in the 3 weeks I used it .The7380XL is no good , avoid it , save you&#x27;re money .  My old Norelco 5861XL works far better . After going over my neck whiskers the other day about 7 or 8 times with the 7380XL and still having them not cut , I decided to dig out my old Norelco 5861XL and try it . After many years of use the battery is dead but it still works using a cord and plugging it in. It immediately gave me a nice close shave , proving itâ€™s not me or my method of shaving thatâ€™s the problem.  Itâ€™s the Norelco 7380XL , itâ€™s  just plain and simple NO GOOD . How a company like Norelco that has made good quality products for such a long time , can put out such a piece of junk like the 7380XL  shaver it beyond me ?</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the shaver is very quiet but it is taking time to get used to that.  It&#x27;s so quiet that I need to check if it is on.  The shave is reasonably close.&lt;br /&gt;It also holds a charge for a long time.  So far (about 8 shaves) the low battery light has not turned on.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way I can wash the heads but it is not good the way I must leave it open to dry out, without the guard on the heads.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic head guard is very flimsy and should be improved and made larger.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend the shaver if it stays this way for the next year.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased Norelco shavers.  And I am a notorious cheapskate.  The only reason I bought this shaver was because I dropped my low-end Norelco shaver that I really wasn&#x27;t very happy with.  I went to a local appliance store (Marbecks in Kansas City) where they sell reconditioned Norelco shavers.  I only paid $25, but now that I know how good this model is I would pay full retail for it. It has a very fast smooth cutting speed.  There is no irritation, it gets into the tough spots, and I don&#x27;t have to go over any area over and over and over.  If you are a regular cordless shaver user I highly recommend this shaver.  If you have never used a shaver before, this is a great one to start with.</li>
            <li> best I ever had, much better than my braun. stopped using razor blades. very close shave every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Worst design ever.  Do not but this.  I have used it for many years, but I finally had to throw it in the trash.  The button that opens the head is exposed do if you put it in a toiletry bag, EVERY time you pack it, it ends up open with shavings spilled all over.  Every trip I take, I hate the razor more than anything so I finally tossed it.  Worked well otherwise.  But don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I bought this Norelco for my father to replace his old razor and he love it, powerful shaver</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I have had Norelcos before and had good results, however this article is without a doubt the best I have ever had.  The shave I got from this electric shaver is the best shave I have ever had as an adult and I suspect it will only get better.  The price was excellent and the feel in my hand was perfect. I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting an excellent shave at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> a VERY DISSAPPOINTING DRY SHAVE , WET NO BETTER THAN BLADE,WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN,,HAVE BETTER $35 DRY SHAVERS AT O]PRESENT</li>
            <li> It is a fine shaver.  It replaced an older model of the same brand.  However, this one requires a very light touch for a close shave.  I am still learning how to use it and more satisfied each time.&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li> I bought this electric razor for my father who needed a new one.  His old Norelco was 8 years old and would not hold a charge.  He absolutely loves this razor.  He says it is the best one he has ever had.  He said it is quiet when on but still shaves as close as a straight edge razor.  My only complaint (mine not my father&#x27;s) is that the razor was received two days later than anticipated.  Not a big deal in the long run.</li>
            <li> Cuts well and is very quiet. Wish there was a two head option. I find the third head gets in the way, when shaving the odd places.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband going on deployment. He uses razors everyday but needed a dry electric shaver to stay in regs over seas. He initially was upset that I&#x27;d spent 70$ on a shaver because his previous ones were only about 20 or 30 bucks but he tried it out anyway and holy cow! It was as close as a razor blade! He has such a dark, thick beard I was nervous it wasn&#x27;t going to work well but it absolutely blew us away. He&#x27;s thinking about switching to this full time and ditching the razor blades all together! Wifey did good &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Simple, functional, holds a good charge, shaves pretty good....a keeper. Bought as an alternate to an early morning razor....It works...an extra 10 minutes sleep!</li>
            <li> Was treated with respect when we had a small issue! They handled it with care and took good care of me!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I had an old Norelco razor for many years.  I am a big believer in running down the battery and then fully recharging.  I think it lasted over 15 years.  I finally had to buy a new one.  First I bought a Wahl.  It looks similar to the Norelco design.  It felt like an airplane when I turned it on.  A lot of power.  It was ok, but it never got close around my nose.  In about a year, the flimsy tab that held the heads in place warped and it never latched again.  Then I bought a Remmington.  It was loud and powerful sounding.  It may have been a problem on my part, but I never adapted to the rectangular design.  I had trouble keeping the screen on my face and was not pleased with the shave.  I think after a week or two, I already had to recharge it. I kept trying it for a month, but finally gave up and returned it.  I came back to this Norelco.  It is extremely quiet and at first I feared that it was not very powerful.  Not true.  It has plenty of power, provides a great shave and gets close to my nose.  I went about a month before I had to recharge it.  I plan on keeping this one a long time and continuing with me belief that you run the battery way down before recharging.  Hopefully it too lasts another 15 years.</li>
            <li> Well, if you&#x27;re over 50, you probably wake up to a little white powder of snow on you face, which used to be a 5 o&#x27;clock shaddow a few years back. I&#x27;ve had a few Norelco shavers, and this one works just fine. Can&#x27;t say how the more expensive shavers work, as I needed the popup clipper, which this one has, and rotary blades as it also has.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver came very quickly, and packaged with everything indicated. It was charged, which allowed me to be able to uee it right away, although I plugged it in to be sure it would stay running for some time. If left off the cord for 4-5 days, it seems to hold a good charge, but I have not let it fully run down. It is easy to clean, but if you tap too hard when the shaving head is open, the blades and metal guards can come out. So be sure your drain popup is partially closed, so nothing drops into the drain. No more snow, I&#x27;m free to go.</li>
            <li> Replacing a Norelco I&#x27;ve had for decades, this model is lighter, much quieter, and gives me an excellent shave. I&#x27;m still counting to see how long charge lasts, but all signs are good so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about a month ago, and so far am quite pleased with it.  It&#x27;s my first rotary shaver, and does a great job.  It&#x27;s of high quality and is easy to clean.  My previous shaver was a Remington, less than a year old, and already failed mechanically.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this electric razor.  He says it&#x27;s the best one he has ever owned.</li>
            <li> Works great and is quiet too.  The battery lasts a long time on a charge.</li>
            <li> Husband loves the nice close shave, smoothness with no irritation and that it&#x27;s cordless.  Charge last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> This razor is light in weight and quiet. Because of these properties it almost feels like it is not &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;. It charges quickly and keeps its charge long (at least a week). I find it a little difficult to shave in places hard to access. My biggest complaint is that it does not provide a close shave, no matter how hard you try. After a couple of hours it feels like you need another shave. This is not normal for me. It is an improvement over some other Remington (I tried and used for a couple of years and gave up on it), but not at all over my old Philips shaver, which I used for 30 (!) years when it finally got problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this. I remain undecided if I want to return it or not. It is OK and does the job, but no better than that.</li>
