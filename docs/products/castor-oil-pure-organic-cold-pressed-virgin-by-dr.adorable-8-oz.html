            <li> very thick, goes on smooth....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely seeing some of my eyebrow hair growing back, but it&#x27;s taking a long time.  </li>
            <li> let it dry</li>
            <li> I bought an empty mascara tube from Amazon, I didn&#x27;t buy one from eBay because it takes about 7 weeks to get it as everything comes from China.</li>
            <li> I never used other castor oil before, so I&#x27;m not exactly an expert on castor oil quality.</li>
            <li> Maybe for some other purposes.</li>
            <li> I curl it on my upper and lower lashes a little on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> so I just use it for my hair and scalp so that it doesn&#x27;t go to waste as I&#x27;ve heard it helps with hair growth.</li>
            <li> Then again, I&#x27;ve always had very thin eyebrows and having waxed them to extreme thinness during my teen years</li>
            <li> I put a little over my eyebrows for them to grow, can&#x27;t say it works!</li>
            <li> I usually use it on my skin and sometimes on my hair</li>
            <li> but I just hate the thickness of this oil but its worth it</li>
            <li> but because this oil is soo thick, my skin wasn&#x27;t reacting well to this product</li>
            <li> buy only organic COLD PRESSED!</li>
            <li> Very thick and sticky</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have not experienced the eyebrow regrowrh that I had hoped.</li>
            <li> if it does not say COLD PRESSED or ORGANIC</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for my lipbalm recipe and for my eyebrow growth serum recipe</li>
            <li> Great item - fast delivery!</li>
            <li> 5 stars.. I will be ordering some more soon. The castor oil is extremely fresh and it cleans out the intestines.</li>
            <li> This totally worked for my mom&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> Nice thick oil, good for eyelash growth, moisturizing eye drops, and on my cuticles. Love the oil, just wish it were packaged in a glass bottle rather than plastic and that the label had a bit more info (like country of origin, uses, or health benefits.) Very nice oil and a large quantity for the price. 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I like this brand, this oil seems pure and the price was great as well. I usually use it on my skin and sometimes on my hair (it makes your hair grow very fast if used regularly and also makes it ticker  and denser)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I do my hair and then I put the castor oil on it then let it dry and I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair for 3 days, when I used to wash it every day. my hair is getting stronger and Thicker and its being repaired.I would buy this again</li>
            <li> I use this to remove my eyemake up as it doesn&#x27;t sting and works really well.  I also know castor oil is good for wrinkles so what better thing to use around my eyes.  :)  I&#x27;m sure it has many other uses but this is all I use it for and it works great and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Helps my hair, my lashes, and eyebrows</li>
            <li> I know the good of castor oil. It is also a good moisturizer for nightime for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for sometime. I put a little over my eyebrows for them to grow, can&#x27;t say it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this Castor Oil to help nourish and grow my eyelashes. It works just great and in a matter of just a few weeks I have noticed a big improvement in the growth and condition of my eyelashes. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to nourish and grow their eyelashes. I bought an empty mascara tube from Amazon, I didn&#x27;t buy one from eBay because it takes about 7 weeks to get it as everything comes from China. So I put the Castor Oil in the clean bottle. Then at bedtime when I wash my face I curl it on my upper and lower lashes a little on the heavy side. It washes off easily in the morning with warm soap and water. Do this every night and in a short time you will notice a big improvement.</li>
            <li> I use this castor oil on my eyebrows to help them grow back and so far, the results have been so-so.  I&#x27;m definitely seeing some of my eyebrow hair growing back, but it&#x27;s taking a long time.  Then again, I&#x27;ve always had very thin eyebrows and having waxed them to extreme thinness during my teen years was NOT the best idea.  Parts of my eyebrows where hair should be have not grown back in YEARS.  I guess I will have to use this oil a bit longer and see where it takes me.</li>
            <li> Works excellent! Did what it needed to do!</li>
            <li> it Didnt do what I wanted tit to do, BUT I&#x27;M SURE THE BRAND IS AMAZING!! BUT NOT FOR ME...</li>
            <li> One of the best product that I use to put on my hair once aweek ..I do mix it with coconut  oil the extra virgin kind....soak your hair with cover for couple of hours then wash it ..it will leave ur hair nice shiny and healthy ....love it</li>
            <li> Originally I bought this for my face to treat acne but because this oil is soo thick, my skin wasn&#x27;t reacting well to this product so I just use it for my hair and scalp so that it doesn&#x27;t go to waste as I&#x27;ve heard it helps with hair growth.</li>
            <li> Castor oil great for the old feet, and I got the idea from my mother as her 82 year old were soft and always looked good.  Now that I am retired, I will be dedicated more time to my health from head to toe.</li>
            <li> I love this Organic Castor oil. I use it on my skin to keep it soft!</li>
            <li> I love this product! This is one of the oils I use in my hair regimen. This has so many uses and it&#x27;s organic and very affordable. I will be repurchasing this again and the shipping was very fast as well.</li>
            <li> I am using this to help my eyelashes grow and it actually works!!</li>

            <li> Very thick and sticky but I use a bit on my face at night and it really has helped with the sun damage I have.</li>
            <li> Great and awesome price!!</li>
            <li> This is the nicest Castor Oil I have every used. It does not leave a residue. Can be used on the face. Use is mainly from my Liver.</li>
            <li> I never used other castor oil before, so I&#x27;m not exactly an expert on castor oil quality. I used it for some DIY projects and it came out better than I expected using this stuff! I think it&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li> I love it for my hair feel my hair getting stronger and thicker but I just hate the thickness of this oil but its worth it</li>
            <li> Love this product, using it to nourish and regrow eyebrows, so far i really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working but from many articles I am sure that it will. very thick, goes on smooth....just by looking at the Oil you can tell it&#x27;s refined very well.....great price and hoping it will do what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Just got this in. bottle is was in good shape and the seal was intact. Once opened the castor oil smelled like its suppose to and all seems to be very good. Looking forward to using it in the many beauty regimens and recipes that I use it for.</li>
            <li> Great for the skin and excellent in getting rid of stretch mark! It keeps the skin soft, smooth, and young looking! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Ok for daily use. When applied to hair, some of my hair falls, so I&#x27;m discontinuing the use of this product for hair. Maybe for some other purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product to help my eyelashes grow. I&#x27;ve been using it about a month now and have to say there is no difference. My eyelashes did not grow a bit. Very dissatisfied</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Five stars! Works perfect for me. I love it.</li>
