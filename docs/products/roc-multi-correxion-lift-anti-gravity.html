            <li>The packaging was great and the creme didn&#x27;t look or smell</li>
            <li>it is very nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;d be waking up in the morning admiring your own skin!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I like Roc products a lot, this was a good price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m headed for 30 and trying to take good care of my skin.</li>
            <li>pregnant- because while retinol is awesome and effective, it&#x27;s a no</li>
            <li>Love this eye cream!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY eye creams that promise to reduce the appearance of lines but none work as well as this!</li>
            <li>After using for two weeks I see no improvement of any kind.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best eye creams I have tried that really does work.</li>
            <li>What I truly appreciate is that  ROC has this line so I can continue using effective ingredients while I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I have never found a better product...</li>
            <li>It feels great on the eyes and it is very creamy</li>
            <li>my skin looks and feel better since i&#x27;ve used this item.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay for me.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem oily or make mascara more prone to smudge, like many eye treatment do.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheaper than it was when CVS had it :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28 and have noticed some lines forming around my eyes and heard that this stuff is supposed to be pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the results &amp; continue to look forward to even bigger results when the fine lines disappear (hopefully they do)</li>
            <li>and I really like the pleasant scent and the way it feels when you apply it and afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The bags under my eyes have shrunk and the fine lines have disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>So far very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>A higher price tag does NOT equal a more effective product :)  </li>
            <li>and you just need a small amount, love love love this!</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a couple weeks since starting this eyes cream &amp; already the bags are gone, I didn&#x27;t have under eye darkness, it is more the fine lines &amp; bagginess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps with dryness, lines, after a few days it seems like the skin is smoother, but most importantly it doesn&#x27;t seem to make the tissue around the eye more puffy.</li>
            <li>I have  lines when I smile</li>
            <li>It really works for me.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I woke up with super puffy red eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Roc products before and saw this new line of cream from them at Target.  </li>
            <li>I have dark circles and fine crow feet lines.  </li>
            <li>maybe in the future, bu I expected more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting hard to find---but this stuff is very kind to my upper eyelids---it has improved that crepe paper look that was starting to develop.</li>
            <li>cream is not heavy, or greasy &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take long to go right into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a 60 year old I should see something by now.</li>
            <li>least it&#x27;s not drooping more.</li>
            <li>So far, after two weeks, I havent notice any changes in my under eye or upper eye area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked really fast probably due to the Retinol that Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li>Many eye creams in my experience have simply made the under eye puffiness worse, so I had actually been going without for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I like the cream, although I&#x27;m not noticing much of a lift in my left upper lid due to an accident that I had years ago.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>It stings a little if I pat it on my eye area too much, so I try not to aggravate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <ol>
            <li> After using for two weeks I see no improvement of any kind. As a 60 year old I should see something by now.</li>
            <li> This product came in a timely manner and I really like the pleasant scent and the way it feels when you apply it and afterwards.  So far very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Roc products before and saw this new line of cream from them at Target.  I have dark circles and fine crow feet lines.  I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s.  I was using the Neutrogena Ageless Intensive Deep Wrinkle eye cream (the little blue tube) before this.  I went through two bottles of that and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in dark circles or wrinkles. It just felt like a moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been using this Roc cream for two weeks and already I&#x27;m using less under eye concealer. It&#x27;s worked really fast probably due to the Retinol that Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t have.  I also use this cream on my eyes during the day underneath concealer.  I have oily skin and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.  I love this cream.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I was shocked.  In my opinion it&#x27;s one of the best eye creams out there.  The bags under my eyes have shrunk and the fine lines have disappeared.  Definitely will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream!  I&#x27;ve tried MANY eye creams that promise to reduce the appearance of lines but none work as well as this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting hard to find---but this stuff is very kind to my upper eyelids---it has improved that crepe paper look that was starting to develop. I hope J&amp;J is not taking it off the market.</li>
            <li> It really works for me. You don&#x27;t see the improvement until you use it for a few days then you will notice that your eyes are wider.</li>
            <li> I have been using eye cream since i was 32 and I am now 58 and everyone says I look 49....I have never found a better product...It feels great on the eyes and it is very creamy and you just need a small amount, love love love this!</li>
            <li> Roc anti gravity eye cream is perfect to keep my lids in place.  Goes on easily and smoothly.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream last night from Target. I&#x27;m 28 and have noticed some lines forming around my eyes and heard that this stuff is supposed to be pretty good. Well I put a few dots of cream around my eyes and rubbed it in and went to sleep. I woke up with super puffy red eyes. I don&#x27;t know if maybe some of it got in my eyes during the night or if it was an allergic reaction. I&#x27;m going to not use it for a few days and try again to see if it happens again. Has anyone else had this same problem?</li>
            <li> Works for me I can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this item it is very nice on my skin. my skin looks and feel better since i&#x27;ve used this item. great buy. an little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. thanks.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eye creams I have tried that really does work. It stings a little if I pat it on my eye area too much, so I try not to aggravate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use this morning &amp; night. It&#x27;s been a couple weeks since starting this eyes cream &amp; already the bags are gone, I didn&#x27;t have under eye darkness, it is more the fine lines &amp; bagginess.&lt;br /&gt;My eye area is lifted &amp; moisturized. I&#x27;m anxious to know what my eye area will look like after a few months of using this eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is not heavy, or greasy &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take long to go right into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the results &amp; continue to look forward to even bigger results when the fine lines disappear (hopefully they do)</li>
            <li> Good product. Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised. Satisfactorily made and serves the purpose for which it was designed. Would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Roc for years and I buy them from Costco. Imagine my delight when I saw this eye cream while shopping at Grocery Outlet for $12.99! I had to have it! And yes, I looked for expiration date. There wasn&#x27;t any that I could remember seeing. The packaging was great and the creme didn&#x27;t look or smell old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Roc eye creme in the evening. I do think it helps in lifting the skin around my eyes. I use another product during the day, which protects my skin from forehead to toe----organic coconut oil from Trader Joe&#x27;s. Yes, only $5.99 for a one pound jar! I&#x27;m an islander. My daily regimen includes Dove&#x27;s Visible Care creme body wash ($5.99) followed by organic coconut oil. Try this and you&#x27;d be waking up in the morning admiring your own skin!</li>
            <li> I like the cream, although I&#x27;m not noticing much of a lift in my left upper lid due to an accident that I had years ago.&lt;br /&gt;At least it&#x27;s not drooping more.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay for me. I use it only at night because it seems like it had some sort of tint in it. But it did help a little on my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Many eye creams in my experience have simply made the under eye puffiness worse, so I had actually been going without for quite a while. I like Roc products a lot, this was a good price, so I gave it a try, even using it at night when I knew I didn&#x27;t have to go anywhere the next day. It helps with dryness, lines, after a few days it seems like the skin is smoother, but most importantly it doesn&#x27;t seem to make the tissue around the eye more puffy. Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem oily or make mascara more prone to smudge, like many eye treatment do.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work well at minimizing wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> So far, after two weeks, I havent notice any changes in my under eye or upper eye area. maybe in the future, bu I expected more</li>
            <li> I have  lines when I smile so I thought I&#x27;d try multi correxion lift --it took about a month then I couls see the improvement.</li>
            <li> So far so good... Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream. I&#x27;m headed for 30 and trying to take good care of my skin. For me, this eye cream works better than other drugstore creams or even the expensive Chanel one I was using. I think it is the ingredients- it has glycolic acid and copper in it. What I truly appreciate is that  ROC has this line so I can continue using effective ingredients while I&#x27;m pregnant- because while retinol is awesome and effective, it&#x27;s a no-no while preggers!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this eye cream before going for the really expensive ones. A higher price tag does NOT equal a more effective product :)  Thank God Amazon carries this...and it&#x27;s cheaper than it was when CVS had it :)</li>
