            <li>Would give it 10 stars if I could !!! :-)</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance but feel sticky after using.  </li>
            <li>All natural, but most importantly, it smells great without any chemicals at all!</li>
            <li>; which I know from research is linked to many health problems including lung disease, heart disease, and cancer.&lt;br /&gt;Ugh!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather not have anyone take a chance that this toxic soup will be safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as many contain known toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went about 18 hours before reapplying more lotion.     </li>
            <li>This especially works AWESOME on your face!!</li>
            <li>The lotion applies well and has a fainter smell than soap, I love it.</li>
            <li>A favorite of mine for years.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, the texture and the results.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering many more Zum products for myself and for gifts.</li>
            <li>The best lotion I have bought in a long time.</li>
            <li>I love the scent but more importantly, the moisturizing aspect.  </li>
            <li>It feels luxurious, smells utterly divine, and makes the skin so so soft.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great treat for you or someone nice who deserves a treat.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it&#x27;s silky and smooth</li>
            <li>This lotion is hydrating, smells fantastic and leaves a lovely finish, but not oily.</li>
            <li>Scent to strong to.even use</li>
            <li>This lotion is alright, but I think it&#x27;s scented too strongly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, as well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very creamy lotion and the scent is amazing, but not too strong to be overpowering.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this lotion and feel that it is pretty good for my skin, although not as good as some other lotions.  </li>
            <li>Great smell that lasts on the skin the entire day/</li>
            <li>I put is on at night and still feel smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing and smooth.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is silky smooth and not a bit sticky.  </li>
            <li>Skin remains smooth and hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lotion is great and smells terrific</li>
            <li>This frankincense &amp; myrrh lotion smells exactly the way that scent is intended to smell with an underlying sweetness!!</li>
            <li>The lotion glides on easily and rubs in quickly.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite (next to Moroccan Oil body souffle, though it is not as rich and hydrating, but love the MO scent!).  </li>
            <li>The scent is unique and calming.</li>
            <li>Smells great and holds in moisture for a long while.</li>
            <li>Very smooth gentle lotion.</li>
            <li>and wow, it gives my face a really nice glow.</li>
            <li>I love my Zum and use as much as I can find of soaps, lotions and wash for clothing.</li>
            <li>I bought a lotion at a local health food store after the clerk recommended this as safe &amp; chemical-free (I stated I was seeking a safe moisturizer for a friend coming out of ICU in hospital).</li>
            <li>They are all really mild scents.     </li>
            <li>Smells great, all natural and nonoffensive ingredients, and absorbs into the skin better than any other lotion I know.</li>
            <li>I also have very dry skin, and most lotions don&#x27;t last or don&#x27;t feel good when I apply them.  </li>
            <li>This lotion, never the less does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Lotion is somewhat greasy at first but works well.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, especially after it has a chance to soak in.</li>
            <li>I was able to buy it cheaper on amazon than I can buy it at a local store.</li>
            <li>I will buy this again and again and try the different scents :)</li>
            <li>Can only access contents by removing the top and pouring it out of the bottle</li>
            <li>It leaves skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I ordered the assorted Zum bag with this lotion sample in it, and I fell in love with it instantly, so I ended up ordering it in this size.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend buying this lotion along with the Zum rub (which works WONDERS on dry skin and taking make up off) and the Zum bars (makes your skin feel and smell so good in the shower).</li>
            <li>It really soaks into your skin well</li>
            <li>Will be used up fast.</li>
            <li>I am very fussy about lotion.  </li>
            <li>and my husband even will use it because it is not greasy but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Frankincense and myrrh and I would highly recommend this to people who have winter or summer for that matter, dry skin.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully unique scent that lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Zum Body to anyone looking for a high quality product.</li>
            <li>and after you apply it, your skin feels very silky and soft - just like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis, and the Boswellia (a natural analgesic) really eases the pain from cracking plaques, while the butters and oils are so soothing.  </li>
            <li>but I love the heavy woodsier earthy tones.</li>
            <li>rich, creamy and such a wonderful scent, I just hate to run out of this</li>
            <li>New to this product line, and would recommend</li>
            <li>Leave your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>and my arms are completely healed!</li>
            <li>far as I am concerned, I will NOT be without a bottle from now on.&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!</li>
            <li>But the ingredients include marshmallow and many other basic plants.</li>
            <li>It is not only organic and has no junk added, but it hydrates my skin all day long and makes it feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the only lotion that works for me, and you could probably eat this - it&#x27;s so pure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Indigo Wild Zum Bar Goats Milk Soap Frankincense and Myrrh</li>
            <li>I like that the ingredients are natural.  </li>
            <li>my ashey skin is nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A HIGH QUALITY LOTION THAT REALLY GIVES RELIEF TO DRY SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes my super dry desert skin actually look hydrated.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty expensive product, so I use it sparingly, mostly for the scent.</li>
            <li>Think this has a little age to it as there isn&#x27;t the usual lovely smell that I get when I buy it at Whole Foods, though it still  hydrates.  </li>
            <li>i will use no other from now on.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is lovely and just right....not too strong.....not to weak.  </li>
            <li>I visited the company&#x27;s homepage and soon discovered the company is a unique, seemly quirky small business that uses natural and organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a huge long way.</li>
            <li>This has been the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that really relieves my winter dry skin.</li>
            <li>Would expect to pay double if this product were offered by major cosmetic lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Only a tiny bit of lotion is needed as its pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>I mean a lotion that quickly dissipates into the skin.</li>

            <li> I like that the ingredients are natural.  </li>
            <li> my ashey skin is nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A HIGH QUALITY LOTION THAT REALLY GIVES RELIEF TO DRY SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes my super dry desert skin actually look hydrated.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty expensive product, so I use it sparingly, mostly for the scent.</li>
            <li> Think this has a little age to it as there isn&#x27;t the usual lovely smell that I get when I buy it at Whole Foods, though it still  hydrates.  </li>
            <li> i will use no other from now on.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is lovely and just right....not too strong.....not to weak.  </li>
            <li> I visited the company&#x27;s homepage and soon discovered the company is a unique, seemly quirky small business that uses natural and organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a huge long way.</li>
            <li> This has been the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that really relieves my winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> Would expect to pay double if this product were offered by major cosmetic lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Only a tiny bit of lotion is needed as its pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> I mean a lotion that quickly dissipates into the skin.</li>
            <li> The fragrance last long time, which I find a plus.</li>
            <li> Since our skin is the largest organ in our body and anything we apply absorbs into our bloodstream within 26 seconds, I&#x27;ve become a fanatic about having all pure ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion is the same, however, because everyone is so different, i was disappointed by how much more oily it is than i had hoped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be keeping this lotion on hand for as long as they keep making it!!!</li>
            <li> I had problems with extreme dry skin on my arms to the point where I went to my doctor who prescribed medication that didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I hate that), just gives it a little bit of shimmer that makes your skin look and feel so healthy!</li>
            <li> Because of the other 2 reviews, i bought a bottle of Zum lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please be very careful with your &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; body products</li>
            <li> A thick lotion for the human body.  </li>
            <li> I can use a lot of other products and still wake up scratching my arms in the night...not with Zum!</li>
            <li> A small coin-sized squirt of Zum lotion goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The lotion is very thin and spreads onto your skin really well.</li>
            <li> The scent is heavy..</li>
            <li> Works well year round.</li>
            <li> I bought the small sized tubes of this lotion for stocking stuffers and ended up wishing I&#x27;d bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> Even though the lotion is thin, it&#x27;s nothing like any other lotion I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> my friends are now addicted to this&lt;br /&gt;lotion</li>
            <li> Im addicted to this scent.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The most amazing product for scent and moisturizing. i will use no other from now on. The scent is incredible. A little goes a huge long way. Love this product. The scent is heavy..but I love the heavy woodsier earthy tones. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had problems with extreme dry skin on my arms to the point where I went to my doctor who prescribed medication that didn&#x27;t work! I decided to use Zum twice per day and my arms are completely healed! Thank you Zum!!!</li>
            <li> I love the scent but more importantly, the moisturizing aspect.  I can use a lot of other products and still wake up scratching my arms in the night...not with Zum!</li>
            <li> rich, creamy and such a wonderful scent, I just hate to run out of this</li>
            <li> Zum Body lotion is the one I&#x27;ve been searching for two years!  It is not only organic and has no junk added, but it hydrates my skin all day long and makes it feel silky smooth.  Since our skin is the largest organ in our body and anything we apply absorbs into our bloodstream within 26 seconds, I&#x27;ve become a fanatic about having all pure ingredients.  I also have very dry skin, and most lotions don&#x27;t last or don&#x27;t feel good when I apply them.  This is the only lotion that works for me, and you could probably eat this - it&#x27;s so pure.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Smells divine. Works well year round.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of incense and this lotion&#x27;s scent is authentic frankincense.  Not overpowering, scent stays just above the skin.  Lotion is somewhat greasy at first but works well.  Perfect for all Earth Mothers!</li>
            <li> Great smell that lasts on the skin the entire day/ Only a tiny bit of lotion is needed as its pretty heavy. Have and will continue to buy over and over.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and works great Happy with it!</li>
            <li> These products are amazing!!! Natural and great for skin!!! I started with their soap and now have lotions, hand soaps and washes!!!</li>
            <li> this is the best lotion around love the scent !</li>
            <li> smells so good and absorbs quick.</li>
            <li> Very smooth gentle lotion. It is not greasy or drying. Good fragrance, although I do not wear cologne or perfume when using this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it&#x27;s silky and smooth</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t dare to imagine the number of body lotions that I have tried in 50 years....aaagh...this is my favorite (next to Moroccan Oil body souffle, though it is not as rich and hydrating, but love the MO scent!).  This lotion is hydrating, smells fantastic and leaves a lovely finish, but not oily.</li>
            <li> You gotta love this cream.  It smells so good and is so soothing. I put is on at night and still feel smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li> I bought the small sized tubes of this lotion for stocking stuffers and ended up wishing I&#x27;d bought one for myself. I ordered the lotion, hand soap, and bath salts. They all smell great!</li>
            <li> The best lotion I have bought in a long time. Smells great and you don&#x27;t even have to put perfume on after applying your lotion. Leave your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> This has a more feminine smell than the Frankincense and Myrrh lotion from Purple Prairie Botanicals but it is very pleasant and lasts much longer.  The lotion glides on easily and rubs in quickly.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion! It&#x27;s organic and the&lt;br /&gt;fragrance is unparrelell to any other.&lt;br /&gt;All my friends are now addicted to this&lt;br /&gt;lotion as well. It even softens my cuticles&lt;br /&gt;and keeps my hands looking healthy and&lt;br /&gt;youthful.</li>
            <li> Because of the other 2 reviews, i bought a bottle of Zum lotion. I&#x27;ve been using Indigo Wild Zum Bar Goats Milk Soap Frankincense and Myrrh and i Love it&#x27;s smell.  The smell of the lotion is the same, however, because everyone is so different, i was disappointed by how much more oily it is than i had hoped.</li>
            <li> Would give it 10 stars if I could !!! :-)</li>
            <li> This is pricey for the amount you get, so it is a treat I buy maybe twice a year. And man, is it a treat. It makes my super dry desert skin actually look hydrated. It feels luxurious, smells utterly divine, and makes the skin so so soft.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great treat for you or someone nice who deserves a treat.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell. Amazing feel.  Moisturizing and smooth. My husband loves this scent. He can&#x27;t keep his hands off of me once I put it on.  Now that&#x27;s a product to keep buying.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance but feel sticky after using.  The Zum Rub is the product I prefer to use on my skin.</li>
            <li> Scent to strong to.even use</li>
            <li> All natural, but most importantly, it smells great without any chemicals at all! This is a pretty expensive product, so I use it sparingly, mostly for the scent.</li>
            <li> Please do not use this deliciously-scented concoction on children, elders, or people with compromised immune systems! I bought a lotion at a local health food store after the clerk recommended this as safe &amp; chemical-free (I stated I was seeking a safe moisturizer for a friend coming out of ICU in hospital). I was in a tizz &amp; fell for the fab fragrance not realizing that along with &amp;#34;essential oils&amp;#34; this product also has &amp;#34;fragrance oil&amp;#34; which I know from research is linked to many health problems including lung disease, heart disease, and cancer.&lt;br /&gt;Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;This also has carbomer, potassium sorbate, and hydrolyzed jojoba esters. I&#x27;d rather not have anyone take a chance that this toxic soup will be safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be very careful with your &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; body products as many contain known toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Really nice lotion. I love the scent, especially after it has a chance to soak in. This has been the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that really relieves my winter dry skin. I plan to always keep a bottle on hand.</li>
            <li> Zum lotion is simply amazing. It has a very mild Earthy scent to it, none of that eye-watering perfumey stuff, bleck! The lotion is very thin and spreads onto your skin really well. A small coin-sized squirt of Zum lotion goes a long way! Even though the lotion is thin, it&#x27;s nothing like any other lotion I have ever tried. It really soaks into your skin well and after you apply it, your skin feels very silky and soft - just like a baby&#x27;s bottom. The silkyness doesn&#x27;t wear off either! I went about 18 hours before reapplying more lotion.     This especially works AWESOME on your face!! I massage some of this stuff onto my face before I put my make up on and wow, it gives my face a really nice glow. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny (ew, cause I hate that), just gives it a little bit of shimmer that makes your skin look and feel so healthy! And it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores either!    You really can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the Zum scents. My favorite is the lemon-lavender, but the sandlewood is sooo good too! They are all really mild scents.     I definitely recommend buying this lotion along with the Zum rub (which works WONDERS on dry skin and taking make up off) and the Zum bars (makes your skin feel and smell so good in the shower).</li>
            <li> I love my Zum and use as much as I can find of soaps, lotions and wash for clothing. The lotion applies well and has a fainter smell than soap, I love it. Will be used up fast.</li>
            <li> A favorite of mine for years.</li>
            <li> I am very fussy about lotion.  This has great ingredients, smells great and my husband even will use it because it is not greasy but very moisturizing. I was able to buy it cheaper on amazon than I can buy it at a local store. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Think this has a little age to it as there isn&#x27;t the usual lovely smell that I get when I buy it at Whole Foods, though it still  hydrates.  I&#x27;ve ordered the Aging Hippie patchouli for a change - we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> This lotion is alright, but I think it&#x27;s scented too strongly.</li>
            <li> A thick lotion for the human body.  I wish it was a lighter lotion.  By that I mean a lotion that quickly dissipates into the skin. This lotion, never the less does a good job.  I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heaven in a bottle! Thick and creamy. I use it as my fragrance before going out or even to bed!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  Although frankincense (Boswellia) is not listed on the label, I imagine it&#x27;s included in the &amp;#34;essential oils&amp;#34; description, and I sure can smell it, the scent is WONDERFUL!!  I have psoriasis, and the Boswellia (a natural analgesic) really eases the pain from cracking plaques, while the butters and oils are so soothing.  I will buy this again and again and try the different scents :)</li>
            <li> I love the scent. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT SKIN PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A HIGH QUALITY LOTION THAT REALLY GIVES RELIEF TO DRY SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  The scent is wonderful.  I like that the ingredients are natural.  I will definitely be buying this again. Quick delivery, as well!</li>
            <li> Arrived with no pump. Can only access contents by removing the top and pouring it out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Love Zum products! This frankincense &amp; myrrh lotion smells exactly the way that scent is intended to smell with an underlying sweetness!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is one of the best I have ever used and it smells great! I am a huge fan of Frankincense and myrrh and I would highly recommend this to people who have winter or summer for that matter, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully unique scent that lasts a long time.  The lotion itself is good quality, too.  I&#x27;ll be keeping this lotion on hand for as long as they keep making it!!!</li>
            <li> I love the scent, the texture and the results. Not greasy or sticky. Highly recommend Zum Body to anyone looking for a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this lotion and feel that it is pretty good for my skin, although not as good as some other lotions.  I still like it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels good on skin.  I have been using it when I get out of the shower on body and my ashey skin is nearly gone.  Beware fragrance is great but can confilct with perfumes if you wear them.  The fragrance last long time, which I find a plus.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion! The scent is unique and calming. It leaves skin smooth and soft. I visited the company&#x27;s homepage and soon discovered the company is a unique, seemly quirky small business that uses natural and organic ingredients.  I plan on ordering many more Zum products for myself and for gifts.</li>
            <li> I ordered the assorted Zum bag with this lotion sample in it, and I fell in love with it instantly, so I ended up ordering it in this size. It&#x27;s a very creamy lotion and the scent is amazing, but not too strong to be overpowering. A little bit goes a long way, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion!  The fragrance is lovely and just right....not too strong.....not to weak.  The lotion itself is silky smooth and not a bit sticky.  Skin remains smooth and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;The price is mind blowing!  Would expect to pay double if this product were offered by major cosmetic lines.&lt;br /&gt;As far as I am concerned, I will NOT be without a bottle from now on.&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!</li>
            <li> Smells great and holds in moisture for a long while.</li>
            <li> Lotion is great and smells terrific</li>
            <li> New to this product line, and would recommend</li>
            <li> Smells great, all natural and nonoffensive ingredients, and absorbs into the skin better than any other lotion I know. The aroma is quite perfumey so you have to be prepared for that. But the ingredients include marshmallow and many other basic plants. No yucky stuff. Really great lotion.</li>
            <li> Im addicted to this scent. Softens nicely</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with the lotion the price and the time sent. Told my daughter about this she loves this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance...!</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly and feels great on the skin.</li>
