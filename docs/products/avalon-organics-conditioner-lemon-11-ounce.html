            <li>I always get the best deals on Amazon!!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>The smell of this conditioner is so wonderfully lemony..</li>
            <li>The scent is perfect.</li>
            <li>I use their shampoos, conditioners and facewash and always feel great doint so.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but once my hair dries this stuff always makes it feel like it&#x27;s coated in greasy.</li>
            <li>Smells great , works great on my daughters curly tops.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not to mention that most of them DON&#x27;T work!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>Forget clarifying conditioners if you have my kind of hair!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, good product.</li>
            <li>My husband loved it</li>
            <li>Provides nice cleaning and good conditioning.</li>
            <li>Switched to another organic brand with MUCH better results!</li>
            <li>It does smell nice.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent of butter/oil.  </li>
            <li>purchased this conditioner with my own funds.r-dry either.</li>
            <li>purchased this conditioner with my own funds.</li>
            <li>This has got to be the absolute BEST conditioner I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I liked this conditioner, I just didn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>The lemon smell is perfect, refreshing, natural lemon smell.  </li>
            <li>The products from this company are top notch.</li>
            <li>The shampoo came with a pump top dispenser but not this one.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>My quest is challenging because I also donate my hair to charity every three years.</li>
            <li>The hair was not detangling as most conditioners would do.</li>
            <li>So this meant more hair would pull out during the brushing process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested many, many conditioners over the years and not had this combination of issues happen before.</li>

            <li>Love the &amp;#34;lemony&amp;#34; smell of all Avalon Lemon products.</li>
            <li>Avalon reformulated all their products (I called and asked, they confirmed).</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just letting you know that I believe it&#x27;s something that should be resolved ASAP as I am pretty sure I&#x27;m not the only one who thinks like that and putting on a protection seal would greatly improve the reputation of Avalon Organics.</li>
            <li>If I have a dollop of conditioner on my hand, and I put it on my head, it is going to touch the top of my hair first.</li>
            <li>I was done, the hair would feel squeaky clean - which is a problem.</li>

            <li>Since it also contains natural oils, it washes away nicely, too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even at its full waist length point.</li>
            <li>It probably would be best for someone with short, blonde hair who likes the scent of lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It probably would be best for someone with short, blonde hair who likes the scent of lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very refreshing and soothing at the same time!</li>
            <li>On top of that, my hair was soooooooo incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>I only wish this product was more widely available.  </li>
            <li>Avalon Organics Lemon Conditioner seemed like it would be just right for me.</li>
            <li>In general I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>and it was perfect....very minimal to no flyaways, shiny and incredibly soft hair, no weigh down and a wonderful light lemon scent!</li>
            <li>My hair love this conditioner ( and  same brand shampoo).</li>
            <li>I do realize that many people with blonde hair use lemon juice to bleach their hair and make it lighter.</li>
            <li>I do realize that many people with blonde hair use lemon juice to bleach their hair and make it lighter.</li>
            <li>I love lemons anyway, so to find a lemon conditioner was a definite bonus!</li>
            <li>Smells very good and it does moisturize, but after a week of me washing my hair everyday and using this, I realize I should use this conditioner only sparingly because of built up residue.</li>
            <li>Whether you have hair like mine, or thick, unruly, damaged, etc--or just need a deep conditioning treatment to use on the ends, I think this stuff is the best bang for your buck out there.</li>
            <li>It did make my hair shiny and it did smell good, but I am just not sure it&#x27;s for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thick, wavy, slightly dry, so it may work better for someone with more fine, oily hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel there is much after-use smell that hangs around.  </li>
            <li>Tried and used a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>This means one has to really pound it to get the conditioner out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very lightweight conditioner that would benefit someone with oily hair.  </li>
            <li>Really</li>
            <li>Nice scent, a bit harsh on curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Apparently my hair is now turning white at a prodigious rate where I am putting most of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Apparently my hair is now turning white at a prodigious rate where I am putting most of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and can get quite itchy if I use a shampoo or soap that has certain chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>The natural oils work very well on my curly hair.</li>
            <li>conditioner seems to get absorbed nearly instantly.</li>
            <li>I recommend this if you are looking for a thick kind of conditioner--clearly some of the less-than-five-star reviews are not looking for this.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I actually ended up giving this to my teenage daughter, who does in fact have oily hair, and it seems to work just fine for her.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend the peppermint shampoo and the peppermint body lotion has become something I cannot live without.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could not believe how soft it was after using this conditioner!</li>
            <li>It works well with the shampoo and leaves my hair soft without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It says it restores natural highlights and color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I am a sucker for punishment I will try the rosemary version to see if it&#x27;s any better, and post a review there when I&#x27;m done testing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I am a sucker for punishment I will try the rosemary version to see if it&#x27;s any better, and post a review there when I&#x27;m done testing.</li>
            <li>So I need my hair to remain thick and healthy while I do this.</li>
            <li>Maybe its the &#x27;clarifying&#x27; quality to it, but my hair seemed more stripped, much more difficult to comb through than with their other products.  </li>
            <li>Smell didn&#x27;t bother me - what did was the fact that it barely conditioned - my hair was always tangled after use.</li>
            <li>However, I was a bit surprised that the product didn&#x27;t have an inner seal that covers the hole.</li>
            <li>My hair is very textured and prone to drying and cracking but this conditioner keeps it moisturized without the need for a lot of other products.  </li>

            <li> Very disappointing because the old formula was simply amazing.</li>
            <li> The individual strands of my hair are thick and wavy, so I appreciate a really nourishing conditioner that helps prevent frizz.</li>
            <li> The conditioner comes in a thick buttery emulsion and it&#x27;s hard to dispense even with my strong male forceful squeeze.  </li>
            <li> Look around at other recent reviews and you&#x27;ll see I am not the only one.</li>
            <li> I use it less frequently because my hair is usually dry.</li>

            <li> The texture is very different from any other conditioner that I have used.  </li>
            <li> This is bad enough when the bottle is beginning, but by the end of the bottle it makes getting any out quite challenging.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.  </li>
            <li> First, the conditioner is very thick, and the container cannot sit on its lid.</li>
            <li> of this was odd enough.</li>

            <li> I then have to massage it down</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find soap, shampoo, and conditioner products that have fewer odd chemicals in this.</li>

            <li> I have very long, somewhat thick hair....</li>
            <li> past middle of my back....and usually have trouble finding a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t have horrible ingredients and a horribly strong smell along with it!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the container is hard-plastic and it&#x27;s hard to squeeze the bottler to dispense.  </li>
            <li> I also find that after a few uses the oils help control frizzies and \\&quot;hay-head\\&quot; by keeping my hair in order.  </li>
            <li> Just dried</li>
            <li> Was hard to wash out ...</li>
            <li> Over my time with the bottle I used larger and larger (bordering on, to me, outrageous) amounts of conditioner on my hair.</li>
            <li> Not good for people who have oily hair.</li>
            <li> Otherwise my charity donations will make recipients unhappy rather than happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> For my Daughter in Law.  I always get the best deals on Amazon!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I definitely didn&#x27;t like this conditioner as much as other Avalon Organics conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.  Maybe its the &#x27;clarifying&#x27; quality to it, but my hair seemed more stripped, much more difficult to comb through than with their other products.  The lemon smell is perfect, refreshing, natural lemon smell.  My hair is thick, wavy, slightly dry, so it may work better for someone with more fine, oily hair.</li>
            <li> The products from this company are top notch. I use their shampoos, conditioners and facewash and always feel great doint so.</li>
            <li> The natural oils work very well on my curly hair. My hair is very textured and prone to drying and cracking but this conditioner keeps it moisturized without the need for a lot of other products.  Since it also contains natural oils, it washes away nicely, too.  I also find that after a few uses the oils help control frizzies and \\&quot;hay-head\\&quot; by keeping my hair in order.  I only wish this product was more widely available.  Thank you to Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but once my hair dries this stuff always makes it feel like it&#x27;s coated in greasy. it doesn&#x27;t feel like it soaks in then washes out, it feels like this stuff is just sitting on my hair weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I like the same brand organic shampoo and decided to try this conditioner.  I also like this product and it seems to work well.  It does smell nice.  It has a nice scent of butter/oil.  I don&#x27;t feel there is much after-use smell that hangs around.  The only complaint I have is that the container is hard-plastic and it&#x27;s hard to squeeze the bottler to dispense.  The conditioner comes in a thick buttery emulsion and it&#x27;s hard to dispense even with my strong male forceful squeeze.  The shampoo came with a pump top dispenser but not this one.  I use a different plastic container for daily use...</li>
            <li> Smells great , works great on my daughters curly tops.&lt;br /&gt;I use it too and I conjunction with Shampoo has improved my Hair</li>
            <li> Tried and used a whole bottle. Smell didn&#x27;t bother me - what did was the fact that it barely conditioned - my hair was always tangled after use. Switched to another organic brand with MUCH better results!</li>

So I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find soap, shampoo, and conditioner products that have fewer odd chemicals in this. My quest is challenging because I also donate my hair to charity every three years. So I need my hair to remain thick and healthy while I do this. Otherwise my charity donations will make recipients unhappy rather than happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Avalon Organics Lemon Conditioner seemed like it would be just right for me. My boyfriend loves the aroma of lemon, so that would be a plus. It would have fewer chemicals. It says it restores natural highlights and color. It removes build-up. All great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I began trying it. First, the conditioner is very thick, and the container cannot sit on its lid. This means one has to really pound it to get the conditioner out. This is bad enough when the bottle is beginning, but by the end of the bottle it makes getting any out quite challenging. It means the last part of the bottle is wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the instructions say to massage it in \\&quot;from the roots up\\&quot;. Hmmm. I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s even technically possible unless one had an eyedropper. If I have a dollop of conditioner on my hand, and I put it on my head, it is going to touch the top of my hair first. I then have to massage it down *towards* the roots. I don&#x27;t see how I could get it to start at the roots and then work its way out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner seems to get absorbed nearly instantly. That then means there isn&#x27;t any left to \\&quot;massage around\\&quot; and get to the rest of the hair. Over my time with the bottle I used larger and larger (bordering on, to me, outrageous) amounts of conditioner on my hair. My hair is currently only just-past-shoulders length, too. It&#x27;s not even at its full waist length point. I would put a giant dollop in my hand, start putting it on my hair, and it would vanish nearly instantly. It&#x27;s not that my hair is super-dry either. If anything I&#x27;d call it slightly oily. So I never felt as if I was getting all my hair conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was done, the hair would feel squeaky clean - which is a problem. When I then tried to comb or brush it, it would tangle. The hair was not detangling as most conditioners would do. It would catch on the brush or comb. So this meant more hair would pull out during the brushing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this was odd enough. I&#x27;ve tested many, many conditioners over the years and not had this combination of issues happen before. But then the clincher. I was out kayaking with my boyfriend recently, and he looked at my head and then took a picture of it. Apparently my hair is now turning white at a prodigious rate where I am putting most of the conditioner. I have dark hair. I do realize that many people with blonde hair use lemon juice to bleach their hair and make it lighter. I should have realized this would happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I am a sucker for punishment I will try the rosemary version to see if it&#x27;s any better, and post a review there when I&#x27;m done testing. But I can unequivocally say that this lemon is just not for me. I would not recommend it for anyone with dark hair, or with long hair. It probably would be best for someone with short, blonde hair who likes the scent of lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this conditioner with my own funds.r-dry either.

            <li> I liked this conditioner, I just didn&#x27;t love it.  The texture is very different from any other conditioner that I have used.  It did make my hair shiny and it did smell good, but I am just not sure it&#x27;s for me.  If you have dry hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.  It&#x27;s a very lightweight conditioner that would benefit someone with oily hair.  As a matter of fact, I actually ended up giving this to my teenage daughter, who does in fact have oily hair, and it seems to work just fine for her.</li>
            <li> Smells very good and it does moisturize, but after a week of me washing my hair everyday and using this, I realize I should use this conditioner only sparingly because of built up residue. Otherwise, good product.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the absolute BEST conditioner I have ever used! I have very long, somewhat thick hair....past middle of my back....and usually have trouble finding a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t have horrible ingredients and a horribly strong smell along with it! Not to mention that most of them DON&#x27;T work!! Well, I don&#x27;t have to look any further! The smell of this conditioner is so wonderfully lemony..it&#x27;s very refreshing and soothing at the same time! I love lemons anyway, so to find a lemon conditioner was a definite bonus! On top of that, my hair was soooooooo incredibly soft! I could not believe how soft it was after using this conditioner! I didn&#x27;t have to use any extra products on my hair at all! Just dried and it was perfect....very minimal to no flyaways, shiny and incredibly soft hair, no weigh down and a wonderful light lemon scent! My husband loved it and I have to say that this is a definite keeper! I will never purchase another conditioner again! Absolutely amazing! WHOOOOOOO!!!!!</li>
            <li> In general I am satisfied. However, I was a bit surprised that the product didn&#x27;t have an inner seal that covers the hole. Without it, customers wouldn&#x27;t know if the product had been tampered or not. I think it&#x27;s something that Avalaon Organics should resolve but I&#x27;m just letting you know that I believe it&#x27;s something that should be resolved ASAP as I am pretty sure I&#x27;m not the only one who thinks like that and putting on a protection seal would greatly improve the reputation of Avalon Organics.</li>
            <li> I love their products but this one left my hair feeling heavy and thick.  Was hard to wash out ... Really</li>
            <li> Nice scent, a bit harsh on curly hair.  But works well on oily hair.  I use it less frequently because my hair is usually dry.</li>
            <li> Love the &amp;#34;lemony&amp;#34; smell of all Avalon Lemon products. Have used the body lotion a long time. The scent is perfect. Not over-bearing.</li>
            <li> Oops.  I thought I was getting shampoo, but got this instead, so I passed it on to friends.  I did like the smell.</li>
            <li> The individual strands of my hair are thick and wavy, so I appreciate a really nourishing conditioner that helps prevent frizz. Forget clarifying conditioners if you have my kind of hair!  I recommend this if you are looking for a thick kind of conditioner--clearly some of the less-than-five-star reviews are not looking for this. Whether you have hair like mine, or thick, unruly, damaged, etc--or just need a deep conditioning treatment to use on the ends, I think this stuff is the best bang for your buck out there. I buy for $9 or $10 at the local organic delis in NYC but have seen it online for $7. I would also recommend the peppermint shampoo and the peppermint body lotion has become something I cannot live without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This lemon conditioner is nothing like what it used to be. Avalon reformulated all their products (I called and asked, they confirmed). Look around at other recent reviews and you&#x27;ll see I am not the only one. Very disappointing because the old formula was simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Not good for people who have oily hair. Well not in my case because everybody&#x27;s hair is different.</li>
