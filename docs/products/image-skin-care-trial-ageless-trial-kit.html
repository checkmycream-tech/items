            <li>/&gt;Prior to using this product, I had a very effective peel using PCA products.  </li>

            <li>The serum and cream make my skin feel good, but they don&#x27;t smell great.  </li>

            <li>Love this skin care line.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE these&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li>Vita-C: my favorite</li>
            <li>Maybe in the full sizes I&#x27;d like it better.</li>
            <li>I was overall happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe these are genuine Image products.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive (allergic), ethnic skin that is fairly oily but can resist treatments.</li>
            <li>However, for me, the peel by Image brand was far more effective.  </li>
            <li>(sizes are TSA friendly)</li>
            <li>Still trying it out but initial impression is that the products are good.  </li>
            <li>I really have fallen in love with the cleanser in this line.</li>
            <li>Now mom loves them too and just ordered the full size versions of the sample pack.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Ageless, Vita-C, and Ormedic kits-- each for 1 week to see which products I wanted to buy in full size.  </li>
            <li>the products arrived quickly and were in good shape (each from a different vendor.  </li>
            <li>They are reasonably priced, quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Bummer, first time this happened with Amazon!</li>
            <li>Keeping a healthy appearance on the outside is just as important as the inside.</li>
            <li>This is a great line of skin care products that is not easy to find.</li>
            <li>I had the right amount of product for my week vacation.  </li>
            <li>At aged 69, she looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product really gets into the pores and cleans my face!</li>
            <li>The trial sizes are a bit too small to give the products a fair analysis, though.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight but has a nice youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>The box was torn open and all product in the containers had melted but seemed to &amp;#34;reform&amp;#34;  or set once inside the A/C and worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I find this line to be very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she says it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really need a nighttime eye product to repair wrinkles and bags.</li>
            <li>Received product I love the line but the product itself was old and not what I expected.</li>
            <li>The products came looking a little yellowed, but worked ok.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t live without this cleanser.</li>
            <li>They all seemed too gentle and my skin didn&#x27;t feel clean or tight after using.  </li>
            <li>The containers had no seal and product had leaked completely out!</li>
            <li>The face wash is OK- hard to get a lather.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it keeps it clear and soft</li>
            <li>Quality is not the same in this travel package as the real products.</li>
            <li>Ormedic: my least favorite products.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this is intended for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to try this product; however, this product that was sent from onestopshopping222 arrived and looked beat up,  old and possibly used.</li>
            <li>I tried a couple of the products with my last facial and thought the trial size would great for evaluating the whole line, but product came late and seals on 2 of the 5 samples were broken.  </li>
            <li>The other products are new to me</li>
            <li>but I did not get 2 weeks worth as others stated and it was hard to get out of the tiny plastic containers.</li>

            <li> but I did not get 2 weeks worth as others stated and it was hard to get out of the tiny plastic containers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but cheaper than others that are available.  </li>
            <li> Normally when I get an exfoliating peel, it will take the longest period to take effect and then I&#x27;ll have small patches of peeling skin for up to 2 weeks after.  </li>
            <li> Too bad because I would have bought more.</li>
            <li> that I wanted to try the other skin care products, too.  </li>
            <li> I would agree with other users.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the product because a few were popped open when they arrived.</li>
            <li> The tinted SPF is came with is ridiculously dark.  </li>
            <li> for my 40 yr old, still oily and acne-prone, but tired and aging skin, I will probably go with the Vita-C products and use the Ageless masque 2x/week to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> It had very little in the trial size containers and one of the products was dehydrated and empty.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but was disappointed to find seal that is usually on the product, was missing.  </li>
            <li> I was literally shedding sections of skin vs. little patches of peeling skin.</li>
            <li> Too small for the amount charged.in other words</li>
            <li> That always makes me a little weary.</li>
            <li> Too harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> but you use very little of the product...</li>
            <li> trial sizes are really small wish</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ll like them</li>
            <li> My face has been all sorts of messed up since going off of B.C. pills and in my late 20s</li>
            <li> Approx 2 weeks use at least per pack.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the way it arrived.</li>
            <li> The labels are speared, I&#x27;m unable to tell what&#x27;s what.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just had a bad batch</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible breakout reaction that wouldnt go away.</li>
            <li> This product has a terrible smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Still trying it out but initial impression is that the products are good.  The trial sizes are a bit too small to give the products a fair analysis, though.</li>
            <li> The products came looking a little yellowed, but worked ok.</li>
            <li> None of the bottles had seals on them so I sent them back.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of the products with my last facial and thought the trial size would great for evaluating the whole line, but product came late and seals on 2 of the 5 samples were broken.  One sample labeling was all smeared off and sticky/yucky....returning ofcourse is a big pain for $18 so I guess I&#x27;ll try the unopened products and not get products from that supplier. Bummer, first time this happened with Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love the day gel so I will buy that separately next time.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the product because a few were popped open when they arrived. The labels are speared, I&#x27;m unable to tell what&#x27;s what.  I&#x27;m not happy with the way it arrived.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive (allergic), ethnic skin that is fairly oily but can resist treatments. Normally when I get an exfoliating peel, it will take the longest period to take effect and then I&#x27;ll have small patches of peeling skin for up to 2 weeks after.  An aesthetician gave me samples of this brand&#x27;s peel and said that my skin would probably \\&quot;shed\\&quot;.  I was so amazed at the efficacy of this peel, that I wanted to try the other skin care products, too.  I find this line to be very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using this product, I had a very effective peel using PCA products.  It resulted in one of the best peels so I purchased their samples - it&#x27;s also a very effective skin care line.  However, for me, the peel by Image brand was far more effective.  I was literally shedding sections of skin vs. little patches of peeling skin.</li>
            <li> This sample package was a great way to assist me in deciding on a product. It provided enough product for about a week. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> excellent product even after one day I can feel and see a difference...trial sizes are really small wish they were just a bit larger...but you use very little of the product...love love love the sunscreen !</li>
            <li> Too small for the amount charged.in other words a rip off. Too bad because I would have bought more. Not enough to see results</li>
            <li> My fiance ordered this and she says it works very well.  It&#x27;s expensive but cheaper than others that are available.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Item came damaged. I sent a message to seller and never got a response. The containers had no seal and product had leaked completely out!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but was disappointed to find seal that is usually on the product, was missing.  That always makes me a little weary.</li>
            <li> Too harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> I was overall happy with the product. The box was torn open and all product in the containers had melted but seemed to &amp;#34;reform&amp;#34;  or set once inside the A/C and worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I really have fallen in love with the cleanser in this line. The other products are new to me so i&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ll like them but I can&#x27;t live without this cleanser. My face has been all sorts of messed up since going off of B.C. pills and in my late 20s I had a terrible breakout reaction that wouldnt go away. This product really gets into the pores and cleans my face! I haven&#x27;t found anything else that would get the job done. I have tried Dermalogica...Philosophy...Clinique...nothing works. I would give the trial a shot and see how it works for you if you have yet to find something good.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try it out and my package came destroyed and leaking...not all the products seemed to be leaking but I did not get 2 weeks worth as others stated and it was hard to get out of the tiny plastic containers. Not a fan. Maybe in the full sizes I&#x27;d like it better.</li>
            <li> It came in deluxe size which was fantastic and I really loved the products that came:)</li>
            <li> This product has a terrible smell. I don&#x27;t know if I just had a bad batch but I had to throw it away because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for 4 days ,but I can see the difference already.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any one who has skin problems.</li>
            <li> Some of the contents looked used, had no seal and even leaked all in the box. Not very happy.</li>
            <li> I had the right amount of product for my week vacation.  Now I have the travel size containers to refill!  However, when I received the package, one of the containers had leaked and the rest of them were sticky.</li>
            <li> Received product I love the line but the product itself was old and not what I expected. It had very little in the trial size containers and one of the products was dehydrated and empty.</li>
            <li> I would agree with other users. Wanted to try this product; however, this product that was sent from onestopshopping222 arrived and looked beat up,  old and possibly used. Only two of the jars had the safety seal on them. The print rubbed off one of the jars when touched. I question its authenticity.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Have been using Image skin care for 2 yrs. Wanted travel set, some of the samples had already been open in both of the sample packs Letters on packaging smeared.</li>
            <li> Present for my travelling sister- everything you need to keep up on the Image line.  My sister talked me into it and my esthetician commented on how much better my skin looked and she didn&#x27;t know I&#x27;d been using the Image line.</li>
            <li> I love Image Skin care! Product is excellent for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Quality is not the same in this travel package as the real products. I don&#x27;t believe these are genuine Image products.</li>
            <li> Love this skin care line. I have sensitive skin and it keeps it clear and soft</li>
            <li> Got this for my mother who just started Botox and filler.  At aged 69, she looks amazing.  I&#x27;ve used Image for years as it was recommended to me by my esthetician.  I absolutely LOVE these&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCTS.  They are reasonably priced, quick and easy to use.  Now mom loves them too and just ordered the full size versions of the sample pack.  As for the pack itself, it&#x27;s the PERFECT travel size!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit to see how my skin would react to the products and it has been great. My skin looks smoother and brighter. The sample size is enough to get a feel for the product. I would recommend this to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Nice way to try all the products. Prefect size for a week trip.</li>
            <li> Perfect way to see if this product is for you.  Enough to use for two weeks for a trial .</li>
            <li> 3 out of the 5 jars were not sealed. Kind of beat up packaging, and expire this year. 6/15-10/15.</li>
            <li> I tried the Ageless, Vita-C, and Ormedic kits-- each for 1 week to see which products I wanted to buy in full size.  Ageless: my favorite is he masque-- nice and exfoliating.  The face wash is OK- hard to get a lather.  The serum and cream make my skin feel good, but they don&#x27;t smell great.  Overall, I did notice a difference after a week.  Ormedic: my least favorite products.  They all seemed too gentle and my skin didn&#x27;t feel clean or tight after using.  Maybe this is intended for people with sensitive skin.  The tinted SPF is came with is ridiculously dark.  Why is this is a trial pack?  Vita-C: my favorite pack-- all the items smell wonderful.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight but has a nice youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;All the products arrived quickly and were in good shape (each from a different vendor.  Approx 2 weeks use at least per pack.&lt;br /&gt;So for my 40 yr old, still oily and acne-prone, but tired and aging skin, I will probably go with the Vita-C products and use the Ageless masque 2x/week to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Some of the products burn my face but the cleanser and serum are good.  I really need a nighttime eye product to repair wrinkles and bags.</li>
            <li> The product is set to expire in November 2015. The cream was rancid when received.</li>
            <li> This is a great line of skin care products that is not easy to find. Try this trial size if you want to sample or if you air travel (sizes are TSA friendly) Keeping a healthy appearance on the outside is just as important as the inside.</li>
