    <ol>
            <li>Great all in one product the ingredients are unmatched!</li>
            <li>Excellent product. .</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>It smells very good...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know which one it is that does the trick, but now that I know how great Burt&#x27;s Bees works</li>
            <li>so for me both of these smell great too.  </li>
            <li>Smells great but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m assuming its good since I like all Burt&#x27;s Bees products I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>I also add to water in a spray bottle to make my own leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>but I find has a very strong smell I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face, body and hair for over 2 years now works better then any facial/ body cream on the market and its safe for us!</li>
            <li>I love it, the lotion smells great and is super smooth and Burts Bees is one of our favorite brands!</li>
            <li>This lotion is fantastic!</li>
            <li>You can get a couple of more weeks out of the bottle this way.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several body lotions that did not have parabens and this one is the best one I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I don&#x27;t love the smell...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin and leaves it feeling silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I bruise easy &amp; had a chemical burn on my hands.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is fine and works well</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super self-conscious about it!</li>
            <li>As most Burt&#x27;s Bees products, this is a nice moisturizing lotion that makes your hands soft without leaving them greasy -</li>
            <li>It just makes my skin feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using name brands available in the stores &amp; nothing compares.  </li>
            <li>This review is for both the &#x27;Aloe and Buttermilk&#x27; lotion and the &#x27;Fragrance Free Shea Butter and Vitamin E&#x27; lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Find another bottle with a screw on cap with a flip up lid that will fit.</li>
            <li>, this is the best duo for delicate aging skin that bruises easily.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I appreciate the clean ingredients</li>
            <li>I have tried many highly touted lotions and none seemed to help.</li>
            <li>I end up with large bruises &amp; start bruising easily again.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful formulation especially for dry skin</li>
            <li>I am rarely bothered by how lotions smell</li>
            <li>Not a bad thing, just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li>I buried my hands under my sheets right away</li>
            <li>Everyone is right.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to believe them, but they are right.</li>
            <li>This lotion left my skin soft and more importantly, NON-ITCHY!</li>
            <li>I used this lotion for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>This winter has been the first in years that I have had no problems with itchy shins.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s funny how there is so much variation concerning the smell.  </li>
            <li>The Fragrance Free version has a very light smell of beeswax and other &#x27;fruit&#x27; oils, which come from the natural odor of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Does a good job at keeping hands from getting dry and cracked, especially if you do lots of work with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>None of the ointments/creams/lotions really helped.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion that works...and the ingredients list makes us feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>Very chemically.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin moisturized better than other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I live in San Diego, CA, you&#x27;d think I could find this size in the stores here, but I can&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this particular lotion combined with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Exfoliating Body</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not long lasting and it smells really really strong.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this for babies with eczema or with sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li>Not thick</li>
            <li>After you apply it and wait for a reasonable time for it to absorb (5 - 10 minutes), your hands end up soft but not greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>Nice weight to lotion, heavy enough but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m big fan of Burt&#x27;s bees products and I like this body lotion a lot because it really help moisturize my sensitive skin without irritation.</li>
            <li>My 2-year old son has eczema and has had rashes of varying sizes and colors for 2 years now.</li>
            <li>I even use it on the sensitive skin on my face and there is never any irritation or burning.  </li>
            <li>(even though it&#x27;s from &amp;#34;100% natural fragrance&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to moisturize my hands with lotion before I went to bed-</li>
            <li>of these are thick and have more of a creamy consistency, not watery or oily like others.</li>
            <li>The Aloe and Buttermilk has a smell like beeswax mixed with other mildly &#x27;sweet&#x27; plant fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It does absorb quickly but it feels a little sticky.</li>
            <li>Great feel, it&#x27;s too bad it reeks.</li>
            <li>But since I am not using it for its fragrance but for its ability to make my skin soft, I would definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who has such delicate skin that bruises easily</li>
            <li>I started using this very early last year and used it all summer long.</li>
            <li>and we live in a very dry climate.  </li>
            <li>This is a good lotion if you can get past the unpleasant smell, which luckily doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>which was a good time because this stuff smelled so bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My wife loves this cream as the fragrance is not very strong and its natural</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take long for Clorox to change the formula for Aloe &amp; Buttermilk Body Lotion.</li>
            <li> It smells stronger than my scented lotions and seems to stay a long time.</li>
            <li> works well for dry skin, I would  buy it again</li>
            <li> thing to note is that these have the same ingredients (minus the fragrance of course), so read carefully.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough but not greasy and makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and what age spots that started creeping up a few years ago are now gone!</li>
            <li> Our child has very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin even in the summer and a lot of products cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Looking at other reviews</li>
            <li> it does not have that chemical/petroleum smell that you will find in other non-scented lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this lotion because I am a huge fan of burts bees, but the smell is awful!!</li>
            <li> While the moisturizer is itself quite good, the awful fragrance makes it almost unusable.</li>
            <li> Hands down, bar none</li>
            <li> When the bottle stops pumping remove the pump screw on the lid and set the bottle upside down on the counter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found just lately that I had some really  dry bumpy areas on my skin that itched!  </li>
            <li> I really think you won&#x27;t be disappointed,</li>
            <li> &amp; I mean arm length, draw blood bruising that takes weeks to fade check out these products &amp; give them a try.  </li>
            <li> Terrible Fragrance, sickly sweet and cloying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50s &amp; have very delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> For years I have had a problem with my shins driving me crazy every winter because of itching.</li>
            <li> it smells badly.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Either you like it or hate it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As most Burt&#x27;s Bees products, this is a nice moisturizing lotion that makes your hands soft without leaving them greasy - I use it as hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, body and hair for over 2 years now works better then any facial/ body cream on the market and its safe for us! I also add to water in a spray bottle to make my own leave in conditioner. Great all in one product the ingredients are unmatched! I am 51 years old and what age spots that started creeping up a few years ago are now gone!</li>
            <li> My 2-year old son has eczema and has had rashes of varying sizes and colors for 2 years now. None of the ointments/creams/lotions really helped. Then his pediatrician recommended Burt&#x27;s Bees Aloe &amp; Buttermilk lotion, and that worked like a miracle!! It keeps the rashes under control and is our savior! I absolutely recommend this for babies with eczema or with sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li> Our child has very dry skin and we live in a very dry climate.  This is the only lotion that works...and the ingredients list makes us feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> works well for dry skin, I would  buy it again</li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic! My grandson has eczema and this lotion does NOT sting! I would recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li> Terrible Fragrance, sickly sweet and cloying. Great feel, it&#x27;s too bad it reeks.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! Not thick &amp; I appreciate the clean ingredients</li>
            <li> I love it, the lotion smells great and is super smooth and Burts Bees is one of our favorite brands!</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion if you can get past the unpleasant smell, which luckily doesn&#x27;t last long. It&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin and leaves it feeling silky and smooth.  Looking at other reviews it&#x27;s funny how there is so much variation concerning the smell.  Either you like it or hate it.  I am rarely bothered by how lotions smell but this one is an exception.  But since I am not using it for its fragrance but for its ability to make my skin soft, I would definitely recommend it.  I even use it on the sensitive skin on my face and there is never any irritation or burning.  It just makes my skin feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> This body lotion has problem with smell. it smells badly. It seems Burt&#x27;s Body Lotion all have problem with smell.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for the first time this morning. I really, really wanted to like this lotion because I am a huge fan of burts bees, but the smell is awful!! It smells nothing like milk and honey. Very chemically. It does absorb quickly but it feels a little sticky. Even now, three hours after putting it on, I can still smell the lotion and I&#x27;m super self-conscious about it! I will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50s &amp; have very delicate skin.  I bruise easy &amp; had a chemical burn on my hands.  I live in San Diego, CA, you&#x27;d think I could find this size in the stores here, but I can&#x27;t!  I&#x27;ve been using this particular lotion combined with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Exfoliating Body Wash.  Hands down, bar none, this is the best duo for delicate aging skin that bruises easily.  I&#x27;ve also found just lately that I had some really  dry bumpy areas on my skin that itched!  Within a week it was healed!!  I&#x27;ve tried using name brands available in the stores &amp; nothing compares.  I end up with large bruises &amp; start bruising easily again.  This with the Radiance Body Wash combo is The One!!!  I don&#x27;t know which one it is that does the trick, but now that I know how great Burt&#x27;s Bees works I just pray they don&#x27;t ever discontinue!  Anyone who has such delicate skin that bruises easily &amp; I mean arm length, draw blood bruising that takes weeks to fade check out these products &amp; give them a try.  I really think you won&#x27;t be disappointed,</li>
            <li> Excellent product. . Moisturizers without greasiness. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This review is for both the &#x27;Aloe and Buttermilk&#x27; lotion and the &#x27;Fragrance Free Shea Butter and Vitamin E&#x27; lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these are thick and have more of a creamy consistency, not watery or oily like others. After you apply it and wait for a reasonable time for it to absorb (5 - 10 minutes), your hands end up soft but not greasy or oily.  Does a good job at keeping hands from getting dry and cracked, especially if you do lots of work with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy and I can&#x27;t stand perfumes - so for me both of these smell great too.  The Aloe and Buttermilk has a smell like beeswax mixed with other mildly &#x27;sweet&#x27; plant fragrances.  The Fragrance Free version has a very light smell of beeswax and other &#x27;fruit&#x27; oils, which come from the natural odor of the ingredients. It smells very good... it does not have that chemical/petroleum smell that you will find in other non-scented lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that these have the same ingredients (minus the fragrance of course), so read carefully.  They both have Shea Butter, Vitamin E, Buttermilk, and Aloe.  Not a bad thing, just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every body lotion, butter, and creme out there and this is the only one that gave me the results I wanted. I have very dry skin even in the summer and a lot of products cause irritation. This lotion left my skin soft and more importantly, NON-ITCHY! And it lasted all day. It even helped releive some of the red bumps I get from shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take long for Clorox to change the formula for Aloe &amp; Buttermilk Body Lotion. Disappointed. Switching to Aura Cacia. Coconut oil went from 4th ingrd to 9th. Aloe from 7 to 13, Buttermilk from 9 to 14. Goodguide gives it 4 out of 10 on health. Added decyl cocoate, polyglyceryl-3 stearate, glyceryl stearate citrate, cetyl alcohol, lactic acid, citric acid, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium benzoate, magnesium aluminum silicate, phenoxyethanol, limonene.</li>
            <li> For years I have had a problem with my shins driving me crazy every winter because of itching. I have tried many highly touted lotions and none seemed to help. I started using this very early last year and used it all summer long. This winter has been the first in years that I have had no problems with itchy shins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion though. Find another bottle with a screw on cap with a flip up lid that will fit. When the bottle stops pumping remove the pump screw on the lid and set the bottle upside down on the counter. You can get a couple of more weeks out of the bottle this way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not long lasting and it smells really really strong.  I assumed something for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin would not have a lot of fragrance. (even though it&#x27;s from &amp;#34;100% natural fragrance&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to moisturize my hands with lotion before I went to bed- which was a good time because this stuff smelled so bad I buried my hands under my sheets right away so I didn&#x27;t have to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve replaced my facial and body moisturizer with virgin coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Everyone is right. The formula changed. I didn&#x27;t want to believe them, but they are right. It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I apply it to my face several times a day.  Keeps my skin moisturized better than other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Provided 24 hr moisture without all the chemicals. Nice weight to lotion, heavy enough but not greasy. Smells great but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The lotion is fine and works well but I find has a very strong smell I didn&#x27;t expect. It smells stronger than my scented lotions and seems to stay a long time.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this cream as the fragrance is not very strong and its natural</li>
            <li> Wonderful formulation especially for dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several body lotions that did not have parabens and this one is the best one I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s thick enough but not greasy and makes my skin feel soft.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I don&#x27;t love the smell...it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
            <li> This was a gift but I&#x27;m assuming its good since I like all Burt&#x27;s Bees products I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m big fan of Burt&#x27;s bees products and I like this body lotion a lot because it really help moisturize my sensitive skin without irritation.</li>
            <li> While the moisturizer is itself quite good, the awful fragrance makes it almost unusable.</li>
