            <li>This cologne does smell good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be a good fragrance</li>
            <li>GOOD PRICE AND GOOD SMELL..</li>
            <li>Good smelling spicy fragrance, good for summer days.</li>

            <li>Good smell</li>
            <li>Good price, but wish it held up for a longer time.</li>
            <li>but, \\&quot;the picture looks good.</li>
            <li>i was hoping it smelled good</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>One for my dad and one for my boyfriend,they bothh loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good perfume for the price..</li>
            <li>Surprisingly having cologne scented carpet has its advantages.</li>
            <li>My husband loved it.</li>
            <li>and it seems like it would be good to use to go out or just to wear at night</li>
            <li>I liked the smell, since your fragrance is not as is not so attractive as to give you a good ratings</li>
            <li>Nice light scent, excellent price.</li>
            <li>I LOVE A LOT AND RECEIVED MANY WONDERFUL COMMENTS ABOUT THE SCENT.</li>
            <li>COMES QUICK!!!</li>
            <li>Love it, also great price</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>THIS COLONE IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE AND HAVE HAD MANY COMPLIMENTS</li>
            <li>My mother also loved it, it has a nice manly smell</li>
            <li>but when it arrived, I fell in love!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding cologne for like 5 bucks!</li>
            <li>(im adding more letters to each word to exaggerate the smell!)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why people spend 80-100 bucks on colognes when you can get something like this for so cheap!!</li>
            <li>but that is honestly the BEST explanation I can give for this certain product.   </li>
            <li>is good, but you receive that you pay ,very good service, thanks</li>
            <li>the smell is amazing, i got a lot of compliments from a lot of girls, you can&#x60;t beat the price and the cologne got here a day ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells AMAZING</li>
            <li>This is a real smooth cologne.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest this perfume when not to buy it</li>
            <li>but buy more than one if you want to keep yourself smelling good all day.</li>
            <li>Nice stuff.</li>
            <li>so am going save money and have excellent product to use thanks</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the fragrance smell good</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, nice price and smell.</li>
            <li>good smell, soft and durable, perfect for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;be</li>
            <li>a nice color</li>
            <li>but its it has a nice mellow note you can smell for about 3 hours.after</li>
            <li>my husband says its an ok cologne nothing fancy but good for the price if your not trying to spend a lot</li>
            <li>This one smell nice on clothing too but it fades.</li>
            <li>it would be handy...</li>
            <li>so I might buy it again, not too spectacular though</li>
            <li>To be honest, I had never tried any Yacht Man products.  </li>
            <li>Makes for a nice gift.</li>
            <li>I also received chap stick and a cologne sample from the seller which was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the great price and quality of this item!</li>
            <li>Like this cologne..very nice...</li>
            <li>but he liked the cologne..</li>
            <li>it  isnt at the top of my list although its good for a night out with your partner.</li>
            <li>I love this Spray, smell good</li>
            <li>Nice aroma but must be renewed every 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>The price is great and the stuff smell pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;can&#x27;t describe the smell... but just too too strong and not at all pleasant to smell..</li>
            <li>so a sweet aroma works great.  </li>
            <li>CARRYING ME THROUGH THE DAY SMELLING GREAT FOR A FULL 8 HRS.</li>
            <li>It is a very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>good for every day use, i use it as a car freshener and it works just fine</li>
            <li>Honestly this thing deserves more than 5 stars</li>
            <li>Easy 5 stars from me!</li>
            <li>Now of course it all has to do with your nose&#x27;s opinion, but my nose, which I trust, has always led to great successful purchases (in the end, what I wear and try when I go out or on a special occasion), and my final choices were always followed by great compliments by people</li>
            <li>I have been very impressed with the nice fragrance of Yacht Man Red.  </li>
            <li>u dont gotta spend like 50 bucks when u have this perfectly fine cologne!</li>
            <li>Yacht Man Metal seems to be the lightest of the three with a VERY light scent...</li>
            <li>yacht man is a very smooth cologne</li>
            <li>its mild and good smelling.</li>
            <li>the fragance is ok... not bad... but not that good...</li>
            <li>Good smell but definitely a more sweet aroma, it lasts for awhile.</li>
            <li>It is quite strong at first but fades to a nice pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>One cheap perfume with great fresh smell.</li>
            <li>My son in law love it</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because its not terrible but definitely not Yacht Man&#x27;s best!  </li>
            <li>I love the way this smell.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and price of this product.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>

            <li>This cologne is just okay.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was recommended by the sight for buying my favorite cologne which is Carlos Santanna.</li>
            <li>this perfume was a gift for my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;i love the way it smell and</li>
            <li>Purchased this before and love the smell</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s appropriate for any age.</li>
            <li>It smells mostly like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>plus we bought a bottle for his father as well! :)</li>
            <li>This product has more water and alcohol than fragrance.</li>
            <li>I get my order and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It smells cheap, because it is!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t LOVE it..</li>
            <li>but ti was ok</li>
            <li>Is a option to a cheap perfume if you want to smell nice during a shot time.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells on my husband.</li>
            <li>fresh feeling...really good pefrfume , i love it.i would recomnd this one to friends</li>
            <li>Actually bought the fame of the brand here in Brazil but never esperimentei, packaging and color seduced me, an excellent cost benefit by famous brand&lt;br /&gt;Spanish.</li>
            <li>He will love it</li>
            <li>this is not going into my top 20 collections.</li>
            <li>MINE ROOMMATE LOVE THE FRAGRANCE  </li>
            <li>DO PLESE SEND MORE SAMPLE PLEASE AT 7423 ROXYE LANE SARASOTA FL</li>
            <li>I have tried all Yacht Man cologne and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Not being able to smell the product made me uneasy</li>
            <li>love this cologne</li>
            <li>Probably would be ok to go to a dance club or someplace where lighter and fruitier colognes mix in well.  </li>
            <li>better  </li>
            <li>I love types of colognes....</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Interesting.</li>
            <li>Great merchandise and fast delivery..</li>
            <li>IS MADE MOST OF ALCOHOL SCENT DOES NOT LAST&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always browse through the mens cologne section mostly to see the prices on my favorites.  </li>
            <li>I love this cologne and will use it in the mix with my favorites.</li>
            <li>Not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>i hope, those colognes are more over the top.</li>
            <li>but if you put it on cloth, it lasts a lot longer than on skin, although it&#x27;s more abrasive.</li>
            <li>Still, this is a nice romantic fragrance, great to take your wife to a nice meal.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Also the bottle is quite cute</li>
            <li>Love the fragarance.</li>
            <li>Yacht Man Metal is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love when my guy sprays himself with this smell, makes me want to be closer to him.</li>
            <li>I like how fast it was delievered to our doorstep too, great service.</li>
            <li>Enjoyable smell is all I got to say.</li>
            <li>more thing he loves the top.</li>
            <li>Probably better than just wasting it.</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant aroma, the second I smelled it</li>
            <li>Smells good for the first minute,wears off.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST DAY IT SMELL GOOD</li>
            <li>It smells so good gotten so much compliments!</li>
            <li>This cologne smells really good and the overall value is good.</li>
            <li>This cologne is light and smells nice, but it is just too light and airy.  </li>
            <li>I like this item Red by Myurgia for men, and the price very good, I recommend this item to any one</li>
            <li>This perfume has a fruit scent smell which is very sweet..</li>
            <li>The scent is very sweet and floral.</li>
            <li>For me the most important thing for a cologne is the sent life.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay not so great, the regular version of the Yacht Man, the one comes in silver bottle is much better than this one.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much for the price, but figured it would be good for a cologne emergency.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a really goo scent since Yaght seems to have a good reputation.</li>
            <li>loves the nice fresh scent .</li>
            <li>smelled good  fast shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot for a good price and overall a good product, I would recommend it to anyone who likes a sweet smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very mild.</li>
            <li>It has an extremely strong cedar sent.</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent that I can&#x27;t describe, but it is not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li>Not for me, too strong.</li>
            <li>Its smooth with a little loud touch but its mostly for a first date win win lol</li>
            <li>I got my own and my wife and I like the scent very much.</li>
            <li>This colonge is sweet more of a night time cologne.</li>
            <li>But if anyone looking for a cheap and strong fragrance then go for this.</li>
            <li>purchased for my hubby and he loves the scent, not too strong and not too light just in between</li>
            <li>, I have yacht man blue and is great and works fine.</li>
            <li>Huge mistake.</li>
            <li>yacht man blue smells great and is a must buy for how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>it was really CHEAP COLOGNE</li>
            <li>so this raised the question that how is it so cheap here.</li>
            <li>it was so cheap.  </li>
            <li>Worth more than Wat</li>
            <li>It is cheap and smells cheap.</li>
            <li>so if he needs a reboost he has it available.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a cheap product, and you are a man/boy, to wear when you go out or whatever</li>
            <li>I was happy that my friends felt the same as they purchased after my suggestion.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Deal..</li>
            <li>I ordered this cologne to get free shipping on another item.  </li>
            <li>but i took the risk since the price was so cheap...</li>
            <li>There is a reason this cologne is so cheap.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice fragrance and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Smells great and last about 7-8 hours.</li>
            <li>This really smells nice on him.</li>
            <li>Is cheap; smells cheap.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is so light as to be almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li>They both smell really good Blue being my favorite.</li>
            <li>Yacht Man Red is more of a \\&quot;nighttime\\&quot; cologne that is stronger with a smooth, pleasant, and sweet aroma that will stay with you without having to reapply a bunch of times.  </li>
            <li>though I would check out all of the other versions...and according to the reviews this was really good but definitely NOT the best.</li>
            <li>OK, so it was $6.60, so why even complain right?</li>
            <li>It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li>but it smells clean and fresh  with a hint of citrus not to over the top</li>
            <li>Great perfume for such a less price and very good to even gift someone on any occasion.</li>
            <li>Decent fragrance and nice bottle</li>
            <li>This came fast (just like your husband) and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>The scent goes on strong but quickly starts to fade to a real nice long wearing day long into the night good scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty okay..</li>
            <li>The formula smells remarkably like Dunhill Red.</li>
            <li>and I had my doubts before purchasing a brand I haven&#x27;t heard, but rest assured I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li>Very good but do not last, to much alcohol.</li>
            <li>I can believe this fragrance the smell is so good...fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>SUPER CHEAP PRICE AND</li>
            <li>The frangrance seems to last all day and even at night it is pleasant</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant however it only lasts for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>Yacht Man Red was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>It has the most long lasting, best smell .</li>
            <li>and it is very lightly scented and wears off very fast.i</li>
            <li>im not a fan of cheap mens spray but must say i love this product, not to strong not to soft,</li>
            <li>hope this helps you make the right decision!</li>
            <li>thanks a lot thanks to them is precisely what they offered me the article is very nice and is what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li>this is a very mild scent, it wears off quickly but the price was right</li>
            <li>What a great smell first off, second</li>
            <li>I gave it to a buddy of mine who actually likes the scent so good on him.</li>
            <li>and i loved the blue one.</li>
            <li>For the price this is some good cologne I will definitely purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li>Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent</li>
            <li>POPEL3@COLUMBUS.RR.COM LOVED THIS PRESENT</li>
            <li>Its good for the daily use.</li>
            <li>it is a sweet smell</li>
            <li>but if you end up sweating it will kick back up leaving you smelling good and not like a pig.</li>
            <li>If you want to have intense odor, you&#x27;ll have to put more quantity which is why it is 3.4 oz</li>
            <li>For a cheep 10 dollar cologne it is not bad</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very rich in the first 30 minutes but then is lost, although the cost is worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong at first</li>
            <li>GENUINE AND HONEST SELLER, SUPER FAST SHIPPING, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, AAA+++</li>
            <li>but seems to dissipate quickly.</li>
            <li>its mild ,not over powering.</li>
            <li>good deal---smells good---last a few hours---can&#x27;t beat the price---all the women love it</li>
            <li>again the scent does not wear off quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance is much greater and longer lasting than most colognes</li>
            <li>Boyfriend love this one better than the Yacht Man Blue.</li>
            <li>Better then blue version, but my wife think otherwise :-)</li>
            <li>Comprenlo es Super Buena</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the promptness and professionalism has proven distributor, I would like to work again in the future with this company.</li>
            <li>Sorry to the seller, who did a wonderful job getting it to me quickly with Amazon Prime (Nov &#x27;11, $6), but the smell is very sweet and does not smell like a cologne for men, daytime use or even nighttime use.   </li>
            <li>I ordered the yacht man blue and red spray and they both smell great although the red has an edge to it that makes it great for a date</li>
            <li>This smells great, it has a sweet smell and after a few hours it has a slight vanilla smell, but its a great product for the price</li>
            <li>Tried the red first and absolutely loved the frangrance and its longevity.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very manly and strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and soft.</li>
            <li>But this is a nice, solid fragrance and when you can have a 100ml bottle like this for less than $10, given its virtually identical competitors, you have a win.</li>
            <li>It is a very soft  and fresh smell, he liked it soo much that I bought again</li>
            <li>It was a great deal and i might buy some for my little cousins that want to show off to their friends.</li>
            <li>Smells good and lasts long!!!</li>
            <li>I really love this scent, it smells so sweet, like candy, not very strong though, very light</li>
            <li>Just great smelling stuff and lasts for a few hours anyway.</li>
            <li>This is a great smelling cologne for a practical everyday use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
            <li>This is really worth for the price</li>
            <li>It is really worth for this price.</li>
            <li>definately can hold its own with any of the big names and on a side note</li>
            <li>worth the buy</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Masculine, but sexy smell that lasts without filling an area.</li>
            <li>certainly worth $10 to try it out.  </li>
            <li>Powerful smell for the money.</li>
            <li>I wear it a couple times a week but prefer a more masculine smell.</li>
            <li>it is such a nice bottle.</li>
            <li>This one is by far my favorite of all of them.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>Great stuff was highly surprised just ordered it out of the blue</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Super powerful and stayed all day</li>
            <li>Got here pretty quick and as advertised.</li>
            <li>It has a nice masculine woodsy smell and lasts pretty much all day.  </li>
            <li>A good perfume to have to supplement the other killer cologne in your collection</li>
            <li>Nice product, not as long lasting as I might like but a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>the price is just right.</li>
            <li>i have almost all of them got mine right away</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>but the smell is pretty good even though it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li>Amis friends love their sweet aroma and especially my girl</li>
            <li>Nice, long lasting and mild cologne and the price makes it all the better for me to recommend it</li>
            <li>Nice smell not stay for long time</li>
            <li>It smells very sophisticated and it is very long lasting, lasts longer than some of the top brands.  </li>
            <li>Spend a few more dollars and get something better.</li>
            <li>Thank you thank you very much</li>
            <li>but it is gone very fast....</li>
            <li>I bought this 2 days ago and it came today, very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Recommended thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Wonderful  Fragrance but very little smell left</li>
            <li>Yes i was aware of this when i ordered it so it</li>
            <li>This cologne is peefect it last a long time and smells great.  </li>
            <li>When we received it, he absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>the description of item is exact according to display in the website</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s better to buy a &amp;#34;ADIDAS&amp;#34; perfume which are at the same price and quantity.</li>
            <li>At first it had almost a Joop cologne smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have already ordered three more bottles from the same family of cologne to try them all!</li>
            <li>It usually last about 30 minutes at most, but i am going to use it for my car instead.</li>
            <li>I will spend more on name brands next time.</li>
            <li>Out of 3 this was his favorite then Yacht man Blue and then Nautical Silver.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t attest to that because this is my first time buying it.</li>
            <li>Looked at reviews and description first.</li>
            <li>My first time using this</li>
            <li>The red color looks pretty, but I sure couldn&#x27;t tell you what this stuff smells like...  </li>
            <li>This was absolutely the nastiest smell cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled in my life!</li>
            <li>Long lasting and a great price.</li>
            <li>I am a first time customer</li>
            <li>I only put one spritz and got compliments all day long, glad I didn&#x27;t spray more on myself.  </li>
            <li>It has a friuty sweet scent that last for hours,,better that most high dollar colognes,I highly recommend this cologne...</li>
            <li>good for a more of a active night or  active day.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know HHHHOWWW people could give it a positive review.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than the Yatch Man Grey.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and sweet.</li>
            <li>I typically use CK and Perry Elise, so Yacht Man allows for a strong, but pleasant scent to the other two.</li>
            <li>I wear certain colognes at certain times.  </li>
            <li>I usually put this on while going out because its a tad strong, but I like that!!</li>
            <li>the top looks bit loose as if it is leaking.</li>
            <li>the yacht man red is a great smelling cologne for half the price..</li>
            <li>He is pretty particular.  </li>
            <li>Great for the price, especially when times are tight.</li>
            <li>It has a nautical, outdoorsy, clean smell, but is a little on the strong side for those who like people to smell them coming.  </li>
            <li>the smell is light ,it will last for whole day .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this scent, it smells fruity and that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m really into.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced product</li>
            <li>but just doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I really like this cologne.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>wears off in about 10 minutes on the skin but will stay much longer</li>
            <li>Younger man would enjoy.</li>
            <li>Really spicy sent, not for me.</li>
            <li>What was delivered was not the real thing.</li>
            <li>This is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>I am a big cologne aficionado; so, I enjoy purchasing a variety of colognes.  </li>
            <li>But then again at this price what more can be expected.  </li>
            <li>YMR has a light musky smell with some fruit and spice mixed in.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much you spray on by the time you leave you house</li>
            <li>Not feeling this Cologne too much</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>I buy this stuff whenever it appears at a reasonable price...  </li>
            <li>Gave to my father for his birthday, he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>34240  THANKS</li>
            <li>REALLY LIKE IT....</li>
            <li>also i feel it wears out very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i recommend only if you want to run the risk and because of the cheap price</li>
            <li>To much of alcohol</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need to apply that much.</li>
            <li>Too much will cause people to stare so</li>
            <li>DO NOT apply too much, it would be an over kill.</li>
            <li>I knew this should be a much pricier cologne.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It is nice to have several different scents and this one measures up</li>
            <li>The others smell pretty much like most other cologne, however this has a sweeter fresher smell.(still masculine) really good price and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I ordered the YM black which basically had no scent besides a hint of bug spray but the Red smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It is very rare that I rate a product so low; however, I feel this one does deserve it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong scent that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Good chance is it&#x27;s the exact same formula, same stuff in a different bottle.</li>
            <li>and I am very much satisfied so after reading other reviews here on Amazon</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance for men n long lasting too...</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell, but my least favorite of the four Yacht Man colognes I tried.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very strong and lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last very long on the body.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for my gift for my better half.</li>
            <li>Not in order to go out with any pretty girl perfume soft.</li>
            <li>I have 5-Cuba scents, Polo Red, 2-Nautica scents, True Religion, and 2-Yacht Man scents.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to have little more intense odor though.</li>
            <li>you have to drown yourself in the thing just for a decent smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Yacht Man Red, Yacht Man Blue, and Yacht Men Metal, and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It is more expensive but much better.  </li>
            <li>I will most likely just order a 2nd bottle for him</li>
            <li>Smell is decent.</li>
            <li>and i love them both for the price you just cant go wrong when i need more</li>
            <li>I have smelled this in a store prior and liked it - it&#x27;s going to be a Christmas-gift like the other colognes.</li>
            <li>But the cologne did get a little better when on my skin.</li>
            <li>I would recomend this to the gent on a budget and wanting a clean long lasting fresh scent.</li>
            <li>However, it is a very light scent, and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>This line of colognes kept intriguing me with their crazily mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a cologne this price.  </li>
            <li>something long lasting is better than this</li>
            <li>I like the fresh scent for daytime especially.</li>
            <li>OK but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>Smells great, I use it everyday but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Other than that they smell fantastic.</li>
            <li>Very soft lemon scent.</li>
            <li>When you first open the box you will not like the smell at all.</li>
            <li>I have several other colognes but this has become my favorite..</li>
            <li>I am excited to try some of their other offerings.</li>
            <li>it is strong and last long thats what i needed...!</li>
            <li>This is a little strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth scent, not iverbear and long lasting.</li>
            <li>This is a light fragrance and does not last long on my husband</li>
            <li>Normal and cheap serve for everyday.</li>
            <li>I decided to go for the Red version this time as this was described as even better in terms of long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>I think YachtMan Red is better option for people who are looking less price fragrent.</li>
            <li>Also i am not sure if this is original as nothing i mentioned about the product on the packaging which is unusual.</li>
            <li>Yacht Man Blue resembles Cool Water to me, but it isn&#x27;t as strong and won&#x27;t last as long as Yacht Man Red, so I&#x27;ve made Yacht Man Blue my daytime cologne.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to describe but it&#x27;s a smooth light scent and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>it is not a heavy smell, but it smells spicy and masculine.</li>
            <li>This cologne is for old men.</li>
            <li>old mens clothing makes her nose itch when i wear it.</li>
            <li>---it makes them go wild</li>
            <li>he was surprised with this.he</li>
            <li>But spoilers ahead it is nothing as compared to my old one.</li>
            <li>but it is sold by Amazon directly</li>
            <li>My husband had one already which was nearly finishing</li>
            <li>The smell is  absolutely indistinguishable from Dunhill Red.</li>
            <li>and I was nicely surprised</li>
            <li>Its true the smell dosent last long at all.....</li>
            <li>Pluses are:  sweet scent, does last a fairly long time, don&#x27;t need to drench myself in it, inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Ok, Not very great.</li>
            <li>I bought it honestly because I was curious &amp; needed a few extra dollars to get free shipping for the other item</li>
            <li>Honestly they are pretty bad the Red is sweet and not a light sweet</li>
            <li>Not really a fan of this yacht man red because it smells way too sweet but</li>
            <li>and this was the cheapest bottle of cologne with decent enough reviews I could find.</li>
            <li>this product should ONLY BE WORN BY MEN IN THEIR 50s and older</li>
            <li>So before tossing it, I mixed some of it with some of my older colognes.</li>
            <li>It has a high alcoholic content which quickly vaporizes.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I expected much for the cheap price but would have expected it to last longer than a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>I thought the scent would be better, but on my skin, it&#x27;s NOT good.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I promise&amp;#34;, you that once your guy sprays himself you will want to pull him near you and you will not be able to get enough of him/well the smell on him at least, &amp;#34;winks&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Incidentally, I have been searching for years under the olde name and apparently someone reissued it under this name!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to give it to any older female relative</li>
            <li>the smell does not last more than 2 minutes, not a  good product but enticing</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and it was what I expected</li>
            <li>Paco Rabanne 1 million is no longer a top scent, people got tired of it.</li>
            <li>and it was not at all on top of that the bottle was broken</li>
            <li>Again it is an OK cologne, not great..</li>
            <li>Very aromatic product reminiscent of one I used way back in the 60&#x27;s with a different name but very similar scent!  </li>
            <li>and I have loved them all,  it even last pretty long for such a less expensive fragrance  </li>
            <li>Good for casual use only since the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I just love this cheaper cologne itt is  very in expensive, so I have had it a couple of times, does not last very long,&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it would be an everyday cologne, but definitely an alternative to your favorite one.</li>
            <li>I really prefer the woody musk smells in cologne such as Polo Black, Power, etc....</li>
            <li>Smells so good on my husband and with a tight income with expensive taste....</li>
            <li>I bought Red, Black, Metal and Blue, and this one is my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>a new scent mixed with some other notes you just cant put your finger on.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> good</li>
            <li> This cologne does smell good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be a good fragrance</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE AND GOOD SMELL..</li>
            <li> Good smelling spicy fragrance, good for summer days.</li>

            <li> Good smell</li>
            <li> Good price, but wish it held up for a longer time.</li>
            <li> but, \\&quot;the picture looks good.</li>
            <li> i was hoping it smelled good</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> One for my dad and one for my boyfriend,they bothh loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good perfume for the price..</li>
            <li> Surprisingly having cologne scented carpet has its advantages.</li>
            <li> My husband loved it.</li>
            <li> and it seems like it would be good to use to go out or just to wear at night</li>
            <li> I liked the smell, since your fragrance is not as is not so attractive as to give you a good ratings</li>
            <li> Nice light scent, excellent price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE A LOT AND RECEIVED MANY WONDERFUL COMMENTS ABOUT THE SCENT.</li>
            <li> COMES QUICK!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, also great price</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> THIS COLONE IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE AND HAVE HAD MANY COMPLIMENTS</li>
            <li> My mother also loved it, it has a nice manly smell</li>
            <li> but when it arrived, I fell in love!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding cologne for like 5 bucks!</li>
            <li> (im adding more letters to each word to exaggerate the smell!)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people spend 80-100 bucks on colognes when you can get something like this for so cheap!!</li>
            <li> but that is honestly the BEST explanation I can give for this certain product.   </li>
            <li> is good, but you receive that you pay ,very good service, thanks</li>
            <li> the smell is amazing, i got a lot of compliments from a lot of girls, you can&#x60;t beat the price and the cologne got here a day ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells AMAZING</li>
            <li> This is a real smooth cologne.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest this perfume when not to buy it</li>
            <li> but buy more than one if you want to keep yourself smelling good all day.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff.</li>
            <li> so am going save money and have excellent product to use thanks</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the fragrance smell good</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, nice price and smell.</li>
            <li> good smell, soft and durable, perfect for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;be</li>
            <li> a nice color</li>
            <li> but its it has a nice mellow note you can smell for about 3 hours.after</li>
            <li> my husband says its an ok cologne nothing fancy but good for the price if your not trying to spend a lot</li>
            <li> This one smell nice on clothing too but it fades.</li>
            <li> it would be handy...</li>
            <li> so I might buy it again, not too spectacular though</li>
            <li> To be honest, I had never tried any Yacht Man products.  </li>
            <li> Makes for a nice gift.</li>
            <li> I also received chap stick and a cologne sample from the seller which was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for the great price and quality of this item!</li>
            <li> Like this cologne..very nice...</li>
            <li> but he liked the cologne..</li>
            <li> it  isnt at the top of my list although its good for a night out with your partner.</li>
            <li> I love this Spray, smell good</li>
            <li> Nice aroma but must be renewed every 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> The price is great and the stuff smell pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;can&#x27;t describe the smell... but just too too strong and not at all pleasant to smell..</li>
            <li> so a sweet aroma works great.  </li>
            <li> CARRYING ME THROUGH THE DAY SMELLING GREAT FOR A FULL 8 HRS.</li>
            <li> It is a very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> good for every day use, i use it as a car freshener and it works just fine</li>
            <li> Honestly this thing deserves more than 5 stars</li>
            <li> Easy 5 stars from me!</li>
            <li> Now of course it all has to do with your nose&#x27;s opinion, but my nose, which I trust, has always led to great successful purchases (in the end, what I wear and try when I go out or on a special occasion), and my final choices were always followed by great compliments by people</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed with the nice fragrance of Yacht Man Red.  </li>
            <li> u dont gotta spend like 50 bucks when u have this perfectly fine cologne!</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Metal seems to be the lightest of the three with a VERY light scent...</li>
            <li> yacht man is a very smooth cologne</li>
            <li> its mild and good smelling.</li>
            <li> the fragance is ok... not bad... but not that good...</li>
            <li> Good smell but definitely a more sweet aroma, it lasts for awhile.</li>
            <li> It is quite strong at first but fades to a nice pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> One cheap perfume with great fresh smell.</li>
            <li> My son in law love it</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because its not terrible but definitely not Yacht Man&#x27;s best!  </li>
            <li> I love the way this smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and price of this product.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> FAVORITE:</li>
            <li> This cologne is just okay.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was recommended by the sight for buying my favorite cologne which is Carlos Santanna.</li>
            <li> this perfume was a gift for my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;i love the way it smell and</li>
            <li> Purchased this before and love the smell</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s appropriate for any age.</li>
            <li> It smells mostly like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> plus we bought a bottle for his father as well! :)</li>
            <li> This product has more water and alcohol than fragrance.</li>
            <li> I get my order and I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It smells cheap, because it is!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t LOVE it..</li>
            <li> but ti was ok</li>
            <li> Is a option to a cheap perfume if you want to smell nice during a shot time.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells on my husband.</li>
            <li> fresh feeling...really good pefrfume , i love it.i would recomnd this one to friends</li>
            <li> Actually bought the fame of the brand here in Brazil but never esperimentei, packaging and color seduced me, an excellent cost benefit by famous brand&lt;br /&gt;Spanish.</li>
            <li> He will love it</li>
            <li> this is not going into my top 20 collections.</li>
            <li> MINE ROOMMATE LOVE THE FRAGRANCE  </li>
            <li> DO PLESE SEND MORE SAMPLE PLEASE AT 7423 ROXYE LANE SARASOTA FL</li>
            <li> I have tried all Yacht Man cologne and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> Not being able to smell the product made me uneasy</li>
            <li> love this cologne</li>
            <li> Probably would be ok to go to a dance club or someplace where lighter and fruitier colognes mix in well.  </li>
            <li> better  </li>
            <li> I love types of colognes....</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Interesting.</li>
            <li> Great merchandise and fast delivery..</li>
            <li> IS MADE MOST OF ALCOHOL SCENT DOES NOT LAST&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always browse through the mens cologne section mostly to see the prices on my favorites.  </li>
            <li> I love this cologne and will use it in the mix with my favorites.</li>
            <li> Not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> i hope, those colognes are more over the top.</li>
            <li> but if you put it on cloth, it lasts a lot longer than on skin, although it&#x27;s more abrasive.</li>
            <li> Still, this is a nice romantic fragrance, great to take your wife to a nice meal.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Also the bottle is quite cute</li>
            <li> Love the fragarance.</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Metal is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love when my guy sprays himself with this smell, makes me want to be closer to him.</li>
            <li> I like how fast it was delievered to our doorstep too, great service.</li>
            <li> Enjoyable smell is all I got to say.</li>
            <li> more thing he loves the top.</li>
            <li> Probably better than just wasting it.</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant aroma, the second I smelled it</li>
            <li> Smells good for the first minute,wears off.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST DAY IT SMELL GOOD</li>
            <li> It smells so good gotten so much compliments!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells really good and the overall value is good.</li>
            <li> This cologne is light and smells nice, but it is just too light and airy.  </li>
            <li> I like this item Red by Myurgia for men, and the price very good, I recommend this item to any one</li>
            <li> This perfume has a fruit scent smell which is very sweet..</li>
            <li> The scent is very sweet and floral.</li>
            <li> For me the most important thing for a cologne is the sent life.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay not so great, the regular version of the Yacht Man, the one comes in silver bottle is much better than this one.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much for the price, but figured it would be good for a cologne emergency.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a really goo scent since Yaght seems to have a good reputation.</li>
            <li> loves the nice fresh scent .</li>
            <li> smelled good  fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot for a good price and overall a good product, I would recommend it to anyone who likes a sweet smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very mild.</li>
            <li> It has an extremely strong cedar sent.</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent that I can&#x27;t describe, but it is not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> Not for me, too strong.</li>
            <li> Its smooth with a little loud touch but its mostly for a first date win win lol</li>
            <li> I got my own and my wife and I like the scent very much.</li>
            <li> This colonge is sweet more of a night time cologne.</li>
            <li> But if anyone looking for a cheap and strong fragrance then go for this.</li>
            <li> purchased for my hubby and he loves the scent, not too strong and not too light just in between</li>
            <li> , I have yacht man blue and is great and works fine.</li>
            <li> Huge mistake.</li>
            <li> yacht man blue smells great and is a must buy for how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> it was really CHEAP COLOGNE</li>
            <li> so this raised the question that how is it so cheap here.</li>
            <li> it was so cheap.  </li>
            <li> Worth more than Wat</li>
            <li> It is cheap and smells cheap.</li>
            <li> so if he needs a reboost he has it available.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because it was cheap.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cheap product, and you are a man/boy, to wear when you go out or whatever</li>
            <li> I was happy that my friends felt the same as they purchased after my suggestion.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Deal..</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne to get free shipping on another item.  </li>
            <li> but i took the risk since the price was so cheap...</li>
            <li> There is a reason this cologne is so cheap.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice fragrance and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Smells great and last about 7-8 hours.</li>
            <li> This really smells nice on him.</li>
            <li> Is cheap; smells cheap.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so light as to be almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li> They both smell really good Blue being my favorite.</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Red is more of a \\&quot;nighttime\\&quot; cologne that is stronger with a smooth, pleasant, and sweet aroma that will stay with you without having to reapply a bunch of times.  </li>
            <li> though I would check out all of the other versions...and according to the reviews this was really good but definitely NOT the best.</li>
            <li> OK, so it was $6.60, so why even complain right?</li>
            <li> It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li> but it smells clean and fresh  with a hint of citrus not to over the top</li>
            <li> Great perfume for such a less price and very good to even gift someone on any occasion.</li>
            <li> Decent fragrance and nice bottle</li>
            <li> This came fast (just like your husband) and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> The scent goes on strong but quickly starts to fade to a real nice long wearing day long into the night good scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty okay..</li>
            <li> The formula smells remarkably like Dunhill Red.</li>
            <li> and I had my doubts before purchasing a brand I haven&#x27;t heard, but rest assured I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> Very good but do not last, to much alcohol.</li>
            <li> I can believe this fragrance the smell is so good...fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> SUPER CHEAP PRICE AND</li>
            <li> The frangrance seems to last all day and even at night it is pleasant</li>
            <li> Smell is pleasant however it only lasts for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Red was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> It has the most long lasting, best smell .</li>
            <li> and it is very lightly scented and wears off very fast.i</li>
            <li> im not a fan of cheap mens spray but must say i love this product, not to strong not to soft,</li>
            <li> hope this helps you make the right decision!</li>
            <li> thanks a lot thanks to them is precisely what they offered me the article is very nice and is what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li> this is a very mild scent, it wears off quickly but the price was right</li>
            <li> What a great smell first off, second</li>
            <li> I gave it to a buddy of mine who actually likes the scent so good on him.</li>
            <li> and i loved the blue one.</li>
            <li> For the price this is some good cologne I will definitely purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent</li>
            <li> POPEL3@COLUMBUS.RR.COM LOVED THIS PRESENT</li>
            <li> Its good for the daily use.</li>
            <li> it is a sweet smell</li>
            <li> but if you end up sweating it will kick back up leaving you smelling good and not like a pig.</li>
            <li> If you want to have intense odor, you&#x27;ll have to put more quantity which is why it is 3.4 oz</li>
            <li> For a cheep 10 dollar cologne it is not bad</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very rich in the first 30 minutes but then is lost, although the cost is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strong at first</li>
            <li> GENUINE AND HONEST SELLER, SUPER FAST SHIPPING, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, AAA+++</li>
            <li> but seems to dissipate quickly.</li>
            <li> its mild ,not over powering.</li>
            <li> good deal---smells good---last a few hours---can&#x27;t beat the price---all the women love it</li>
            <li> again the scent does not wear off quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance is much greater and longer lasting than most colognes</li>
            <li> Boyfriend love this one better than the Yacht Man Blue.</li>
            <li> Better then blue version, but my wife think otherwise :-)</li>
            <li> Comprenlo es Super Buena</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the promptness and professionalism has proven distributor, I would like to work again in the future with this company.</li>
            <li> Sorry to the seller, who did a wonderful job getting it to me quickly with Amazon Prime (Nov &#x27;11, $6), but the smell is very sweet and does not smell like a cologne for men, daytime use or even nighttime use.   </li>
            <li> I ordered the yacht man blue and red spray and they both smell great although the red has an edge to it that makes it great for a date</li>
            <li> This smells great, it has a sweet smell and after a few hours it has a slight vanilla smell, but its a great product for the price</li>
            <li> Tried the red first and absolutely loved the frangrance and its longevity.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very manly and strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and soft.</li>
            <li> But this is a nice, solid fragrance and when you can have a 100ml bottle like this for less than $10, given its virtually identical competitors, you have a win.</li>
            <li> It is a very soft  and fresh smell, he liked it soo much that I bought again</li>
            <li> It was a great deal and i might buy some for my little cousins that want to show off to their friends.</li>
            <li> Smells good and lasts long!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this scent, it smells so sweet, like candy, not very strong though, very light</li>
            <li> Just great smelling stuff and lasts for a few hours anyway.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne for a practical everyday use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
            <li> This is really worth for the price</li>
            <li> It is really worth for this price.</li>
            <li> definately can hold its own with any of the big names and on a side note</li>
            <li> worth the buy</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Masculine, but sexy smell that lasts without filling an area.</li>
            <li> certainly worth $10 to try it out.  </li>
            <li> Powerful smell for the money.</li>
            <li> I wear it a couple times a week but prefer a more masculine smell.</li>
            <li> it is such a nice bottle.</li>
            <li> This one is by far my favorite of all of them.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> Great stuff was highly surprised just ordered it out of the blue</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Super powerful and stayed all day</li>
            <li> Got here pretty quick and as advertised.</li>
            <li> It has a nice masculine woodsy smell and lasts pretty much all day.  </li>
            <li> A good perfume to have to supplement the other killer cologne in your collection</li>
            <li> Nice product, not as long lasting as I might like but a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> the price is just right.</li>
            <li> i have almost all of them got mine right away</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> but the smell is pretty good even though it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Amis friends love their sweet aroma and especially my girl</li>
            <li> Nice, long lasting and mild cologne and the price makes it all the better for me to recommend it</li>
            <li> Nice smell not stay for long time</li>
            <li> It smells very sophisticated and it is very long lasting, lasts longer than some of the top brands.  </li>
            <li> Spend a few more dollars and get something better.</li>
            <li> Thank you thank you very much</li>
            <li> but it is gone very fast....</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 days ago and it came today, very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Recommended thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Wonderful  Fragrance but very little smell left</li>
            <li> Yes i was aware of this when i ordered it so it</li>
            <li> This cologne is peefect it last a long time and smells great.  </li>
            <li> When we received it, he absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> the description of item is exact according to display in the website</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s better to buy a &amp;#34;ADIDAS&amp;#34; perfume which are at the same price and quantity.</li>
            <li> At first it had almost a Joop cologne smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have already ordered three more bottles from the same family of cologne to try them all!</li>
            <li> It usually last about 30 minutes at most, but i am going to use it for my car instead.</li>
            <li> I will spend more on name brands next time.</li>
            <li> Out of 3 this was his favorite then Yacht man Blue and then Nautical Silver.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t attest to that because this is my first time buying it.</li>
            <li> Looked at reviews and description first.</li>
            <li> My first time using this</li>
            <li> The red color looks pretty, but I sure couldn&#x27;t tell you what this stuff smells like...  </li>
            <li> This was absolutely the nastiest smell cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled in my life!</li>
            <li> Long lasting and a great price.</li>
            <li> I am a first time customer</li>
            <li> I only put one spritz and got compliments all day long, glad I didn&#x27;t spray more on myself.  </li>
            <li> It has a friuty sweet scent that last for hours,,better that most high dollar colognes,I highly recommend this cologne...</li>
            <li> good for a more of a active night or  active day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know HHHHOWWW people could give it a positive review.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than the Yatch Man Grey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and sweet.</li>
            <li> I typically use CK and Perry Elise, so Yacht Man allows for a strong, but pleasant scent to the other two.</li>
            <li> I wear certain colognes at certain times.  </li>
            <li> I usually put this on while going out because its a tad strong, but I like that!!</li>
            <li> the top looks bit loose as if it is leaking.</li>
            <li> the yacht man red is a great smelling cologne for half the price..</li>
            <li> He is pretty particular.  </li>
            <li> Great for the price, especially when times are tight.</li>
            <li> It has a nautical, outdoorsy, clean smell, but is a little on the strong side for those who like people to smell them coming.  </li>
            <li> the smell is light ,it will last for whole day .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this scent, it smells fruity and that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m really into.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced product</li>
            <li> but just doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> wears off in about 10 minutes on the skin but will stay much longer</li>
            <li> Younger man would enjoy.</li>
            <li> Really spicy sent, not for me.</li>
            <li> What was delivered was not the real thing.</li>
            <li> This is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> I am a big cologne aficionado; so, I enjoy purchasing a variety of colognes.  </li>
            <li> But then again at this price what more can be expected.  </li>
            <li> YMR has a light musky smell with some fruit and spice mixed in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how much you spray on by the time you leave you house</li>
            <li> Not feeling this Cologne too much</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff whenever it appears at a reasonable price...  </li>
            <li> Gave to my father for his birthday, he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> 34240  THANKS</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE IT....</li>
            <li> also i feel it wears out very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i recommend only if you want to run the risk and because of the cheap price</li>
            <li> To much of alcohol</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need to apply that much.</li>
            <li> Too much will cause people to stare so</li>
            <li> DO NOT apply too much, it would be an over kill.</li>
            <li> I knew this should be a much pricier cologne.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It is nice to have several different scents and this one measures up</li>
            <li> The others smell pretty much like most other cologne, however this has a sweeter fresher smell.(still masculine) really good price and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I ordered the YM black which basically had no scent besides a hint of bug spray but the Red smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It is very rare that I rate a product so low; however, I feel this one does deserve it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong scent that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Good chance is it&#x27;s the exact same formula, same stuff in a different bottle.</li>
            <li> and I am very much satisfied so after reading other reviews here on Amazon</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance for men n long lasting too...</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell, but my least favorite of the four Yacht Man colognes I tried.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very strong and lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last very long on the body.</li>
            <li> Thanks again for my gift for my better half.</li>
            <li> Not in order to go out with any pretty girl perfume soft.</li>
            <li> I have 5-Cuba scents, Polo Red, 2-Nautica scents, True Religion, and 2-Yacht Man scents.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to have little more intense odor though.</li>
            <li> you have to drown yourself in the thing just for a decent smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Yacht Man Red, Yacht Man Blue, and Yacht Men Metal, and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It is more expensive but much better.  </li>
            <li> I will most likely just order a 2nd bottle for him</li>
            <li> Smell is decent.</li>
            <li> and i love them both for the price you just cant go wrong when i need more</li>
            <li> I have smelled this in a store prior and liked it - it&#x27;s going to be a Christmas-gift like the other colognes.</li>
            <li> But the cologne did get a little better when on my skin.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this to the gent on a budget and wanting a clean long lasting fresh scent.</li>
            <li> However, it is a very light scent, and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This line of colognes kept intriguing me with their crazily mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a cologne this price.  </li>
            <li> something long lasting is better than this</li>
            <li> I like the fresh scent for daytime especially.</li>
            <li> OK but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Smells great, I use it everyday but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Other than that they smell fantastic.</li>
            <li> Very soft lemon scent.</li>
            <li> When you first open the box you will not like the smell at all.</li>
            <li> I have several other colognes but this has become my favorite..</li>
            <li> I am excited to try some of their other offerings.</li>
            <li> it is strong and last long thats what i needed...!</li>
            <li> This is a little strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth scent, not iverbear and long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is a light fragrance and does not last long on my husband</li>
            <li> Normal and cheap serve for everyday.</li>
            <li> I decided to go for the Red version this time as this was described as even better in terms of long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I think YachtMan Red is better option for people who are looking less price fragrent.</li>
            <li> Also i am not sure if this is original as nothing i mentioned about the product on the packaging which is unusual.</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Blue resembles Cool Water to me, but it isn&#x27;t as strong and won&#x27;t last as long as Yacht Man Red, so I&#x27;ve made Yacht Man Blue my daytime cologne.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to describe but it&#x27;s a smooth light scent and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> it is not a heavy smell, but it smells spicy and masculine.</li>
            <li> This cologne is for old men.</li>
            <li> old mens clothing makes her nose itch when i wear it.</li>
            <li> ---it makes them go wild</li>
            <li> he was surprised with this.he</li>
            <li> But spoilers ahead it is nothing as compared to my old one.</li>
            <li> but it is sold by Amazon directly</li>
            <li> My husband had one already which was nearly finishing</li>
            <li> The smell is  absolutely indistinguishable from Dunhill Red.</li>
            <li> and I was nicely surprised</li>
            <li> Its true the smell dosent last long at all.....</li>
            <li> Pluses are:  sweet scent, does last a fairly long time, don&#x27;t need to drench myself in it, inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Ok, Not very great.</li>
            <li> I bought it honestly because I was curious &amp; needed a few extra dollars to get free shipping for the other item</li>
            <li> Honestly they are pretty bad the Red is sweet and not a light sweet</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of this yacht man red because it smells way too sweet but</li>
            <li> and this was the cheapest bottle of cologne with decent enough reviews I could find.</li>
            <li> this product should ONLY BE WORN BY MEN IN THEIR 50s and older</li>
            <li> So before tossing it, I mixed some of it with some of my older colognes.</li>
            <li> It has a high alcoholic content which quickly vaporizes.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I expected much for the cheap price but would have expected it to last longer than a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> I thought the scent would be better, but on my skin, it&#x27;s NOT good.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I promise&amp;#34;, you that once your guy sprays himself you will want to pull him near you and you will not be able to get enough of him/well the smell on him at least, &amp;#34;winks&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, I have been searching for years under the olde name and apparently someone reissued it under this name!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give it to any older female relative</li>
            <li> the smell does not last more than 2 minutes, not a  good product but enticing</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and it was what I expected</li>
            <li> Paco Rabanne 1 million is no longer a top scent, people got tired of it.</li>
            <li> and it was not at all on top of that the bottle was broken</li>
            <li> Again it is an OK cologne, not great..</li>
            <li> Very aromatic product reminiscent of one I used way back in the 60&#x27;s with a different name but very similar scent!  </li>
            <li> and I have loved them all,  it even last pretty long for such a less expensive fragrance  </li>
            <li> Good for casual use only since the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I just love this cheaper cologne itt is  very in expensive, so I have had it a couple of times, does not last very long,&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it would be an everyday cologne, but definitely an alternative to your favorite one.</li>
            <li> I really prefer the woody musk smells in cologne such as Polo Black, Power, etc....</li>
            <li> Smells so good on my husband and with a tight income with expensive taste....</li>
            <li> I bought Red, Black, Metal and Blue, and this one is my least favorite.  </li>
            <li> a new scent mixed with some other notes you just cant put your finger on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and for such a big bottle at such low costs, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pleasant -- it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> :  If you are in search of a new cologne for an extremely low price, go with the same brand and get the cologne &#x27;Blue&#x27;, otherwise don&#x27;t waste any money on this.   </li>
            <li> the only problem is it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Bought this to cover up for free super saver shipping for Perry Ellis i purchased and its smells like crap.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is real.</li>
            <li> Long lasting too..</li>
            <li> I like the smell and long lasting .Eventhough</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last long..</li>
            <li> fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long at all.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> But it last Long</li>
            <li> Obviously these are not natural fragrances like a Creed or a Montale.</li>
            <li> and it last very long</li>
            <li> The scent, however, doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Morevover, what fragrance there is does not seem to last very long at all.  </li>
            <li> bottle is already broken when i open it, got hot glue on it, and the smell last for about 5</li>
            <li> Seriously don&#x27;t know what to do with it since this is the first time I am buying this brand.</li>
            <li> The original  says by Myrurgia isn&#x27;t the same on these packages, so I assume thats is fake product, no time to return it but not buying again</li>
            <li> This fragrance was more than expected, You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price at all, The product arrives faster than expected</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy it again because I don&#x27;t like reapplying cologne all day long.</li>
            <li> I been using grey flannel</li>
            <li> Smell stays long.</li>
            <li> Not too long time of duration.</li>
            <li> and is bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> But, Yacht Man is not a wow scent like Paco...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this cologne for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t last very long at least with a high intensity.</li>
            <li> I have the metal, black, blue, chocolate, and red yacht man colognes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it and several other Yacht Man cologne fragrances.</li>
            <li> and it does change scents after a few minutes, but it just doesn&#x27;t last long enough.  </li>
            <li> Lasts very long.</li>
            <li> Must let it dry on the skin.</li>
            <li> It does seem to lose its potency when dry</li>
            <li> and I only had a few bucks left to spend</li>
            <li> Old very little smell if any :</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy cologne without knowing what the scent is like but here lately I have bought three.</li>
            <li> The longevity is pretty poor on both</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought bleu de chanel</li>
            <li> Well the only reason is because this had less fragrance than clorinated water.</li>
            <li> Spend a little extra and get something with some frangrance oils to it.</li>
            <li> Value for the $ spent.</li>
            <li> I will never buy this again and will warn others to be careful.</li>
            <li> I paid only $5.84 or so for this, which seems as though it should be a bargain; instead, I feel as though I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> not strong enough for me</li>
            <li> This particular perfume I received has fake written all over it without even ripping open the cover.</li>
            <li> the set is pretty bad and both only last 15 minutes if you apply correctly if incorrectly it will be gone in 10</li>
            <li> However, I sprayed a few times and less than an hour later, I could no longer smell the aroma.  </li>
            <li> One other cologne i would recommend is curve by liz Claiborne.</li>
            <li> One goes to the seller; the other because I can now give this fancy bottle of corn syrup to someone as a gift and get it out of my hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to fragrances, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as other brands.</li>
            <li> I have purchased yacht man red two times in the past five years at a nearby mall.</li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> The cologne will linger for hours, not like other colognes where after an hour you don&#x27;t smell it on you anymore.</li>
            <li> WHERE IT&#x27;S DUE.</li>
            <li> The smell is embarrassing to ware and it has a scratchy, sharp and dying sent.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gift for my dad and found this to be cheaper than other perfumes.</li>
            <li> At the back of the box I see Made in Germany and right besides it an ugly sticker that says &#x27;Made in China</li>
            <li> I found that the sent life is not super strong  but not to bad.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m always losing the caps to my other colognes) and I can&#x27;t give less than a one star rating.</li>
            <li> 2 stars cause my other half  don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Anyway It actually isn&#x27;t bad if your looking for something cheap.</li>
            <li> Pungent, cheap alcoholic smell will drive u crazy.</li>
            <li> small doesn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li> My Girl friend says it smells like a dusty old basement filledwith</li>
            <li> I think it was watered down.</li>
            <li> then it tones down quite a bit</li>
            <li> When I found this bargain cologne for less than $8 I decided to buy it for my husband for a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews did help and it lives up to all expectation.</li>
            <li> The cologne i purchased was watered down and not original at all.</li>
            <li> The lid is a little difficult to open at times but that is minor compared to the smell and value.</li>
            <li> I had never bought this scent for my husband, and I was a little worried.  </li>
            <li> but I gave it to my little nephew since it smells like its from the dollar store</li>
            <li> Maybe a little too Christmas-y.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Joop a little.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s designed to kill existing bad smells -- like Fresh Scent.  </li>
            <li> i wore it a few times and i have alot of women at my job</li>
            <li> A few hours is all you get..</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money on this product.</li>
            <li> .Some can be heavy but</li>
            <li> i like the as an everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of time, even now to write this review.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sickening and girls say VERY UNATTRACTIVE the blue is</li>
            <li> This spray is obviously a fake as it only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> little woman seems to like it too!</li>
            <li> It smells like a red candy lollipop, and i&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who would like this scent.</li>
            <li> Not pleased whatsoever.</li>
            <li> but this one iam still not sure about</li>
            <li> I usually by Chanel or Givenchy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to shop online for stuff like that</li>
            <li> at least bearable</li>
            <li> I get at least 20 compliments everytime I wear this</li>
            <li> Honestly not a fan at all.</li>
            <li> Just a bad scent in general.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle smell that isnt too over powering or overbearing.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the fragrance disappeared within 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> It was weak.</li>
            <li> Smell stays only for an hour or so :( .</li>
            <li> But I m fairly disappointed and now the packet is open and used twice</li>
            <li> , I have a bit of tough demeanor along with confidence</li>
            <li> I just smelled a candy-like cherry with just artificial sweetness, and maybe a little cinnamon?</li>
            <li> Everyone that is saying that this product is poor is correct.</li>
            <li> I call this my secret weapon from Myrurgia.</li>
            <li> got what I paid for, poor quality</li>
            <li> Not a great one but for the money you pay</li>
            <li> this stuff smells horrible if you&#x27;re a young man....</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this, because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell after it dried.</li>
            <li> The scent is very weak.</li>
            <li> just got this spray in my hand, and i think its fake.</li>
            <li> &#x27; Fake?</li>
            <li> My husband loves it, unfortunately after a couple hours you can&#x27;t smell any of the scent.</li>
            <li> To me it seems a fake cologne.</li>
            <li> so I went for it to ensure that I dont get a fake.</li>
            <li> ITS REALLY  UNFORTUNATE</li>
            <li> i purchased this blindly for my husband.</li>
            <li> This is fake perfume</li>
            <li> Some buyers think it is fake product</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product did not surprise me.  </li>
            <li> Ill never ever purchase cologne from amazon.com in life again.</li>
            <li> But i am unhappy with the packaging as in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Cinnamon, ambergris, maybe some artificial attempt at sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Very unfortunate</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s that bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel so bad because it was $5.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad about this smell</li>
            <li> So please trust me, do not buy this product, even if you find it not to be as bad as I say it is, people around you will not find it pleasing at all</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell all that bad.</li>
            <li> Truly disappointed with this cologne.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in it and would not purchase it again</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking maybe an awkward 6th grader could wear it instead of some awful axe body spray because they are just as bad.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the smell.</li>
            <li> (I hate</li>
            <li> the scent is that annoying.  </li>
            <li> a Disappointed should allow for another  To sent out !</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells horrible.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this stuff, its horrible.</li>
            <li> This one has to be one of the worst that I have ever smelled.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The price is great and the stuff smell pretty good. It is nice to have several different scents and this one measures up and you can&#x27;t beat the price. JR</li>
            <li> I only use this cologne to finish it. I purchased it and several other Yacht Man cologne fragrances. Truly disappointed with this cologne. The scent does not last. you have to drown yourself in the thing just for a decent smell.  it was really CHEAP COLOGNE</li>
            <li> We dednt resive items</li>
            <li> My oldest son got this as a Xmas gift and I was stealing it from him.  I got my own and my wife and I like the scent very much.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant but you need the the others as counterpoint.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this scent, it smells fruity and that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m really into. I gave it to a buddy of mine who actually likes the scent so good on him. It&#x27;s just not for me</li>
            <li> it is a great product I would let anyone try this because it smells nice and it last very long</li>
            <li> I am happy with this item. It is very useful and practical. Good quality. I recommend it. Great job. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Decent fragrance and nice bottle but seems to dissipate quickly. Reasonably priced product but just doesn&#x27;t do much. Did not reorder.</li>
            <li> Everyone that is saying that this product is poor is correct. The fragrance is gone as soon as you put it on. Save your money.</li>
            <li> My son in law love it the smell is very nice</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because its not terrible but definitely not Yacht Man&#x27;s best!  It smells like a diluted version of Joop.  I have purchased Yacht Man Metal and loved it for my husband so I though I would check out all of the other versions...and according to the reviews this was really good but definitely NOT the best.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smell. I was surprise of the price. Long lasting too.. I would reccomend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this perfume  smells great and lasts all day. My son sneaks and uses it also</li>
            <li> good for every day use, i use it as a car freshener and it works just fine</li>
            <li> I love the smell and price of this product.</li>
            <li> just got this spray in my hand, and i think its fake. bottle is already broken when i open it, got hot glue on it, and the smell last for about 5 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;think again before you buy.</li>
            <li> Love it, also great price</li>
            <li> I really love this scent, it smells so sweet, like candy, not very strong though, very light</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells horrible. It smells like rubbing alcohol. I don&#x27;t suggest anyone to buy this.</li>
            <li> It is a very strong fragrance. Yes i was aware of this when i ordered it so it ok. But i am unhappy with the packaging as in the bottle. the top looks bit loose as if it is leaking. Also i am not sure if this is original as nothing i mentioned about the product on the packaging which is unusual. I saw this product on Target for $45 so this raised the question that how is it so cheap here. But if anyone looking for a cheap and strong fragrance then go for this. I also bought blue one wit this and i loved the blue one. its mild and good smelling.</li>
            <li> I thought the scent would be better, but on my skin, it&#x27;s NOT good.  Thank goodness it was so cheap.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Red by Myrurgia Eau De Toilette Spray: This particular perfume I received has fake written all over it without even ripping open the cover. At the back of the box I see Made in Germany and right besides it an ugly sticker that says &#x27;Made in China&#x27; Fake? Counterfeit? Seriously don&#x27;t know what to do with it since this is the first time I am buying this brand. Thinking of sending this back.</li>
            <li> the smell is amazing, i got a lot of compliments from a lot of girls, you can&#x60;t beat the price and the cologne got here a day ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> Just recieved my order. This cologne is peefect it last a long time and smells great.  For the price this is some good cologne I will definitely purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne.  I&#x27;ve tried Yacht Man Red, Yacht Man Blue, and Yacht Men Metal, and this one is my favorite.  Yacht Man Red is more of a \\&quot;nighttime\\&quot; cologne that is stronger with a smooth, pleasant, and sweet aroma that will stay with you without having to reapply a bunch of times.  Yacht Man Blue resembles Cool Water to me, but it isn&#x27;t as strong and won&#x27;t last as long as Yacht Man Red, so I&#x27;ve made Yacht Man Blue my daytime cologne.  Yacht Man Metal seems to be the lightest of the three with a VERY light scent... it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  I would skip on the Yacht Man Metal.  FAVORITE: [[ASIN:B0019RO78E Yacht Man Red by Myrurgia Eau De Toilette Spray for Men, 3.40 Ounce]]  SECOND-FAVORITE: [[ASIN:B001B0X05U Yacht Man Blue By Puig Eau-de-toilette Spray, 3.4 Ounce]]  PASS: [[ASIN:B001RVMQX0 Yacht Man Metal by Myrurgia Eau-de-toilette Spray for Men, 3.40-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne for my kids Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent i wore it a few times and i have alot of women at my job ask me the name of this cologne.</li>
            <li> This is really worth for the price</li>
            <li> the smell last an hour..</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance for men n long lasting too... Worth more than Wat it costs... This is Wat my husband has to say abt it...</li>
            <li> Very good but do not last, to much alcohol.</li>
            <li> This cologne is just okay. When you first open the box you will not like the smell at all. It has an extremely strong cedar sent. But the cologne did get a little better when on my skin. I found that the sent life is not super strong  but not to bad. the sent strength is very good and the cologne projects nicely.  Nothing like an angle men cologne or a jean paul. For me the most important thing for a cologne is the sent life. This cologne barley passes the test. For a cheep 10 dollar cologne it is not bad but i would suggest to get a nautica blue instead which i bought on amazon for 10 bucks also. One other cologne i would recommend is curve by liz Claiborne. It is more expensive but much better.

            <li> I am a man who likes to smell good and this does the trick. The frangrance seems to last all day and even at night it is pleasant</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was recommended by the sight for buying my favorite cologne which is Carlos Santanna. I do not recommend Yacht Man Red. It did not work for me. It was weak.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance. It&#x27;s hard to shop online for stuff like that but the smell is pretty good even though it&#x27;s not what I expected. It&#x27;s soft and sweet.</li>
            <li> GENUINE AND HONEST SELLER, SUPER FAST SHIPPING, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, AAA+++</li>
            <li> It is really worth for this price.I like the smell and long lasting .Eventhough the smell is light ,it will last for whole day . I think YachtMan Red is better option for people who are looking less price fragrent.</li>
            <li> I had never bought this scent for my husband, and I was a little worried.  He is pretty particular.  When we received it, he absolutely loves it!  He wears this all the time!!  I will definitely be buying it again for him.</li>
            <li> this perfume was a gift for my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;i love the way it smell and the price is just right.</li>
            <li> Tis is a well-formulated product for the price.</li>
            <li> definitely a great buy and great gift</li>
            <li> No me Gusto es muy sensilla y no dura la fragancia aunque la presentacion es aceptable y para el precio esta bien</li>
            <li> Honestly they are pretty bad the Red is sweet and not a light sweet it smells like you&#x27;ve been sitting in a vat of caramelized sugar for a couple of hours it&#x27;s sickening and girls say VERY UNATTRACTIVE the blue is at least bearable the set is pretty bad and both only last 15 minutes if you apply correctly if incorrectly it will be gone in 10</li>
            <li> AWWWWghhhh I absolutely hate the smell. I don&#x27;t know HHHHOWWW people could give it a positive review. It is cheap and smells cheap.</li>
            <li> I had some problem . Its good they helped me resolving it. Thanks. They gave me money back and I have returned things back</li>
            <li> I have to be honest this perfume when not to buy it I liked the smell, since your fragrance is not as is not so attractive as to give you a good ratings</li>
            <li> Sorry to the seller, who did a wonderful job getting it to me quickly with Amazon Prime (Nov &#x27;11, $6), but the smell is very sweet and does not smell like a cologne for men, daytime use or even nighttime use.   It smells like a red candy lollipop, and i&#x27;m sorry but that is honestly the BEST explanation I can give for this certain product.   Bottom line:  If you are in search of a new cologne for an extremely low price, go with the same brand and get the cologne &#x27;Blue&#x27;, otherwise don&#x27;t waste any money on this.   Two stars:  One goes to the seller; the other because I can now give this fancy bottle of corn syrup to someone as a gift and get it out of my hands.</li>
            <li> Purchased this before and love the smell</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good deal. Very attractive bottle. The reason for two stars but fragrance is a sweater version of Raid but don&#x27;t fear the cologne(?) wears off in about 10 minutes on the skin but will stay much longer (Oh no) if used on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve been warned</li>
            <li> Good smell but it won&#x27;t last very long at least with a high intensity.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent perfume its scent is very nice and durable, I liked the aroma s truly excellent. Amis friends love their sweet aroma and especially my girl loves this perfume. My buddies told me that was the perfume were looking for.</li>
            <li> I call this my secret weapon from Myrurgia. This is a wayy underpriced cologne. It is dense with an array of great notes, has some spice, some fruit, some vetvier, some bergamont. I get at least 20 compliments everytime I wear this, woman grab me and say \\&quot;omg you smell incredible\\&quot;. definately can hold its own with any of the big names and on a side note I finally broke down and bought bleu de chanel and it even at 85 bucks does not garner the attention Red gets...</li>
            <li> Got it for my Hubby for Christmas and he loved it! It has a smooth scent, not iverbear and long lasting. I&#x27;m allergic to fragrances, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as other brands. Definitely a keeper! Can&#x27;t wait to try the others.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the promptness and professionalism has proven distributor, I would like to work again in the future with this company.</li>
            <li> ok smell!!! Younger man would enjoy.</li>
            <li> Really spicy sent, not for me. I&#x27;m not sure who would like this scent. I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s appropriate for any age. Just a bad scent in general.</li>
            <li> I have purchased yacht man red two times in the past five years at a nearby mall. This time I decided to get it online. Huge mistake. What was delivered was not the real thing. It has the same look and the same name but it smells different. It smells mostly like rubbing alcohol. I think it was watered down. I even compared the smells from the one I bought from the store and this one. They smell completely different. This is not the real thing. If you want the actual yachman red don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> The scent goes on strong but quickly starts to fade to a real nice long wearing day long into the night good scent.I would recomend this to the gent on a budget and wanting a clean long lasting fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an out-on-a-limb buy, and I don&#x27;t regret it.  Before, I used Brut cologne and it worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;my girlfriend always says,\\&quot;This cologne is delicious.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and for those who wanna know what it smells like; i would say it has a cedar like smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;totally worth the buy</li>
            <li> When I found this bargain cologne for less than $8 I decided to buy it for my husband for a stocking stuffer. I had never smelled it, but took a chance based on the reviews. This cologne smells AMAZING it is not a heavy smell, but it smells spicy and masculine. My husband loves it, unfortunately after a couple hours you can&#x27;t smell any of the scent. I will most likely just order a 2nd bottle for him so he can keep one with him on the go (office or car) so if he needs a reboost he has it available. For the price and the amount, it is a steal- but buy more than one if you want to keep yourself smelling good all day.</li>
            <li> This is a really great smelling cologne.  I am a big cologne aficionado; so, I enjoy purchasing a variety of colognes.  I wear certain colognes at certain times.  My mood dictates the cologne that I wear.  I default to Yacht Man Red for the weekends.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Ok, Not very great. At this price, its just alright. Fragrance not discernible.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last long.. A few hours is all you get.. But then again at this price what more can be expected.  Value for the $ spent.</li>
            <li> YMR has a light musky smell with some fruit and spice mixed in. It&#x27;s a pleasant scent. The big issue is that the scent starts fading within 2 minutes of application.  I won&#x27;t buy it again because I don&#x27;t like reapplying cologne all day long. I wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money on this product.</li>
            <li> the smell does not last more than 2 minutes, not a  good product but enticing</li>
            <li> Nice stuff. Smells great, not flowery, not feminine, not musky, not fruity.  Just great smelling stuff and lasts for a few hours anyway. Will order again.  Also may try the Yacht Man bundle offer of six different fragrances.</li>
            <li> I was influenced by the reviews and bought a bottle.  DON&#x27;T THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY.  This scent does not resemble Dunhill Desire Red, not in the remotest sense and it doesn&#x27;t last 30 minutes.  It has a high alcoholic content which quickly vaporizes.  I wanted to give this 1/16th of 1 star.  Yes it&#x27;s that bad and i&#x27;m not exaggerating.  You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because it was cheap. I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much for the price, but figured it would be good for a cologne emergency.  He ended up loving it, which was great because I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on his cologne any longer.  It smells similar to the more expensive colognes he wears--he likes scents you can definitely smell, and this is definitely one.  It has a nautical, outdoorsy, clean smell, but is a little on the strong side for those who like people to smell them coming.  Great for the price, especially when times are tight.</li>
            <li> This is a light fragrance and does not last long on my husband but it smells clean and fresh  with a hint of citrus not to over the top .Some can be heavy but not this one. I would buy it for him again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and sprayer does not work well, I have yacht man blue and is great and works fine.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a really goo scent since Yaght seems to have a good reputation. I was really disappointed in it and would not purchase it again</li>
            <li> Do not buy this stuff, its horrible. This cologne is for old men. I don&#x27;t feel so bad because it was $5.</li>
            <li> it is awefull and i can&#x27;t return it... i just didn&#x27;t read the return policy on fragrance.. don&#x27;t assume people that everything is returnable on amazon...&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t describe the smell... but just too too strong and not at all pleasant to smell..&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t know what others like in it... i fell for the good reviews and price..</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews it had and I was looking for soething different for my boyfriend... It is a very soft  and fresh smell, he liked it soo much that I bought again plus we bought a bottle for his father as well! :)</li>
            <li> This product has more water and alcohol than fragrance. I don&#x27;t care how much you spray on by the time you leave you house the smell will be evaporated. Spend a little extra and get something with some frangrance oils to it.</li>
            <li> Not feeling this Cologne too much</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this, because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell after it dried.</li>
            <li> Old very little smell if any : Wonderful  Fragrance but very little smell left a Disappointed should allow for another  To sent out !</li>
            <li> I ordered the yacht man blue and red spray and they both smell great although the red has an edge to it that makes it great for a date or when you just want to smell like a boss.</li>
            <li> Hi good afternoon. I get my order and I am satisfied with my purchase. Thank you thank you very much</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of this yacht man red because it smells way too sweet but yacht man blue smells great and is a must buy for how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> Well, I just got the cologne and used it. I learned you get what you pay for. I am not sure if this is real. To me it seems a fake cologne. The scent is very weak. After an hour you don&#x27;t smell anything. I will never buy this again and will warn others to be careful.</li>
            <li> I just love this cheaper cologne itt is  very in expensive, so I have had it a couple of times, does not last very long,&lt;br /&gt;very good for a more of a active night or  active day.  Nothing bad about this smell</li>
            <li> the effect does not last , disappears within 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend and he loves the scent. The previous reviews did help and it lives up to all expectation. I will recommend it to everyone. It</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty okay..Its smooth with a little loud touch but its mostly for a first date win win lol</li>
            <li> Honestly not a fan at all. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and I only had a few bucks left to spend and this was the cheapest bottle of cologne with decent enough reviews I could find. Not pleased whatsoever. I just smelled a candy-like cherry with just artificial sweetness, and maybe a little cinnamon? It wasn&#x27;t anything I would wear. I&#x27;m thinking maybe an awkward 6th grader could wear it instead of some awful axe body spray because they are just as bad.</li>
            <li> I do not have the recommendations, this pack is according for the article! the description of item is exact according to display in the website</li>
            <li> The fragrance isint great and it is very lightly scented and wears off very fast.i bought this for a Christmas present and was so embarrassed .</li>
            <li> WELL THIS IS NICHOLAS POPEL AMAZON POPEL3@COLUMBUS.RR.COM LOVED THIS PRESENT AND WELL I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT AND IT IS AWESOME AND SMELLS AWESOME. THE END PLEASE GIVE ME A GIFT CARD MAYBE</li>
            <li> Shipped fast but the smell ain&#x27;t my cup of tea lol other then that it was perfect</li>
            <li> I been using grey flannel it&#x27;s about $ 40.00 a bottle... the yacht man red is a great smelling cologne for half the price.. so am going save money and have excellent product to use thanks</li>
            <li> It smells cheap, because it is! I am a perfume, fragrance, cologne freak and I have smelled and tried a lot of them. This one has to be one of the worst that I have ever smelled. Now of course it all has to do with your nose&#x27;s opinion, but my nose, which I trust, has always led to great successful purchases (in the end, what I wear and try when I go out or on a special occasion), and my final choices were always followed by great compliments by people I know and don&#x27;t know! So please trust me, do not buy this product, even if you find it not to be as bad as I say it is, people around you will not find it pleasing at all and they will keep a distance. If you are looking for a cheap product, and you are a man/boy, to wear when you go out or whatever, it&#x27;s better to buy a &amp;#34;ADIDAS&amp;#34; perfume which are at the same price and quantity. If you are buying from Amazon...&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you make the right decision!</li>
            <li> Its true the smell dosent last long at all.....</li>
            <li> yacht man is a very smooth cologne i have almost all of them got mine right away i am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Good product and service.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all.</li>
            <li> Very impressed for the price. This is a great smelling cologne for a practical everyday use.</li>
            <li> wife says it smells like a $5.00 cologne. Well, it was $8.00</li>
            <li> I like this item Red by Myurgia for men, and the price very good, I recommend this item to any one 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍</li>
            <li> Got these for gifting and everyone loved the smell. One cheap perfume with great fresh smell. Smell stays long. I was happy that my friends felt the same as they purchased after my suggestion.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Deal.. Great Buy, Dont delay buy yours today.. Great Xmas Gift for Dad, Family, Friends. You wont be disappointed on this product.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the fragrance smell good</li>
            <li> Smell is pleasant however it only lasts for a couple minutes. Can&#x27;t say I expected much for the cheap price but would have expected it to last longer than a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find in the store to &amp;#34;pre&amp;#34; smell. didn&#x27;t LOVE it.. but ti was ok</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven but cap broke as soon as I opened it, great value and fragrance, though</li>
            <li> im not a fan of cheap mens spray but must say i love this product, not to strong not to soft, just right</li>
            <li> Is a option to a cheap perfume if you want to smell nice during a shot time. Not too long time of duration.</li>
            <li> This eau de toilette has a good scent the only problem is it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long at all.&lt;br /&gt;At the max an hour, in fact not even that long.&lt;br /&gt;Not buying this again......waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I love how it smells on my husband.</li>
            <li> I happen to come across this cologne on accident. At first it had almost a Joop cologne smell to it. It is quite strong at first but fades to a nice pleasant smell. I would recommend this product, nice price and smell. I am not sure if it would be an everyday cologne, but definitely an alternative to your favorite one. I typically use CK and Perry Elise, so Yacht Man allows for a strong, but pleasant scent to the other two. If you want to know what to compare it to, think Joop with a hint of fruit, this is the best I can describe it.</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff whenever it appears at a reasonable price...  I like it!!!  It smells great and feels good.  Doesn&#x27;t increase my IQ or libido but it does what an aftershave is supposed to do.  That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s designed to do. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> fresh feeling...really good pefrfume , i love it.i would recomnd this one to friends,i got he package also on time</li>
            <li> good smell, soft and durable, perfect for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;be amazed to see her, tien a nice color and is bigger than I expected, I thought it would be smaller. good</li>
            <li> My Girl friend says it smells like a dusty old basement filledwith old mens clothing makes her nose itch when i wear it.</li>
            <li> i like the as an everyday fragrance. its mild ,not over powering. in fact its not something you&#x27;ll get compliments about. but its it has a nice mellow note you can smell for about 3 hours.after then it tones down quite a bit and you can catch a hint of it from time to time through out the day.</li>
            <li> Actually bought the fame of the brand here in Brazil but never esperimentei, packaging and color seduced me, an excellent cost benefit by famous brand&lt;br /&gt;Spanish.</li>
            <li> good deal---smells good---last a few hours---can&#x27;t beat the price---all the women love it---it makes them go wild/wild/wild---every guy needs this</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband..he was surprised with this.he loves the nice fresh scent . i think he likes it.</li>
            <li> thanks a lot thanks to them is precisely what they offered me the article is very nice and is what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li> This cologne does smell good. However, it is a very light scent, and doesn&#x27;t last very long. It needs to be reapplied if you will be out for an extended time. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice, long lasting and mild cologne and the price makes it all the better for me to recommend it</li>
            <li> THIS COLONE IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE AND HAVE HAD MANY COMPLIMENTS AND INDIVIDUALS ASKING ME WHAT WAS I WEARING. THE PRICE IS GREAT AND DON&#x27;T LET THEM KNOW WHAT U PAID FOR IT!</li>
            <li> Very soft lemon scent.Perfect for morning activities.</li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise this German- made fragrance turned out to be!  Masculine, but sexy smell that lasts without filling an area.</li>
            <li> I can believe this fragrance the smell is so good...fresh and clean. I brought for my son and be came one of his favorites...</li>
            <li> Thanks again for my gift for my better half. He will love it</li>
            <li> Very aromatic product reminiscent of one I used way back in the 60&#x27;s with a different name but very similar scent!  Incidentally, I have been searching for years under the olde name and apparently someone reissued it under this name!  Please don&#x27;t change the name again so I can find it again without the big time lapse!</li>
            <li> Smell stays only for an hour or so :( . Smell is decent. They should come up with upgraded version of this cologne.</li>
            <li> not strong enough for me</li>
            <li> Gave to my father for his birthday, he absolutely loves it.  The cologne will linger for hours, not like other colognes where after an hour you don&#x27;t smell it on you anymore.</li>
            <li> The reason to choose this fragrance was that I have been using Yatch Man Blue for quite a some time now and I am very much satisfied so after reading other reviews here on Amazon I decided to go for the Red version this time as this was described as even better in terms of long lasting fragrance. But spoilers ahead it is nothing as compared to my old one. The fragrance is very mild. I doubt on genuineity but it is sold by Amazon directly so I went for it to ensure that I dont get a fake. But I m fairly disappointed and now the packet is open and used twice so I can&#x27;t return it. Others beware of buying this one.</li>
            <li> my husband says its an ok cologne nothing fancy but good for the price if your not trying to spend a lot</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne along with Paco Rabanne 1 Million. Paco Rabanne 1 million is no longer a top scent, people got tired of it. But, Yacht Man is not a wow scent like Paco... this is not going into my top 20 collections.</li>
            <li> I luv it, I have a bit of tough demeanor along with confidence so a sweet aroma works great.  I bought it honestly because I was curious &amp; needed a few extra dollars to get free shipping for the other item I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am especially happy that I ordered this on a Tuesday afternoon &amp; received it on Thursday (I hate waiting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is great &amp; I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> MINE ROOMMATE LOVE THE FRAGRANCE  DO PLESE SEND MORE SAMPLE PLEASE AT 7423 ROXYE LANE SARASOTA FL 34240  THANKS</li>
            <li> I got this thinking I&#x27;ll be a good fragrance and it was not at all on top of that the bottle was broken</li>
            <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last very long on the body.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy cologne without knowing what the scent is like but here lately I have bought three.This one smells great to me and reminds me of Musk with a hint of Cedar.It&#x27;s difficult to describe but it&#x27;s a smooth light scent and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE IT.... HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL COMPLIMENTS ON IT.  WOULD REORDER IT AGAIN...GOOD PRICE AND GOOD SMELL..</li>
            <li> Omg pls improve this.smell ?,I will not recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> This cologne smells really good and the overall value is good. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne to get free shipping on another item.  I have been very impressed with the nice fragrance of Yacht Man Red.  It has a nice masculine woodsy smell and lasts pretty much all day.  I have several other colognes but this has become my favorite.. and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent, excellent price. I&#x27;ll be using this cologne for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The little woman seems to like it too!</li>
            <li> This is a real smooth cologne. It&#x27;s an evening fragrance. The scent lasts for up to 12 hours during the night and about 6 hours during the day. No regrets.</li>
            <li> Great.Great smell! The ladies love it too!!!! RJ</li>
            <li> I have tried all Yacht Man cologne and this is my favorite. The others smell pretty much like most other cologne, however this has a sweeter fresher smell.(still masculine) really good price and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have smelled this in a store prior and liked it - it&#x27;s going to be a Christmas-gift like the other colognes.</li>
            <li> Good smelling spicy fragrance, good for summer days. Definitely better than the Yatch Man Grey. Good for casual use only since the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. A good perfume to have to supplement the other killer cologne in your collection</li>
            <li> very nice, excellent value</li>
            <li> Nice smell not stay for long time</li>
            <li> Smells good for the first minute,wears off. Very unfortunate but I gave it to my little nephew since it smells like its from the dollar store</li>
            <li> The original  says by Myrurgia isn&#x27;t the same on these packages, so I assume thats is fake product, no time to return it but not buying again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say it. I just love it. recommend it to anyone who like good things.</li>
            <li> i never buy my fragances without trying them but i took the risk since the price was so cheap... the fragance is ok... not bad... but not that good... also i feel it wears out very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend only if you want to run the risk and because of the cheap price</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Red was a pleasant surprise. Not being able to smell the product made me uneasy but when it arrived, I fell in love! I have already ordered three more bottles from the same family of cologne to try them all!</li>
            <li> Bought this to cover up for free super saver shipping for Perry Ellis i purchased and its smells like crap. Pungent, cheap alcoholic smell will drive u crazy. Stay out of it. Thats why they u get what u pay for !!</li>
            <li> Yacht Man Red&lt;br /&gt;I love this cologne</li>
            <li> To much of alcohol But it last Long</li>
            <li> smells gross! nauseating. got what I paid for, poor quality</li>
            <li> There is a reason this cologne is so cheap.  It smells AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably going to end up tossing it in the trash eventually.  It gets one star because I do like the cap design (I&#x27;m always losing the caps to my other colognes) and I can&#x27;t give less than a one star rating.</li>
            <li> Not a great one but for the money you pay you will be happy. Its good for the daily use.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell, but my least favorite of the four Yacht Man colognes I tried.  I bought Red, Black, Metal and Blue, and this one is my least favorite.  Pluses are:  sweet scent, does last a fairly long time, don&#x27;t need to drench myself in it, inexpensive.  Probably would be ok to go to a dance club or someplace where lighter and fruitier colognes mix in well.  Too fruity for my tastes, though, in the situations I wear it in - work, upper-scale restaurants, sporting events.  Give it a shot if you like the lighter, fruitier type of cologne; certainly worth $10 to try it out.  Just not my fave.</li>
            <li> I had nothing but great comments from people when I warn this version. It&#x27;s a excellent scent, one of the best out of the bunch from this maker. It&#x27;s a bit strong at first but you don&#x27;t need to apply that much. Must let it dry on the skin. This one smell nice on clothing too but it fades. Too much will cause people to stare so DO NOT apply too much, it would be an over kill.</li>
            <li> Took a chance on this low price line of Eau De Toilette items by Myrurgia.  Tried the red first and absolutely loved the frangrance and its longevity.  I then purchased the blue and silver.  Like all three but the red and silver our my favorites.  Will be purchasing the brown soon.  I really prefer the woody musk smells in cologne such as Polo Black, Power, etc.... however the Yacht Man line has added to my collection and you just can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Good smell but it is gone very fast.... better  bring the bottle around!!! it would be handy...something long lasting is better than this</li>
            <li> Got here pretty quick and as advertised. The only thing i didnt like was that the cologne doesnt last. It usually last about 30 minutes at most, but i am going to use it for my car instead. This is not the sellers fault..they only sell it. It was a great deal and i might buy some for my little cousins that want to show off to their friends.</li>
            <li> This spray is obviously a fake as it only lasts a few hours. My husband had one already which was nearly finishing and u could tell the difference...</li>
            <li> The product smells wonderful and the price is magnificent. The lid is a little difficult to open at times but that is minor compared to the smell and value.</li>
            <li> I love types of colognes....but this one iam still not sure about</li>
            <li> This is a little strong for my liking. It has a strong scent that I can&#x27;t describe, but it is not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> Smells great, I use it everyday but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last for a long time. Haven&#x27;t got any compliments so I guess it is not the best fragrance one.</li>
            <li> NOW LET ME GIVE CREDIT WHERE IT&#x27;S DUE. THIS THE YACHT MAN COLOGNE I LOVE A LOT AND RECEIVED MANY WONDERFUL COMMENTS ABOUT THE SCENT. AND THE FRAGRANCE LASTS WAY LONGER THAN 3HRS. CARRYING ME THROUGH THE DAY SMELLING GREAT FOR A FULL 8 HRS. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling indeed. I love it. Lasts very long.</li>
            <li> Interesting. Maybe a little too Christmas-y.</li>
            <li> purchased for my hubby and he loves the scent, not too strong and not too light just in between</li>
            <li> Powerful smell for the money. Smells secy on men !!</li>
            <li> Nice product, not as long lasting as I might like but a nice fragrance. Good price, but wish it held up for a longer time.</li>
            <li> Exquisite fragrance , arrived in time to give, beautiful presentation</li>
            <li> Great merchandise and fast delivery.. Already brought 5 of them..</li>
            <li> this is a very mild scent, it wears off quickly but the price was right so I might buy it again, not too spectacular though</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS COLOGNE  IS MADE MOST OF ALCOHOL SCENT DOES NOT LAST&lt;br /&gt;  ITS REALLY  UNFORTUNATE HOW THIS SCAN IS NOT CONTROLLED BY AMAZON THIS IS THE SAME  TYPE OF COLOGNES YOU GET FROM THE PERSONS IN THE STREET</li>
            <li> It has a friuty sweet scent that last for hours,,better that most high dollar colognes,I highly recommend this cologne...again the scent does not wear off quickly</li>
            <li> Well, \\&quot;the picture looks good\\&quot; is all that I can say.  This product was a waste of time, even now to write this review.  The smell is embarrassing to ware and it has a scratchy, sharp and dying sent. I cannot and will not recommend this to anyone but, \\&quot;the picture looks good.</li>
            <li> i purchased this blindly for my husband. loved the price about $6 i think! i was hoping it smelled good and it did. he even liked it! yay it is a sweet smell</li>
            <li> I THREW THIS IN THE GABAGE THE FIRST DAY IT SMELL GOOD BUT LAST 30 MINS I WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> To be honest, I had never tried any Yacht Man products.  I always browse through the mens cologne section mostly to see the prices on my favorites.  This line of colognes kept intriguing me with their crazily mixed reviews.  I usually by Chanel or Givenchy but I thought what the heck, I&#x27;ll give the Red a try. It was so inexpensive and I don&#x27;t know why.  It&#x27;s fragrance is much greater and longer lasting than most colognes 4 times the cost.  It has a very pleasant aroma, the second I smelled it I knew this should be a much pricier cologne.  It smells very sophisticated and it is very long lasting, lasts longer than some of the top brands.  I only put one spritz and got compliments all day long, glad I didn&#x27;t spray more on myself.  I love this cologne and will use it in the mix with my favorites.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh scent for daytime especially. Not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Very nice spray on&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance</li>
            <li> Normal and cheap serve for everyday. Not in order to go out with any pretty girl perfume soft.</li>
            <li> I like the scent. It&#x27;s very light and soft. Not too overwhelming. Something men can wear without offending people around them. Makes for a nice gift.</li>
            <li> Smells so good on my husband and with a tight income with expensive taste....this met our needs. SUPER CHEAP PRICE AND COMES QUICK!!!</li>
            <li> it only stay on you for 5 mins,Is different from the ones sold in shops.i anti gonna buy this product online</li>
            <li> This is a nice fragrance and for a reasonable price. Reminds me of Joop a little. Scent lingers all day.</li>
            <li> I ordered the YM black which basically had no scent besides a hint of bug spray but the Red smells pretty good.  The scent, however, doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I will spend more on name brands next time.</li>
            <li> Great perfume for such a less price and very good to even gift someone on any occasion. I recommend to buy someone who has budget constraint.</li>
            <li> Smells great and last about 7-8 hours. I have 5-Cuba scents, Polo Red, 2-Nautica scents, True Religion, and 2-Yacht Man scents. I would place Yacht Man Red up there with the rest. I have received compliments every time I spray the scent on.</li>
            <li> This is fake perfume small doesn&#x27;t stay long don&#x27;t spend your money</li>
            <li> Good smell but definitely a more sweet aroma, it lasts for awhile. I wear it a couple times a week but prefer a more masculine smell. It&#x27;s a lot for a good price and overall a good product, I would recommend it to anyone who likes a sweet smelling cologne. I also received chap stick and a cologne sample from the seller which was a nice bonus. I&#x27;m gonna try out blue next. Easy 5 stars from me!</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 days ago and it came today, very fast delivery. no serial code was tampered with, box was perfect condition. I sprayed 1 squirt of this and I loved it. My mother also loved it, it has a nice manly smell and i must say, for this price we are robbing the people who made this.lol Great product, i recommend this to all. And what a coincidence, I ordered nautica blue and it came today as well with this. Both wonderful scents, not to overpowering. My burberry and Joop should be here tomorrow i hope, those colognes are more over the top. this fragrance is what i call \\&quot;something lite\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought two of these basically not knowing how it would smell.One for my dad and one for my boyfriend,they bothh loved it.When i took the smell of it i started regretting why i didn&#x27;t buy myself one to.Honestly this thing deserves more than 5 stars</li>
            <li> This came fast (just like your husband) and smells pretty good. It&#x27;s a strong scent that lasts a long time. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> to ya&#x27;ll  guys out there, I recommend this product for date nights, class and work only.</li>
            <li> I order this item as a 3part father&#x27;s day gift for my fiancee. Out of 3 this was his favorite then Yacht man Blue and then Nautical Silver. This really smells nice on him. Thanks Amazon for the great price and quality of this item!</li>
            <li> very good. excellent.</li>
            <li> I purchased both Red and Blue. They both smell really good Blue being my favorite. My biggest conplaint is that the scents don&#x27;t last that long amd you kinda have to douse yoyourself with it to make it apparent. Other than that they smell fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd cologne from them and I have loved them all,  it even last pretty long for such a less expensive fragrance  thank you for another great product</li>
            <li> Great Product, Cute Bottle, Kinda reminds me JOOP, which I use to have every once in awhile!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and in great Shape!!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very rich in the first 30 minutes but then is lost, although the cost is worth it. I sweat a lot and maybe this affects ...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gift for my dad and found this to be cheaper than other perfumes. Initially, I was a bit hesitant because I never used this brand and neither has my dad but after I received them on time, I must say the perfume smells great. It&#x27;s long lasting and for such a big bottle at such low costs, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> Like this cologne..very nice...</li>
            <li> I always try to get things he needs..shorts, pants, shoes, etc and he never likes the style or something but he liked the cologne..guess that&#x27;s why cologne is often given as gifts</li>
            <li> Not for me, too strong. Think Opium like back in the day.</li>
            <li> it is strong and last long thats what i needed...! a b c d e f g h i  j k l m n o</li>
            <li> The formula smells remarkably like Dunhill Red. The smell is  absolutely indistinguishable from Dunhill Red. You could spray one on each wrist and not know which is which. Maybe the sillage is a bit more pronounced on the Dunhill - or maybe that&#x27;s just my imagination given that the Dunhill fragrance is seven or eight times as expensive. The longevity is pretty poor on both but if you put it on cloth, it lasts a lot longer than on skin, although it&#x27;s more abrasive. Still, this is a nice romantic fragrance, great to take your wife to a nice meal. Cinnamon, ambergris, maybe some artificial attempt at sandalwood. Obviously these are not natural fragrances like a Creed or a Montale. But this is a nice, solid fragrance and when you can have a 100ml bottle like this for less than $10, given its virtually identical competitors, you have a win. If you like Dunhill Red, you&#x27;ll like Yacht Man Red. Good chance is it&#x27;s the exact same formula, same stuff in a different bottle. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Decided to try this fragrance and I must admit it has convinced me. It has a subtle smell that isnt too over powering or overbearing. Also the bottle is quite cute</li>
            <li> Love the fragarance. It does seem to lose its potency when dry but if you end up sweating it will kick back up leaving you smelling good and not like a pig. Yacht Man Metal is my favorite. I did not purchase it from Amazon btw.</li>
            <li> great product, prompt delivery</li>
            <li> Is cheap; smells cheap. Spend a few more dollars and get something better.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a fruit scent smell which is very sweet.. It&#x27;s a good perfume for the price.. Smells good and lasts long!!!</li>
            <li> I need to reapply every 2 hours or so because it wears out in that time. Some buyers think it is fake product but I can&#x27;t attest to that because this is my first time buying it. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> The smell is very nice and lasts for quite some time</li>
            <li> this kindof reminds me of the mall. a new scent mixed with some other notes you just cant put your finger on. it  isnt at the top of my list although its good for a night out with your partner.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell all that bad. I didn&#x27;t want a spray cap to I tried to break it off and make a splash. However it shattered all over my carpet. I can still smell it 2 years later. Surprisingly having cologne scented carpet has its advantages. Anyway It actually isn&#x27;t bad if your looking for something cheap.</li>
            <li> I love this Spray, smell good</li>
            <li> is good, but you receive that you pay ,very good service, thanks</li>
            <li> What a great smell first off, second it is such a nice bottle. I love when my guy sprays himself with this smell, makes me want to be closer to him. I give this one 5 stars. I like how fast it was delievered to our doorstep too, great service. All you ladies, you need to get your man one of these bottles (or two of them) you will not regret it! &amp;#34;I promise&amp;#34;, you that once your guy sprays himself you will want to pull him near you and you will not be able to get enough of him/well the smell on him at least, &amp;#34;winks&amp;#34;. Enjoyable smell is all I got to say.</li>
            <li> I have the metal, black, blue, chocolate, and red yacht man colognes.  This one is by far my favorite of all of them. It has the most long lasting, best smell . I would definately recommend this.</li>
            <li> I like this product especially its design. I was expecting it to have little more intense odor though. If you want to have intense odor, you&#x27;ll have to put more quantity which is why it is 3.4 oz I guess.</li>
            <li> i like it, use every day</li>
            <li> Boyfriend love this one better than the Yacht Man Blue. He wore it on Christmas and the day after, the day after that and ..dyou get the drift. Yes he SEVERAL fragrances to choose from already but this one was his choice.</li>
            <li> Great product recommend</li>
            <li> Nice aroma but must be renewed every 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells like my grandmother.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who isn&#x27;t over the age of 60</li>
            <li> I didnt like them so i sold them and the persons that bought them do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over what a good deal this cologne is! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but it has ended up being one of my favorites of all my husband&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> excellent product I love</li>
            <li> ..complex...appealing...like how it smells to me...that&#x27;s what matters..</li>
            <li> Smells great! My husband loved it.</li>
            <li> OK but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> This cologne is light and smells nice, but it is just too light and airy.  It&#x27;s a pleasant fragrance and I like it and it does change scents after a few minutes, but it just doesn&#x27;t last long enough.  An hour after wearing this spray, you can&#x27;t remember if you are wearing any cologne or not.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a cologne this price.  Unfortunately, the product did not surprise me.  I have to admit that the smell is great.  I really like the smell.  However, I sprayed a few times and less than an hour later, I could no longer smell the aroma.  It is very rare that I rate a product so low; however, I feel this one does deserve it.  I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> *It has a nice scent to it. Looked at reviews and description first. It&#x27;s very manly and strong. My first time using this and it seems like it would be good to use to go out or just to wear at night*</li>
            <li> otimo product I recommend.</li>
            <li> OK, so it was $6.60, so why even complain right? Well the only reason is because this had less fragrance than clorinated water. Seriously, the fragrance disappeared within 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money it&#x27;s fragrance for man excellent</li>
            <li> The red color looks pretty, but I sure couldn&#x27;t tell you what this stuff smells like...  It&#x27;s not pleasant -- it&#x27;s not bad.  Maybe it&#x27;s designed to kill existing bad smells -- like Fresh Scent.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try the blue color next time.</li>
            <li> This fragrance was more than expected, You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price at all, The product arrives faster than expected</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and it was what I expected</li>
            <li> this stuff smells horrible if you&#x27;re a young man....this product should ONLY BE WORN BY MEN IN THEIR 50s and older</li>
            <li> 2 stars cause my other half  don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> This was absolutely the nastiest smell cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled in my life!</li>
            <li> smelled good  fast shipping</li>
            <li> Better then blue version, but my wife think otherwise :-) This one has a different smell. Somewhat reminds red perry ellis. Seem to last a bit longer than the blue version. Again it is an OK cologne, not great..</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding cologne for like 5 bucks! cmon u dont gotta spend like 50 bucks when u have this perfectly fine cologne! a tad strong but great because i needed something inexpensive in my collection and bought this! It smells so good! neatly packaged and ships on time! This colonge is sweet more of a night time cologne. Also recccccomenddddd yatch mannn blueeeeeeeeee which isss even betterrrrr (im adding more letters to each word to exaggerate the smell!) It smells so good gotten so much compliments!</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance and my husband is on his 3rd bottle.  Long lasting and a great price. Try it</li>
            <li> THIS ONE WAS FOR MY MY GRANDSON, HE LOVES IT. iT MAKES HIM FEEL ALL GROWN UP.One more thing he loves the top.</li>
            <li> Great stuff was highly surprised just ordered it out of the blue and I was nicely surprised</li>
            <li> Comprenlo es Super Buena</li>
            <li> Gross&lt;br /&gt;I collect colognes and I gave this away to somebody I did t like&lt;br /&gt;Super powerful and stayed all day</li>
            <li> I recommend it very good, it came very well protected and in perfect condition, also smells great. Recommended thank you very much.</li>
            <li> The scent is very sweet and floral. I can only tell you that it smells like a bar of imported facial soap for women. The scent is very strong and lasts for a few hours. I didn&#x27;t want to give it to any older female relative I know because they might feel that they have to wear it when I visit them. Couldn&#x27;t have that, and I didn&#x27;t want to use it as a room spray - the scent is that annoying.  So before tossing it, I mixed some of it with some of my older colognes. One part Yacht Man to 3 parts of Halston, and another mix with Drakkar Noir ended up with some very nice scents. Probably better than just wasting it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay not so great, the regular version of the Yacht Man, the one comes in silver bottle is much better than this one.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so light as to be almost nonexistent. Morevover, what fragrance there is does not seem to last very long at all.  I paid only $5.84 or so for this, which seems as though it should be a bargain; instead, I feel as though I wasted my money.  I cannot recommend Yacht Man Red.</li>
            <li> This smells great, it has a sweet smell and after a few hours it has a slight vanilla smell, but its a great product for the price</li>
            <li> i bought both sens and i love them both for the price you just cant go wrong when i need more i know where to get it thanks</li>
            <li> Ill never ever purchase cologne from amazon.com in life again. The cologne i purchased was watered down and not original at all. When i would spray it on me the fragrance would dissappear after 10 min?!!!.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people spend 80-100 bucks on colognes when you can get something like this for so cheap!! I am a first time customer and I had my doubts before purchasing a brand I haven&#x27;t heard, but rest assured I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED. I usually put this on while going out because its a tad strong, but I like that!! Great value for money. I am excited to try some of their other offerings.</li>
