    <ol>
            <li>and i find it the best lube.</li>
            <li>Best in the biz.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Best lube EVER!!!</li>
            <li>It also makes wonderful massage oil.</li>
            <li>Great product, though pricey.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>I know most places say water based is best,</li>
            <li>Yo this s***s awesome:)</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff that has super glide</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I found this deal!</li>
            <li>but we&#x27;ll never switch from this sure lube!</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these 250 ml bottles for years, absolutely my favorite lube, and I will be buying another bottle when I run out.  </li>
            <li>Love this lube.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, we&#x27;ve been using this brand for over 10 years and it is by far the silkiest and smoothest lube.</li>
            <li>And the package arrived to Shanghai so quickly.</li>
            <li>If you get it on your hands and decide to go to sleep rather than having a marathon bathroom scrub-everything session, you&#x27;ll wake up with your hands soft and moisturized. :-)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m putting some medical tape around the cap and bottle to help gripping when closing the bottle, but still a pain to dispense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First use, could not put the cap back on, as its a smooth plastic bottle and cap.  </li>
            <li>Very overpriced,  </li>
            <li>if you try to dribble it directly on a toy, it tends to run right off, but no biggie.</li>
            <li>Hard to clean off of them.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Hard to clean off of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky at all, doesn&#x27;t dry up, doesn&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li> Pjur does not dry out and stays slick all night long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stain sheets or clothes and a little goes a very long way!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, but hate the dispenser choice.  </li>
            <li> is it&#x27;s definitely on the thin side, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the packaging is absolutely the worst possible container for this product short of a Ziploc bag.  </li>
            <li> Very little is needed and it works spectacularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No better product on the market.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re sloppy like we are it will get on everything- headboard, nightstand.</li>
            <li> A squirt bottle design might work for a small bottle, but at this size it is, well, bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And even for the difficult packaging, I&#x27;m still giving it five stars!</li>
            <li> Too bad the price keeps flectuating</li>

            <li> Been using this lube for years and i find it the best lube. Too bad the price keeps flectuating and it has gone back up. Very overpriced,  so I&#x27;m glad I found this deal!</li>

            <li> OMG!!! Best lube EVER!!! This stuff is amazing, we&#x27;ve been using this brand for over 10 years and it is by far the silkiest and smoothest lube. I buy it for all my friends as wedding gifts. It also makes wonderful massage oil. Doesn&#x27;t stain sheets or clothes and a little goes a very long way!! We use it several times and week and a 250ml bottle will last us 6 months. You will not regret buying this!!</li>

            <li> Very nice. And the package arrived to Shanghai so quickly.</li>
