    <ol>
            <li>Great set...great quality!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the quality, though.</li>
            <li>This is great!  </li>
            <li>Everything is wonderful quality.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect starter kit for petite women; my wife loved it.  </li>
            <li>Great for travel and the implements are well organized in the case.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice, compact manicure kit.  </li>
            <li>They seem to be very nice.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for travel when you snag a nail and more.  </li>
            <li>The boys love having their very own grooming sets!  </li>
            <li>I selected this set because of the manufacturer&#x27;s good reputation and Solingen didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>It does not have all the tools for a full manicure, but if fits nicely  in your bag or pocket and is a great help when you are out and about.</li>
            <li>By far the best mens mani pedi kit I&#x27;ve ever seen, get it and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, my husband is very happy with his new nail kit.</li>
            <li>But the price is a bit high for something where I&#x27;m only happy with one of 5 items, so I&#x27;ll return this.</li>
            <li>Worth the money you spend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice mens set, especially for travellers.</li>
            <li>Good quality and sharp.</li>
            <li>This is a great set for travel because it is so small</li>
            <li>I clipped my fingernails and toenails and without incident, but if you&#x27;re interested in this product, I&#x27;d suggest buying it ASAP before some activist group pushes for a ban.</li>
            <li>The tweezers grab really well.</li>
            <li>The actual implements were made in Germany not China and the case that holds them is genuine leather.  </li>
            <li>The price was quite reasonable, too.</li>
            <li>This one met the criteria and is real leather.  </li>
            <li>Leather case is ok, not perfect, but for that price point, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Make sure to tune into the product dimensions - it was smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>The clippers are okay, I found they take a lot of force due to the short arm of the lever.</li>
            <li>Large structured women might light the instruments a bit small.</li>
            <li>The scissors are sharp, but they really are cuticle scissors (forget about cutting/trimming nails); I should have read the product description more carefully there.</li>
            <li>The case is very sturdy and really rather small, considering how much is packed into it.</li>
            <li>They are old enough to have become interested in personal grooming.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned about the small size of the scissors, but it is strong enough.</li>
            <li>The stainless steel tools feel and perform as well-made as expected.  </li>
            <li>It is a full step above the sort of small sets one sees on sale in big box stores.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely refused anything that was less than manly.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Fits tightly into dopp kit without taking up excess space.</li>
            <li> The nail file is disappointing in that both sides are very rough -- the finer side of this one is like the rougher one on my old one.</li>

            <li> Perfect for travel when you snag a nail and more.  Good quality and sharp.</li>
            <li> The tweezers grab really well. the case isn&#x27;t flimsy. The tools are sharp and work well. Worth the money you spend.</li>
            <li> Great set...great quality!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, my husband is very happy with his new nail kit.</li>
            <li> This is your basic kit.  Bought it for my teen son who was always losing my tweezers and nail clippers.  He absolutely refused anything that was less than manly.  The case is very sturdy and really rather small, considering how much is packed into it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice mens set, especially for travellers. Leather case is ok, not perfect, but for that price point, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the tweezers, and to replace my aging current kit (also German-made). I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the quality, though. The scissors are sharp, but they really are cuticle scissors (forget about cutting/trimming nails); I should have read the product description more carefully there. The clippers are okay, I found they take a lot of force due to the short arm of the lever. The nail file is disappointing in that both sides are very rough -- the finer side of this one is like the rougher one on my old one. No complaints on the tweezers. But the price is a bit high for something where I&#x27;m only happy with one of 5 items, so I&#x27;ll return this.</li>
            <li> Smaller tools than expected. Bought these for the glove compartment.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, compact manicure kit.  The tools are well made and, as one would expect from German craftsmanship, the blades are sharp and sturdy.  It is a full step above the sort of small sets one sees on sale in big box stores.  It does not have all the tools for a full manicure, but if fits nicely  in your bag or pocket and is a great help when you are out and about.</li>

            <li> This is great!  Bought from Three Swords because I have only heard good things about it, and have not been disappointed.  Everything is wonderful quality. This is a great set for travel because it is so small and I can throw it in my bag when I leave for the weekend.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the small size of the scissors, but it is strong enough. I selected this set because of the manufacturer&#x27;s good reputation and Solingen didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Ordered it to go in my purse...love it. Everything is sharp and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these kits for my grandsons.  They are old enough to have become interested in personal grooming.  I also wanted a quality product; one that would last them for a while.  The actual implements were made in Germany not China and the case that holds them is genuine leather.  They seem to be very nice.  The boys love having their very own grooming sets!  The price was quite reasonable, too.</li>
            <li> By far the best mens mani pedi kit I&#x27;ve ever seen, get it and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Was needing a man&#x27;s manicure set for travel purposes and specifically was looking for a compact frameless case with a zipper closure.  This one met the criteria and is real leather.  The stainless steel tools feel and perform as well-made as expected.  Fits tightly into dopp kit without taking up excess space.</li>
