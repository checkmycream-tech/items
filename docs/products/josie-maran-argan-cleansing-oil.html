            <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li>I love Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil and decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers across all price ranges that have never taken care of my combination skin.</li>
            <li>I recently saw alot of wonderful \\&quot;real\\&quot; reviews on another website that I trust that sells Josie Maran and decided to try it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>but I am enjoying this cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is not like the authentic Josie Maran sample I received from her company.</li>
            <li>and I agree it takes a bit more to take off eye makeup, but there is always eye makeup remover for the that job.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I read the reviews before using, because the consistency of the cleanser is puzzling.</li>
            <li>Love the honey-like texture, and it leaves my skin feeling like...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just one more example of over priced cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>Shu is ok, but I find it drying, and it is *expensive*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you start to lather it falls off your face before your face is even clean!</li>
            <li>The travel version I tried before was easy to apply and removed all of my makeup - including waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>It also has a strong perfume which is quite overpowering.</li>
            <li>this cleanser is hands down the best cleanser I have use .</li>
            <li>I have a very dry skin and by using this product it has help my skin with my dryness a very good cleansing</li>
            <li>And a HUGE dislike - do not get this on your lips at all...</li>
            <li>I picked it up from Sephora a few weeks ago, and it is perfect for my fair, sensitive, combination skin.  </li>
            <li>It warms on your skin and leaves you feeling hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>I received a free trial of this from a sephora.com order.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>Light orange scent</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product.</li>
            <li>I was all excited to buy this product.  </li>
            <li>I always wanted a squeaky clean feeling after washing my face but never realized I was drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser leaves my skin clean and feeling supple.</li>
            <li>But when you follow directions, you will be rewarded with clean, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>I follow it up with a soap and my face is squeaky clean everytime.</li>
            <li>face feels clean and soft...highly recommend</li>
            <li>It was an issue of.. how is this oil going to clean my face.</li>
            <li>I do not like the way it rinses off leaving my skin squeaky clean (like using bar-soap)</li>
            <li>Then you can rinse it off with warm water and/or use the oil cleansing method of steaming/wiping gently with a hot towel.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and feels amazing for hours afterwards, and even my waterproof mascara is gone.</li>
            <li>I normally have some redness that I&#x27;ve always attributed to my fair skin and a ruddy complexion, but this cleanser helps minimize the redness and leaves my skin incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>I have fair and slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li>With sensitive skin and mild acne, I have tried many products to help maintain my skins moisture AND heal acne.</li>
            <li>best way to use it is to wet your face and hands slightly, and spread it out on your hands slightly to warm it up, THEN spread it on your face, massaging gently for 30 seconds or so.  </li>
            <li>I am 53, and my skin has never felt softer from using this amazing facial cleanser!  </li>
            <li>Personally, I like to start my shower to get the water warm, use this product, and then hop in the shower and rinse off once I&#x27;ve adjusted the temperature.  </li>
            <li>It is pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is something addictive about this cleanser--it just feels so nice.</li>
            <li>While I read all the reviews, it seemed like a fabulous product and seemed to work on many different faces.  </li>
            <li>I gave used this product for some time with very positive results for my combination skin.  </li>
            <li>The only positive about it is that it has a nice citrus scent.</li>
            <li>Kept oily shine at bay , removed waterproof eye make-up easily and made my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>tried this product because I was tired of stripping my skin and wanted to find a paraban free, gmo free, free free free product and came up with the Josie Maran line.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for cleansing my back with a clarisonic- left my skin feeling very clean and not dry at all.</li>
            <li>The oil is very, very sticky and does not spread easily.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love the fact that is all natural, not tested on animals and contains no chemicals, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I tried the travel version (bought from Sephora) first just to try it out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Josie Maran and love her 100% Argan oil.</li>
            <li>At first, I was hesitant.</li>
            <li>Thanks Josie!</li>
            <li>I have dry/combo skin with very few breakouts but definitely congestion and this cleansing oil works great!  </li>
            <li>skin so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I follow with Dr. Perricone toner and Josie&#x27;s pure argan oil on my eyelids, lips, and cuticles.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered the large bottle.  </li>
            <li>I recommend all Josie&#x27;s products for care and cleansing, and Bare Minerals original foundation and color products.</li>
            <li>I love that she donates proceeds to help polar bears and</li>
            <li>I massage the cleansing oil into my skin with a wee bit of water really concentrating on areas with large or clogged pores</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this so much.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look dewey and fresh and is not harsh for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>has really improved the quality of my complexion.</li>
            <li>This wash is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take much to cleanse my skin</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need to spend so much money on a cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li>There are other, better, lower price alternatives.  </li>
            <li>I have mature skin that mostly on the dry side</li>
            <li>A small amt is all that&#x27;s needed with alittle water and it becomes a warm and creamy texture.</li>
            <li>I had a small sample of this and liked it</li>
            <li>I use a Clarisonic most of the time, but on the odd occasion when I can&#x27;t use it, a washcloth works just as well.</li>
            <li>seems odd to use oil to clean your face with, but this leaves my skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY discourage you from using this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anyone would say I have bad skin, but no one says I have great skin either- until now!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle and leaves my skin so soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without the it, the sunscreen AND the argan oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, for the same money (or less), try DHC (original or Mild touch), Origins, or Kose Softymo.</li>
            <li>I tried less to conserve the product but found that it wasn&#x27;t easy to spread over my face.</li>
            <li>The oil I received from this company is much thicker and a much darker color...not the same consistency as the one I got in Sephora.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser is soothing without causing any irritation.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased a smaller Josie Maran set that included the cleansing oil, the argan oil, and daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My face stays so soft and moist for 24 hours ata atime!</li>
            <li>In the past this cleaner was more of an oil based consistency.</li>
            <li>I have always suffered from occasional breakouts and new products on my skin just reeked havoc!!</li>
            <li>Might as well just buy directly from Sephora and pay the extra $5 for the real thing.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels ridiculously soft after one use.</li>
            <li>Believe me I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how well it takes off my makeup (except for mascara, so I just used a separate eye makeup remover).  </li>
            <li>so I suggest you order this directly from Sephora or Josie Maran&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>This takes off makeup fairly well, not great, but it smells delish!</li>
            <li>Very definitely lifts oil and leaves pores clear and skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser but do not love the pump bottle because after a few pumps the pump lid allows the product to leak out all over the place which is very wasteful and messy:/</li>
            <li>Squirts out more than I want it to when I press the pump and is then very hard to rub in on</li>
            <li>I like this oil for cleaning - it lasts a long time as it doesn&#x27;t take much for daily use</li>
            <li>It has a rough slip to it so it does not glide gently on your face.</li>
            <li>This oil smells heavenly and it is so rich and moisturizing, it also works very well in removing the difficult and sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>I have very oily t-zone due to oily Rosacea, but dry to normal elsewhere.</li>
            <li>2-3 pumps is barely a teaspoon worth of product, so figure you&#x27;ll get at least 1.5 months out of it, more if you use it every other day or every few days.  </li>
            <li>but i will not to buy it again is nothing spectacular and in expensive to wait for future result</li>
            <li>It takes care of the dry spot above my nose while also balancing out my normally oily chin.  </li>

            <li> With sensitive skin and mild acne, I have tried many products to help maintain my skins moisture AND heal acne.</li>
            <li> best way to use it is to wet your face and hands slightly, and spread it out on your hands slightly to warm it up, THEN spread it on your face, massaging gently for 30 seconds or so.  </li>
            <li> I am 53, and my skin has never felt softer from using this amazing facial cleanser!  </li>
            <li> Personally, I like to start my shower to get the water warm, use this product, and then hop in the shower and rinse off once I&#x27;ve adjusted the temperature.  </li>
            <li> It is pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is something addictive about this cleanser--it just feels so nice.</li>
            <li> While I read all the reviews, it seemed like a fabulous product and seemed to work on many different faces.  </li>
            <li> I gave used this product for some time with very positive results for my combination skin.  </li>
            <li> The only positive about it is that it has a nice citrus scent.</li>
            <li> Kept oily shine at bay , removed waterproof eye make-up easily and made my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> tried this product because I was tired of stripping my skin and wanted to find a paraban free, gmo free, free free free product and came up with the Josie Maran line.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for cleansing my back with a clarisonic- left my skin feeling very clean and not dry at all.</li>
            <li> The oil is very, very sticky and does not spread easily.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love the fact that is all natural, not tested on animals and contains no chemicals, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried the travel version (bought from Sephora) first just to try it out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Josie Maran and love her 100% Argan oil.</li>
            <li> At first, I was hesitant.</li>
            <li> Thanks Josie!</li>
            <li> I have dry/combo skin with very few breakouts but definitely congestion and this cleansing oil works great!  </li>
            <li> skin so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I follow with Dr. Perricone toner and Josie&#x27;s pure argan oil on my eyelids, lips, and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered the large bottle.  </li>
            <li> I recommend all Josie&#x27;s products for care and cleansing, and Bare Minerals original foundation and color products.</li>
            <li> I love that she donates proceeds to help polar bears and</li>
            <li> I massage the cleansing oil into my skin with a wee bit of water really concentrating on areas with large or clogged pores</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this so much.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look dewey and fresh and is not harsh for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> has really improved the quality of my complexion.</li>
            <li> This wash is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take much to cleanse my skin</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to spend so much money on a cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li> There are other, better, lower price alternatives.  </li>
            <li> I have mature skin that mostly on the dry side</li>
            <li> A small amt is all that&#x27;s needed with alittle water and it becomes a warm and creamy texture.</li>
            <li> I had a small sample of this and liked it</li>
            <li> I use a Clarisonic most of the time, but on the odd occasion when I can&#x27;t use it, a washcloth works just as well.</li>
            <li> seems odd to use oil to clean your face with, but this leaves my skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY discourage you from using this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone would say I have bad skin, but no one says I have great skin either- until now!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle and leaves my skin so soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without the it, the sunscreen AND the argan oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, for the same money (or less), try DHC (original or Mild touch), Origins, or Kose Softymo.</li>
            <li> I tried less to conserve the product but found that it wasn&#x27;t easy to spread over my face.</li>
            <li> The oil I received from this company is much thicker and a much darker color...not the same consistency as the one I got in Sephora.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser is soothing without causing any irritation.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a smaller Josie Maran set that included the cleansing oil, the argan oil, and daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My face stays so soft and moist for 24 hours ata atime!</li>
            <li> In the past this cleaner was more of an oil based consistency.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from occasional breakouts and new products on my skin just reeked havoc!!</li>
            <li> Might as well just buy directly from Sephora and pay the extra $5 for the real thing.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels ridiculously soft after one use.</li>
            <li> Believe me I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how well it takes off my makeup (except for mascara, so I just used a separate eye makeup remover).  </li>
            <li> so I suggest you order this directly from Sephora or Josie Maran&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> This takes off makeup fairly well, not great, but it smells delish!</li>
            <li> Very definitely lifts oil and leaves pores clear and skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser but do not love the pump bottle because after a few pumps the pump lid allows the product to leak out all over the place which is very wasteful and messy:/</li>
            <li> Squirts out more than I want it to when I press the pump and is then very hard to rub in on</li>
            <li> I like this oil for cleaning - it lasts a long time as it doesn&#x27;t take much for daily use</li>
            <li> It has a rough slip to it so it does not glide gently on your face.</li>
            <li> This oil smells heavenly and it is so rich and moisturizing, it also works very well in removing the difficult and sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> I have very oily t-zone due to oily Rosacea, but dry to normal elsewhere.</li>
            <li> 2-3 pumps is barely a teaspoon worth of product, so figure you&#x27;ll get at least 1.5 months out of it, more if you use it every other day or every few days.  </li>
            <li> but i will not to buy it again is nothing spectacular and in expensive to wait for future result</li>
            <li> It takes care of the dry spot above my nose while also balancing out my normally oily chin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is generally on the dry side</li>
            <li> I have already gone through 1 round of antibiotics trying to clear this up and now am starting Retinoid therapy, another antibiotic regime, and clindamycin topical wipes.  </li>
            <li> I am a product whore, in that I never use the same product for too long.</li>
            <li> I use many of Josie&#x27;s products and have never been unhappy with anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> bottle lasts a fairly long time.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle</li>
            <li> and I are going for the long haul.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ll keep using it</li>
            <li> And her argan oil is $45 when you can get pure argan oil in approximately the same size bottle for $12.  </li>
            <li> I like other Josie Maran products and will use the rest of the bottle, but will return to Purity cleansing oil next time.</li>
            <li> squirt 2-3 pumps into your DRY hands and rub on your DRY face.  </li>
            <li> I use two pumps rubbed together in my palms and then rub it onto my DRY face.</li>
            <li> dry skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove my mascara and makes my skin feel really dry.</li>
            <li> I usually used a cetaphil cleanser, but that left me feeling like I still had soap on my back</li>
            <li> When I use it, my face feels rough and dry.  </li>
            <li> You only use a small bit ata a time, so it should last a while, and when i am out, i will purchase it again!  </li>
            <li> Hard to completely rinse off as well...</li>
            <li> You MUST wet your face before applying.</li>
            <li> Then I wet my hands and go over my face again to emulsify the product a bit (it sort of turns white-ish).</li>
            <li> Then I wipe it off with a wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> My skin is excruciatingly dry all during cool to cold weather.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottle may seem small, but it will last awhile.  </li>
            <li> I love all of Josie&#x27;s other products that I purchased, but this on disappointed me.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser works extremely well without drying skin out.</li>
            <li> Of course, this could be genetics, but I am not willing to give up this product to find out.</li>
            <li> and I would need to purchase other items that I have no need for.  </li>
            <li> Cleanses no better than my regular cleanser.</li>
            <li> It has a ph balanced affect on both dry and oily areas and even the pores on my nose which I usually have trouble with are smaller.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
            <li> It is way thick when you put it on your face and feels GROSS!!!</li>
            <li> This oil makes my skin less dry, with no itch, yet it isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t make the shower slick.</li>
            <li> so I just make the body oil and the cleansing oil half to half...</li>
            <li> I also notice that it is less oily.</li>
            <li> You pump it out, and try to rub it on your face and your fingers will move about half an inch, then stick in place because of the oil.  </li>
            <li> While it does cleanse well, it leaves my skin feeling tight afterward, in contrast to what is promises.</li>
            <li> and my face feels tight when it dries.</li>
            <li> I found this out the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;Directions: It says to apply 3-4 pumps on a dry face.</li>
            <li> not clean (which is the intended purpose)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out about this product from a little sample packed Sephora gave me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that I won&#x27;t get the real thing again.</li>
            <li> Wait a few seconds and then rinse.  </li>
            <li> But super-dry, harsh winters wreaked havoc on my skin, year after year, that I was keen to try the JM argan oil.</li>
            <li> Sad I didn&#x27;t listen to the review I saw here in which the lady said this was not the same oil she got from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Usually buy elsewhere</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s going on.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a cleanser that removes my waterproof mascara but won&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is hard to remove off face without tugging.</li>
            <li> The one I bought on Amazon had the consistency of honey - it was really thick and extremely hard to apply to my face</li>
            <li> I just hate going through the whole return process...</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Seriously sticky.</li>
            <li> It is very thick &amp; hard to move around on your skin and did not remove makeup.</li>
            <li> Mixed it with some of my Neutrogena acne control cream wash, &amp; when I do that; it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> I live in a cold area in which when the wind strikes against my face, it feels like knives cutting my skin, but since I have started using this product, I do not feel that the weather affects me so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save your hard earned money for something that works!</li>
            <li> The bottle I just got was very thick and sticky like honey.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gotten much worse.</li>
            <li> Also, if you get it anywhere near your mouth, it tastes awful.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the product was changed or if this was a bad batch</li>
            <li> This is particularly difficult with cleansers, so I was keen to try this product.</li>
            <li> The bottle is unfortunate; mine leaks at the pump mechanism.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product 4 days and have awful sores all over my nose from it.</li>
            <li> This product may be expired or fake.</li>
            <li> Leaves nothing behind!</li>
            <li> a tiny speck of taste in your mouth is very disgusting.  </li>
            <li> I have never in my life broken out as bad as I did using this oil.  </li>
            <li> I have this and am using it now, and I find it very weird to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, but I think I will stick to Sephora for these kinds of purchases.</li>
            <li> I had a really bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Mine acne is so bad (again NEVER had acne</li>
            <li> :( Will not be ordering this again on Amazon</li>
            <li> It did not come with any directions and the packaging was very disappointing as well.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, it will feel horrible and won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Now both sides of my lower face have sticky like flakes that look awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this and will continue to use it.  It&#x27;s so gentle and leaves my skin so soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I like this oil for cleaning - it lasts a long time as it doesn&#x27;t take much for daily use</li>
            <li> Smells great... use with my Clarisonic...skin so clean and soft. Removes all the daily gunk from your skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this product because of my oily skin, but I think it&#x27;s an awesome cleanser! It smells really good and leaves my skin feeling really nice. I have been following this up with the DDF glycolic toner and the josie maran hydrating argan oil stick and it seems to be a winning combination for my oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product. I originally purchased a smaller Josie Maran set that included the cleansing oil, the argan oil, and daily moisturizer. It worked great for cleansing my back with a clarisonic- left my skin feeling very clean and not dry at all. I usually used a cetaphil cleanser, but that left me feeling like I still had soap on my back and it never felt moisturized. This product has been working excellent and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is cheaper on the manufacturer&#x27;s site. I found this out the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;Directions: It says to apply 3-4 pumps on a dry face. Do not do this.  The oil is very, very sticky and does not spread easily.&lt;br /&gt;The best way to use it is to wet your face and hands slightly, and spread it out on your hands slightly to warm it up, THEN spread it on your face, massaging gently for 30 seconds or so.  Then you can rinse it off with warm water and/or use the oil cleansing method of steaming/wiping gently with a hot towel. I follow up with Argan oil (NOW brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;I find the smell pleasant--sort of a citrus-y, orange and grapefruit kind of smell.&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasts a fairly long time.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle yet effective.&lt;br /&gt;It has emulsifiers, which I think helps with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;The price (especially on this site).&lt;br /&gt;If you wear a lot of makeup and/or sunscreen, it may not remove everything. Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> I tried the travel version (bought from Sephora) first just to try it out and I loved it. Ordered this larger version on Amazon and the formula was completely different.  The travel version I tried before was easy to apply and removed all of my makeup - including waterproof mascara.  The one I bought on Amazon had the consistency of honey - it was really thick and extremely hard to apply to my face (it felt like I was pulling my face off). On top of that, it did NOT remove my makeup. This product was returned. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, but I think I will stick to Sephora for these kinds of purchases.</li>
            <li> I was iffy about using an oil as a cleanser, but this stuff is great. My skin feels ridiculously soft after one use. It also has an almost orange smell to it, which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from occasional breakouts and new products on my skin just reeked havoc!! this cleanser is hands down the best cleanser I have use . I always wanted a squeaky clean feeling after washing my face but never realized I was drying out my skin. This cleanser leaves my skin clean and feeling supple. It removes every ounce of makeup including mascara. I use as directed 4 pumps and that is plenty. I tried less to conserve the product but found that it wasn&#x27;t easy to spread over my face. I add water at the end as directed and have had no problems. It does have a bit of a citrus scent which I find nice as well.</li>
            <li> I love love love this cleansing oil. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this so much. You MUST wet your face before applying. If you don&#x27;t, it will feel horrible and won&#x27;t work. But when you follow directions, you will be rewarded with clean, hydrated skin. It does, indeed, remove stubborn eye makeup with no fight. I use a Clarisonic most of the time, but on the odd occasion when I can&#x27;t use it, a washcloth works just as well. All in all, I would recommend this with no reservation. Just for the record, I am 61 and have oily skin. It actually helps control the oil. I didn&#x27;t have any wrinkles when I started using this product, and this cleansing oil has helped me maintain that no wrinkle status. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I picked it up from Sephora a few weeks ago, and it is perfect for my fair, sensitive, combination skin.  I normally have some redness that I&#x27;ve always attributed to my fair skin and a ruddy complexion, but this cleanser helps minimize the redness and leaves my skin incredibly soft.  It takes care of the dry spot above my nose while also balancing out my normally oily chin.  It also has a very pleasant and light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to using this product is following the instructions:  squirt 2-3 pumps into your DRY hands and rub on your DRY face.  Wait a few seconds and then rinse.  Personally, I like to start my shower to get the water warm, use this product, and then hop in the shower and rinse off once I&#x27;ve adjusted the temperature.  You can use it every day, but I tend to use it every couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle may seem small, but it will last awhile.  2-3 pumps is barely a teaspoon worth of product, so figure you&#x27;ll get at least 1.5 months out of it, more if you use it every other day or every few days.  It is pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the packaging, this product is not tested on animals.  It&#x27;s also vegan, and all the packaging is recyclable.</li>
            <li> I have fair and slightly dry skin. I am constantly looking for hydrating products which are non-drying. This is particularly difficult with cleansers, so I was keen to try this product. While it does cleanse well, it leaves my skin feeling tight afterward, in contrast to what is promises. It also has a strong perfume which is quite overpowering. I will be going back to Clinique and Olay Pro-X cleansers.</li>
            <li> this is what I thought I orders when I order the oil, but it was for body so I just make the body oil and the cleansing oil half to half...great</li>
            <li> I have acne and oily skin and I used this with some hesitation. But I loved the way it felt on my skin. I follow it up with a soap and my face is squeaky clean everytime. Believe me I have sensitive skin and I had no problems.</li>
            <li> Its ok but i will not to buy it again is nothing spectacular and in expensive to wait for future result</li>
            <li> I have dry/combo skin with very few breakouts but definitely congestion and this cleansing oil works great!  It makes my skin look dewey and fresh and is not harsh for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the smell.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all. It is very thick &amp; hard to move around on your skin and did not remove makeup. It did not come with any directions and the packaging was very disappointing as well.</li>
            <li> Product is amazing...face feels clean and soft...highly recommend</li>
            <li> This oil smells heavenly and it is so rich and moisturizing, it also works very well in removing the difficult and sensitive eye area. I love the fact that is all natural, not tested on animals and contains no chemicals, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Josie Maran and love her 100% Argan oil. It is hard to find a cleanser that removes my waterproof mascara but won&#x27;t sting my eyes. I was hesitant to try this. My skin is generally on the dry side so it wasn&#x27;t an issue of putting oil on my face. It was an issue of.. how is this oil going to clean my face. Well, it actually does. You have to follow the directions. I use two pumps rubbed together in my palms and then rub it onto my DRY face. Then I wet my hands and go over my face again to emulsify the product a bit (it sort of turns white-ish). Then I wipe it off with a wet washcloth. My skin is soft and feels amazing for hours afterwards, and even my waterproof mascara is gone. Love this product!</li>
            <li> seems odd to use oil to clean your face with, but this leaves my skin clean and soft.  Loving all of Josie&#x27;s argan products.</li>
            <li> Sad I didn&#x27;t listen to the review I saw here in which the lady said this was not the same oil she got from Sephora.

Might as well just buy directly from Sephora and pay the extra $5 for the real thing.  Hard to completely rinse off as well... :( Will not be ordering this again on Amazon cause I&#x27;m afraid that I won&#x27;t get the real thing again. No time to be playing with my face...nah. I do want to add that I absolutely LOVE Josie Maran Argan Cleansing Oil. I just don&#x27;t love this one I received from MMD. SMH</li>
            <li> Usually buy elsewhere but they were out so ordered here.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> There is something addictive about this cleanser--it just feels so nice.Very definitely lifts oil and leaves pores clear and skin very soft. The bottle is unfortunate; mine leaks at the pump mechanism.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I have very sensitive skin . I thought this product would be perfect because of the natural ingredients. I had a really bad reaction.</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> I love all of Josie&#x27;s other products that I purchased, but this on disappointed me.  When I use it, my face feels rough and dry.  The only positive about it is that it has a nice citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I used this cleansing oil for 2 weeks.  I have never in my life broken out as bad as I did using this oil.  While I read all the reviews, it seemed like a fabulous product and seemed to work on many different faces.  Mine acne is so bad (again NEVER had acne and I am 36) that I am covered from forehead to neck in pimples.  I have already gone through 1 round of antibiotics trying to clear this up and now am starting Retinoid therapy, another antibiotic regime, and clindamycin topical wipes.  If you have oily or acne prone skin I would HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY discourage you from using this product.</li>
            <li> I was all excited to buy this product.  Seems as soon as I started using it to remove make-up and cleanse my face, within days, I started to experience break-outs.  I got a washcloth and continued to remove make-up.  Not a big fan of this - not at the cost!</li>
            <li> I love Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil and decided to give this a try.  I&#x27;m surprised how well it takes off my makeup (except for mascara, so I just used a separate eye makeup remover).  It definitely makes me skin feel moisturized.  I will definitely use this is the winter (and then back to Philosophy Purity in the summer).</li>
            <li> At first, I was hesitant. But super-dry, harsh winters wreaked havoc on my skin, year after year, that I was keen to try the JM argan oil. I tried the Josie Maran travel kit and got a trial size of the cleansing oil. Now I can&#x27;t live without the it, the sunscreen AND the argan oil. I massage the cleansing oil into my skin with a wee bit of water really concentrating on areas with large or clogged pores then I use my Clarisonic over it. Instant-facial.  I used to have monthly facials, but I haven&#x27;t had one since I started using this. I use the argan oil on my face at night like a treatment. I use the sunscreen in the morning with serum underneath. One bottle of cleanser lasted 4.5 months.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleansing oil I have ever tried.  It smells nice, your skin feels silky afterwards.  It warms on your skin and leaves you feeling hydrated and smooth. I use many of Josie&#x27;s products and have never been unhappy with anything I have tried. I love that she donates proceeds to help polar bears and another big plus is that her products are NOT tested on animals!  Thanks Josie!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser but do not love the pump bottle because after a few pumps the pump lid allows the product to leak out all over the place which is very wasteful and messy:/</li>
            <li> The best face wash on the planet. PERIOD.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tastes like orange peel&lt;br /&gt;Warms when rubbed&lt;br /&gt;No dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not clean (which is the intended purpose)</li>
            <li> I have mature skin that mostly on the dry side but my nose is oily. I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers across all price ranges that have never taken care of my combination skin. I recently saw alot of wonderful \\&quot;real\\&quot; reviews on another website that I trust that sells Josie Maran and decided to try it and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It has a ph balanced affect on both dry and oily areas and even the pores on my nose which I usually have trouble with are smaller. A small amt is all that&#x27;s needed with alittle water and it becomes a warm and creamy texture. It cleans really well and leaves my skin feeling and looking the best it&#x27;s ever been. I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best face wash I have used to date. I am a product whore, in that I never use the same product for too long. This will be my second bottle and I am still in love! I don&#x27;t want to jinx it, but I think this one and I are going for the long haul. I have acne prone skin and this wash (used with a Clarisonic) has really improved the quality of my complexion. My pores seem smaller and my face is smoother overall. I also notice that it is less oily. This wash is very moisturizing. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product 4 days and have awful sores all over my nose from it. I called the company and they said my skin is purging and it takes a month until it&#x27;s done.  I don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ll keep using it but hope that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening and after a month it will look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s gotten much worse. Now both sides of my lower face have sticky like flakes that look awful. It seems like the cleanser perhaps adheres to the facial hairs and perhaps either doesn&#x27;t wash off enough or it dries out the skin. Not sure what&#x27;s going on. I am stopping the product to see if it goes away.  Hope so.</li>
            <li> I received a free trial of this from a sephora.com order.  I absolutely loved it!  After shopping around, found it was cheaper on amazon.com and i purchased it!  I am 53, and my skin has never felt softer from using this amazing facial cleanser!  You only use a small bit ata a time, so it should last a while, and when i am out, i will purchase it again!  My face stays so soft and moist for 24 hours ata atime!</li>
            <li> I have very oily t-zone due to oily Rosacea, but dry to normal elsewhere. Was using Boscia cleansing oil and absolutely loved it. Kept oily shine at bay , removed waterproof eye make-up easily and made my skin feel so soft. I got Josie Maran as a kit and do not like it compared to Boscia. It doesn&#x27;t remove my mascara and makes my skin feel really dry. Also, if you get it anywhere near your mouth, it tastes awful. Definitely back to Boscia.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil works great on my skin to thoroughly cleanse and soften my face.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up so it doesn&#x27;t take much to cleanse my skin but I am enjoying this cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is not like the authentic Josie Maran sample I received from her company. This product may be expired or fake. It has a rough slip to it so it does not glide gently on your face. It is hard to remove off face without tugging. It also smells perfumey and irritated my skin. The original authentic sample did not perform like this, it was perfect so I suggest you order this directly from Sephora or Josie Maran&#x27;s website. I returned it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works extremely well without drying skin out. I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser is soothing without causing any irritation.</li>
            <li> I have read some of the reviews and I agree it takes a bit more to take off eye makeup, but there is always eye makeup remover for the that job.  This product is for my skin!  I have been seeing the same aesthetician for 5 years religiously (approx 1x/month) and when I came in after using this product she exclaimed &amp;#34;What are you doing differently?  your skin looks Amazing!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and have struggled with this for years.  I don&#x27;t think anyone would say I have bad skin, but no one says I have great skin either- until now!  You will not get the squeaky clean feel that I historically loved, but your skin will thank you.  Why strip your skin then rehydrate when you can keep it hydrated?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product because I was tired of stripping my skin and wanted to find a paraban free, gmo free, free free free product and came up with the Josie Maran line.  I also use the oil after the cleansing.  Also, I continued to use this product through pregnancy and never had any skin issues.  Of course, this could be genetics, but I am not willing to give up this product to find out.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!!!! I have oily, acne-prone skin and this Cleansing oil DID NOT BREAK ME OUT. In fact, it hydrates my skin beautifully. I live in a cold area in which when the wind strikes against my face, it feels like knives cutting my skin, but since I have started using this product, I do not feel that the weather affects me so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out about this product from a little sample packed Sephora gave me and since then I have LOVED THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> This is all I use for daily cleansing, with Josie&#x27;s scrub weekly for exfoliation.  It is gentle and effective.  I follow with Dr. Perricone toner and Josie&#x27;s pure argan oil on my eyelids, lips, and cuticles.  While wrinkles are not a big problem for me yet, this regimen maintains texture, tone, and moisture.  I recommend all Josie&#x27;s products for care and cleansing, and Bare Minerals original foundation and color products.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin and by using this product it has help my skin with my dryness a very good cleansing</li>
            <li> With sensitive skin and mild acne, I have tried many products to help maintain my skins moisture AND heal acne. This product does both. I am glad I read the reviews before using, because the consistency of the cleanser is puzzling. Love the honey-like texture, and it leaves my skin feeling like... MY SKIN! Leaves nothing behind! I use it in conjunction with the Olay Pro-X and get great results.</li>
            <li> I gave used this product for some time with very positive results for my combination skin.  However it is no longer sold alone at QVC where I initially purchased it and I would need to purchase other items that I have no need for.  Thank you Amazon for selling this as a stand one item!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to spend so much money on a cleansing oil.  There are other, better, lower price alternatives.  The ingredients are pretty much the same.  Josie Maran&#x27;s product contains argan oil, which only has benefits if it&#x27;s left on the skin to absorb.  And her argan oil is $45 when you can get pure argan oil in approximately the same size bottle for $12.  Ridiculous.  It&#x27;s just one more example of over priced cosmetics.  Avoid the hype and purchase something else.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> This does not remove mascara!!! It is way thick when you put it on your face and feels GROSS!!! When you start to lather it falls off your face before your face is even clean! Save your hard earned money for something that works!</li>
            <li> In the past this cleaner was more of an oil based consistency. The bottle I just got was very thick and sticky like honey. I am not sure if the product was changed or if this was a bad batch</li>
            <li> Use it as a hair mask twice weekly</li>
            <li> I have 40yo, acne prone oily/combination skin.  This has not caused any breakout and does take the makeup off.  I do not like the way it rinses off leaving my skin squeaky clean (like using bar-soap) and my face feels tight when it dries. I feel like it&#x27;s stripping my face of everything. And a HUGE dislike - do not get this on your lips at all...a tiny speck of taste in your mouth is very disgusting.  I like other Josie Maran products and will use the rest of the bottle, but will return to Purity cleansing oil next time.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells great and takes off stubborn eye make-up easily. Just mix it with a splash of water, you once you apply it to your skin you also get an instant warming sensation.</li>
            <li> My skin is excruciatingly dry all during cool to cold weather.  Water in the shower actually hurts.  I had a small sample of this and liked it so I ordered the large bottle.  This oil makes my skin less dry, with no itch, yet it isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t make the shower slick.</li>
            <li> Cleanses no better than my regular cleanser. One saving grace is that my pores did seem to shrink. Not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, all the hype is just hype. And marketing.&lt;br /&gt;Gave it a go.</li>
            <li> I have this and am using it now, and I find it very weird to use. Let me say - I have used several oil cleansers before so I know how to use them. That&#x27;s not the problem. This stuff is sticky. Seriously sticky. You pump it out, and try to rub it on your face and your fingers will move about half an inch, then stick in place because of the oil.  You can get it rubbed around, but it takes effort, and that level of rubbing probably isn&#x27;t good for your skin. This takes off makeup fairly well, not great, but it smells delish! Light orange scent - they should all smell this good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, for the same money (or less), try DHC (original or Mild touch), Origins, or Kose Softymo. Shu is ok, but I find it drying, and it is *expensive*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful!</li>
            <li> All these glowing reviews puzzle me. I tried this product and am not a fan. I didn&#x27;t feel like it thoroughly cleaned my face at all. Will not repurchase.</li>
