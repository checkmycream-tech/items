            <li>The cloths come in individual packets that are perfect for&lt;br /&gt;traveling and prevent it from drying out.  </li>
            <li>I also love how it&#x27;s non-scented.  </li>
            <li>I (unfortunately) LOVE this product.  </li>

            <li>It feels like my face is really clean afterwades.</li>
            <li>I used the full 30 day supply</li>
            <li>I re-purchased and included it in my skin care regimen, every other night, and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>Smaller appearing pores, clean pores, healthy glow, reduced fine lines...</li>
            <li>I tell my friends that anyone can have great skin in less than one minute.</li>
            <li>My skin has become much more clear.</li>
            <li>I use the Daily Resurfacer as needed after cleansing and love the results.  </li>
            <li>For travel purposes, most definitely because of its packaging.</li>
            <li>Love how this makes your face feel the next day.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re fighting the good fight, using age smart products, and religiously applying sun block, you need to continue regular mild exfoliation and hydration.</li>
            <li>I use it every other night and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use- premoistened pads individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>This product is simple, easy and disposable, making it not a burden to use.</li>
            <li>I pretty much use only Dermalogica as I have fallen in love with the line overall, and I have used almost all there products as I am an esthetician</li>
            <li>and I attribute it to switching to dermalogica and using this product particularly.</li>
            <li>I have normal, combination skin.  </li>
            <li>recently started using it again - and its worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love the new applicator (as opposed to the small pouches).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li>I would use this product at night that way it has true time to work without interfering with make up or other things.</li>
            <li>Great product it revives your face in an instant expensive</li>
            <li>This product works initially, but all it really does is make your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Really made  my face look younger and smoother.</li>
            <li>BUT if you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>Skin is noticeably soft, smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>A decent daily resurfacer.  </li>
            <li>This product is very easy and simple to use, especially if your as lazy as I am when it comes to taking care of your skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, it is gentle enough on the face to get proper results and not any skin irritation.</li>
            <li>you can help clear the skin the daily resurfacer has loosened over the night.</li>
            <li>i have tried other products that claim to offer similar results and end up going back to dermalogica.i&#x27;m in menopause and it relieves the dryness and redness (also corrects blotchiness and any scars)along with proper skincare.its worth the extra money,and natural ingrediants is a bonus.</li>
            <li>Price in general is my only gripe.  </li>

            <li> Price in general is my only gripe.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks I noticed that my skin was more dull,  less hydrated and definitely less lustrous.</li>
            <li> I have used Dermalogica for years, starting with Ultracalming Cleanser and Daily Microfoliant,but as I aged I added prescription Renova.</li>
            <li> I used it for 4 days and my skin got very dry and broke out by the 3rd day.  </li>
            <li> The Renova left my skin dry, tight and red.</li>
            <li> I have used other similar products on the market and NOTHING compares to this!!</li>
            <li> Overall, no different than other products tried, of which are 50% less.  </li>
            <li> 30 seconds for the Resurfacing Cleanser in the shower and less than that to apply the Daily Resurfacer for overnight repair.</li>
            <li> This is not an overnight miracle, but if you&#x27;re middle aged and fighting gravity and the inevitable dull complexion, this is the way.</li>
            <li> About 2 weeks later, I noticed a negative change in my skin - and it occurred to me that it was because I STOPPED using the daily resurfacer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perhaps I can work up to using the Daily Resurfacer everyday.</li>
            <li> I started using dermalogica brand after some careful research for some skin products.</li>
            <li> Your face will not feel dry and tight like some exfoliants do.</li>
            <li> and I stopped using it due to the cost.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far too expensive with not enough reward.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love skin and taking care of mine but after a long day a tedious regimen is not what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> My face does not \\&quot;peel\\&quot;,rather my skin slightly flakes at times.</li>
            <li> The Resurfacer seems to balance my skin by slightly hydrating my drier cheeks and forehead and reducing my oily nose and chin</li>
            <li> product is essentially a thick paper cloth in the shape of a tube that goes over your finger (similar to the Oral B to go teeth brush wipes for your teeth) and is moistened with hydroxy acids and enzymes and green tea.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a little too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I did have to work up to using this cleanser everyday, but my patience paid off.</li>
            <li> I bought and used a few of these cans now.</li>
            <li> Now I get similar results just using the Resurfacing Cleanser and the Daily Resurfacer without any unpleasant side effects.</li>
            <li> Have not changed anything else in my usual skin regime.</li>
            <li> This is the third can of these I have bought, just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> And if you use it once weekly, the price isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> I hate chemically smelling face</li>
            <li> I use these pads about once every week or two, in the evening before bed, and it clears out the nasty blackheads.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You will see immediate results with this product. Skin is noticeably soft, smooth and firm. Your face will not feel dry and tight like some exfoliants do. My face does not \\&quot;peel\\&quot;,rather my skin slightly flakes at times. It isn&#x27;t even noticeable to the naked eye (I use magnifying glasses to look at my skin). I have sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t use this product every day- I use it 3x per week. I cleanse daily with their Skin Resurfacing Cleanser. I did have to work up to using this cleanser everyday, but my patience paid off. Perhaps I can work up to using the Daily Resurfacer everyday. This product is so easy to use- premoistened pads individually wrapped. I tell my friends that anyone can have great skin in less than one minute. 30 seconds for the Resurfacing Cleanser in the shower and less than that to apply the Daily Resurfacer for overnight repair. I have used Dermalogica for years, starting with Ultracalming Cleanser and Daily Microfoliant,but as I aged I added prescription Renova. The Renova left my skin dry, tight and red. Now I get similar results just using the Resurfacing Cleanser and the Daily Resurfacer without any unpleasant side effects.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. I started using dermalogica brand after some careful research for some skin products. This product is simple, easy and disposable, making it not a burden to use. Plus, it is gentle enough on the face to get proper results and not any skin irritation.I have used other similar products on the market and NOTHING compares to this!!</li>
            <li> Best price I found for this item.</li>
            <li> I use the Daily Resurfacer as needed after cleansing and love the results.  It immediately brightens up my skin and leaves it moisturized.  I have normal, combination skin.  The Resurfacer seems to balance my skin by slightly hydrating my drier cheeks and forehead and reducing my oily nose and chin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is essentially a thick paper cloth in the shape of a tube that goes over your finger (similar to the Oral B to go teeth brush wipes for your teeth) and is moistened with hydroxy acids and enzymes and green tea.  You rub the the cloth on your face to exfoliate physically and chemically.  The cloths come in individual packets that are perfect for&lt;br /&gt;traveling and prevent it from drying out.  I also love how it&#x27;s non-scented.  I hate chemically smelling face products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy on Amazon; you save about 1/3 compared to buying in a spa or salon store.  And if you use it once weekly, the price isn&#x27;t too bad.  Price in general is my only gripe.  But I did like the product so much I gifted it to my two best girl friends.</li>
            <li> It feels like my face is really clean afterwades.</li>
            <li> I (unfortunately) LOVE this product.  It takes about 2-3 weeks to see a difference...but man, what a difference after long-term use.  Smaller appearing pores, clean pores, healthy glow, reduced fine lines...I used this product for months and I stopped using it due to the cost.  About 2 weeks later, I noticed a negative change in my skin - and it occurred to me that it was because I STOPPED using the daily resurfacer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started using it again - and its worth the money.  I love the new applicator (as opposed to the small pouches).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a difference!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin looks and feels so smooth after I use this. I use them about twice a week.</li>
            <li> This product as not lived up to the product info has stated on its website.  A decent daily resurfacer.  It&#x27;s easy, quick to use; for this, give&lt;br /&gt;a 4-1/2 star rating.  Overall, no different than other products tried, of which are 50% less.  Because of its brand name and some of their&lt;br /&gt;products used which like, thought would try, but not again.  For travel purposes, most definitely because of its packaging.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Really made  my face look younger and smoother.</li>
            <li> I used the full 30 day supply and I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This has transformed my skin.  I use it every other night and the results are amazing.  Have not changed anything else in my usual skin regime.</li>
            <li> My skin has become much more clear. Reduced scar visibility, breakouts, and evened my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Great product it revives your face in an instant expensive but well worth it!  I will always buy this product.</li>
            <li> I keep getting compliments for my skin and I attribute it to switching to dermalogica and using this product particularly.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and didn&#x27;t think that I saw any results on my aging skin. I do like Dermalogica as a brand, it is a minimalist brand dedicated solely to skin improvement, no splashy packaging or scents. I used the entire supply. I thought there was no noticeable difference or improvement, so I decided not to re-purchase. After a couple of weeks I noticed that my skin was more dull,  less hydrated and definitely less lustrous. I had not noticed the gradual improvement until I stopped using it. I re-purchased and included it in my skin care regimen, every other night, and my skin looks great. This is not an overnight miracle, but if you&#x27;re middle aged and fighting gravity and the inevitable dull complexion, this is the way. If you need a miracle you should see a dermatologist. If you&#x27;re fighting the good fight, using age smart products, and religiously applying sun block, you need to continue regular mild exfoliation and hydration. When I apply this, then apply nightly moisturizer, my skin remains well-hydrated through the night. This product has earned it&#x27;s space on my shelf! Love it!</li>
            <li> This does what it says it does BUT if you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use it.  I used it for 4 days and my skin got very dry and broke out by the 3rd day.  Nice product, love the finger applicators because it doesn&#x27;t seem like you&#x27;re wasting anything but it&#x27;s just a little too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product works initially, but all it really does is make your skin soft. It&#x27;s far too expensive with not enough reward. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy and simple to use, especially if your as lazy as I am when it comes to taking care of your skin. I pretty much use only Dermalogica as I have fallen in love with the line overall, and I have used almost all there products as I am an esthetician and this is the skin care line I used in school. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love skin and taking care of mine but after a long day a tedious regimen is not what I am looking for. This product takes seconds to use and is placed in convenient per use packs that once your done you can place your moisturizer on your face and it works while it sets. I would use this product at night that way it has true time to work without interfering with make up or other things. One thing I would also do is find a exfoliant you like for morning use that way you can help clear the skin the daily resurfacer has loosened over the night. I would recommend either Daily Microfoliant or Skin Prep Scrub which are both Dermalogica as well.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes your face feel the next day.</li>
            <li> My complexion is a lot better! My husband even noticed it! Love this product and will continue to use it despite its cost,</li>
            <li> Use it regularly - really a great clean at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This is the third can of these I have bought, just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> i have tried other products that claim to offer similar results and end up going back to dermalogica.i&#x27;m in menopause and it relieves the dryness and redness (also corrects blotchiness and any scars)along with proper skincare.its worth the extra money,and natural ingrediants is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I bought and used a few of these cans now. I have a lot of blackheads in the nose and chin region. I use these pads about once every week or two, in the evening before bed, and it clears out the nasty blackheads. Satisfied customer would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and I appreciate finding it at a good price.  As a septuagenarian, my skin looks great!</li>
