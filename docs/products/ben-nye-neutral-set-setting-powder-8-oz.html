            <li>Ben Nye makeup products are great.</li>

            <li>I have oily skin and at the end of the day my make up still looks good.</li>
            <li>when i purchased this item i asked for translucent fair powder ,but they sent me neutral set instead</li>
            <li>I love this line!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t already own this you have to you will not regret this purchase</li>
            <li>I will say though it does give your makeup a more &amp;#34;matte look&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Its just okay.</li>
            <li>Way better than corn starch or baby powder.</li>
            <li>and I love using this on top of my foundation.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>Of course, I love the product itself.</li>
            <li>I ordered this about a month ago and this powder works wonderfully when setting my foundation to last all day even with oily skin!!</li>
            <li>It has gotten me through many long parties looking great!</li>
            <li>Until I met Ben Nye Neutral Set powder, I was a Tarte Smooth Operator</li>
            <li>It makes my face so smooth after it says my make up and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I love all BenNye products but this setting powder is amazing, your makeup will look matte and oil free for hours, I use the Ben Nye final seal spray combined with this.</li>
            <li>Great product I use every single day</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>It is great at absorbing all the extra oils that I produce.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian with fair skin, so the neutral setting powder suits me just right.</li>
            <li>Does give a nice finish like the rest of the Ben Nye line and will last forever in this size.</li>
            <li>Then I simply need to take the tissue paper and blot the excess sebum away and my makeup still stays with the ben Nye setting powder, it really works very well, love it!!</li>
            <li>Also the color may be white, but it really is true to it&#x27;s neutral powder name; however, I am not too sure how it would look on darker tones.</li>
            <li>Love the Ben Nye neutral setting powder so much that I decided to get the huge tub 8oz after getting the smaller sized shakers 1.5oz..</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time she used this product along with her make-up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to scoop some out and put it in a smaller container with a cap that has holes or you will find that it falls everywhere.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do much for my makeup.</li>
            <li>It really helps control my t-zone.</li>
            <li>i have naturally very oily skin, thought i could never wear liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>also a very moist powder</li>
            <li>My makeup looks so much smoother with it</li>
            <li>But other than that, I love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently I forgot to use the ben Nye powder and used the normal foundation powder to set my foundation, my face was oily and the makeup was disappearing even before noon time.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and it keeps my makeup fresh all day long.  </li>
            <li>this stuff has changed my life completely!</li>
            <li>which is pure white powder</li>
            <li>Came across the Ben Nye product line based on a recommendation from a professional makeup artist.  </li>
            <li>It will take a long time and a lot of &amp;#34;faces&amp;#34; to get through this much powder!</li>
            <li>Very workable, goes on white but becomes translucent</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously you have to try this powder; it&#x27;s under $5 for a container that will last a LONG long time!&lt;br /&gt;Tarte&#x27;s Smooth Operator will set you back about $30 for around a tablespoon or two of product.</li>
            <li>This jar is also huge, life time supply for one person at least</li>
            <li>Also, even though the price can be more expensive than some other powders, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money and shipping involved especially for the amount you receive.</li>

            <li> Quick shipping.  Arrived exactly as advertised.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great  translucent powder great on any skin type, oily, dry,combo. I keep a small one in makeup bag a with this size last a long time,</li>

            <li> Great product I use every single day not just when i am on stage. it does lighten your skin but im am rather pale so I don&#x27;t mind. But if i was any darker I would just apply bronzer over it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a cosplayer and she does her research well. This is the first time she used this product along with her make-up and I agree with her, it does a great job. There is no going back.</li>
            <li> Came across the Ben Nye product line based on a recommendation from a professional makeup artist.  I have been using the Dermablend line, and this setting powder is finer and easier to apply, not to mention way cheaper.  I love this line!</li>
            <li> Works great to set your foundation. Seems almost translucent once it is applied but does lighten up your foundation a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> Its just okay. It doesn&#x27;t really do much for my makeup.</li>
            <li> best setting powder ever!</li>
            <li> This is awesome. I set my foundation, and went into 99 degree weather in Las Vegas.  Not only did my foundation not melt, I did not sweat! Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> A must have for makeup artist. Way better than corn starch or baby powder.</li>

            <li> Until I met Ben Nye Neutral Set powder, I was a Tarte Smooth Operator Amazonian Clay devotee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously you have to try this powder; it&#x27;s under $5 for a container that will last a LONG long time!&lt;br /&gt;Tarte&#x27;s Smooth Operator will set you back about $30 for around a tablespoon or two of product. Both of them knock down shine and make a matte finish without oxidizing or causing your face to feel like it has a mud mask on it by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Ben Nye also absorbs and prevents your face from sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing that some may find objectionable about the Ben Nye product is that it has aluminum as an antiperspirant ingredient. This is the secret that sets it apart from any other facial powder on the market.</li>
            <li> I have an oily face and I love using this on top of my foundation.  It is great at absorbing all the extra oils that I produce.  I love it.  However, I do notice that I can only use one application.  Anymore than one application will give a white powder look to my face.  But other than that, I love it.  It really helps control my t-zone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this. It makes my face so smooth after it says my make up and lasts all day. I have oily skin and at the end of the day my make up still looks good. If you don&#x27;t already own this you have to you will not regret this purchase</li>
            <li> I love all BenNye products but this setting powder is amazing, your makeup will look matte and oil free for hours, I use the Ben Nye final seal spray combined with this.</li>
            <li> This product came in fairly good time, and in great condition. Of course, I love the product itself. Ben Nye makeup products are great. It will take a long time and a lot of &amp;#34;faces&amp;#34; to get through this much powder!</li>
            <li> when i purchased this item i asked for translucent fair powder ,but they sent me neutral set instead which is pure white powder it is overpriced and i couldve used talcom powder instead....</li>
            <li> Got this to set my makeup and reduce shine and it delivered! It has gotten me through many long parties looking great! This jar is also huge, life time supply for one person at least</li>
            <li> i have naturally very oily skin, thought i could never wear liquid foundation. this stuff has changed my life completely!</li>
            <li> Powder will get all over the place. It&#x27;s better to scoop some out and put it in a smaller container with a cap that has holes or you will find that it falls everywhere. Does give a nice finish like the rest of the Ben Nye line and will last forever in this size.</li>
            <li> Best powder ever! Very workable, goes on white but becomes translucent&lt;br /&gt;Its also a very moist powder so it won&#x27;t completely dry out your makeup causing it to crack</li>
            <li> Love the Ben Nye neutral setting powder so much that I decided to get the huge tub 8oz after getting the smaller sized shakers 1.5oz.. I have oily skin, so it helps to absorb the sebum throughout the day, the minute the powder is set on  my face/foundation, eyelids, my face will stay matte all the way from 730am to lunch time. Then I simply need to take the tissue paper and blot the excess sebum away and my makeup still stays with the ben Nye setting powder, it really works very well, love it!! By evening time, I still look alright, no major smudges..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I forgot to use the ben Nye powder and used the normal foundation powder to set my foundation, my face was oily and the makeup was disappearing even before noon time. buy this!! I&#x27;m Asian with fair skin, so the neutral setting powder suits me just right.</li>
            <li> I ordered this about a month ago and this powder works wonderfully when setting my foundation to last all day even with oily skin!! My makeup looks so much smoother with it and I would definitely order it again! This works for cosplay and even everyday use if you wear foundation- Also the color may be white, but it really is true to it&#x27;s neutral powder name; however, I am not too sure how it would look on darker tones. Also, even though the price can be more expensive than some other powders, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money and shipping involved especially for the amount you receive.</li>
