            <li>I love this shampoo and had reservations about purchasing it on Amazon, but have not had any problems with it.</li>
            <li>and I feel they are much better already.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many shampoos before this</li>
            <li>Love Redken products.  </li>
            <li>excellent product have used for several years</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li>- this helps my hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite all time shampoo.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair really smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>Great smell and leaves hair soft .</li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>and I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite!  </li>
            <li>Very nice and leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, I am using it since I try for the first time, my hair gets really soft and easy to brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>We are happy enough to have just bought our second bottle of Redken</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying it immensely.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling clean and very soft.</li>
            <li>I have used Redken products previously and have also liked what I purchased.</li>
            <li>Didnt know the bottle was this large.</li>
            <li>I still use that cheap stuff for a quick first wash, and a small amount (the size of a large pea) of the Redken for a follow up.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser suggested I try this particular brand</li>
            <li>Always a good product for thick, coarse hair in hot weather climate.  </li>
            <li>If anyone is heartbroken like me about the old formula being changed there is a petition going to Redken to ask them to go back to the original.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical of high priced personal products, but this stuff gives considerably better results than the very cheap shampoo that I tend to favor.</li>
            <li>The first 33oz bottle lasted over 18 months with daily use.</li>
            <li>5 Stars for the old Avocado Oil Formula.</li>
            <li>I ordered the larger bottle of shampoo because it really works well for my gray hair.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair feeling really soft.  </li>
            <li>The All Soft products seem to be designed for my hair.</li>
            <li>They leave it soft with lots of body.  </li>
            <li>All Soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is noticeably shinier, better to the touch, less broken, easier to brush and seems to stay clean longer.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and getting highlights can be hard on it</li>
            <li>I get my hair color treated regularly and all soft by redken  </li>
            <li>My hair gets soft after using this shampoo several times.</li>
            <li>I have very long, thick hair... and this shampoo helps to keep it smooth and detangled.</li>
