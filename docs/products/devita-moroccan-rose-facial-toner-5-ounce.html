            <li>Devita products are wonderful</li>

            <li>Excellent product, lovely rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is full of wonderful ingredients.</li>
            <li>It feels great and is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It feels really good on my skin, smells nice, removes all of my makeup</li>
            <li>As of right now, it smells wonderful, was soothing, did not irritate my rosacea, and it did indeed seem to be hydrating without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>Unbeatable and excellent consistent quality.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and it lingers quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>Some people may not like the glass bottle, but I think it is rather nice.  </li>
            <li>and it also has a nice glow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Rose toner, for heaven&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li>I have been using it now for more than 5 years and love it!</li>
            <li>This intensely fragrant Rose water is great to waken my skin up in the morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rose smell is much more fragrant than the Guinot yet still refreshing.</li>
            <li>My go to toner, pure product, feels great.</li>
            <li>but it always feels lovely when I do.  </li>
            <li>Now my skin is more even in tone</li>
            <li>Oh Devita, how I love you.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel hesitant about putting any of your products on my skin. :)</li>
            <li>I love the product inside the bottle and the glass bottle itself, but the pump sprayer quit working</li>
            <li>Except that I can&#x27;t find this lovely product in this quality anywhere else.</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD TONER with such a price.  </li>
            <li>Your gentle formula with all natural ingredients that I can understand and read, and your rose toner smells good too!</li>
            <li>This is a really good ALL NATURAL toner.  </li>
            <li>Good all natural product.</li>
            <li>It keeps your pores clean and</li>
            <li>and it has no bad chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different products for skin care, and this toner is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Something new I&#x27;m trying after using Guinot Refreshing Toning Lotion for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and Devita products in general has been really awesome and not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>The ingredient list showed many oils in the product, but was still not leaving any moist feeling on my 53 yr old skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to make my own facial toner but switched to this because I didn&#x27;t have the time for it anymore and the ingredients for this product seemed similar/better than what I used.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with the Devita Aloe Vera Moisture Cleanser, Sanre Skinfood Supple Sunshine moisturizer, and Adovia dead sea facial salts, and my skin is the best its ever been.</li>
            <li>The original content was the color of water and was quite clear in color.  </li>
            <li>My daughter bought some cheaper &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; toner and I could really tell the difference...</li>
            <li>advice, be gentle when using it on your face.  </li>
            <li>so make sure you don&#x27;t use too much especially if you have a sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with this toner is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to disinfect and clean my skin very well, so I end up having to use a lot of it.</li>
            <li>This may be a bit odd to say, but I really like the spray nozzle as it delivers a large and fine mist.  </li>
            <li>Maybe for a younger woman or a warm climate, certainly a not winter</li>
            <li>If nothing else I would have rated it highly for the smell and the hydrating effects.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to be able to judge any specific improvement in the appearance of my skin over time, but if I do I&#x27;ll say more later.  </li>
            <li>Devote some time to your face, it&#x27;s the first thing people see and last, give the product TIME to work!  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t use a toner, but this one actually has really good things for your skin in it, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry and tight, and smells heavenly.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely say this product works well and fast.</li>
            <li>Spray it on an ALL NATURAL cotton pad and swipe it all over my face in an upward movement, one section of the face at a time.  </li>
            <li>I think their products are not only non-toxic but also very beneficial for the skin.</li>
            <li>I have actually ended up spraying it on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; at night quite a few times because I love the smell</li>
            <li>When I was only a few days into using it the Moroccan Rose facial toner caused the dead skin on my face to peel off.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado where its very dry.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like this product and would recommend it to anyone, but especially to those with dry or mature skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this every day because it is actually quite hydrating- a little bit too much for my oily skin in the summer-</li>

            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use a toner, but this one actually has really good things for your skin in it, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry and tight, and smells heavenly.  I don&#x27;t use this every day because it is actually quite hydrating- a little bit too much for my oily skin in the summer- but it always feels lovely when I do.  I have actually ended up spraying it on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; at night quite a few times because I love the smell and it lingers quite nicely.

Overall, I like this product and would recommend it to anyone, but especially to those with dry or mature skin.</li>
            <li> I would definitely say this product works well and fast. When I was only a few days into using it the Moroccan Rose facial toner caused the dead skin on my face to peel off. I had some places where there were dark spots on my face because the dead layer of skin would not peel and this took care of it! Now my skin is more even in tone and it also has a nice glow/shine to it. Beware that this product has a lot of different acids so make sure you don&#x27;t use too much especially if you have a sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li> This intensely fragrant Rose water is great to waken my skin up in the morning. I live in Colorado where its very dry. My daughter bought some cheaper &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; toner and I could really tell the difference...you pay for what you get. This product is a blissful treat for my skin!</li>
            <li> Devita products are wonderful</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful toner I have ever used. I have been using it now for more than 5 years and love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different products for skin care, and this toner is my favorite.  It feels really good on my skin, smells nice, removes all of my makeup (even mascara!) and it has no bad chemicals in it.  I use it in conjunction with the Devita Aloe Vera Moisture Cleanser, Sanre Skinfood Supple Sunshine moisturizer, and Adovia dead sea facial salts, and my skin is the best its ever been.</li>
            <li> This is a really good ALL NATURAL toner.  You can feel and see it working within a couple of days.  It keeps your pores clean and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark skin and tons of acne scars, even when I don&#x27;t pick on a blemish???  Anyway, I brought this product and within 2-3 weeks, I saw a an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the morning and afternoon.  Spray it on an ALL NATURAL cotton pad and swipe it all over my face in an upward movement, one section of the face at a time.  After you do this, LOOK at the cotton ball, you won&#x27;t believe your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, be gentle when using it on your face.  Don&#x27;t swipe the cotton pad harshly over your face.  Devote some time to your face, it&#x27;s the first thing people see and last, give the product TIME to work!  Don&#x27;t use it once or twice and then decide it is not for you.  At least three weeks. You SHOULD see something by then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, great product.</li>
            <li> Unbeatable and excellent consistent quality.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to be able to judge any specific improvement in the appearance of my skin over time, but if I do I&#x27;ll say more later.  As of right now, it smells wonderful, was soothing, did not irritate my rosacea, and it did indeed seem to be hydrating without being greasy.

            <li> Oh Devita, how I love you. Your gentle formula with all natural ingredients that I can understand and read, and your rose toner smells good too! I don&#x27;t feel hesitant about putting any of your products on my skin. :)</li>
            <li> I love the product inside the bottle and the glass bottle itself, but the pump sprayer quit working and I had to pour the toner into my hand and apply.  Well there went the spritzer effect I bought it for.  And too much product is wasted.  I contacted the company about it and they told me they didn&#x27;t have any extra spray tops, sorry.  That was it.  Talk about poor customer service.</li>
            <li> A very nice toner. I spritz it in my neck and chest before sunscreen in the morning. I also use it in a cotton ball after washing my face to tone my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is full of wonderful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, lovely rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells great and clears skin up</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD TONER with such a price.  Money saving triple 5 stars product!</li>
            <li> The ingredient list showed many oils in the product, but was still not leaving any moist feeling on my 53 yr old skin.&lt;br /&gt;The oils must be miniscule amounts.  Maybe for a younger woman or a warm climate, certainly a not winter product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting the product sit until warmer weather, I am still disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle it comes in is made of a dark red glass.  The original content was the color of water and was quite clear in color.  Now, I have a red tint to my product.  I don&#x27;t want red dye coming off into my product!  Some of these dyes can be harmful.  Into the trash this will go!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Rose toner, for heaven&#x27;s sake. What else is there to say? Except that I can&#x27;t find this lovely product in this quality anywhere else.</li>
            <li> My go to toner, pure product, feels great. Hope they never change the formula.</li>
            <li> I used to make my own facial toner but switched to this because I didn&#x27;t have the time for it anymore and the ingredients for this product seemed similar/better than what I used. I like this brand a lot. I think their products are not only non-toxic but also very beneficial for the skin. The only problem I have with this toner is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to disinfect and clean my skin very well, so I end up having to use a lot of it. I may try adding a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in the future to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> Great vegan product!  It feels great and is refreshing.  I have sensitive skin and Devita products in general has been really awesome and not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> Good all natural product. Something new I&#x27;m trying after using Guinot Refreshing Toning Lotion for an extended period of time. Not sure how I feel about it quite yet. It&#x27;s rose smell is much more fragrant than the Guinot yet still refreshing.</li>
