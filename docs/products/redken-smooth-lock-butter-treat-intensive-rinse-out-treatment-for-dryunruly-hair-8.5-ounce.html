    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li>It works BEST if there is heat involved because heat opens up the hair shaft, so the Butter Silk can soak in.  </li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>This product is so wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I use this in combination of my Joico hair treatment, this is for smoothing and works great!</li>
            <li>and i still use it and recommend it this product is awesome</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>and this isn&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
            <li>Good for frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>Good for abused or color treated or both.</li>
            <li>This Lock Butter Treat made my hair feel stronger, heavier, since I have very fine hair that is good.</li>
            <li>There is nothing else as effective.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it kind of tames my curly hair into nice ringlets.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my beloved Butter Treat is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>product is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>so it really is more cost effective than it seems.</li>
            <li>I woke up with a most delicious head of soft curls.  </li>
            <li>love how this stuff works, but don&#x27;t love the smell, but it probably would appeal to most people (i&#x27;m picky).</li>
            <li>I really love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue buying this :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but it works sooo much better.</li>
            <li>More for longer hair)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but Butter Treat is better and more convenient.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>will make hair feel and look great and not put to much wait on your hair.</li>
            <li>It used to smell so clean and light but now, it has an off putting almond-y kind of smell</li>
            <li>Smooth Lock Butter Silk is not inexpensive, but it is much more effective as a conditioner than are cheaper conditioners, so it is actually worth the money.  </li>
            <li>and it is very intense hydration, my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After washing the hair, apply this Redken Smooth Lock Butter Silk treatment.  </li>
            <li>Why is this product no longer available as in discontinued?</li>
            <li>I LOVED the old product, which was called butter treat.</li>
            <li>After 10-15 minutes, rinse out the Redken Smooth Lock Butter Silk with COOL water.  </li>
            <li>In my book, that equals a product worth its cost!</li>
            <li>, you will see a difference right away!</li>
            <li>It works quite well to smooth frizzy hair and to calm waves, as well as to soften aging hair.  </li>
            <li>Rinsing with cool water helps the hair shaft close, which leaves it</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair easy to handle, while keeping the body.  </li>
            <li>It conditions pretty well, but not as well as the original</li>
            <li>Excellent product but very hard to find.</li>
            <li>This is ok, the smell is a little different, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel great at all.</li>
            <li>I am also able to use less product to get better results.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much to get the job done.</li>
            <li>But I think it actually works better.</li>
            <li>Make sure you realize these are two different products before purchasing.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much, I am actually considering marrying it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It keeps it soft smooth and detangled.</li>
            <li>i first used this product when in hair school</li>
            <li>This product did not clearly state that it&#x27;s more like a timed treatment to put on and wash out</li>
            <li>I actually hold my breath while applying it because it&#x27;s so strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently discovered that Fekkai brand is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>One cannot just apply this conditioner, and then wash it out as a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; conditioner would be, if one wants to see any results.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>and this really helps.</li>
            <li>I have fine ,dry hair</li>
            <li>Works as well or better than more expensive products like Aveda.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended it for color-treated hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the new formula Butter Silk.</li>
            <li>I am one of those people that are pretty specific about how products smell.</li>
            <li>I can still by Butter treat at CVS, it&#x27;s in the exact same bottle, coloring etc.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair silky soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Nourished my thick, curly hair, reduces frizz and makes my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>I have coarse, curly-frizzy hair and it really makes it feel soft and smooths down as much as it can for a conditioner.</li>
            <li>My new hair dresser used a product she said she couldn&#x27;t sell me - only for salon use.  </li>

            <li> This isn&#x27;t Butter Treat. It&#x27;s the new formula Butter Silk. It&#x27;s not the same thing and this isn&#x27;t nearly as good. Leaves my hair coarse.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my beloved Butter Treat is no longer available.  It conditions pretty well, but not as well as the original and this smells HORRIBLE - like very strong old lady perfume.  I actually hold my breath while applying it because it&#x27;s so strong.  I will NOT be re-ordering this.  I&#x27;ve recently discovered that Fekkai brand is my new favorite.  It&#x27;s pricey but the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li> This product can work miracles on damaged hair if it is used correctly.  In order to work well, this product must be left in the hair for quite a while, so it can soak in and permeate the hair shaft.  One cannot just apply this conditioner, and then wash it out as a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; conditioner would be, if one wants to see any results.  Instead...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing the hair, apply this Redken Smooth Lock Butter Silk treatment.  Then wrap the hair in either a shower cap or a hot towel and let the product soak in for at least 10-15 minutes.  It works BEST if there is heat involved because heat opens up the hair shaft, so the Butter Silk can soak in.  After 10-15 minutes, rinse out the Redken Smooth Lock Butter Silk with COOL water.  Rinsing with cool water helps the hair shaft close, which leaves it **shiny!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redken Smooth Lock Butter Silk is not inexpensive, but it is much more effective as a conditioner than are cheaper conditioners, so it is actually worth the money.  It works quite well to smooth frizzy hair and to calm waves, as well as to soften aging hair.  In my book, that equals a product worth its cost!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years at the recommendation of my hair stylist(s). Nourished my thick, curly hair, reduces frizz and makes my hair more manageable. Great price. Works as well or better than more expensive products like Aveda.</li>
            <li> love how this stuff works, but don&#x27;t love the smell, but it probably would appeal to most people (i&#x27;m picky).</li>
            <li> I woke up with a most delicious head of soft curls.  My new hair dresser used a product she said she couldn&#x27;t sell me - only for salon use.  Redken Shot Phase smoothlock.  I found it on an auction site thru a beauty supply place.  It&#x27;s a monthly type product.  I&#x27;ve used it twice a week or added it to the smoothlock butter silk.  Other than expense (at this point I&#x27;ve given up), any reason I can&#x27;t keep doing that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  Been looking for 30 yrs.  lol.  Good for frizzy hair.  Good for abused or color treated or both.</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner. I have coarse, curly-frizzy hair and it really makes it feel soft and smooths down as much as it can for a conditioner. The price is reasonable. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I am one of those people that are pretty specific about how products smell. Although the formula hasn&#x27;t seemed to have changed, the smell of it has! It used to smell so clean and light but now, it has an off putting almond-y kind of smell that I  just can&#x27;t get over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re into that sort of fragrance, I suppose this product does what it is supposed to do. But as for me, I will not be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> Great product. Gets rid of Frizz and dryness. Been using it for 5+ years. Sadly, I was told it is in the process of being discontinued. Not good! There is nothing else as effective.</li>
            <li> This product is so wonderful.  This will be the fourth purchase!  It really makes my hair easy to handle, while keeping the body.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This Lock Butter Treat made my hair feel stronger, heavier, since I have very fine hair that is good. I love this and it is very intense hydration, my hair feels amazing. I&#x27;ll continue buying this :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is one of only a few that actually softens my hair, although I usually leave it on for 30-40mins rather than the 20 they say.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to learn that the butter treat I normally used had be discontinued and replaced by this product. But I think it actually works better. I am also able to use less product to get better results. I have thin hair and I use it as a conditioner when I shampoo. So it is only in my hair for less than a minute.</li>
            <li> I LOVED the old product, which was called butter treat. This is ok, the smell is a little different, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel great at all. The weird thing is I can still by Butter treat at CVS, it&#x27;s in the exact same bottle, coloring etc. but it works sooo much better. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again. Make sure you realize these are two different products before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination of my Joico hair treatment, this is for smoothing and works great! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this after shampooing. I do not rinse it out. I use only a small amount (pea size.I have short hair. More for longer hair) My beautician uses it also when I have my hair done.After applying I use my mousse and style hair. I have fine ,dry hair and this really helps. 5 stars</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, I am actually considering marrying it!&lt;br /&gt;I have curly, dry hair that can often look like a q tip! This butter treat actually adds moisture to my locks and loosens up my curls so I can actually have a hair style.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it kind of tames my curly hair into nice ringlets. Helps weigh the curls down.</li>
            <li> beat on market for curley hair. It keeps it soft smooth and detangled.Why is this product no longer available as in discontinued?</li>
            <li> Excellent product but very hard to find. A little goes along way so it really is more cost effective than it seems.</li>
            <li> This product did not clearly state that it&#x27;s more like a timed treatment to put on and wash out after your hair is towel dried.  It&#x27;s okay, but Butter Treat is better and more convenient.</li>
            <li> I just recently started using this product on my clients and I love it. You don&#x27;t have to use very much to get the job done. It leaves the hair silky soft and bouncy. I highly recommended it for color-treated hair that&#x27;s unruly, you will see a difference right away!</li>
            <li> i first used this product when in hair school and i still use it and recommend it this product is awesome will make hair feel and look great and not put to much wait on your hair.</li>
