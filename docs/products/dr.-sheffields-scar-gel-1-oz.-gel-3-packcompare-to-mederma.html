            <li>It&#x27;s so freaking cheap too!</li>
            <li>Shipping was great, came fast, safe and undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>effects.&lt;br /&gt;Price was great considering how much youre getting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 3 months using this, and directions say 6 months, so I&#x27;m looking forward to more improvement.</li>
            <li>but they are MUCH better looking.</li>
            <li>but she just is at the age of wanting to wear dresses and cute shorts</li>
            <li>I purchased for my sister in Brazil, who swear it is smoothing her wrinkles around the eyes better</li>
            <li>I scar easily from acne and from cuts.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing significant improvement on my surgery scars.</li>
            <li>Works better that the higher priced brands.</li>
            <li>began using as directed, 3 times per day, but I quickly found out I just didn&#x27;t have the time with a baby.</li>
            <li>Came quickly in the mail</li>
            <li>Overall at the price point I&#x27;m very pleased and</li>
            <li>Within the 1st week, I was pleasantly surprised that it softened and lightened most of my keloids.</li>
            <li>So far,  the scar gel cream seems to be working, but I just started using it last week, but I am happy with the results for the time I have been using it.</li>
            <li>This review will be mostly for those who have keloids, which are raised scars that continue to grow over time and bigger than the original wound.</li>
            <li>I pit it on everything,  not just scars, and it always works, usually pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I apply it everyday and every day they shrink more and more.  </li>
            <li>Seller shipped my item very fast.</li>
            <li>It has a mild herbal odor that quickly dissipates, and spreads and dries out clear.</li>
            <li>The texture of this gel is soft and smooth and it does help fade and change the appearance of your existing scars.</li>
            <li>For the first week I used as directed, but it&#x27;s now 1-2 times per day.</li>
            <li>Shipping came early and package was secure.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am quite pleased with the results, plus it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Got this at first from Walmart at $1.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought just try it for the heck of it,</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare this product to any other on the market because this is the first of its kind for me.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised that its faded scars so quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this at the dollar store, and didnt have very high expectations given the $1 price...</li>
            <li>This product really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works if you use it every day and rub it in morning and night.  </li>
            <li>It was very affordable and works really well.</li>
            <li>AND I DON&#x27;T SEE MUCH CHANGE IN THE AREA I&#x27;M USING IT ON MY FOOT</li>
            <li>I had a scar for months, but it went away in about two months thanks to Dr.</li>
            <li>It really gets rid of scars.  </li>
            <li>whenever I remember, really)</li>
            <li>Wake up, shower, gently massage on scar gel in a circular motion, then again before bed.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>nothing much to lose except a buck.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate this products.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the brand name scar gel</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really make your scars go away.</li>
            <li>but WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Reduced my new c-section scar by 50% in just two months!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the scars are much less noticeable because of using this product.</li>
            <li>so I told her to mainly use it at night before bed after her</li>
            <li>main ingredient is onion juice.</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>But might make them a little better over time.</li>
            <li>of right now, most of my keloids are nearly flat and have become light pink-brown, instead of dark pink.</li>
            <li>I have one month old burn marks on my face, I purchase Dr. Sheffield, bio-oil, kelo and real Mederma from Amazon.</li>
            <li>My scars are new</li>
            <li>Seems to make your skin peel allowing for new growth to diminish your scar.</li>
            <li>This even works on old scars!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied and am near achieving my personal goal of simply flattening the cumbersome keloids in only a month (box said 3-6 months).</li>
            <li>I would definately recommend this product to anyone with new or old stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Dr. Sheffield gel is just watery liquid, put it on my skin and it drys out like glue, it only gives you the peel, pure chemical effects.</li>
            <li>The gel is clear and odorless.</li>
            <li>So far seems to be working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE EARLY JUNE 2015</li>
            <li>(HAD FOOT SURGERY IN EARLY APRIL).  </li>
            <li>This is by far cheaper</li>
            <li>I was totally pleasantly surprised with the result.</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and she has been using it for a couple months on some old scars.</li>
            <li>I dont think it has any smell, and it only leaves tacky residue if you put on too much</li>
            <li>kind of so I was surprised that for the same price I got 3 and still got the other from the other place</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work as well as other brands, but for the money its worth trying</li>
            <li>I still have 2 tubes left and also use this once a day for new acne scars, which have nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li>So I tried on a large 2nd and 3rd degree</li>
            <li>I read on medical forums some doctors will suggest massaging new scars to help the healing process.</li>
            <li>This product works like the $30 Mederma product (but flakes/coagulates less) and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It works just as great as any other expensive scar gel.</li>
            <li>It works fine, albeit somewhat slowly.  </li>
            <li>I have relatively old keloid scars--3 to 6+ years, biggest one a bit smaller than a quarter.</li>
            <li>After weeks of use following directions I have barely seen any improvement.</li>
            <li>that left a large dark bump on my neck.  </li>
            <li>(ive only used it three times so far) and I dont want to give a dishonest review without first hand knowledge of the products</li>

            <li> After weeks of use following directions I have barely seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> that left a large dark bump on my neck.  </li>
            <li> (ive only used it three times so far) and I dont want to give a dishonest review without first hand knowledge of the products</li>
            <li> I tried to keep to the schedule but did miss a couple of times; however, at the end of the eight weeks the dark bump had completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> reason I&#x27;m staying at four stars is because I havent been using it long enough to see a difference yet</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give an informed review</li>
            <li> I figured, why not old scars</li>
            <li> I have a 3 inch surgical scar on the inside of my left wrist from when I broke my left wrist a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry, and I haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> I use it 3 to 4 times a day every single day.</li>
            <li> The big dark brown scar is not noticeable anymore.</li>
            <li> Made my knee replacement scar less visible in a very short time</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first, because I have tried other stretch mark products, such as, bio oil.</li>
            <li> so I thought it would work better , won&#x27;t bad mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month or so with absolutely no difference in my scars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the product for a few days, so I don&#x27;t know if it works.</li>
            <li> not to mention, one tube was basically empty and the product packaging had residue on it.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and didnt see any difference other than some temporary tightening when I used it.</li>
            <li> I gave the other two tubes of this gel to her</li>
            <li> ordered other from other place</li>
            <li> The incision/scar is lighter in color and no longer red in appearance except for one small area where the scar is the thickest.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using the product maybe twice every other day--</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other scar gels or creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> any other product she ever tried.</li>
            <li> then it dries to a slightly tacky gel like finish</li>
            <li> tried it on my dark elbows and it even seemed to help brighten them a little bit</li>
            <li> a little too liquidy, but it will spead well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit greasy going on</li>
            <li> I unfortunately fainted and had to get stitches on my face near my eye.</li>
            <li> I just received the product a few days ago and already see an improvement on the scars on my face.</li>
            <li> so I started using this scar gel after some amateur research.</li>
            <li> it was just a fraction of the price f the small tube of Mederma.</li>
            <li> Seriously this product rocks.  </li>
            <li> I have a terrible habit of picking at barely noticeable,  self perceived imperfections on my face, and alot of times i make whatever was there ten times worse-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased and tried the expensive stretch mark creams with little to no change in the appearance of my stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Now, i have never used mederma- its just too expensive.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t recall that brand smelling as bad as this stuff.</li>
            <li> It tends to get sticky if you sweat though, so it&#x27;s annoying to use this stuff in the summer.</li>

            <li> Only been using for a week and i already see a visible difference on stubborn acne stars. Will keep using (i apply 2-3x a day) and hope they continue to fade. I actually bought this to use on surgery scars, but the bandages haven&#x27;t come off yet…so i figured id give it a test run on my face while i was waiting. Pleasantly surprised that its faded scars so quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased and tried the expensive stretch mark creams with little to no change in the appearance of my stretch marks.  This product  has already shown improvement and I&#x27;ve only been using it a month.  I would definately recommend this product to anyone with new or old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This product really worked well for me.  I was stung by a bee on my neck during July 2011, that left a large dark bump on my neck.  I followed the instructions using the scar gel as recommended eight weeks three times a day.  I tried to keep to the schedule but did miss a couple of times; however, at the end of the eight weeks the dark bump had completely disappeared.  The best thing is that it works and the price is FANTASTIC!!!  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Reduced my new c-section scar by 50% in just two months!</li>
            <li> So far seems to be working. Takes some time.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works if you use it every day and rub it in morning and night.  It&#x27;s amazing. Three packages will take care of just about anything.</li>
            <li> The texture of this gel is soft and smooth and it does help fade and change the appearance of your existing scars. It was very affordable and works really well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as my mom said it works great for wrinkles. She swears it has diminished her lip lines. She is in her 60&#x27;s and has always taken great care of her skin. I am in my 40&#x27;s and didnt see any difference other than some temporary tightening when I used it. I gave the other two tubes of this gel to her and she was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. You get what you pay for. Takes forever to dry, and I haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> This even works on old scars!</li>
            <li> Scar looking better already after 2 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE EARLY JUNE 2015 AND NOW IT&#x27;S THE END OF JUNE AND I DON&#x27;T SEE MUCH CHANGE IN THE AREA I&#x27;M USING IT ON MY FOOT (HAD FOOT SURGERY IN EARLY APRIL).  I&#x27;M JUST TRYING TO BE PATIENT!</li>
            <li> This scar gel is amazing! It works just as great as any other expensive scar gel. I had a scar for months, but it went away in about two months thanks to Dr.Sheffield&#x27;s! This was such a great deal!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!!! Great product</li>
            <li> works well but you have to use it 3 to 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It really gets rid of scars.  I apply it everyday and every day they shrink more and more.  It&#x27;s so freaking cheap too!</li>
            <li> Anything to help fade my surgery scars!</li>
            <li> I picked this up from the store. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month or so with absolutely no difference in my scars.</li>
            <li> I ordered it thinking it was just one &#x27;cause ordered other from other place and they were the same price kind of so I was surprised that for the same price I got 3 and still got the other from the other place but it was just one, so is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the texture</li>
            <li> a little too liquidy, but it will spead well</li>
            <li> Shipping was great, came fast, safe and undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I&#x27;m staying at four stars is because I havent been using it long enough to see a difference yet (ive only used it three times so far) and I dont want to give a dishonest review without first hand knowledge of the products effects.&lt;br /&gt;Price was great considering how much youre getting. Great deal.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first, because I have tried other stretch mark products, such as, bio oil. This is by far cheaper and I have noticed a gradual lightening on my stretch marks (obtained through puberty). I&#x27;m 3 months using this, and directions say 6 months, so I&#x27;m looking forward to more improvement.</li>
            <li> I have a 3 inch surgical scar on the inside of my left wrist from when I broke my left wrist a little over a year ago. The brake required a plate and some screws. I started using this scar gel about a week ago and I began to see immediate results. I use it 3 to 4 times a day every single day. The incision/scar is lighter in color and no longer red in appearance except for one small area where the scar is the thickest. After one week I already see a 50% to 75% appearance improvement. The gel is clear and odorless. I can&#x27;t compare this product to any other on the market because this is the first of its kind for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my scars as of yet and I&#x27;ve been using for about a month . My scars are new so I thought it would work better , won&#x27;t bad mouth it just yet tho</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as other brands, but for the money its worth trying</li>
            <li> I used this product twice daily on scars I recieved maybe two months prior to buying this. I noticed a difference in the visibility of the scars within 4 days of use! Seriously this product rocks.  The scars are still there (I&#x27;ve been using the product maybe twice every other day--whenever I remember, really) but they are MUCH better looking.</li>
            <li> Works! Seems to make your skin peel allowing for new growth to diminish your scar. After just weeks my scar on my arm from abrasion injury has dissappeared by 50%.</li>
            <li> I have used one tube of this and I am seeing a difference in my newest scars from a surgery in August, and some improvement in scars from another surgery a year ago in August. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give an informed review but I&#x27;ll update when I form an opinion</li>
            <li> I used this on the scars from both of my knee replacements.  I&#x27;m sure the scars are much less noticeable because of using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a 1-pack, not a 3-pack. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the title. Amazon refunded my order because their customer service is top-notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the product for a few days, so I don&#x27;t know if it works. Scar treatments like these supposedly take months...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application is nice though. It has a mild herbal odor that quickly dissipates, and spreads and dries out clear. It tends to get sticky if you sweat though, so it&#x27;s annoying to use this stuff in the summer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and it works too! I know that from experience and I&#x27;m just not saying that. Seller shipped my item very fast.</li>
            <li> I scar easily from acne and from cuts.  This product works like the $30 Mederma product (but flakes/coagulates less) and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have tried this to help fade acne scars. After weeks of use following directions I have barely seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s one of the best scar creams I&#x27;ve used I see some results</li>
            <li> Not seeing any difference, Would not order again.</li>
            <li> I have one month old burn marks on my face, I purchase Dr. Sheffield, bio-oil, kelo and real Mederma from Amazon. I have only put Mederma for one night and I see the difference. Bio-oil and Dr.Sheffield... not working. Dr. Sheffield gel is just watery liquid, put it on my skin and it drys out like glue, it only gives you the peel, pure chemical effects. Not like Mederma, it drys like glue but at the same time you feel the Itchiness on the skin, same experience that your wound try to heel themselves. So... it should be Dr. Sheffield&#x27;s Scar Gel - *Compare to Mederma want to be*</li>
            <li> Did nothing for dimishing my wife&#x27;s scars.</li>
            <li> This review will be mostly for those who have keloids, which are raised scars that continue to grow over time and bigger than the original wound. This is only MY experience with this product and it may be different for everyone. I have relatively old keloid scars--3 to 6+ years, biggest one a bit smaller than a quarter. They had been growing, itching, and hurting a lot so I started using this scar gel after some amateur research. I have not tried any other scar gels or creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using as directed, 3 times per day, but I quickly found out I just didn&#x27;t have the time with a baby. For the first week I used as directed, but it&#x27;s now 1-2 times per day. Within the 1st week, I was pleasantly surprised that it softened and lightened most of my keloids. Also, there was a ~35% size reduction. By the 2nd week, there was a ~50% size reduction, but color remained unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My process: Wake up, shower, gently massage on scar gel in a circular motion, then again before bed. Sometimes, when I have time, I will massage the keloids by pressing until it turns white-ish, then go in a circular motion for 5-10 minutes. Whenever I do this, I often find that it hurts but softens the keloids quicker. I read on medical forums some doctors will suggest massaging new scars to help the healing process. I figured, why not old scars too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of right now, most of my keloids are nearly flat and have become light pink-brown, instead of dark pink. Overall, I am very satisfied and am near achieving my personal goal of simply flattening the cumbersome keloids in only a month (box said 3-6 months). I still have 2 tubes left and also use this once a day for new acne scars, which have nearly disappeared. I don&#x27;t think this product is supposed to make any scars disappear, but help the overall appearance. Shipping came early and package was secure. Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> It works fine, albeit somewhat slowly.  Over a period of several weeks I noticed the scar faded and almost disappeared in the next couple of weeks.  Overall, I am quite pleased with the results, plus it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> So far,  the scar gel cream seems to be working, but I just started using it last week, but I am happy with the results for the time I have been using it. Can&#x27;t beat the price,  it was just a fraction of the price f the small tube of Mederma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a Five star Rating because the item did Reached on Time I was very satisfied will surly order order this again for my customers hope this helps</li>
            <li> I unfortunately fainted and had to get stitches on my face near my eye. I just received the product a few days ago and already see an improvement on the scars on my face. The discolored area is progressing nicely.</li>
            <li> Got this at first from Walmart at $1.  At first I thought just try it for the heck of it, nothing much to lose except a buck.  So I tried on a large 2nd and 3rd degree burn scar on my leg which has been there since 1995  I was totally pleasantly surprised with the result. I have only applied it once a day for two weeks when I started seeing the result.  The big dark brown scar is not noticeable anymore. I can wear shorts again without getting self-conscious. Even my family is amazed.  The product is inexpensive but highly effective.  Excellent product.  A++++++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing significant improvement on my surgery scars. Was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The product is working great...I already see good results. I really appreciate this products. This product is highly recommended. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is working to fade my daughters scars on her legs. She is a  big tomboy but she just is at the age of wanting to wear dresses and cute shorts so I got this for her and she has been using it for a couple months on some old scars. It&#x27;s a little bit greasy going on n then it dries to a slightly tacky gel like finish so I told her to mainly use it at night before bed after her shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my dark elbows and it even seemed to help brighten them a little bit but I think for that purpose I would have to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main ingredient is onion juice. Overall at the price point I&#x27;m very pleased and delivery was quick and shipping was good.</li>
            <li> Might might not work don the know yet</li>
            <li> nice price and worked well</li>
            <li> I have been using it and I see the scars fade</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results yet.  Still using the product.</li>
            <li> Had gall bladder surgery last July.  My scar has visibly started to go away.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Came quickly in the mail</li>
            <li> It really works. Especially on acne scars.  Its awesome!</li>
            <li> This works great. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Not impressed, would not buy again. Much cheaper than the brand name scar gel but I don&#x27;t recall that brand smelling as bad as this stuff. not to mention, one tube was basically empty and the product packaging had residue on it. just like receiving a used tube from grandmas.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my sister in Brazil, who swear it is smoothing her wrinkles around the eyes better&lt;br /&gt;than any other product she ever tried.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make your scars go away. But might make them a little better over time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months with no change.</li>
            <li> Made my knee replacement scar less visible in a very short time</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work.  i only got one bottle, not three</li>
            <li> I bought this at the dollar store, and didnt have very high expectations given the $1 price...but WOW!!! This stuff rocks!  Now, i have never used mederma- its just too expensive.  But i dont need to with this! I pit it on everything,  not just scars, and it always works, usually pretty quickly. You can even put it on pimples and they go away! I have a terrible habit of picking at barely noticeable,  self perceived imperfections on my face, and alot of times i make whatever was there ten times worse- thank god for this scar gel or id have scars everywhere!  I dont think it has any smell, and it only leaves tacky residue if you put on too much and /or don&#x27;t rub it in well. I can&#x27;t believe i only paid a DOLLAR for this miracle in a tube- i wish i bought ten of them, but ive had this one forever and use it constantly.  A must for every medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> Works better that the higher priced brands.</li>
