            <li>I am happy I have found it.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great bargain since it comes in a pack of 2.</li>
            <li>product is just as described, great gel, easy to order online &amp; not have to go to the store!</li>
            <li>With this product I am so happy to say it gives me more body and easier to manage hair styles.  </li>
            <li>it boosted my ego right along with making me feel and look beautiful again!</li>
            <li>the job but kind of primitively.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it on Amazon at a fair price.</li>
            <li>I started using this brand&#x27;s hairspray &amp; really liked it, so I decided to purchase this serum.  </li>
            <li>AND IT IS WAY BETTER THAN ANY GEL PRODUCTS I HAVE EVER USED.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and can not believe I can not find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>Found this product to be better than anything else I had tried before.</li>
            <li>If you, like me, need a replacement to the gel, then this might be better than those medium or light hold gels/serums in the market...</li>
            <li>More scalp shows and my hair style is just not as full looking.</li>
            <li>and it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I USE LIGHT GEL ON MY HAIR.</li>
            <li>but you will be wishing the gel were still available.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today and it seems to be a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I am in my seventies and do not have the full head of hair that I used to have.  </li>
            <li>I ONLY WISH WE COULD PURCHASE IT MORE EASILY IN MY COUNTRY (HONDURAS).</li>
            <li>worth the hype, and don&#x27;t kid yourselves thinking that it does something</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the reviews right here in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Hate</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but their gel was EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li>For someone who&#x27;s best feature was her long and VERY thick red hair, ageing and loosing most of it has been more than disheartening.</li>
            <li>I have soft, fine hair ...</li>
            <li>Holds my bangs the way I want them ;)</li>
            <li>I used this several years ago, but stopped for a while when I thought I ran out and could not find more.  </li>
            <li>I have used it consistently for the year+ since.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>This one is a mediocre replacement, at best.</li>
            <li>Even when I just air dry, my hair has much more volume.</li>
            <li>The price is good and the product actually lasts us a long time.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li>I bought this product at Walgreens, and so far I think its working very well.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel more full and thick, when its both wavy and when I dry it straight.</li>
            <li>It remains soft to the touch without being sticky.</li>
            <li>I have also referred it to my 84 year old sister and a close woman friend of 60</li>
            <li>I tries all products recommended to me but thicker hair wins thumbs up.</li>
            <li>When I found the remnants of a bottle hidden in the back of a cupboard about a year later and fell back in love with it and started the search again.</li>
            <li>This product is super at thickening hair and hence making you look younger and with out any sticky messy buildup.</li>
            <li>I have been dealing with my baby fine, fairly thin, totally straight hair for a long time.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I USE LIGHT GEL ON MY HAIR. MY WIFE HAD ORDERED THIS PRODUCT FOR HERSELF. I TRIED IT AND IT IS WAY BETTER THAN ANY GEL PRODUCTS I HAVE EVER USED. THIS IS THE ONE TO USE. FORGET ABOUT GELS.</li>
            <li> I am in my seventies and do not have the full head of hair that I used to have.  With this product I am so happy to say it gives me more body and easier to manage hair styles.  I am happy I have found it.  I now also use the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I actually notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use this product. More scalp shows and my hair style is just not as full looking. I use it with Toppik hair fattener, just a nickel to quarter size amount of each and it makes a huge difference. My son says he noticed a difference in his hair also, so we will continue to purchase this. The price is good and the product actually lasts us a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I tries all products recommended to me but thicker hair wins thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and have tried every product, and for the price this is the clear winner. Makes my hair fuller and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews right here in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Hate to burst any bubbles but&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s basically just watery starchy concoction that dries the hair into a semi stiff wig.&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s so watery it doesn&#x27;t harden the hair like hair spray does, but&lt;br /&gt;it basically the same principle.&lt;br /&gt;I could&#x27;v gotten the same effect with a mixture of egg whites or something.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the hype, and don&#x27;t kid yourselves thinking that it does something&lt;br /&gt;at a molecular level.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job but kind of primitively.&lt;br /&gt;I would look into something else after this bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and can not believe I can not find it in stores anymore. Holds my bangs the way I want them ;)</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with my baby fine, fairly thin, totally straight hair for a long time. I have purchased or tried products from just about every price range. I used this several years ago, but stopped for a while when I thought I ran out and could not find more.  When I found the remnants of a bottle hidden in the back of a cupboard about a year later and fell back in love with it and started the search again. I have used it consistently for the year+ since. I was pleased to find it on Amazon at a fair price. I am sensitive to fragrance, and though parfum is listed in the last few ingredients, this product has never bothered me. It has a faint herbal scent from the various extracts but the scent fades quickly. Wheat is listed in the ingredients if that is a concern. While every product does not work for every person, I feel this product gives my hair lift, volume and body.  Even when I just air dry, my hair has much more volume. It remains soft to the touch without being sticky. One bottle will last me quite a few months.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND, AND NOW MY SON, ARE FAITHFUL USERS OF THICKER FULLER HAIR INSTANTLY THICK THICKENING SERUM AND, QUITE FRANKLY, I DO NOTICE THE BIG DIFFERENCE IN THEIR HAIR AND THEIR HAIRDO!  GREAT PRODUCT!  I ONLY WISH WE COULD PURCHASE IT MORE EASILY IN MY COUNTRY (HONDURAS).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do w/o this thickening serum.  I have soft, fine hair ... this product saves me from those bad hair days.</li>
            <li> Found this product to be better than anything else I had tried before. It does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I am not sure what the folks that make this product were thinking when they discontinued their gel, and started making this serum instead. It&#x27;s not bad, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but their gel was EXCELLENT. If you look at reviews for the [now discontinued] gel (some folks still sell it for an outrageous prize), everyone, including me, loved it. This one is a mediocre replacement, at best.

            <li> product is just as described, great gel, easy to order online &amp; not have to go to the store! like it</li>
            <li> This product is super at thickening hair and hence making you look younger and with out any sticky messy buildup. It actually works! For someone who&#x27;s best feature was her long and VERY thick red hair, ageing and loosing most of it has been more than disheartening. It&#x27;s just not me in the mirror anymore. This product not only added years to my look it boosted my ego right along with making me feel and look beautiful again! Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Thicker Fuller Hair Thickening Serum for years.  I never want to be without it!  I have also referred it to my 84 year old sister and a close woman friend of 60+.  Both have very thin straight hair.  My hair is thinning at the crown, and I use this product to especially help fill out this area.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, fine hair that is usually difficult to manage.  I bought this product at Walgreens, and so far I think its working very well. It makes my hair feel more full and thick, when its both wavy and when I dry it straight.</li>
            <li> I started using this brand&#x27;s hairspray &amp; really liked it, so I decided to purchase this serum.  This is a great bargain since it comes in a pack of 2. I used it for the first time today and it seems to be a pretty good product. I have long, fine hair and it adds a little extra boost to the thickness.</li>
