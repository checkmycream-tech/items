    <ol>
            <li>For what it is,  it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>and she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It serves its purpose and is great for travel!</li>
            <li>Priced fairly for the quality.</li>
            <li>Very pleased as was my mother.</li>
            <li>I am planning to order more to use at home, as well as for my pocketbook.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like combing your hair with spikes, and it creates static immediately.  </li>
            <li>Ladies will love the convenience.</li>
            <li>Easy compact brush and comb combination to take along anywhere.  </li>
            <li>So this is the closest replacement that I thought would fit the job.  </li>
            <li>Great little travel comb and brush, nice quality, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I had an old comb like this, nice for my purse.  </li>
            <li>This small collapsible comb fits my wife&#x27;s purse nicely and does a good job of grooming her hair.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;d have preferred a different color, as the light blue looks like some baby-stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Cammo colors would have been great :-)</li>
            <li>Depending on your hair style, you might need a quick comb/brush.</li>
            <li>The seller delivered quickly and I expect my wife to order another of these from this seller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not a styling tool, but if you&#x27;re out for a walk, or shopping, or getting a bite to eat, this is more than adequate.</li>
            <li>I like this comb very much.  </li>
            <li>It is plastic, but seems pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Cheap, fragile plastic.  </li>
            <li>I found this very convenient: it can stay in a pocket and be used when needed.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I believe I shall get much use out of this comb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small comb and hairbrush, foldable which I love for travel and carry in hand bag!  </li>
            <li>I will use it as an extra most likely.</li>
            <li>The plastic is the hard kind and is prone to breaking.</li>
            <li>I had started to give up on a comb, but got tired of that tangled wind-blown look, so was looking for a folding alternative that would easily fit into a pocket, and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice set of bristles on the brush side that are actually quite firm.</li>
            <li>Not Subject</li>
            <li>The teeth are just the right size, both wider on one side and finer on the other.</li>
            <li>this is cheaply made of hard plastic.  </li>

            <li> so it fits in a small evening bag.</li>
            <li> well I suppose things could get gory ...</li>

            <li> This is a little flimsy, but it does the trick.  Lately I&#x27;ve been trying to go most places without a purse, so have been weighing down my pockets with a small cloth wallet, cell phone, Nano, keys, kleenex... well, the list keeps getting longer, and the pockets heavier.  I had started to give up on a comb, but got tired of that tangled wind-blown look, so was looking for a folding alternative that would easily fit into a pocket, and this fit the bill.  Once unfolded, it&#x27;s a comb on one side, and a small brush on the other.  It&#x27;s definitely not a styling tool, but if you&#x27;re out for a walk, or shopping, or getting a bite to eat, this is more than adequate.</li>
            <li> Great little travel comb and brush, nice quality, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Has a nice set of bristles on the brush side that are actually quite firm. Like that it folds in half so it fits in a small evening bag.</li>
            <li> Cheap, fragile plastic.  I sent it back.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my mother who lost her Avon comb that she had for over 30 years.  To replace the vintage comb would have cost $15.00 and up.  So this is the closest replacement that I thought would fit the job.  Very pleased as was my mother.</li>
            <li> I like this comb very much.  I have short hair and it is thinning. The teeth are just the right size, both wider on one side and finer on the other.This comb helps to fluff the hair.  I am planning to order more to use at home, as well as for my pocketbook.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Depending on your hair style, you might need a quick comb/brush. I found this very convenient: it can stay in a pocket and be used when needed.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;d have preferred a different color, as the light blue looks like some baby-stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Cammo colors would have been great :-)</li>
            <li> I had an old comb like this, nice for my purse.  It was made well and lasted 10 years... finally broke... I replaced it with this one... this is cheaply made of hard plastic.  It&#x27;s like combing your hair with spikes, and it creates static immediately.  Not a fan.</li>
            <li> Unless you are searching for a torture device fir your scalp or someone else&#x27;s, I suggest you step away from this brush! If you are a masochist, go for it! You will live the hard bristles digging into your scalp, and if you press hard enough ... well I suppose things could get gory ...&lt;br /&gt;Do Not Subject The Tender Head Of A Child Child To This Atrocity! I BEG YOU!</li>
            <li> Easy compact brush and comb combination to take along anywhere.  It&#x27;s also quite sturdy.  For what it is,  it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This small collapsible comb fits my wife&#x27;s purse nicely and does a good job of grooming her hair. It is well made, is holding up well and she is very happy with it. The seller delivered quickly and I expect my wife to order another of these from this seller. John</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small comb and hairbrush, foldable which I love for travel and carry in hand bag!  Ladies will love the convenience.</li>
            <li> This is small, cheap looking, too hard and not worth the price (very overpriced). I would send it back but not worth my time. I will use it as an extra most likely. Calling one side of it a brush is a misnomer in how I think of a brush&#x27;s bristles being softer.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to slip into my smaller handbags.  It is plastic, but seems pretty sturdy.  One side of it has a single row of teeth while the other side has multiple rows of teeth.  I believe I shall get much use out of this comb.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted. I have two others and needed a third but could not find this item in a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> The plastic is the hard kind and is prone to breaking. The hinge isn&#x27;t snug. It serves its purpose and is great for travel!</li>
            <li> Priced fairly for the quality. If you have thick hair this probably won&#x27;t last long but will do in a pinch.</li>
