            <li>The fact that its retractable is great and the mechanism is good</li>
            <li>A nice product!</li>
            <li>Many of the Ecotools brushes are perfect in both shape and size for mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>but the best thing I love about it is how it does not fall apart</li>
            <li>I love that it contracts into the case, and it&#x27;s the perfect size for a swoosh of blush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice! :0)</li>
            <li>I use it mostly to apply foundation and it helps my foundation blend beautifully!</li>
            <li>it is great for the ones looking for a good brush for powder and blush application on the go.</li>
            <li>Very nice brush and looks like good quality.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly sized and easily fits into my carry around makeup bag.</li>
            <li>And an added bonus is that I can feel good that it is eco-friendly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even take good care of it.</li>
            <li>Its good to apply mineral make-up/ blush.</li>
            <li>Lots of good things about this brush, its compact for a purse-</li>

            <li>These are quite good.</li>
            <li>Price wise, softness, and over all performance.</li>
            <li>and I loved the Eco quality</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good quality, sturdy kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>Works good and brush seems of good quality but the open/close slider (???)</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>I have found that these retractable brushes are as good as the $50 ones they sell.</li>
            <li>I use Bareminerals foundation and the Kabuki brush of their brand shed like a shaggy dog, this one did not, and gives gorgeous coverage.</li>
            <li>the quality for the price is extremely good.  </li>
            <li>I got this because I kept reading about &amp;#34;kabuki&amp;#34; brushes and this one was priced well and had good reviews.</li>
            <li>but not so good for blush.</li>
            <li>I loved this</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>A good price, but</li>
            <li>I think when it was the silver kabuki body it was not as good??????</li>
            <li>This is a handy brush, that retracts and looks attractive.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a good drugstore brush brand that I can trust...</li>
            <li>Brush itself is good though.</li>
            <li>This was for a Christmas gift, and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>their price is very good, and it&#x27;s Eco friendly!</li>
            <li>The price is great and i love the reusable carry</li>
            <li>The brush is very smooth though and feels very nice on your skin.</li>
            <li>I’m very pleased.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s soft and works perfectly with my bronzer</li>
            <li>I love how it can be neatly stored in its own cover.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love them!</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel, super cheap price and super quality!  </li>
            <li>I have great things to say about the actual product but not so great things to say about how it arrived.</li>
            <li>/&gt;would totally recommend this to anyone looking for a great kabuki brush for a great price</li>
            <li>The vegan-and-planet friendly hoopla is a positive, however I&#x27;m more impressed by the quality of the brushes at an affordable price point.</li>
            <li>Great, fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Great brush and important to me is that it is eco friendly.</li>
            <li>I love how it retracts and is SO easy to carry around with me everywhere I go!</li>
            <li>Good value for your money and the product gets to you quickly.</li>
            <li>It blends so nicely &amp; it packs easily</li>
            <li>They wash up nicely with mild face soap and warm water and do not fall apart after being cleaned.</li>
            <li>so far its a very good kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of their products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the price of this, and I love the travel holder it comes in.</li>
            <li>I love how this brush retracts and is travel sized.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I needed more foundation coverage.</li>
            <li>This one is so much softer, has a great coverage AND retracts so</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I absolutelly love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I will update the review in the spring/summer when my skin is more functional :</li>
            <li>I love Ecotools to begin with, and this product just reaffirms it.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s retractable</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to afford to replace them with anything comparable at this time, so I tried these brushes thinking they would be a downgrade....</li>
            <li>BUT the silver one is way better.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush from a store and I must say that this brush is perfect especially if you are going \\&quot;green\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>i love it..</li>
            <li>I LOVE This brush.</li>
            <li>and i love that it retracts into its protective case.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>which is more functional for all-over application.  </li>
            <li>This brush I use for more targeted applications of blushes &amp; bronzers...</li>
            <li>so while I can throw this in my bag and use it for everything, its better at that.</li>
            <li>I love how this retracts and has a lid.  </li>
            <li>but this brush is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have always had such great experience with Ecotools brushes and this is no exception!</li>
            <li>mo3FVQWVTMCHWNN]]I love Ecotools products.</li>
            <li>I love being able to keep it covered.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not prickly like the bareminerals brush, and i feel like it takes in product much better, also.</li>
            <li>I could tell this one is better.  </li>
            <li>So pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love that it has a cap, so I can keep it hygienic.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it twice to apply blush.</li>
            <li>I love the environmental aspects of this company.</li>
            <li>I love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>I took it with me to the Mac store to compare to their Kabuki and I must say I was way more satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li>The bristles are perfect and don&#x27;t fall out all the time like the ones in many brushed I&#x27;ve used and the retractable feature</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a cap, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about makeup residue getting all over the inside of my bag.  </li>
            <li>I would buy two more if these disappeared.</li>
            <li>I do love this brush but it does have a flaw.</li>
            <li>After finding this, i ended up reading some articles about how fancy brushes are one of the most overrated, overpriced things in beauty/makeup products.</li>
            <li>Love this retractable kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage and don&#x27;t mind spending more time to get your makeup on, you might like this, but it just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a bit more snug.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>this would be more of a blush brush.</li>
            <li>so beggar&#x27;s can&#x27;t be choosers :)</li>
            <li>I love there softness and they don&#x60;t shed.</li>
            <li>Really great brush, the container is very durable.  </li>
            <li>What makes it even better is that it is retractable.</li>
            <li>An excellent brush for applying powdered mineral facial make-up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>But I love retractable for my makeup bag and for touchups on the go.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the retractable feature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping there was a problem with the casing for this brush and that the brand&#x27;s nonretractable brushes will be better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with that at this price with no shedding :)</li>
            <li>I bought the blush brush then as well and love it too :-)</li>
            <li>and i love it to apply powder..</li>
            <li>Also, as you buff your face, the liquid foundation gets worked deeper into the bristles and makes cleaning more time-consuming than when powder mineral foundation is used.</li>
            <li>Love the retractable kabuki.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely brush.</li>
            <li>i just love it.</li>
            <li>I love my ecotools retractable Kabuki.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>This retractable Kabuki is so cute and convenient.</li>
            <li>I am used to using Ecotools brushes and I have many.</li>
            <li>lovely brush thank you</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t found one better.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace another retractable brush that I had from a different brand (Two Faced), which was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The kabuki is still flawless after years of constant wear, as is my blush brush.</li>
            <li>It works okay, but kabuki brushes tend to be fulller and stiffer for better coverage.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Unlike many reviewers I have not had any problems with it falling apart.  </li>
            <li>you do need to wash it more often as it picks up more oil from your face.</li>
            <li>I love the brush and use it for travel.</li>
            <li>Love that it retracts.  </li>
            <li>make up bag and just simply love it.</li>
            <li>, I plan on purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Still able to use the brush, but the retractable handle is no longer retractable.</li>
            <li>even better than some over priced brushes from sephora.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>I liked the compact nature of it to fit in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>I would buy more.</li>
            <li>ecotools is probably one of my favorite brush brands.</li>
            <li>wish ALL of my makeup brushes were available this way - eye, lip and concealer!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s probably a better retractable brush you can buy</li>
            <li>and I like this one better.  </li>
            <li>As an added bonus, it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Love the quality and usefulness of this brush, I have one in the office and keep one in my travel makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I love having the brush covered when not in use.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is retractable</li>
            <li>Would try more products from this brand.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many of these, from Mac to a drug store brand.  </li>
            <li>This one seems even better</li>
            <li>and I love that it has the case.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way that it retracts so that the residual powder does not get make-up on anything else.  </li>
            <li>Soft and supple while it perfectly distributes your mineral makeup evenly, all while being environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>I like EcoTools makeup brushes because they are effective, affordable, easily accessible and eco-friendly.</li>
            <li>It is a super soft brush in a perfect size for applying powder.</li>
            <li>Super soft and wonderful.</li>
            <li>beautiful and soft skin</li>
            <li>The quality of the brush itself is pretty good</li>
            <li>I would recommend this earth friendly item!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still using them, and they&#x27;re eco friendly!</li>
            <li>Nice product, received quick.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is a great product, the brush is very soft and does not flake everywhere.</li>
            <li>Very soft and works great.</li>
            <li>It feels great on my soft skin!</li>
            <li>This is the best brush i have found for my mineral foundation, i also use the blush brush for my loose powder.</li>
            <li>It is soft and does not shed bristles, and being able to shrink it into the tube for travel is very handy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and picks up the perfect amount of powder for light touch ups.</li>
            <li>It picks up product well, doesn&#x27;t shed, and the retractile bristles make it super easy to keep it nice.</li>
            <li>(The price is really good for such an exceptional brush)Do not hesitate to buy.</li>
            <li>Not as soft but still works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is an excellent brush with buildable coverage but please keep your specific skin type in mind before using as a full face brush.</li>
            <li>it is SO SOFT and is great at putting on powder.</li>
            <li>this brush is SOOO soft and is GREAT for mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully soft and great design for keeping it compact and protected on the go.</li>
            <li>It Is a great travel &amp; non-travel brush it was really soft</li>
            <li>I love this brush and even after multiple drops and many, many washes it works amazingly!</li>
            <li>It works great, the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>But when I apply my mineral foundation, I like to really buff it into my skin for good coverage.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>No hair fallout and uber easy to clean!  </li>
            <li>That made it kind of snag the bristles unless it is pushed on at just the right angle.</li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t come off during makeup application like some other brushes, and the retractable feature is great, allowing for me to keep it neatly stored in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li>Its easy to wash</li>
            <li>It fits into my makeup bag easily too..</li>
            <li>Retracts into it&#x27;s protective case easily.</li>
            <li>Shorter handle, but easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Will be easy to travel with as well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to carry along with you, travel with, and also stays cleaner when not in use.</li>
            <li>like that it is retractable so that I can pack it easily when I</li>
            <li>I was using the version from elf, but it is not as easy for travel.  </li>
            <li>Tucks away easily when not in use.</li>
            <li>Added bonus: retractable for easy and mess-free travel in purse or suitcase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>The retractable aspect makes it easy to slip into your makeup bag or store in your cosmetics box.</li>
            <li>and I like how I can easily fold it up to store it or to throw it in my purse or make-up bag.</li>
            <li>Easy to travel with</li>
            <li>Easily slides into it&#x27;s case when not in use.  </li>
            <li>But it is practical and easy to use.</li>
            <li>so easy to apply my mineral foundation and does not clump</li>
            <li>Does anyone else&#x27;s have a strong smell?</li>
            <li>/&gt;3/24/14 - the brush is still going strong, with no shedding.</li>
            <li>but I will steer clear of this brand forever, despite the good reviews many people have given their brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the hairs are strong also, haven&#x27;t had any fall out upon cleaning, use, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this brush - it feels very well put together.</li>
            <li>Works great with my bare minerals powder.</li>
            <li>and it is as good as new.</li>
            <li>They are just as good as new after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had it for almost two years now and even after a number of washing/cleaning, it is still as good as new.</li>
            <li>and it comes fine.</li>
            <li>They did everything else fine.</li>
            <li>The case is light aluminum, easy to extend and retract.</li>
            <li>Have used the brush for a week now, and it seems fine, but it turns out i prefer a longer handle to work with.</li>
            <li>super soft, great value.</li>
            <li>Super soft, great to carry in a make up bag or purse but broke in a week</li>
            <li>: Fit the tool to the job and you will do fine.</li>
            <li>This is the greatest little brush i have ever owned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect brush to replace a natural kabuki brush as it is soft and you can control your coverage.  </li>
            <li>The retractable feature is also a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I orginally bought this brush to get me over $25 to make the free shipping.</li>
            <li>And they are a fabulous buy.  </li>
            <li>it is so smooth..</li>
            <li>its bristles are very soft..small and handy</li>
            <li>These EcoTools brushes are fabulous.</li>
            <li>Brush is firm and is of excellent quality.  </li>
            <li>I use it primarily for blush.  </li>
            <li>, the bristles do not fall out even after cleaning &amp; that fact of how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li>the powder goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any powdery streaks on my face.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and stays clean; the metal case is easy to remove with one hand</li>
            <li>I just dab it onto my pressed powder and smooth over my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy retractable brushes are back!</li>
            <li>overall great brush</li>
            <li>The brush is cheap and doesnt hold powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Easy close 2 keep clean.</li>
            <li>I use it for my mineral powder and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is important to note, which is why I&#x27;m giving the background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are cheap and it shows in all</li>
            <li>Cruelty free.</li>
            <li>**cruelty free</li>
            <li>I needed something that would fit inside my purse and</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>This brush wasn&#x27;t as soft as I hoped it would be, but it&#x27;s still a good one.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re someone who has sensitive skin that tends to break out whenever you change things, this may be a good choice for you as a brush.</li>
            <li>whats great about this one is that the top doesn&#x27;t fall off-like with other brands.</li>
            <li>It is helping with my acne to have such I better brush now!!</li>
            <li>I very rarely buy things online, I like to touch/</li>
            <li>I clean it with a spray on daily brush cleanser from Sephora, which works great.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size, works great, and is super soft!</li>
            <li>It was SUPER soft, which is nice for someone who has to use the brush almost three times a day for a week or more.</li>
            <li>makes it super easy to store and keep clean.</li>
            <li>It really is super soft, as advertised, and it seems like a good quality brush.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day and the bristles are super soft, good buy for your money.</li>
            <li>Very soft and compact, I love it!</li>
            <li>I was excited to purchase this blush because of the versatility.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for a small make up bag.</li>
            <li>This is retractable and is just fun to use!  </li>
            <li>It really is worth it!</li>
            <li>The brush falls apart - its not an original EcoTools.</li>
            <li>It is doable, it&#x27;s just doesn&#x27;t close smoothly because I have to align it a certain way before it closes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I love the brush.</li>
            <li>I was upset at the fact that when I got it the one piece came separate right away and seemed to have been cheaply put together but overall great brush.</li>
            <li>This little brush is great, I read all of the reviews before getting it and am glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>thanks not as good as the other one they use to make but its still good</li>
            <li>It keeps in clean.  </li>
            <li>If, however, you have a makeup case or basket or drawer, and you want a brush that will stay clean, forget about it.</li>
            <li>The retractable feature comes in handy more than I thought, especially since I started to keep it in my purse.</li>
            <li>I is heaven sent to be retractable to help it stay clean from dirt.  </li>
            <li>To be able to keep a brush this soft in my purse, is a treat :)  </li>
            <li>so I can keep it clean.</li>
            <li>After seeing how much they cost in the store, I was delighted to find this one so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>quality is very fine, smooth and soft, easy to clean, not that easy to dry, but very suitable for traveling.</li>
            <li>A very soft yet stable brush, it was so nice just to use it on my face.  </li>
            <li>I love the cruelty-free premise of EcoTools, so I gave this brush a try after reading mostly positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my first one for well over 5 years, and it&#x27;s still good as new.</li>
            <li>So I like to have a retractable brush which will keep the brush in good shape and clean (especially if I am traveling).</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles and I love that it retracts!</li>
            <li>So far very please and the price is amazing!</li>
            <li>I tried the blush brush first and loved the price and how soft it was.</li>
            <li>for so many people to rave about it so much.  </li>
            <li>the full coverage brush</li>
            <li>Good size not too big.</li>
            <li>It feels like cool silk across my face.  </li>
            <li>granted, this is my only kabuki ever, but it is damn good.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this much yet, but I love the design and practicality of it.  </li>
            <li>I love the whole Eco tools line of brushes</li>
            <li>I got this brush today, and I&#x27;m sure, like others, I had to try it out straight</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t have a full report yet.</li>
            <li>It has good bristles, and is dense enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Considering everything, it&#x27;s an overall good brush.</li>
            <li>I think it gives powder a nice natural finish.</li>
            <li>The only &#x27;good&#x27; thing was that I received it about 3 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>THis is a cool retractable brush</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend !  </li>
            <li>--I really did want to love this.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>So that being said this brush is awesome and get it at Walmart if you need the comfort of knowing you will get a easy refund if your not happy.</li>
            <li>It picks up the right amount of powder to leave a smooth finish on the skin, no need to tap off the brush, so</li>
            <li>If I futz with it a bit I can get it to slide back into the cap, but most of the time I just leave it out, which is fine but defeats the purpose of a retractable brush!</li>
            <li>This kabuki is light and thick and very good for travelling.</li>
            <li>Very soft exactly what i wanted im in love with this brush!</li>
            <li>Overall, especially considering the price, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Super glue it is.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s basically just super glued in.</li>
            <li>Not the super dense brush I was expecting</li>
            <li>All in all a wonderful brush that is soft and doesn&#x27;t shed, just as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Would love to see a smaller version for even better portability.</li>
            <li>It is very soft, and I absolutely love how it folds up inside of itself (keeps it clean and compact).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and am eager to try more from this brand.</li>
            <li>Only used once but so far so good!</li>
            <li>If the makeup bag you normally carry is more like an [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem as cheap quality wise as some of the other reviewers have felt it to be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the price but not thick enough in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d have to shell out $30 or so for a good one, but when I came across this one, I decided I&#x27;d just give it a shot (mostly because I was too lazy to go to another store).</li>
            <li>but it looks very natural and a lot better.</li>
            <li>Ecotools makes the most reasonably priced, high quality brushes available.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, it is very soft and compacts</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I really love how soft the brushes are!</li>
            <li>When this first arrived my wife was excited to use it.</li>
            <li>love this brush, soft and compact!</li>
            <li>Two thumbs up, I highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li>The brush feels soft against my cheeks and applies powder easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Super soft bristles and cruelty free!  </li>
            <li>Great, small, easy and does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>The construction seems very sturdy and I haven&#x27;t experienced any loose hairs.</li>
            <li>After 35+ years of using makeup, I have finally found the PERFECT makeup brush for use with loose mineral makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have little to no experience purchasing brushes for make up but this turned out to be a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great compact little brush.</li>
            <li>I also have used other brushes, including ones by Mac, and this by far is the softest and most pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>An all round great brush</li>
            <li>I have NEVER seen a makeup brush- even cheap dollar store ones- fall apart so fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased EcoTools retractable blush brush before and had much success with it.  </li>
            <li>Comparable retractable synthetic kabuki brushes start at more than double the price at leading cosmetics stores, so this looked like a fabulous beauty bargain...</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>i like that it&#x27;s retractable, all of my friends were so amazed that it was and found it so useful to just toss on the go..</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to most brushes but this one did not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Btw, that old silver aluminum one was built better than this newer bronze one.</li>
            <li>I rarely wear makeup</li>
            <li>It is really soft to the touch and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I love how soft this brush is.  </li>
            <li>That is a nice added feature and it doesn&#x27;t impact the way you use it at home on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>this is a soft not so dense brush that seems better suited for powder foundations and/or blushes....</li>
            <li>Love this brush, so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d previously been using the Bare Escentuals Retractable Flawless Application Face Brush, which sells for $30.</li>
            <li>The actual brush, on the other hand, is great!</li>
            <li>I went between this brush and a too faced retractable brush, but I decided on this one based on prior experience with the brand and the wonderful price compared to the other one.</li>
            <li>It did change colors right before I bought it.  </li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t drop it or anything, the barrel just slid right off and wouldn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>It is large &amp; full.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I use this with bare minerals and love the buffing effect it has.</li>
            <li>It lasts long, it&#x27;s compact but has a nice weight to it, and puts powder on evenly.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no shedding, it&#x27;s very easy to clean, and is way cheaper than other brushes i&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and bristles/ hair are strong and dont fall on my face.</li>
            <li>Overall its a great brush especially if you want an all-purpose brush that you want to throw in your bag when you travel.</li>
            <li>Soft and easy to use and carry.</li>
            <li>Soft, compact, and brush hairs do not fall out easily.</li>
            <li>Soft and easy to use .</li>
            <li>Love this because it is sooo soft, applies powder evenly, and the retractable feature keeps bristles straight and together without ever smooshing out.</li>
            <li>a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this brush for travel and as a spare while cleaning my primary brush and was very surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>This works great, and I love that it retracts--takes up a lot less space that way, and doesn&#x27;t sprinkle loose powder all over everything because it&#x27;s covered in my bag.</li>
            <li>I used the first one for a couple of years until the bristles started to wear out--I liked it so much that I purchased a second one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice, soft brush that is a great replacement for the powder puff I have been using to apply my mineral powder foundation for the last few years.</li>
            <li>It also holds up very well with regard to washing/air-drying and is very travel friendly.</li>
            <li>so i bought a new set eventually with NEW brushes and they ended up shedding more.</li>
            <li>If it were possible,  I would give it more than 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>since the first time I retracted the brush, and reopened it, it fell apart.</li>
            <li>It worked really well!</li>
            <li>I also bought 2 other styles and I love them as well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for several months now and love it.</li>
            <li>I had to buy another, larger, non-retractable brush that has its hairs more spread out</li>
            <li>When I first tried to make it restract, I couldn&#x27;t figure it out and realized it was because I was trying to twist it instead of slide it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this brush and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>I had a problem with my first brush because it must have been dented during shipping to the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>After it dries it is exactly as before you washed it.</li>
            <li>When I got my first one I had no problems at all washing it</li>
            <li>but I think I may have used water that was too hot one time and the brush fell out of the handle and it came apart.</li>
            <li>Make up goes on smooth and the brush feels like baby bunny hair, so soft.  </li>
            <li>This was my first EcoTools purchase, chosen because of it is made of synthetic and recycled materials.</li>
            <li>The top on this thing is a total joke.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this brush for a couple of weeks now, so I can&#x27;t speak of its lasting-quality, but it is a perfect size for the small cosmetics bag</li>
            <li>I like the latter one better.  </li>
            <li>(probably would&#x27;ve cost more both financially and environmentally to do so!).</li>
            <li>Soft and applies powder smoothly.</li>
            <li>At first it was just one or two, but then a clump of hairs came out.</li>
            <li>I really like that it is retractable too!</li>
            <li>My first kabuki brush, well one that wasn&#x27;t purchased a part of mineral powder package.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>Came apart the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>However, I have been using Ecotools brushes for several years and after washing/cleaning them the brushes still are outstanding and don&#x27;t lose their bristles.  </li>
            <li>Still, overall, will work OK for travel.</li>
            <li>My favorite and only brush.  </li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>It is pretty and</li>
            <li>Will look for a higher quality one that won&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li>So far hairs haven&#x27;t fell out of the brush like a lot of cheap brushes do.</li>
            <li>I think it was exactly what she wanted for Christmas.</li>
            <li>it is still super-soft, fluffy, in good shape and not shedding at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still use them because I love the brush so much, but it is so disappointing not to be able to retract them for more compact (and sanitary!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and gives a fresh, even look to your makeup when applying.</li>
            <li>And since the bristles retract, the brush stays far cleaner than any other makeup brushes I have ever used, which also makes it the perfect on-the-go brush, for both daily touch-ups and traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works well to distribute powder and stores neatly and easily without making a mess, but it is too large to be truly &#x27;purse friendly&#x27; or fit in a makeup bag, which to me is the whole point of a retractable brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very soft and full.</li>
            <li>Not dense enough for good liquid foundation makeup, and yet the bristles are a bit tight for easy application of blush...</li>
            <li>Very High quality brush... larger than most travel size brushes</li>
            <li>I can easily retract the brush, put the lid on, and take it on a trip in a bag, or even at home, easily have it free-standing on the counter instead of having the brush touch some surface when rested and have an icky feeling that it may not be completely clean.</li>
            <li>This is my first kabuki brush and I am amazed at how soft and full the brush is.</li>
            <li>i bought a different set which had another kabuki in it because i love it so much.</li>
            <li>As a result, the metal cap was more oval-ish than round and wouldn&#x27;t fit onto the the brush.</li>
            <li>So finally it occurred to me to check Amazon and this brush seemed like a good option as I was looking for something simple with a cover.</li>
            <li>I purchased one of these at a local store and love it so much.  </li>
            <li>This is super soft!</li>
            <li>Super soft and does not shed!</li>
            <li>Super soft kabuki brush!  </li>
            <li>Super soft Kabuki Brush!  </li>
            <li>this works perfectly with mineral products, and i actually like the brush a LOT more than other kabuki brushes I&#x27;ve had before, even the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I came across the Eco Tools retractable Kabuki Brush and after reading the positive reviews, decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this kabuki brush after reading all of the positive reviews written by others on this site and others as well.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft, as was expected, and very cute.</li>
            <li>This brush works better than any high dollar big name blush brush!  </li>
            <li>This brush, like all ecotools brushes, is super soft.</li>
            <li>so my skin is more dry than combination.</li>
            <li>Super soft and picks up my mineral foundation</li>
            <li>Super soft and plush, bristles don&#x27;t get bent or fall out, and recycled to boot.  </li>
            <li>Super soft</li>
            <li>That does not shed, is super soft and compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the money I think I definitely got more than enough use out of it, and liked it so much that I bought the same product again.</li>
            <li>The brush is super soft, quite dense, doesn&#x27;t shed and applies powder evenly and generously allowing for fuller coverage.</li>
            <li>You could go to Sephora and easily pay 5x for a similar brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as simple as using better glue because I have tried hot glueing AND super glueing the bases back into place</li>
            <li>This brush is LARGE and the fact that it&#x27;s retractable is a bonus-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many of my brushes for ten years, and they look and feel like new.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush for applying loose powder.</li>
            <li>Love this for using loose powder on the go.</li>
            <li>My face is very picky and loves to be super sensitive.</li>
            <li>This brush felt soft and silky and I loved it, until it fell apart less than a week after purchase.  </li>
            <li>The basic things everyone wants out of their makeup brushes are softness, easy care, bristles that don&#x27;t shed, and effectiveness at putting on the makeup they are intended to be used with.</li>
            <li>For the cost, the quality is very high.</li>
            <li>This one really feels more like a loose powder blush brush.  </li>
            <li>Alima Pure very well.</li>
            <li>I use BareMinerals and the application is even and looks very natural, don&#x27;t need a lot of product either!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s HUGE, I was expecting something the size of the urban decay one, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with this brush so far, but I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks so far.</li>
            <li>No complaints, it fits into my makeup pouch for my purse very well.</li>
            <li>I really needed a replacement but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much on a brush, so I decided to search for alternatives.</li>
            <li>It takes up a way too much room in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I also expected it to be extendable lengthwise, but the top just retracts into the handle.</li>
            <li>this brush is really very gud..</li>
            <li>The cap also doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, so I might end up throwing it away and keeping the plastic display holder that it came in.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This brush, along with a spoolie for my eyebrows, is really all I need.  </li>
            <li>the price, you really get what you paid for AND so much</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorites because of the bristle density and how gentle on the skin it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like it and</li>
            <li>The brush I received was a different, cheap one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed much at all and holds its shape really well.</li>
            <li>In fact, I like it so much that I gave one to my daughter-in-law</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>very sleek packaging and densely packed.</li>
            <li>I also noticed it doesn&#x27;t hold the product very evenly, and thus doesn&#x27;t disperse the product as evenly as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Annemarie C</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a retractable Real Techniques brush at Ulta instead in time for my trip, and it does the job.</li>
            <li>The bristles are much softer than the BE model.  </li>
            <li>Very practical.</li>
            <li>but this is the only one that EcoTools have available</li>
            <li>and I really like Eco Tools brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really portable.  </li>
            <li>Works really well with powders too.</li>
            <li>A really like this brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>my only beef with it is that after a year of use, the sliding tube that holes the brush kind of broke off of the outside metal tube.</li>
            <li>Its soft and fluffy and feels good on skin.</li>
            <li>so I like/use it as a travel foundation applicator that I take in my purse (especially since it closes and won&#x27;t make a mess), but it cannot compare to a good quality flat top kabuki brush for home use.  </li>
            <li>I bought the kabuki brush a few years ago and was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it--and at a fraction of the price that you might pay for brushes of lesser quality, it is as easy on your pocketbook as on your skin.</li>
            <li>The brush is super soft and feels like a fancy high quality brush, not something you can find at drugstores.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s worth it to return and get a new one, but just thought I&#x27;d share to see if anyone experienced the same thing.</li>
            <li>Ordered this brush for my powder,&lt;br /&gt;was shipped very fast, and I like the way you use the brush, the bristles are VERY soft and have not had a problem with them shedding yet.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Some of the smaller brushes I used to carry in my purse, even though I had them wrapped in a cloth case, got battered pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The bristles are incredibly soft and silky, with just the right amount of density.</li>
            <li>I used some Loctite gel super glue (My favorite) around the original glue and placed the round of bristles back in the original location and have been going on strong for at least 3 months.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it does not shed at all unlike some of the other $30 brushes I have.  </li>
            <li>I have other ecotools products that i LOVE</li>
            <li>Turns out it is better than I even expected!</li>
            <li>other retractable kabuki better.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this brush on a whim at my local K-mart.  </li>
            <li>The brush is absolutely worth the small price and it performs better than a $30 kabuki.</li>
            <li>I ordered this particular item because I already have an EcoTools kabuki brush and really like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly soft, durable, and very, very portable, given the retraction.  </li>
            <li>I just got my new one which I will be more careful cleaning</li>
            <li>I am quickly falling in love with EcoTools and have ordered several other brushes since.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh out of the ziploc-like packaging the brushed aluminum case looked great, though larger than expected.</li>
            <li>First one I&#x27;ve ever found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and it does miraculous things with my powder.</li>
            <li>It is a nice compact size and fits perfectly in my small make up bag.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li>I can afford to replace much more easily although so far the quality seems about the same as previous brushes.</li>
            <li>I typically will wash all of my brushes in warm soapy water, but because this is attached to the metal, I&#x27;m sure if it will rust or dry properly.</li>
            <li>This brush is large and so very soft.  </li>
            <li>After almost a year, still looks and performs like new!</li>
            <li>I prefer my travel brushes to be retractable, so I was glad I found this for way less than the store prices.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll want to leave this brush behind since it will take up most of the available space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying the same product line again when I need more brushes.</li>
            <li>so i super glued it back.</li>
            <li>I like this Kabuki mainly because it is a retractable brush.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, but decent quality.</li>
            <li>The aluminum handle and bristle guard are strong and haven&#x27;t bent yet, and I&#x27;m rough on things.  </li>
            <li>Brush is very dense and very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft!</li>
            <li>Easily packable for travel and purse, and large enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this brush for blushes and loose mineral powders.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush as an alternative to those of you who&#x27;ve been using the pricey BE tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>and I can not believe the price compared to the high priced name brand brushes this one out performes them all.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, as well as all ecotool beauty products.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brush rivals that of high end brushes like Aveda&#x27;s kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone who finds themselves applying makeup when they are out and about a lot</li>
            <li>Highly recommended....</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and all EcoTools products.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the only one I use, buffs my powder foundation better than any other brush and is more sanitary/convenient than loose brushes.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and my makeup goes on sooo much better than other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Like some other reviews said, it was not cost effective to send it back.  </li>
            <li>Love this little brush.</li>
            <li>Ecotool products are also for sale at Bed Bath and Beyond for a little more money.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it picks up very little product and does not offer good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This a great alternative to expensive kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li>I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid castile soap to clean the brushes, then stand them upright to dry in a ceramic toothbrush holder I have repurposed for my brushes.</li>
            <li>like it so much (quality and soft)</li>
            <li>for anyone who&#x27;s looking to use this brush with liquid foundation: I tried using this brush with liquid foundation too, to test versatility, and it was a no-go; the brush seems just too dense for a smooth application; the bristles tend to drag as you buff/stipple the liquid onto your skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft and puts my foundation on very well.</li>
            <li>I started replacing a lot of my brushes with the ecotools brand because the hairs on the brush are so soft and never irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li>Normally I would have asked for a replacement, but I could tell by the construction it wouldn&#x27;t be an isolated incident.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same size as my BeautiControl and Arbonne kabuki brushes and feels as good if not better than they do</li>
            <li>you have normal to combination skin, this brush is a winner.</li>
            <li>I travel with it and use it a few times a day most days.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s good but definitely not great.</li>
            <li>The brush is fine - like any other kabuki brush, but the cap keeps falling off (it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;click&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This retractable one last through wash after wash after wash and is super soft.</li>
            <li>The brush is very very soft and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Paris Presents Inc. and Stacy got back to me right away and sent a replacement brush and a gift.  </li>
            <li>I did find this brand at Walmart, as an FYI, right about the same price.</li>
            <li>when it arrived, it was super soft and I loved that it was retractable-was hoping for no more powder mess in my make up bag.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are accurate and I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li>This brush, and every other Ecotools brush I have tried, fit every criteria.</li>
            <li>Only a few fibers fell out at first (maybe 8 at the most).  </li>
            <li>As is usual with EcoTools brushes, the bristles are super soft and it is a breeze to clean.</li>
            <li>If it wears out I&#x27;m just going to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I was also in need of a new brush as well.</li>
            <li>and I re-ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>So I went out in search of a new powder brush.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t think twice about ordering a new brush online.</li>
            <li>I talked with live chat</li>
            <li>particularly like this retractable kabuki brush because it has a cap that completely covers and protects the bristles.</li>
            <li>I have had much better luck with my retractable pink one by a different brand.</li>
            <li>bristles!&lt;br /&gt;The company behind ecotools is exceptional also.  </li>
            <li>I love this little brush!</li>
            <li>--it has an odd smell to it, very noticeable when you use it to put powder right around your nose!</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s incredibly soft and has a high quality feel.  </li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>brush is very soft and feels like silk as it glides across my face.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and do not break off.</li>
            <li>Excelent brush, very soft and usefull for my travel makeup</li>
            <li>but I did not think it was very soft.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and cruelty-free bristles and bamboo handle-</li>
            <li>Very soft and hair stays on the brush.  </li>
            <li>The brush itself is very soft and works well.</li>
            <li>Very soft, I use it with my bareminerals powder foundation.</li>
            <li>Evenly applies my bronzer and has very soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have no problems with this brush.  </li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable for such a quality brush.  </li>
            <li>Very soft brush.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>It performs even better than the Bare Escentuals brush, and costs $20 less.</li>
            <li>You can very easily adjust the brush by sliding it up a little (which makes the brush firmer) for a heavier coverage or keeping the brush fully open for a bronzer or mineral powder.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>So soft!  </li>
            <li>This brush is so soft!</li>
            <li>The first (and only) time I used this brush, the hairs started coming out.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a backup since I lost my first ecotools kabuki from two years ago recently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>a second brush to use when I&#x27;m cleaning the first</li>
            <li>Looked like a giant wad of hot glue and bristles inside.  </li>
            <li>This one beats it all, this is the 3rd one purchased in 4 years, not because they don&#x27;t last, but because i use it everyday and think its a good idea to throw away makeup after a years use.  </li>
            <li>I do have a problem with my face powder which is nearly empty and hollow in the middle and the brush doesn&#x27;t seem to grab enough but is still a great brush.</li>
            <li>and I have been looking for the right brush for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Also, the brush extends a little too far so the cap does not slide on as easily as it should.  </li>
            <li>The only positive I have is that it retracts.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and there is no excessive shedding.</li>
            <li>I also see these tools at the local super drug and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>no mess!</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my Bare Escentuals kabuki brush -- but wanted to avoid the high cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it five stars, but I just have a hard time giving anything five stars unless I feel that it couldn&#x27;t better.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s retractable is super convenient for not getting powder on other things when you place it in your bag.  </li>
            <li>This brush is perfect for applying face powder without leaving coarse little bristles behind.</li>
            <li>It is worth the buy and measures up to much more expensive Kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a Kabuki brush that was soft and didn&#x27;t shed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>soft and being retractable is convenient to carry along in my purse, although I wish the cap would not come off that easilly</li>
            <li>(keep in mind to NOT retract it when drying, it should be completely exposed to air).</li>
            <li>bristles itself is extremely soft.</li>
            <li>This talkon brush is wonderfully soft and dense.</li>
            <li>The brush is soooo soft.</li>
            <li>Terrific brush for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly soft, and whenever my friends come over they comment on how soft it is.</li>
            <li>Maybe my face is to sensitive.</li>
            <li>So the water never dried out and the brush ended smelling.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and dense.  </li>
            <li>but yea, i was surprised when it just popped out.</li>
            <li>i use bareminerals mineral makeup, and i thought my brushes shed because they were old...</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft but hold their shape.  </li>
            <li>The Ecotools brushes are soft and don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>This brush is soooo soft</li>
            <li>have had it for over a month, hasn&#x27;t shed one hair and is still soft</li>
            <li>I looooove how soft this brush is.</li>
            <li>, no bristles have fallen off, it is soft and functional.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft, but it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;incredibly soft&amp;#34; as product description says.</li>
            <li>I use it to apply my MAC SKinFinish natural powder.</li>
            <li>Soft and portable.</li>
            <li>Brush is soft and appears to be well made.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The brush itself is extremely soft and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re blissfully soft, they&#x27;ve lasted me for years</li>
            <li>It is too soft.</li>
            <li>Use it frequently.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush because my old powder brush needed replacement.  </li>
            <li>I was happily surprised to discover how soft it is.  </li>
            <li>REALLY REALLY REALLY soft.  </li>
            <li>Soft bristles that don&#x27;t fall out and stick to my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft but I feel like I cant get any blush or bronzer on with it.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and seems well made but is not as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I like it; the brush is soft.</li>
            <li>They are also not as soft, and shed a tad more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my gripe is that the ENTIRE brush- the whole cover to the brush itself- fell off within two weeks.</li>
            <li>Washed it like 2 times and the brush completely fell apart from the metal bit at the bottom.</li>
            <li>It is compact and really soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and do not come away when using.  </li>
            <li>Really soft.  </li>
            <li>, looks professional each and every time.</li>
            <li>This is a soft and portable kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft they had to be stolen from an angel wing.  </li>
            <li>After I tried to re-bend it back to a more round shape it sort of fits onto the brush</li>
            <li>but I think it is worth it since my last one lasted several years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have seen expensive brushes at sephore etc, its honestly as good.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when it arrived but the packaging it come in made it really hard to get the brush out without bending the bristles.</li>
            <li>This was a good brush, but the little part that you use to adjust it wouldn&#x27;t stay put like other similar brushes I have used.</li>
            <li>Also, it is soft, not stiff &amp; rough like so many other brushes.</li>
            <li>I am going back and buying two more, one for my mom and the other for an extra.</li>
            <li>Their other brushes are nice, but don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shedding: I have never seen a single bristle shed, though another brand shed horrendously the first time I washed them--what a waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness</li>
            <li>I needed a brush to use for my powder foundation and couldn&#x27;t find one that I liked in local stores or pharmacies that wasn&#x27;t a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li>It also was small enough to fit into my case without causing too much of a shuffle.</li>
            <li>This brush is just as good - if not better! - than the Bare Minerals (or more expensive brand name kabuki) brush.</li>
            <li>I like to rotate through them so that I can have a clean one to use every few days.</li>
            <li>The soft bristles are securely attached and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding over the past two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I think my specific product was just defected because I have used the exact same one for over a year</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this brush, but don&#x27;t buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because the cap is a little loose fitting.</li>
            <li>Because the bristles are so thick they can take over a day to dry completely, so it&#x27;s nice to have a backup.</li>
            <li>This brush is a lot like Bare Minerals full coverage brush for much less money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft on your skin, and I use it for my bare minerals powder foundation.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and Don&#x27;t shed at all like the Bare essentials do.</li>
            <li>but this just bounces back to brand new again.</li>
            <li>the actual brush is SOFT SOFT</li>
            <li>I save so much money for what is essentially the same brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soooo soft and i love that it retracks and had a lid, makes one less thing to make a mess in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>If I have the income again in the future, I&#x27;d return to my Bare Escentuals brushes for any new purchases.</li>
            <li>This retractable brush broke apart in my small, soft hands the very first time I opened it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned high, mid and low end brushes.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush due to all of the positive reviews I read about it</li>
            <li>After reading other positive reviews online, I decided to try this item from Ectools.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to do a primary application on one section of my face at a time, then a secondary \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; with just a dusting of powder.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how long they will last but don&#x27;t foresee them falling apart as fast as the BE&#x27;s do.</li>
            <li>I got this to replace my bare mineral brush.</li>
            <li>I used it with bare minerals foundation</li>
            <li>I use Bare Minerals or Smashbox foundation powder.</li>
            <li>I have been using bare minerals powder makeup for 5 years and have gone through every brand of Kabuki brush out there.</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my Bare Escentuals Kabuki Brush, and I couldn&#x27;t resist the price of this Ecotools</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy the Bare Escentuals Kabuki Brush again at about three times the price,</li>
            <li>It does not retract far enough for my needs.</li>
            <li>It completely came apart into 3 different pieces, cant even get it to stay together if I try</li>
            <li>I use these guys for Bare Minerals Foundation.</li>
            <li>The texture is not rough and scratchy.  </li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals Kabuki Brush quality.</li>
            <li>The bristle are soft enough and plentiful, but they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; the product the way BE brushes do.</li>
            <li>So soft and satisfies my inner germaphobe.</li>
            <li>I used a $25 Bare Escentuals brush for 3 years until it was worn out.  </li>
            <li>got this to replace my retractable kabuki brush i got from bare minerals to use with their products.</li>
            <li>arrived in pieces...not worth the trouble to return.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but the cap seems tight and very think, worried that the cap will eventually crack because of that.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I&#x27;m not sure about is how to clean it.</li>
            <li>I wish the brush was thicker, but compared to other brushes on Amazon, this is really well-priced.  </li>
            <li>The price in Amazon is much cheaper than other places.</li>
            <li>Not quite as soft as the other ecotools brushes that I&#x27;ve purchased but still very soft.</li>
            <li>Initially I was concerned they wouldn&#x27;t be soft enough, however they are the softest I have ever felt.</li>
            <li>its actually much softer and better and sheds less (not at all so far, actually, in the 3 months i&#x27;ve had it) than the expensive old brush.</li>
            <li>and I love the casing, but I&#x27;m starting to think the retractor in my brush is broken?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a week now, its very soft and hasn&#x27;t shed a single hair.</li>
            <li>reading reviews for this brush here, and in other venues, I decided that it must be at least okay</li>
            <li>I recently bought Bare Eccentuals Mineral makeup and wasn&#x27;t too fond of the brush that came with it.</li>
            <li>- instead I tried to make do with them as replacements for my Bare Escentuals brushes and they simply will not do the job for me.</li>
            <li>As for performance, it is as decent as any of my other taklon kabukis.  </li>
            <li>Some girl stole my kabuki that I had from Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s Bare Bronze line (I used to work there, so it was cheap with my discount).</li>
            <li>It is a little big, but definitely still pretty portable (I keep it in my purse for touch ups throughout the day.)</li>
            <li>This is my second one, the first lasted a few years before the glue finally gave way inside</li>
            <li>This is very soft, but quite a bit smaller than I expected it.</li>
            <li>Since the Bare Essential brushes are three times the price and last no more than six months I thought as long as these last six months they are worth it.</li>
            <li>The bristles are VERY soft compared to my experience of other Kabuki brushes.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The make-up itself was wonderful but none of the brushes cut it.</li>
            <li> When it came, oh my gosh, it was perfect.</li>
            <li> If I have one issue it can&#x27;t have five, it has to be PERFECT!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> The case is awesome, it pulls the brush into the case so you can slip on the cap without damaging the bristles.  </li>

            <li> A nice product!</li>
            <li> Many of the Ecotools brushes are perfect in both shape and size for mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> but the best thing I love about it is how it does not fall apart</li>
            <li> I love that it contracts into the case, and it&#x27;s the perfect size for a swoosh of blush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice! :0)</li>
            <li> I use it mostly to apply foundation and it helps my foundation blend beautifully!</li>

            <li> and I loved the Eco quality</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good quality, sturdy kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> Works good and brush seems of good quality but the open/close slider (???)</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> I have found that these retractable brushes are as good as the $50 ones they sell.</li>
            <li> I use Bareminerals foundation and the Kabuki brush of their brand shed like a shaggy dog, this one did not, and gives gorgeous coverage.</li>
            <li> the quality for the price is extremely good.  </li>
            <li> I got this because I kept reading about &amp;#34;kabuki&amp;#34; brushes and this one was priced well and had good reviews.</li>
            <li> but not so good for blush.</li>
            <li> I loved this</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> A good price, but</li>
            <li> I think when it was the silver kabuki body it was not as good??????</li>
            <li> This is a handy brush, that retracts and looks attractive.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a good drugstore brush brand that I can trust...</li>
            <li> Brush itself is good though.</li>
            <li> This was for a Christmas gift, and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> their price is very good, and it&#x27;s Eco friendly!</li>

            <li> They wash up nicely with mild face soap and warm water and do not fall apart after being cleaned.</li>
            <li> so far its a very good kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of their products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the price of this, and I love the travel holder it comes in.</li>
            <li> I love how this brush retracts and is travel sized.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I needed more foundation coverage.</li>
            <li> This one is so much softer, has a great coverage AND retracts so</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I absolutelly love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I will update the review in the spring/summer when my skin is more functional :</li>
            <li> I love Ecotools to begin with, and this product just reaffirms it.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s retractable</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to afford to replace them with anything comparable at this time, so I tried these brushes thinking they would be a downgrade....</li>
            <li> BUT the silver one is way better.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush from a store and I must say that this brush is perfect especially if you are going \\&quot;green\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> i love it..</li>
            <li> I LOVE This brush.</li>
            <li> and i love that it retracts into its protective case.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> which is more functional for all-over application.  </li>
            <li> This brush I use for more targeted applications of blushes &amp; bronzers...</li>
            <li> so while I can throw this in my bag and use it for everything, its better at that.</li>
            <li> I love how this retracts and has a lid.  </li>
            <li> but this brush is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have always had such great experience with Ecotools brushes and this is no exception!</li>
            <li> mo3FVQWVTMCHWNN]]I love Ecotools products.</li>
            <li> I love being able to keep it covered.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not prickly like the bareminerals brush, and i feel like it takes in product much better, also.</li>
            <li> I could tell this one is better.  </li>
            <li> So pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love that it has a cap, so I can keep it hygienic.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it twice to apply blush.</li>
            <li> I love the environmental aspects of this company.</li>
            <li> I love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I took it with me to the Mac store to compare to their Kabuki and I must say I was way more satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li> The bristles are perfect and don&#x27;t fall out all the time like the ones in many brushed I&#x27;ve used and the retractable feature</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a cap, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about makeup residue getting all over the inside of my bag.  </li>
            <li> I would buy two more if these disappeared.</li>
            <li> I do love this brush but it does have a flaw.</li>
            <li> After finding this, i ended up reading some articles about how fancy brushes are one of the most overrated, overpriced things in beauty/makeup products.</li>
            <li> Love this retractable kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage and don&#x27;t mind spending more time to get your makeup on, you might like this, but it just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a bit more snug.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> this would be more of a blush brush.</li>
            <li> so beggar&#x27;s can&#x27;t be choosers :)</li>
            <li> I love there softness and they don&#x60;t shed.</li>
            <li> Really great brush, the container is very durable.  </li>
            <li> What makes it even better is that it is retractable.</li>
            <li> An excellent brush for applying powdered mineral facial make-up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> But I love retractable for my makeup bag and for touchups on the go.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the retractable feature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping there was a problem with the casing for this brush and that the brand&#x27;s nonretractable brushes will be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with that at this price with no shedding :)</li>
            <li> I bought the blush brush then as well and love it too :-)</li>
            <li> and i love it to apply powder..</li>
            <li> Also, as you buff your face, the liquid foundation gets worked deeper into the bristles and makes cleaning more time-consuming than when powder mineral foundation is used.</li>
            <li> Love the retractable kabuki.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely brush.</li>
            <li> i just love it.</li>
            <li> I love my ecotools retractable Kabuki.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> This retractable Kabuki is so cute and convenient.</li>
            <li> I am used to using Ecotools brushes and I have many.</li>
            <li> lovely brush thank you</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t found one better.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another retractable brush that I had from a different brand (Two Faced), which was wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The kabuki is still flawless after years of constant wear, as is my blush brush.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but kabuki brushes tend to be fulller and stiffer for better coverage.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Unlike many reviewers I have not had any problems with it falling apart.  </li>
            <li> you do need to wash it more often as it picks up more oil from your face.</li>
            <li> I love the brush and use it for travel.</li>
            <li> Love that it retracts.  </li>
            <li> make up bag and just simply love it.</li>
            <li> , I plan on purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Still able to use the brush, but the retractable handle is no longer retractable.</li>
            <li> even better than some over priced brushes from sephora.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> I liked the compact nature of it to fit in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li> I would buy more.</li>
            <li> ecotools is probably one of my favorite brush brands.</li>
            <li> wish ALL of my makeup brushes were available this way - eye, lip and concealer!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s probably a better retractable brush you can buy</li>
            <li> and I like this one better.  </li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and usefulness of this brush, I have one in the office and keep one in my travel makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I love having the brush covered when not in use.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is retractable</li>
            <li> Would try more products from this brand.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many of these, from Mac to a drug store brand.  </li>
            <li> This one seems even better</li>
            <li> and I love that it has the case.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way that it retracts so that the residual powder does not get make-up on anything else.  </li>
            <li> Soft and supple while it perfectly distributes your mineral makeup evenly, all while being environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> I like EcoTools makeup brushes because they are effective, affordable, easily accessible and eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> It is a super soft brush in a perfect size for applying powder.</li>
            <li> Super soft and wonderful.</li>
            <li> beautiful and soft skin</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush itself is pretty good</li>
            <li> I would recommend this earth friendly item!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still using them, and they&#x27;re eco friendly!</li>
            <li> Nice product, received quick.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is a great product, the brush is very soft and does not flake everywhere.</li>
            <li> Very soft and works great.</li>
            <li> It feels great on my soft skin!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush i have found for my mineral foundation, i also use the blush brush for my loose powder.</li>
            <li> It is soft and does not shed bristles, and being able to shrink it into the tube for travel is very handy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and picks up the perfect amount of powder for light touch ups.</li>
            <li> It picks up product well, doesn&#x27;t shed, and the retractile bristles make it super easy to keep it nice.</li>
            <li> (The price is really good for such an exceptional brush)Do not hesitate to buy.</li>
            <li> Not as soft but still works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is an excellent brush with buildable coverage but please keep your specific skin type in mind before using as a full face brush.</li>
            <li> it is SO SOFT and is great at putting on powder.</li>
            <li> this brush is SOOO soft and is GREAT for mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully soft and great design for keeping it compact and protected on the go.</li>
            <li> It Is a great travel &amp; non-travel brush it was really soft</li>
            <li> I love this brush and even after multiple drops and many, many washes it works amazingly!</li>
            <li> It works great, the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> But when I apply my mineral foundation, I like to really buff it into my skin for good coverage.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much</li>
            <li> No hair fallout and uber easy to clean!  </li>
            <li> That made it kind of snag the bristles unless it is pushed on at just the right angle.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t come off during makeup application like some other brushes, and the retractable feature is great, allowing for me to keep it neatly stored in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> Its easy to wash</li>
            <li> It fits into my makeup bag easily too..</li>
            <li> Retracts into it&#x27;s protective case easily.</li>
            <li> Shorter handle, but easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Will be easy to travel with as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to carry along with you, travel with, and also stays cleaner when not in use.</li>
            <li> like that it is retractable so that I can pack it easily when I</li>
            <li> I was using the version from elf, but it is not as easy for travel.  </li>
            <li> Tucks away easily when not in use.</li>
            <li> Added bonus: retractable for easy and mess-free travel in purse or suitcase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> The retractable aspect makes it easy to slip into your makeup bag or store in your cosmetics box.</li>
            <li> and I like how I can easily fold it up to store it or to throw it in my purse or make-up bag.</li>
            <li> Easy to travel with</li>
            <li> Easily slides into it&#x27;s case when not in use.  </li>
            <li> But it is practical and easy to use.</li>
            <li> so easy to apply my mineral foundation and does not clump</li>
            <li> Does anyone else&#x27;s have a strong smell?</li>
            <li> /&gt;3/24/14 - the brush is still going strong, with no shedding.</li>
            <li> but I will steer clear of this brand forever, despite the good reviews many people have given their brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the hairs are strong also, haven&#x27;t had any fall out upon cleaning, use, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this brush - it feels very well put together.</li>
            <li> Works great with my bare minerals powder.</li>
            <li> and it is as good as new.</li>
            <li> They are just as good as new after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had it for almost two years now and even after a number of washing/cleaning, it is still as good as new.</li>
            <li> and it comes fine.</li>
            <li> They did everything else fine.</li>
            <li> The case is light aluminum, easy to extend and retract.</li>
            <li> Have used the brush for a week now, and it seems fine, but it turns out i prefer a longer handle to work with.</li>
            <li> super soft, great value.</li>
            <li> Super soft, great to carry in a make up bag or purse but broke in a week</li>
            <li> : Fit the tool to the job and you will do fine.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest little brush i have ever owned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect brush to replace a natural kabuki brush as it is soft and you can control your coverage.  </li>
            <li> The retractable feature is also a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I orginally bought this brush to get me over $25 to make the free shipping.</li>
            <li> And they are a fabulous buy.  </li>
            <li> it is so smooth..</li>
            <li> its bristles are very soft..small and handy</li>
            <li> These EcoTools brushes are fabulous.</li>
            <li> Brush is firm and is of excellent quality.  </li>
            <li> I use it primarily for blush.  </li>
            <li> , the bristles do not fall out even after cleaning &amp; that fact of how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li> the powder goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any powdery streaks on my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and stays clean; the metal case is easy to remove with one hand</li>
            <li> I just dab it onto my pressed powder and smooth over my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy retractable brushes are back!</li>
            <li> overall great brush</li>
            <li> The brush is cheap and doesnt hold powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Easy close 2 keep clean.</li>
            <li> I use it for my mineral powder and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is important to note, which is why I&#x27;m giving the background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are cheap and it shows in all</li>
            <li> Cruelty free.</li>
            <li> **cruelty free</li>
            <li> I needed something that would fit inside my purse and</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> This brush wasn&#x27;t as soft as I hoped it would be, but it&#x27;s still a good one.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re someone who has sensitive skin that tends to break out whenever you change things, this may be a good choice for you as a brush.</li>
            <li> whats great about this one is that the top doesn&#x27;t fall off-like with other brands.</li>
            <li> It is helping with my acne to have such I better brush now!!</li>
            <li> I very rarely buy things online, I like to touch/</li>
            <li> I clean it with a spray on daily brush cleanser from Sephora, which works great.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size, works great, and is super soft!</li>
            <li> It was SUPER soft, which is nice for someone who has to use the brush almost three times a day for a week or more.</li>
            <li> makes it super easy to store and keep clean.</li>
            <li> It really is super soft, as advertised, and it seems like a good quality brush.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day and the bristles are super soft, good buy for your money.</li>
            <li> Very soft and compact, I love it!</li>
            <li> I was excited to purchase this blush because of the versatility.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for a small make up bag.</li>
            <li> This is retractable and is just fun to use!  </li>
            <li> It really is worth it!</li>
            <li> The brush falls apart - its not an original EcoTools.</li>
            <li> It is doable, it&#x27;s just doesn&#x27;t close smoothly because I have to align it a certain way before it closes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I love the brush.</li>
            <li> I was upset at the fact that when I got it the one piece came separate right away and seemed to have been cheaply put together but overall great brush.</li>
            <li> This little brush is great, I read all of the reviews before getting it and am glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> thanks not as good as the other one they use to make but its still good</li>
            <li> It keeps in clean.  </li>
            <li> If, however, you have a makeup case or basket or drawer, and you want a brush that will stay clean, forget about it.</li>
            <li> The retractable feature comes in handy more than I thought, especially since I started to keep it in my purse.</li>
            <li> I is heaven sent to be retractable to help it stay clean from dirt.  </li>
            <li> To be able to keep a brush this soft in my purse, is a treat :)  </li>
            <li> so I can keep it clean.</li>
            <li> After seeing how much they cost in the store, I was delighted to find this one so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> quality is very fine, smooth and soft, easy to clean, not that easy to dry, but very suitable for traveling.</li>
            <li> A very soft yet stable brush, it was so nice just to use it on my face.  </li>
            <li> I love the cruelty-free premise of EcoTools, so I gave this brush a try after reading mostly positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first one for well over 5 years, and it&#x27;s still good as new.</li>
            <li> So I like to have a retractable brush which will keep the brush in good shape and clean (especially if I am traveling).</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles and I love that it retracts!</li>
            <li> So far very please and the price is amazing!</li>
            <li> I tried the blush brush first and loved the price and how soft it was.</li>
            <li> for so many people to rave about it so much.  </li>
            <li> the full coverage brush</li>
            <li> Good size not too big.</li>
            <li> It feels like cool silk across my face.  </li>
            <li> granted, this is my only kabuki ever, but it is damn good.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this much yet, but I love the design and practicality of it.  </li>
            <li> I love the whole Eco tools line of brushes</li>
            <li> I got this brush today, and I&#x27;m sure, like others, I had to try it out straight</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t have a full report yet.</li>
            <li> It has good bristles, and is dense enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Considering everything, it&#x27;s an overall good brush.</li>
            <li> I think it gives powder a nice natural finish.</li>
            <li> The only &#x27;good&#x27; thing was that I received it about 3 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> THis is a cool retractable brush</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend !  </li>
            <li> --I really did want to love this.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> So that being said this brush is awesome and get it at Walmart if you need the comfort of knowing you will get a easy refund if your not happy.</li>
            <li> It picks up the right amount of powder to leave a smooth finish on the skin, no need to tap off the brush, so</li>
            <li> If I futz with it a bit I can get it to slide back into the cap, but most of the time I just leave it out, which is fine but defeats the purpose of a retractable brush!</li>
            <li> This kabuki is light and thick and very good for travelling.</li>
            <li> Very soft exactly what i wanted im in love with this brush!</li>
            <li> Overall, especially considering the price, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Super glue it is.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s basically just super glued in.</li>
            <li> Not the super dense brush I was expecting</li>
            <li> All in all a wonderful brush that is soft and doesn&#x27;t shed, just as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Would love to see a smaller version for even better portability.</li>
            <li> It is very soft, and I absolutely love how it folds up inside of itself (keeps it clean and compact).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and am eager to try more from this brand.</li>
            <li> Only used once but so far so good!</li>
            <li> If the makeup bag you normally carry is more like an [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem as cheap quality wise as some of the other reviewers have felt it to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the price but not thick enough in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d have to shell out $30 or so for a good one, but when I came across this one, I decided I&#x27;d just give it a shot (mostly because I was too lazy to go to another store).</li>
            <li> but it looks very natural and a lot better.</li>
            <li> Ecotools makes the most reasonably priced, high quality brushes available.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it is very soft and compacts</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I really love how soft the brushes are!</li>
            <li> When this first arrived my wife was excited to use it.</li>
            <li> love this brush, soft and compact!</li>
            <li> Two thumbs up, I highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> The brush feels soft against my cheeks and applies powder easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Super soft bristles and cruelty free!  </li>
            <li> Great, small, easy and does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> The construction seems very sturdy and I haven&#x27;t experienced any loose hairs.</li>
            <li> After 35+ years of using makeup, I have finally found the PERFECT makeup brush for use with loose mineral makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have little to no experience purchasing brushes for make up but this turned out to be a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great compact little brush.</li>
            <li> I also have used other brushes, including ones by Mac, and this by far is the softest and most pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> An all round great brush</li>
            <li> I have NEVER seen a makeup brush- even cheap dollar store ones- fall apart so fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased EcoTools retractable blush brush before and had much success with it.  </li>
            <li> Comparable retractable synthetic kabuki brushes start at more than double the price at leading cosmetics stores, so this looked like a fabulous beauty bargain...</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> i like that it&#x27;s retractable, all of my friends were so amazed that it was and found it so useful to just toss on the go..</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to most brushes but this one did not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Btw, that old silver aluminum one was built better than this newer bronze one.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear makeup</li>
            <li> It is really soft to the touch and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this brush is.  </li>
            <li> That is a nice added feature and it doesn&#x27;t impact the way you use it at home on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> this is a soft not so dense brush that seems better suited for powder foundations and/or blushes....</li>
            <li> Love this brush, so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously been using the Bare Escentuals Retractable Flawless Application Face Brush, which sells for $30.</li>
            <li> The actual brush, on the other hand, is great!</li>
            <li> I went between this brush and a too faced retractable brush, but I decided on this one based on prior experience with the brand and the wonderful price compared to the other one.</li>
            <li> It did change colors right before I bought it.  </li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t drop it or anything, the barrel just slid right off and wouldn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> It is large &amp; full.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I use this with bare minerals and love the buffing effect it has.</li>
            <li> It lasts long, it&#x27;s compact but has a nice weight to it, and puts powder on evenly.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no shedding, it&#x27;s very easy to clean, and is way cheaper than other brushes i&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and bristles/ hair are strong and dont fall on my face.</li>
            <li> Overall its a great brush especially if you want an all-purpose brush that you want to throw in your bag when you travel.</li>
            <li> Soft and easy to use and carry.</li>
            <li> Soft, compact, and brush hairs do not fall out easily.</li>
            <li> Soft and easy to use .</li>
            <li> Love this because it is sooo soft, applies powder evenly, and the retractable feature keeps bristles straight and together without ever smooshing out.</li>
            <li> a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for travel and as a spare while cleaning my primary brush and was very surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> This works great, and I love that it retracts--takes up a lot less space that way, and doesn&#x27;t sprinkle loose powder all over everything because it&#x27;s covered in my bag.</li>
            <li> I used the first one for a couple of years until the bristles started to wear out--I liked it so much that I purchased a second one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice, soft brush that is a great replacement for the powder puff I have been using to apply my mineral powder foundation for the last few years.</li>
            <li> It also holds up very well with regard to washing/air-drying and is very travel friendly.</li>
            <li> so i bought a new set eventually with NEW brushes and they ended up shedding more.</li>
            <li> If it were possible,  I would give it more than 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> since the first time I retracted the brush, and reopened it, it fell apart.</li>
            <li> It worked really well!</li>
            <li> I also bought 2 other styles and I love them as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for several months now and love it.</li>
            <li> I had to buy another, larger, non-retractable brush that has its hairs more spread out</li>
            <li> When I first tried to make it restract, I couldn&#x27;t figure it out and realized it was because I was trying to twist it instead of slide it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my first brush because it must have been dented during shipping to the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> After it dries it is exactly as before you washed it.</li>
            <li> When I got my first one I had no problems at all washing it</li>
            <li> but I think I may have used water that was too hot one time and the brush fell out of the handle and it came apart.</li>
            <li> Make up goes on smooth and the brush feels like baby bunny hair, so soft.  </li>
            <li> This was my first EcoTools purchase, chosen because of it is made of synthetic and recycled materials.</li>
            <li> The top on this thing is a total joke.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this brush for a couple of weeks now, so I can&#x27;t speak of its lasting-quality, but it is a perfect size for the small cosmetics bag</li>
            <li> I like the latter one better.  </li>
            <li> (probably would&#x27;ve cost more both financially and environmentally to do so!).</li>
            <li> Soft and applies powder smoothly.</li>
            <li> At first it was just one or two, but then a clump of hairs came out.</li>
            <li> I really like that it is retractable too!</li>
            <li> My first kabuki brush, well one that wasn&#x27;t purchased a part of mineral powder package.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Came apart the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> However, I have been using Ecotools brushes for several years and after washing/cleaning them the brushes still are outstanding and don&#x27;t lose their bristles.  </li>
            <li> Still, overall, will work OK for travel.</li>
            <li> My favorite and only brush.  </li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> It is pretty and</li>
            <li> Will look for a higher quality one that won&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li> So far hairs haven&#x27;t fell out of the brush like a lot of cheap brushes do.</li>
            <li> I think it was exactly what she wanted for Christmas.</li>
            <li> it is still super-soft, fluffy, in good shape and not shedding at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still use them because I love the brush so much, but it is so disappointing not to be able to retract them for more compact (and sanitary!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and gives a fresh, even look to your makeup when applying.</li>
            <li> And since the bristles retract, the brush stays far cleaner than any other makeup brushes I have ever used, which also makes it the perfect on-the-go brush, for both daily touch-ups and traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well to distribute powder and stores neatly and easily without making a mess, but it is too large to be truly &#x27;purse friendly&#x27; or fit in a makeup bag, which to me is the whole point of a retractable brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very soft and full.</li>
            <li> Not dense enough for good liquid foundation makeup, and yet the bristles are a bit tight for easy application of blush...</li>
            <li> Very High quality brush... larger than most travel size brushes</li>
            <li> I can easily retract the brush, put the lid on, and take it on a trip in a bag, or even at home, easily have it free-standing on the counter instead of having the brush touch some surface when rested and have an icky feeling that it may not be completely clean.</li>
            <li> This is my first kabuki brush and I am amazed at how soft and full the brush is.</li>
            <li> i bought a different set which had another kabuki in it because i love it so much.</li>
            <li> As a result, the metal cap was more oval-ish than round and wouldn&#x27;t fit onto the the brush.</li>
            <li> So finally it occurred to me to check Amazon and this brush seemed like a good option as I was looking for something simple with a cover.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these at a local store and love it so much.  </li>
            <li> This is super soft!</li>
            <li> Super soft and does not shed!</li>
            <li> Super soft kabuki brush!  </li>
            <li> Super soft Kabuki Brush!  </li>
            <li> this works perfectly with mineral products, and i actually like the brush a LOT more than other kabuki brushes I&#x27;ve had before, even the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I came across the Eco Tools retractable Kabuki Brush and after reading the positive reviews, decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this kabuki brush after reading all of the positive reviews written by others on this site and others as well.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft, as was expected, and very cute.</li>
            <li> This brush works better than any high dollar big name blush brush!  </li>
            <li> This brush, like all ecotools brushes, is super soft.</li>
            <li> so my skin is more dry than combination.</li>
            <li> Super soft and picks up my mineral foundation</li>
            <li> Super soft and plush, bristles don&#x27;t get bent or fall out, and recycled to boot.  </li>
            <li> Super soft</li>
            <li> That does not shed, is super soft and compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the money I think I definitely got more than enough use out of it, and liked it so much that I bought the same product again.</li>
            <li> The brush is super soft, quite dense, doesn&#x27;t shed and applies powder evenly and generously allowing for fuller coverage.</li>
            <li> You could go to Sephora and easily pay 5x for a similar brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as simple as using better glue because I have tried hot glueing AND super glueing the bases back into place</li>
            <li> This brush is LARGE and the fact that it&#x27;s retractable is a bonus-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many of my brushes for ten years, and they look and feel like new.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush for applying loose powder.</li>
            <li> Love this for using loose powder on the go.</li>
            <li> My face is very picky and loves to be super sensitive.</li>
            <li> This brush felt soft and silky and I loved it, until it fell apart less than a week after purchase.  </li>
            <li> The basic things everyone wants out of their makeup brushes are softness, easy care, bristles that don&#x27;t shed, and effectiveness at putting on the makeup they are intended to be used with.</li>
            <li> For the cost, the quality is very high.</li>
            <li> This one really feels more like a loose powder blush brush.  </li>
            <li> Alima Pure very well.</li>
            <li> I use BareMinerals and the application is even and looks very natural, don&#x27;t need a lot of product either!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s HUGE, I was expecting something the size of the urban decay one, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this brush so far, but I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks so far.</li>
            <li> No complaints, it fits into my makeup pouch for my purse very well.</li>
            <li> I really needed a replacement but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much on a brush, so I decided to search for alternatives.</li>
            <li> It takes up a way too much room in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I also expected it to be extendable lengthwise, but the top just retracts into the handle.</li>
            <li> this brush is really very gud..</li>
            <li> The cap also doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, so I might end up throwing it away and keeping the plastic display holder that it came in.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This brush, along with a spoolie for my eyebrows, is really all I need.  </li>
            <li> the price, you really get what you paid for AND so much</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorites because of the bristle density and how gentle on the skin it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like it and</li>
            <li> The brush I received was a different, cheap one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed much at all and holds its shape really well.</li>
            <li> In fact, I like it so much that I gave one to my daughter-in-law</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> very sleek packaging and densely packed.</li>
            <li> I also noticed it doesn&#x27;t hold the product very evenly, and thus doesn&#x27;t disperse the product as evenly as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Annemarie C</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a retractable Real Techniques brush at Ulta instead in time for my trip, and it does the job.</li>
            <li> The bristles are much softer than the BE model.  </li>
            <li> Very practical.</li>
            <li> but this is the only one that EcoTools have available</li>
            <li> and I really like Eco Tools brushes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really portable.  </li>
            <li> Works really well with powders too.</li>
            <li> A really like this brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> my only beef with it is that after a year of use, the sliding tube that holes the brush kind of broke off of the outside metal tube.</li>
            <li> Its soft and fluffy and feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> so I like/use it as a travel foundation applicator that I take in my purse (especially since it closes and won&#x27;t make a mess), but it cannot compare to a good quality flat top kabuki brush for home use.  </li>
            <li> I bought the kabuki brush a few years ago and was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it--and at a fraction of the price that you might pay for brushes of lesser quality, it is as easy on your pocketbook as on your skin.</li>
            <li> The brush is super soft and feels like a fancy high quality brush, not something you can find at drugstores.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s worth it to return and get a new one, but just thought I&#x27;d share to see if anyone experienced the same thing.</li>
            <li> Ordered this brush for my powder,&lt;br /&gt;was shipped very fast, and I like the way you use the brush, the bristles are VERY soft and have not had a problem with them shedding yet.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Some of the smaller brushes I used to carry in my purse, even though I had them wrapped in a cloth case, got battered pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The bristles are incredibly soft and silky, with just the right amount of density.</li>
            <li> I used some Loctite gel super glue (My favorite) around the original glue and placed the round of bristles back in the original location and have been going on strong for at least 3 months.  </li>
            <li> I love it because it does not shed at all unlike some of the other $30 brushes I have.  </li>
            <li> I have other ecotools products that i LOVE</li>
            <li> Turns out it is better than I even expected!</li>
            <li> other retractable kabuki better.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this brush on a whim at my local K-mart.  </li>
            <li> The brush is absolutely worth the small price and it performs better than a $30 kabuki.</li>
            <li> I ordered this particular item because I already have an EcoTools kabuki brush and really like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly soft, durable, and very, very portable, given the retraction.  </li>
            <li> I just got my new one which I will be more careful cleaning</li>
            <li> I am quickly falling in love with EcoTools and have ordered several other brushes since.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh out of the ziploc-like packaging the brushed aluminum case looked great, though larger than expected.</li>
            <li> First one I&#x27;ve ever found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and it does miraculous things with my powder.</li>
            <li> It is a nice compact size and fits perfectly in my small make up bag.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and soft but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li> I can afford to replace much more easily although so far the quality seems about the same as previous brushes.</li>
            <li> I typically will wash all of my brushes in warm soapy water, but because this is attached to the metal, I&#x27;m sure if it will rust or dry properly.</li>
            <li> This brush is large and so very soft.  </li>
            <li> After almost a year, still looks and performs like new!</li>
            <li> I prefer my travel brushes to be retractable, so I was glad I found this for way less than the store prices.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll want to leave this brush behind since it will take up most of the available space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely buying the same product line again when I need more brushes.</li>
            <li> so i super glued it back.</li>
            <li> I like this Kabuki mainly because it is a retractable brush.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight, but decent quality.</li>
            <li> The aluminum handle and bristle guard are strong and haven&#x27;t bent yet, and I&#x27;m rough on things.  </li>
            <li> Brush is very dense and very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft!</li>
            <li> Easily packable for travel and purse, and large enough for daily use.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this brush for blushes and loose mineral powders.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush as an alternative to those of you who&#x27;ve been using the pricey BE tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> and I can not believe the price compared to the high priced name brand brushes this one out performes them all.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, as well as all ecotool beauty products.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush rivals that of high end brushes like Aveda&#x27;s kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone who finds themselves applying makeup when they are out and about a lot</li>
            <li> Highly recommended....</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and all EcoTools products.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the only one I use, buffs my powder foundation better than any other brush and is more sanitary/convenient than loose brushes.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and my makeup goes on sooo much better than other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviews said, it was not cost effective to send it back.  </li>
            <li> Love this little brush.</li>
            <li> Ecotool products are also for sale at Bed Bath and Beyond for a little more money.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it picks up very little product and does not offer good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This a great alternative to expensive kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid castile soap to clean the brushes, then stand them upright to dry in a ceramic toothbrush holder I have repurposed for my brushes.</li>
            <li> like it so much (quality and soft)</li>
            <li> for anyone who&#x27;s looking to use this brush with liquid foundation: I tried using this brush with liquid foundation too, to test versatility, and it was a no-go; the brush seems just too dense for a smooth application; the bristles tend to drag as you buff/stipple the liquid onto your skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft and puts my foundation on very well.</li>
            <li> I started replacing a lot of my brushes with the ecotools brand because the hairs on the brush are so soft and never irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> Normally I would have asked for a replacement, but I could tell by the construction it wouldn&#x27;t be an isolated incident.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same size as my BeautiControl and Arbonne kabuki brushes and feels as good if not better than they do</li>
            <li> you have normal to combination skin, this brush is a winner.</li>
            <li> I travel with it and use it a few times a day most days.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s good but definitely not great.</li>
            <li> The brush is fine - like any other kabuki brush, but the cap keeps falling off (it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;click&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This retractable one last through wash after wash after wash and is super soft.</li>
            <li> The brush is very very soft and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Paris Presents Inc. and Stacy got back to me right away and sent a replacement brush and a gift.  </li>
            <li> I did find this brand at Walmart, as an FYI, right about the same price.</li>
            <li> when it arrived, it was super soft and I loved that it was retractable-was hoping for no more powder mess in my make up bag.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are accurate and I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> This brush, and every other Ecotools brush I have tried, fit every criteria.</li>
            <li> Only a few fibers fell out at first (maybe 8 at the most).  </li>
            <li> As is usual with EcoTools brushes, the bristles are super soft and it is a breeze to clean.</li>
            <li> If it wears out I&#x27;m just going to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I was also in need of a new brush as well.</li>
            <li> and I re-ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> So I went out in search of a new powder brush.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t think twice about ordering a new brush online.</li>
            <li> I talked with live chat</li>
            <li> particularly like this retractable kabuki brush because it has a cap that completely covers and protects the bristles.</li>
            <li> I have had much better luck with my retractable pink one by a different brand.</li>
            <li> bristles!&lt;br /&gt;The company behind ecotools is exceptional also.  </li>
            <li> I love this little brush!</li>
            <li> --it has an odd smell to it, very noticeable when you use it to put powder right around your nose!</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s incredibly soft and has a high quality feel.  </li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> brush is very soft and feels like silk as it glides across my face.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and do not break off.</li>
            <li> Excelent brush, very soft and usefull for my travel makeup</li>
            <li> but I did not think it was very soft.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and cruelty-free bristles and bamboo handle-</li>
            <li> Very soft and hair stays on the brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself is very soft and works well.</li>
            <li> Very soft, I use it with my bareminerals powder foundation.</li>
            <li> Evenly applies my bronzer and has very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have no problems with this brush.  </li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable for such a quality brush.  </li>
            <li> Very soft brush.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> It performs even better than the Bare Escentuals brush, and costs $20 less.</li>
            <li> You can very easily adjust the brush by sliding it up a little (which makes the brush firmer) for a heavier coverage or keeping the brush fully open for a bronzer or mineral powder.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> So soft!  </li>
            <li> This brush is so soft!</li>
            <li> The first (and only) time I used this brush, the hairs started coming out.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a backup since I lost my first ecotools kabuki from two years ago recently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> a second brush to use when I&#x27;m cleaning the first</li>
            <li> Looked like a giant wad of hot glue and bristles inside.  </li>
            <li> This one beats it all, this is the 3rd one purchased in 4 years, not because they don&#x27;t last, but because i use it everyday and think its a good idea to throw away makeup after a years use.  </li>
            <li> I do have a problem with my face powder which is nearly empty and hollow in the middle and the brush doesn&#x27;t seem to grab enough but is still a great brush.</li>
            <li> and I have been looking for the right brush for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Also, the brush extends a little too far so the cap does not slide on as easily as it should.  </li>
            <li> The only positive I have is that it retracts.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and there is no excessive shedding.</li>
            <li> I also see these tools at the local super drug and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> no mess!</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my Bare Escentuals kabuki brush -- but wanted to avoid the high cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars, but I just have a hard time giving anything five stars unless I feel that it couldn&#x27;t better.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s retractable is super convenient for not getting powder on other things when you place it in your bag.  </li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for applying face powder without leaving coarse little bristles behind.</li>
            <li> It is worth the buy and measures up to much more expensive Kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Kabuki brush that was soft and didn&#x27;t shed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> soft and being retractable is convenient to carry along in my purse, although I wish the cap would not come off that easilly</li>
            <li> (keep in mind to NOT retract it when drying, it should be completely exposed to air).</li>
            <li> bristles itself is extremely soft.</li>
            <li> This talkon brush is wonderfully soft and dense.</li>
            <li> The brush is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> Terrific brush for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly soft, and whenever my friends come over they comment on how soft it is.</li>
            <li> Maybe my face is to sensitive.</li>
            <li> So the water never dried out and the brush ended smelling.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft and dense.  </li>
            <li> but yea, i was surprised when it just popped out.</li>
            <li> i use bareminerals mineral makeup, and i thought my brushes shed because they were old...</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft but hold their shape.  </li>
            <li> The Ecotools brushes are soft and don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> This brush is soooo soft</li>
            <li> have had it for over a month, hasn&#x27;t shed one hair and is still soft</li>
            <li> I looooove how soft this brush is.</li>
            <li> , no bristles have fallen off, it is soft and functional.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft, but it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;incredibly soft&amp;#34; as product description says.</li>
            <li> I use it to apply my MAC SKinFinish natural powder.</li>
            <li> Soft and portable.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft and appears to be well made.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The brush itself is extremely soft and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re blissfully soft, they&#x27;ve lasted me for years</li>
            <li> It is too soft.</li>
            <li> Use it frequently.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush because my old powder brush needed replacement.  </li>
            <li> I was happily surprised to discover how soft it is.  </li>
            <li> REALLY REALLY REALLY soft.  </li>
            <li> Soft bristles that don&#x27;t fall out and stick to my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but I feel like I cant get any blush or bronzer on with it.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and seems well made but is not as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I like it; the brush is soft.</li>
            <li> They are also not as soft, and shed a tad more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my gripe is that the ENTIRE brush- the whole cover to the brush itself- fell off within two weeks.</li>
            <li> Washed it like 2 times and the brush completely fell apart from the metal bit at the bottom.</li>
            <li> It is compact and really soft.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and do not come away when using.  </li>
            <li> Really soft.  </li>
            <li> , looks professional each and every time.</li>
            <li> This is a soft and portable kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft they had to be stolen from an angel wing.  </li>
            <li> After I tried to re-bend it back to a more round shape it sort of fits onto the brush</li>
            <li> but I think it is worth it since my last one lasted several years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have seen expensive brushes at sephore etc, its honestly as good.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when it arrived but the packaging it come in made it really hard to get the brush out without bending the bristles.</li>
            <li> This was a good brush, but the little part that you use to adjust it wouldn&#x27;t stay put like other similar brushes I have used.</li>
            <li> Also, it is soft, not stiff &amp; rough like so many other brushes.</li>
            <li> I am going back and buying two more, one for my mom and the other for an extra.</li>
            <li> Their other brushes are nice, but don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shedding: I have never seen a single bristle shed, though another brand shed horrendously the first time I washed them--what a waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness</li>
            <li> I needed a brush to use for my powder foundation and couldn&#x27;t find one that I liked in local stores or pharmacies that wasn&#x27;t a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> It also was small enough to fit into my case without causing too much of a shuffle.</li>
            <li> This brush is just as good - if not better! - than the Bare Minerals (or more expensive brand name kabuki) brush.</li>
            <li> I like to rotate through them so that I can have a clean one to use every few days.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles are securely attached and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding over the past two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I think my specific product was just defected because I have used the exact same one for over a year</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this brush, but don&#x27;t buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because the cap is a little loose fitting.</li>
            <li> Because the bristles are so thick they can take over a day to dry completely, so it&#x27;s nice to have a backup.</li>
            <li> This brush is a lot like Bare Minerals full coverage brush for much less money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft on your skin, and I use it for my bare minerals powder foundation.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and Don&#x27;t shed at all like the Bare essentials do.</li>
            <li> but this just bounces back to brand new again.</li>
            <li> the actual brush is SOFT SOFT</li>
            <li> I save so much money for what is essentially the same brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soooo soft and i love that it retracks and had a lid, makes one less thing to make a mess in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> If I have the income again in the future, I&#x27;d return to my Bare Escentuals brushes for any new purchases.</li>
            <li> This retractable brush broke apart in my small, soft hands the very first time I opened it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned high, mid and low end brushes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush due to all of the positive reviews I read about it</li>
            <li> After reading other positive reviews online, I decided to try this item from Ectools.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to do a primary application on one section of my face at a time, then a secondary \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; with just a dusting of powder.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long they will last but don&#x27;t foresee them falling apart as fast as the BE&#x27;s do.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my bare mineral brush.</li>
            <li> I used it with bare minerals foundation</li>
            <li> I use Bare Minerals or Smashbox foundation powder.</li>
            <li> I have been using bare minerals powder makeup for 5 years and have gone through every brand of Kabuki brush out there.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my Bare Escentuals Kabuki Brush, and I couldn&#x27;t resist the price of this Ecotools</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy the Bare Escentuals Kabuki Brush again at about three times the price,</li>
            <li> It does not retract far enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> It completely came apart into 3 different pieces, cant even get it to stay together if I try</li>
            <li> I use these guys for Bare Minerals Foundation.</li>
            <li> The texture is not rough and scratchy.  </li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals Kabuki Brush quality.</li>
            <li> The bristle are soft enough and plentiful, but they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; the product the way BE brushes do.</li>
            <li> So soft and satisfies my inner germaphobe.</li>
            <li> I used a $25 Bare Escentuals brush for 3 years until it was worn out.  </li>
            <li> got this to replace my retractable kabuki brush i got from bare minerals to use with their products.</li>
            <li> arrived in pieces...not worth the trouble to return.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but the cap seems tight and very think, worried that the cap will eventually crack because of that.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I&#x27;m not sure about is how to clean it.</li>
            <li> I wish the brush was thicker, but compared to other brushes on Amazon, this is really well-priced.  </li>
            <li> The price in Amazon is much cheaper than other places.</li>
            <li> Not quite as soft as the other ecotools brushes that I&#x27;ve purchased but still very soft.</li>
            <li> Initially I was concerned they wouldn&#x27;t be soft enough, however they are the softest I have ever felt.</li>
            <li> its actually much softer and better and sheds less (not at all so far, actually, in the 3 months i&#x27;ve had it) than the expensive old brush.</li>
            <li> and I love the casing, but I&#x27;m starting to think the retractor in my brush is broken?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a week now, its very soft and hasn&#x27;t shed a single hair.</li>
            <li> reading reviews for this brush here, and in other venues, I decided that it must be at least okay</li>
            <li> I recently bought Bare Eccentuals Mineral makeup and wasn&#x27;t too fond of the brush that came with it.</li>
            <li> - instead I tried to make do with them as replacements for my Bare Escentuals brushes and they simply will not do the job for me.</li>
            <li> As for performance, it is as decent as any of my other taklon kabukis.  </li>
            <li> Some girl stole my kabuki that I had from Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s Bare Bronze line (I used to work there, so it was cheap with my discount).</li>
            <li> It is a little big, but definitely still pretty portable (I keep it in my purse for touch ups throughout the day.)</li>
            <li> This is my second one, the first lasted a few years before the glue finally gave way inside</li>
            <li> This is very soft, but quite a bit smaller than I expected it.</li>
            <li> Since the Bare Essential brushes are three times the price and last no more than six months I thought as long as these last six months they are worth it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are VERY soft compared to my experience of other Kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> where as my other brushes i have to put in a ziplock bag or something..however because it&#x27;s retractable the brush is very stiff..making it unable to brush on your face smoothly</li>
            <li> It works so much better, I&#x27;m sorry I waited this long to make the investment.</li>
            <li> Yes, as previous reviews have stated this brush is very soft.</li>
            <li> seems like it wont last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I hated the brushes that came with my mineral makeup, this one works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I had to get a new one and found this little gem at Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very soft and doesn&#x27;t leave little pieces of brush hair all over your face.</li>
            <li> The bristles are also very dense, which causes it to be stiffer than other kabuki brushes and adds to the odd application of foundation.</li>
            <li> which was what I was looking for - even if it doesn&#x27;t last very long (as stated in some reviews)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the lid doesn&#x27;t fit on very tight</li>
            <li> with less soft bristles.</li>
            <li> This item completely fell apart after using it only a few times.</li>
            <li> It is one of my staples, it&#x27;s soft and thick and offers full-coverage w/my mineral foundation powder.</li>
            <li> While it is very very soft, I found that it unevenly spreads my powder foundation.</li>
            <li> I went back to my old stiff kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not very soft.  </li>
            <li> There is little to no shedding and is so soft.</li>
            <li> The actual  brush head however did not fall apart and it has not lost one single bristle either!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other Ecotools brushes in the past, and based on positive experience</li>
            <li> and I love that I can carry it in my make-up bag without worrying about the brush getting dirty or ruined.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay a fortune for it, but still expected it to last longer than four days.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe i got sucked into buying the expensive $40 brush from Bare Minerals when i first started using their makeup like ten years ago.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money and had to throw it away.  </li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t break on first use, such a poorly assembled tool ends up in the trash heap in six months instead of six years.</li>
            <li> this one will be good for home base make up tools</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this brush three separate times from Amazon and each time it&#x27;s broken right out of the package.</li>
            <li> They last a long time and don&#x27;t tangle like other brushes do.</li>
            <li> No problem with the hairs falling out either like with other similar products.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, the bristles do NOT fall off (and that always used to happen with my standard MAC one.</li>
            <li> I have several Eco-Tools brushes, and I&#x27;ll never purchase any other brand.</li>
            <li> Fell apart after 6 months and was utterly unusable due to it&#x27;s retractable construction.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a dense kabukis for foundation buffing (especially a liquid or cream) go with the other.....</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little skinner, but then Im guess the brush wouldnt be big enough to apply powder</li>
            <li> The one I owned prior was very rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t stay together for very long.</li>
            <li> I hand wash them with some facewash and let them air dry.</li>
            <li> YOU HAVE DRY</li>
            <li> I have dry to combination skin</li>
            <li> Considering the dry winter air this brush was no exception.</li>
            <li> &gt; If you dont have dry skin</li>
            <li> At this price point I will not mind purchasing another should it last only a few months.</li>
            <li> Nice brush but base was not glued to handle properly.</li>
            <li> Thought this could not possibly live up to the hype but it does.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft to the touch but the cap of the brush is not fitting at all.</li>
            <li> Retracted, with the case closed, it was about four inches long, and</li>
            <li> The metal sleeve and cap protect the brush, and keep any loose powder from migrating into my makeup pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given this 5 stars if the bottom part hadn&#x27;t been loose.  </li>
            <li> The retraction is loose, so it doesn&#x27;t always stay up when it&#x27;s being used.</li>
            <li> this one you have to push it up then place the cap on then push it back down</li>
            <li> This brush is incredibly soft, much softer than other expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> the very first time(which is expected because I&#x27;m usually pretty tough on new brushes since I hate finding tiny hairs on my products.)</li>
            <li> For being less than ten dollars, this kabuki is a steal!</li>
            <li> Using this brush and the mac studio fix powder plus foundation, my skin looked airbushed but very dry even after using the mac fix plus to set the powder.</li>
            <li> The brush itself wasn&#x27;t bad, but the &amp;#34;retractable&amp;#34; cover/handle is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted through about a year of daily use and has now become stiff and has some broken bristles.</li>
            <li> I wish the diameter of the brush head was a little bigger.  </li>
            <li> and so I reassembled it and drilled a hole in the side of the bottom where the inner tube sits and put a little screw in there.</li>
            <li> Seems impossible that this could be as fine after the fortune I&#x27;ve been shelling out for Clinique and MAC brushes for so long.</li>
            <li> Following the same ring, I coated it with a thin layer of superglue and carefully placed it back where it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not very Eco-friendly in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels rough on the face.</li>
            <li> Minimal to no shedding, no noticeable smell.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when pulling it from the cloth packaging it comes in.</li>
            <li> This brush was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I would probably buy this again, but not specifically for &#x27;on the go&#x27; use as it was a lot bulkier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Mine actually fell apart after a few weeks</li>
            <li> A few years ago I couldn&#x27;t even find one and ended up buying a regular one.</li>
            <li> A few of my smaller brushes (for eyeshadow, etc) by this brand have started to have issues with the brush head loosening from the handle, but they are still useable.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected.</li>
            <li> It is very loose</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I appreciate this feature because make-up brushes sometimes get crushed and misshapen while traveling.  </li>
            <li> It is not what I expected (although I now realize that the video clip demonstrates correctly how one opens the canister.</li>
            <li> They are stored in a BE bag carefully.</li>
            <li> closed like a lipstick).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had is for several weeks and use it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> but it did not feel as thick and soft as this size.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft, which is the only positive thing I can say about this item. :(</li>
            <li> Other brushes that I have used in the past never seem to be the same after they dry</li>
            <li> The brush fibers are packed to make a very thick brush, allowing for high saturation of whatever product you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> It is not as stiff as I would have expected from a kabuki brush, the bristles are not as tightly compacted as in a traditional brush, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and after recieving a \\&quot;free\\&quot; brush with the clinique powder I recently purchased at a dept. store, I could not believe how scratchy and uncomfortable that brush was to use...</li>
            <li> I still use it at home, but don&#x27;t use it for travel due to the retractable part being broke</li>
            <li> The only thing holding the dome-shaped brush and mechanism in the outer shell was a small bit of glue on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I would purchase other items from this brand again.</li>
            <li> It was extremely soft&amp;i can feel the quality.</li>
            <li> I was sold then and even ordered other make up brushes by ecotool.</li>
            <li> I have bought a couple of other brushes at target and other stores.  </li>
            <li> I just wish whoever ships this out would package it carefully so that it doesn&#x27;t arrive in a damaged condition!</li>
            <li> (Their other brushes have bamboo handles, which I approve of as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be as \\&quot;great\\&quot; as the other.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This one from EcoTools does not even compare to the other one.  </li>
            <li> other retractable brushes i have seen twist shut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other retractable brushes and eventually they get gunked up and fall apart when you wash.</li>
            <li> (they take a little while to dry after washing).</li>
            <li> That held tight for a year but the screw got loose</li>
            <li> brush is so unbelievably soft and luxurious-feeling, it&#x27;s hard to imagine that it cost less then $10!  </li>
            <li> The brand is highly recommended on Makeup Alley, so I was surprised and disappointed that the functionality of the mechanism relies on a single smear of dried-up glue.</li>
            <li> (grip the brush base with your palm while you remove the top part of the case with your thumb and forefinger) so that you can hold your compact with one hand and remove the cap of the brush with the other.  </li>
            <li> It made me realize how much my old one had gotten tough.  </li>
            <li> More than a little disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Was not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> model\\&quot; is that you can twist and base, the bristles recoil, and you can put a metal lid on top.  </li>
            <li> Load it up, twist down.  </li>
            <li> Took me a minute to figure out the retractor part, part of the handle comes up to go around the brush rather than the brush going down in the handle.</li>
            <li> I definetely recommend this brush and all the other ecotools!</li>
            <li> I find it a little hard to use on a daily basis because it tends to fan in when you are trying to use it.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried they wouldn&#x27;t pick up the foundation very well, but was proven wrong again.</li>
            <li> The retractable part is a bit confusing though, and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get it to a complete close.</li>
            <li> All Black Pro Makeup Case with Trays]]</li>
            <li> However, after less than five weeks of using it, all of the pieces started coming un-glued.  </li>
            <li> Brush would not raise up for use much less retract.  </li>
            <li> I had owned the brush for less than a minute.</li>
            <li> Also the product description plays up the packaging like it&#x27;s a bag you would keep or something, but it&#x27;s just slightly thicker plastic.</li>
            <li> I found the three products that I ordered to be too stiff, smell bad, and not at all comfortable for the hand.</li>
            <li> so using powder foundations and brushes alone turns me into a cakey patchy mess.</li>
            <li> I was just looking for a portable powder brush that doesn&#x27;t mess up my make up bag.</li>
            <li> and I resorted to a piece of duct tape over it to keep it tight.</li>
            <li> Total crap, fell apart the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I saw it for a little bit cheaper at Target</li>
            <li> The system of putting on the lid takes a little getting used to, but it serves its purpose well for keeping the brush protected.  </li>
            <li> Even the little bag it came in was made from recycled materials.  </li>
            <li> I also adore the little kabuki that comes in the minerals set.</li>
            <li> Due to the retractable element, I&#x27;m not sure how others have managed to re glue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I do, I use a little concealer and mineral powder.</li>
            <li> plus, it fits so perfectly in my little pouch.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bulky - not as compact as you would think.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect anything, let alone to find this little thing came from heaven.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s far less expensive than name-brand brushes from a cosmetics counter at a department store.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful when I open the brush because half the time I get the wrong end coming out</li>
            <li> My everyday brush is from BE and</li>
            <li> For some reason, the cap of my brush is angled so I have trouble closing it efficiently.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use this brush, the powder goes on unevenly.</li>
            <li> it made my sensitive skin even worse!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get crimped or messy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> But started to fall apart after a few months.</li>
            <li> I like the brush, but after a few days the metal fell apart on it.</li>
            <li> Previously, I used to buy the Bare Minerals brand Kabuki which is 4 times as expensive.</li>
            <li> but I might  just drill that too and use a small bolt to keep it tight before it happens again.</li>
            <li> Tried to glue it back together with crazy glue and let it dry over night</li>
            <li> I love that you could retract the brush so that it doesn&#x27;t dirty your makeup bag or purse, and it also doesn&#x27;t get dirty.</li>
            <li> It is insanely convenient to be able to retract it and cover it</li>
            <li> It closes up to be quite small, although it might be a bit bulky if you carry around a smaller-sized makeup bag in your purse...</li>
            <li> but I think that its as small as it can be while still being functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brushes tend to be expensive and you take the risk of buying it only to have it shed all over your face.</li>
            <li> I tried returning the item but apparently, I am past the allowable return date.  </li>
            <li> I used this brush no more than 15 times and it fell apart on me.</li>
            <li> I like the brush because it&#x27;s retractable, eco-friendly, and size is small</li>
            <li> The outside of the handle part came unglued, rendering the product useless.  </li>
            <li> So I know that it wasn&#x27;t destroyed by a careless third party.</li>
            <li> Very fluffy brush.</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to take out the brush, without having it rammed into the &#x27;zip lock&#x27; closing of the package.</li>
            <li> This brush is too hard for me.</li>
            <li> It was hard to wash this because the bristles were close together.</li>
            <li> It feels expensive even though it&#x27;s stupid cheap.</li>
            <li> Shoddy construction.  </li>
            <li> I bought the same type of brush from sephora for 29$ and it sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> the only thing is it closes kinda awkwardly.</li>
            <li> This one has gone through at least 5 washes and still in one piece.</li>
            <li> and then you find that it just gets dirty because the cap is constantly falling off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Softness:  Other brushes I tried poked my skin and were uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> it not only twists down into the base but even has a cap.</li>
            <li> I can fiddle with it and still get it to close if I slide the brush back into the bottom piece, but it&#x27;s very difficult to pull up the part the covers the brush.</li>
            <li> added plus is that the case and sleeve are made from recycled aluminum, and the bristles are an eco-friendly synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously considering purchasing another to have a spare.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> But the brush is somewhat too compact and tight, making it difficult to evenly apply mineral foundation.  </li>
            <li> I am thinking maybe some brushes online are fake or something because I&#x27;ve had my brush for a few months</li>
            <li> It was put together with weak glue that wore off a week or so after using it.</li>
            <li> (Which would look and feel tacky, to say the least!)</li>
            <li> Opens up a little awkwardly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried gluing the base back together, but it won&#x27;t stay.  </li>
            <li> only issue is that the brush came apart into four pieces (cap, base, brush, retracting mechanism) when I was trying to remove it from the packaging and now it doesn&#x27;t retract anymore.</li>
            <li> ; store where I could have gotten an exchange for the poor workmanship.</li>
            <li> The product arrived broken.</li>
            <li> normally buy Bobbi Brown make up brushes, but I found that the powder brushes shed an awful lot after a lot of use and cleaning, so I wanted to get</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after only two or three washings, the cover that holds the brush base detaches.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the weird streaky look</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush that came with my makeup was very coarse and it was also terrible for shedding.  </li>
            <li> I think it would be difficult to get used to something else,  now that I&#x27;ve used this one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find anything wrong with the brush, but still.</li>
            <li> The packaging was a bit difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong here...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still not perfect.</li>
            <li> I was almost skeptical to buy this brush after reading some reviews, but it was the price I was looking for</li>
            <li> Makeup brushes can be so expensive</li>
            <li> The interior of the brush came unglued and was utterly useless.  </li>
            <li> but the construction is very poor.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy received the product and it was broken</li>
            <li> What a disappointment...</li>
            <li> BUT I think Amazon has a bad stock of this.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> For the price I suppose I&#x27;m not too disappointed, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend or buy it again.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so mad when my boxer puppy ate my makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> It came out of the base and no longer could retract.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the apparatus that allows the brush to retract into the base is in dire need of a redesign.  </li>
            <li> This is particularly annoying when you throw it in your makeup bag</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the item that came in the mail.</li>
            <li> very annoying.  </li>
            <li> I hate throwing my brushes into a makeup bag to get covered in germs for me to smear all over my face!  </li>
            <li> It is really annoying when i try to put my foundation on and find brush bristles on my face sheds A LOT!!!!</li>
            <li> The Kabuki was like dragging sandpaper across my face and smelled the worst of the lot.  </li>
            <li> I had a MAC brush and the bristles are awfully shedding all over my face after a minimum of use.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased EcoTools retractable blush brush before and had much success with it.  This purchase was different.  After using this for about a month, the retractable part broke.  :(  I still use it at home, but don&#x27;t use it for travel due to the retractable part being broke and I can&#x27;t put the cover on it.  The brush is soft and has great coverage!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  After almost a year, still looks and performs like new!</li>
            <li> Good value for your money and the product gets to you quickly. No complaints, it fits into my makeup pouch for my purse very well. I will be buying more of their products.</li>
            <li> Only used once but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Love these Kabuki&#x27;s! I have 3 of them now. I like to rotate through them so that I can have a clean one to use every few days. I hand wash them with some facewash and let them air dry. Because the bristles are so thick they can take over a day to dry completely, so it&#x27;s nice to have a backup. I&#x27;ve had my first one for well over 5 years, and it&#x27;s still good as new. The bristles are of great quality and durability, but not vegan if that matters to you.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Kabuki brush that was soft and didn&#x27;t shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews for this brush here, and in other venues, I decided that it must be at least okay for so many people to rave about it so much.  I purchased one yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is so unbelievably soft and luxurious-feeling, it&#x27;s hard to imagine that it cost less then $10!  The metal sleeve and cap protect the brush, and keep any loose powder from migrating into my makeup pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush that came with my makeup was very coarse and it was also terrible for shedding.  I always felt as if something was crawling on my face...very annoying.  The EcoTools Retractable Kabuki Brush does not shed--not at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also pleased with the way this brush applies my mineral makeup so flawlessly.  If it were possible,  I would give it more than 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added plus is that the case and sleeve are made from recycled aluminum, and the bristles are an eco-friendly synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously considering purchasing another to have a spare.  I think it would be difficult to get used to something else,  now that I&#x27;ve used this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously been using the Bare Escentuals Retractable Flawless Application Face Brush, which sells for $30. After something like five years, it finally became unusable. I really needed a replacement but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much on a brush, so I decided to search for alternatives. I came across the Eco Tools retractable Kabuki Brush and after reading the positive reviews, decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I decided to try this brush because it is AWESOME. It performs even better than the Bare Escentuals brush, and costs $20 less. The bristles are soft, hold the powder, and apply it perfectly. I am so happy I found this brush. And an added bonus is that I can feel good that it is eco-friendly. I highly recommend this brush as an alternative to those of you who&#x27;ve been using the pricey BE tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT** 7/1/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week the brush sort of fell apart. It came out of the base and no longer could retract. When it came out, I could see the ring of glue that was used it hold it on. Following the same ring, I coated it with a thin layer of superglue and carefully placed it back where it is supposed to be. So far, so good. It&#x27;s back to proper functioning status.</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for I think 5 or 6 years now and in that time I have only replace in 4 times. That is with daily often multiple times a day use. I think that&#x27;s pretty awesome. I don&#x27;t even take good care of it. I wash it with shampoo or face wash and it comes fine. Not as soft but still works great.</li>
            <li> I recently bought Bare Eccentuals Mineral makeup and wasn&#x27;t too fond of the brush that came with it. I instead bought this brush and use it as an all-over face application/powder brush. It is amazing! It is so soft and my makeup goes on sooo much better than other brushes I&#x27;ve used.I can&#x27;t believe the price of this, and I love the travel holder it comes in. It prevents the brush from getting damaged in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this brush - it feels very well put together. The bristles are VERY soft compared to my experience of other Kabuki brushes. It was one of the reasons I decided on this brush. The one I owned prior was very rough on my skin. This one is noticeably softer, however, it does make it more difficult to blend mineral make up. I&#x27;ve learned to do a primary application on one section of my face at a time, then a secondary \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; with just a dusting of powder. This helps with even application. Overall, especially considering the price, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Ordered this brush for my powder,&lt;br /&gt;was shipped very fast, and I like the way you use the brush, the bristles are VERY soft and have not had a problem with them shedding yet.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other Ecotools brushes in the past, and based on positive experience I had high hopes for this one. The vegan-and-planet friendly hoopla is a positive, however I&#x27;m more impressed by the quality of the brushes at an affordable price point. Comparable retractable synthetic kabuki brushes start at more than double the price at leading cosmetics stores, so this looked like a fabulous beauty bargain... only it broke before I could use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh out of the ziploc-like packaging the brushed aluminum case looked great, though larger than expected. Retracted, with the case closed, it was about four inches long, and over one inch in diameter. If you travel with a [[ASIN:B003JM0WDQ Seya All Black Pro Makeup Case with Trays]], that isn&#x27;t a big deal. If the makeup bag you normally carry is more like an [[ASIN:B0034KSQ1I Ecotools Alicia Cosmetic Bag]] or [[ASIN:B004T0WZBY Ecotools Alicia Deluxe Pencil Case, Beige/Sage, One Size]], you&#x27;ll want to leave this brush behind since it will take up most of the available space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had to decide on the issue of leave-behind or take-with since the first time I retracted the brush, and reopened it, it fell apart. The brush-end came out of the recycled aluminum casing and after that point, would not stay in. Normally I would have asked for a replacement, but I could tell by the construction it wouldn&#x27;t be an isolated incident. The only thing holding the dome-shaped brush and mechanism in the outer shell was a small bit of glue on the bottom. Even if it doesn&#x27;t break on first use, such a poorly assembled tool ends up in the trash heap in six months instead of six years. That&#x27;s not very Eco-friendly in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware where the [[ASIN:B001MX89Y8 Ecotools Recycled Retractable Kabuki]] is concerned. As an alternative, considering looking up Morph&amp;eacute; Brushes. They offer a number of Kabuki alternatives, including a vegan-friendly retractable kabuki brush (the KB9) at the same price point. An added bonus: Morph&amp;eacute; brushes are made in the USA. My fingers are crossed Amazon will start vending Morph&amp;eacute; products this year.nt.

            <li> Not quite as soft as the other ecotools brushes that I&#x27;ve purchased but still very soft. I do have a problem with my face powder which is nearly empty and hollow in the middle and the brush doesn&#x27;t seem to grab enough but is still a great brush. It does well and I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the falling apart that others have made note of.</li>
            <li> I love how this brush retracts and is travel sized.  But the brush is somewhat too compact and tight, making it difficult to evenly apply mineral foundation.  Still, it&#x27;s incredibly soft and has a high quality feel.  I would purchase other items from this brand again.</li>
            <li> I love this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very soft and being retractable is convenient to carry along in my purse, although I wish the cap would not come off that easilly</li>
            <li> arrived in pieces...not worth the trouble to return. Super glue it is.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s soft and the fact that it&#x27;s retractable is perfect for your purse. Quality product!</li>
            <li> This kabuki is light and thick and very good for travelling. I once cleaned it and hair keeps in tact.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!!! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an actress, so I need to ask a lot of my make-up and of course my make-up brushes. I needed something that would provide a LOT of coverage with a powder foundation. Being on stage, no matter how clear or perfect you skin is, you need a lot of foundation. It&#x27;s just the way of stage make-up. None of the brushes that came with my stage kit worked. The make-up itself was wonderful but none of the brushes cut it. I needed more foundation coverage. They did everything else fine. Then I thought I&#x27;d try a kabuki, rather than the full coverage brush the kit came with. So I looked around to find the cheapest thing I could get. I needed a brush soon, for our quickly approaching opening night. I found this and liked the price and the ratings so I bought it. When it came, oh my gosh, it was perfect. It gave me the coverage I needed. It was SUPER soft, which is nice for someone who has to use the brush almost three times a day for a week or more. It also was small enough to fit into my case without causing too much of a shuffle. It worked really well! If it wears out I&#x27;m just going to buy a new one. This brush is great. If you need a lot of coverage and you need it fast and all over, this brush is perfect. I highly recommended it. I&#x27;d give it five stars, but I just have a hard time giving anything five stars unless I feel that it couldn&#x27;t better. If I have one issue it can&#x27;t have five, it has to be PERFECT! I didn&#x27;t find anything wrong with the brush, but still.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my bare mineral brush. This one is so much softer, has a great coverage AND retracts so I can take it anywhere. I saw it for a little bit cheaper at Target but they were always out of stock so I ended up buying here and I&#x27;m very happy. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the coolest kabuki brush I have found!!  Perfect for travel, super cheap price and super quality!  The case is awesome, it pulls the brush into the case so you can slip on the cap without damaging the bristles.  It&#x27;s the same size as my BeautiControl and Arbonne kabuki brushes and feels as good if not better than they do but at 1/3 the price!!  I&#x27;m on here to buy more!!  :)</li>
            <li> I very rarely buy things online, I like to touch/ feel things I buy. I bought this brush after reading some helpful reviews. I absolutely love it. The brush is soft and bristles/ hair are strong and dont fall on my face. Its good to apply mineral make-up/ blush. For the price, its a great buy. i have seen expensive brushes at sephore etc, its honestly as good. The fact that its retractable is great and the mechanism is good so the bristles dont stick to the cap. love it!.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  The cover keeps the bristles covered and I like that it is retractable.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutelly love this brush.  This is the best brush I have found and I have been looking for the right brush for a long time.  I love it because it does not shed at all unlike some of the other $30 brushes I have.  It is very dense which is what I want and therefore applies mineral makeup flawlessly and I can not believe the price compared to the high priced name brand brushes this one out performes them all.  I came back to re-order and I hope they never stop making these.  Try it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> i like that it&#x27;s retractable, all of my friends were so amazed that it was and found it so useful to just toss on the go..where as my other brushes i have to put in a ziplock bag or something..however because it&#x27;s retractable the brush is very stiff..making it unable to brush on your face smoothly</li>
            <li> This a great alternative to expensive kabuki brushes. This brush, like all ecotools brushes, is super soft. The bristles are densely packed and it gives great powder foundation coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN:&lt;br /&gt; I have dry to combination skin so using powder foundations and brushes alone turns me into a cakey patchy mess. Its winter in NYC so my skin is more dry than combination. Considering the dry winter air this brush was no exception. Using this brush and the mac studio fix powder plus foundation, my skin looked airbushed but very dry even after using the mac fix plus to set the powder. I used it with bare minerals foundation and it was the same results. I also used it with setting powder to set my liquid foundation and again my makeup looked cakey. It is not the brushes fault, its my skin. I will update the review in the spring/summer when my skin is more functional :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal to combination skin, this brush is a winner. My sister who has normal skin looks flawless when she uses this brush with powder foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you dont have dry skin this an excellent powder brush. I found this brush to have duel use, it is great powder brush or setting brush and can be used to apply bronzer and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an excellent brush with buildable coverage but please keep your specific skin type in mind before using as a full face brush.</li>
            <li> Lots of good things about this brush, its compact for a purse- it not only twists down into the base but even has a cap. Its easy to wash (keep in mind to NOT retract it when drying, it should be completely exposed to air). Brush is very dense and very soft.</li>
            <li> I love Ecotools to begin with, and this product just reaffirms it. It feels very luxurious and handles mineral make up completely flawlessly. It doesn&#x27;t seem as cheap quality wise as some of the other reviewers have felt it to be. For being less than ten dollars, this kabuki is a steal! I highly recommend it, as well as all ecotool beauty products.</li>
            <li> I bought this kabuki brush after reading all of the positive reviews written by others on this site and others as well. My everyday brush is from BE and this Ecotools Brush blows it out of the water!!! Super soft and picks up my mineral foundation both BE and Alima Pure very well. I use it for finishing powder also and when in a hurry for my blush color as well. It fits into my makeup bag easily too.. Good size not too big. Will definitely re-purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> I was excited to purchase this blush because of the versatility. I needed a brush for on-the-go but I didn&#x27;t want to ruin the bristles. I remember seeing a retractable brush at Sephora, but it was out of my price range. Seeing that I already have a set of Eco-tools brush, I decided to purchase their retractable brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the package arrived ahead of time of it&#x27;s scheduled delivery date, which was awesome. The packaging was a bit difficult to remove. It was hard for me to take out the brush, without having it rammed into the &#x27;zip lock&#x27; closing of the package. I couldn&#x27;t simply push it up from the bottom without ruining the brush head. After I realized there was no way I could get the brush out, without forcing it out, I decided to risk getting angled bristles (which I did, but it could have been worse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles itself is extremely soft. I like the aluminum case, but the only problem I have with the brush (aside from the difficulty of removing the brush), is the cap. For some reason, the cap of my brush is angled so I have trouble closing it efficiently. It is doable, it&#x27;s just doesn&#x27;t close smoothly because I have to align it a certain way before it closes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I love the brush. I use it for press powder and blush from time to time.</li>
            <li> The hairs have started to fall out; would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s retractable so I can use it for travelling. I can even have some powder already&lt;br /&gt;on it and retract for later use. It&#x27;s a great product and I know I will use it quite often. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;for having it. Ecotools products are great!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush i have found for my mineral foundation, i also use the blush brush for my loose powder.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I bought mine from walmart. I wanted to leave this review after reading all that comments on how it broke. I am thinking maybe some brushes online are fake or something because I&#x27;ve had my brush for a few months and it is as good as new. I travel with it and use it a few times a day most days. So that being said this brush is awesome and get it at Walmart if you need the comfort of knowing you will get a easy refund if your not happy.</li>
            <li> It was extremely soft&amp;i can feel the quality. Definitely worth it</li>
            <li> I was so mad when my boxer puppy ate my makeup brushes! I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to afford to replace them with anything comparable at this time, so I tried these brushes thinking they would be a downgrade....let me tell you, I LOVE THIS BRUSH!  It feels so much better on my face than what I was using before! I also bought 2 other styles and I love them as well!</li>
            <li> As for performance, it is as decent as any of my other taklon kabukis.  Maybe not as great at picking up powder as the flatter ones, but that is all a matter of preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s HUGE, I was expecting something the size of the urban decay one, but with less soft bristles. It takes up a way too much room in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I have found the Brush for my mineral foundation!  This talkon brush is wonderfully soft and dense. the case is chic and great for travel and keeping the bristles inline. It feels like cool silk across my face.  The price is great and i love the reusable carry case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love this company.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect.  Super soft and plush, bristles don&#x27;t get bent or fall out, and recycled to boot.  Seriously.  It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> It does its job BUT the silver one is way better.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush from a store and I must say that this brush is perfect especially if you are going \\&quot;green\\&quot;. Comparing it to Too-faced retractable kabuki, they&#x27;re similar in dimensions and the softness in bristles. The difference is that eco-tools is synthetic while Too-Faced says that they&#x27;re Teddy Bear bristles. The brush is absolutely worth the small price and it performs better than a $30 kabuki. The other reviews are accurate and I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> This is very soft, but quite a bit smaller than I expected it. I also expected it to be extendable lengthwise, but the top just retracts into the handle.</li>
            <li> I have little to no experience purchasing brushes for make up but this turned out to be a great product. The case is light aluminum, easy to extend and retract. Perfect size for a small make up bag. The brush itself is a great product, the brush is very soft and does not flake everywhere. I&#x27;ve had this brush for several months now and love it. I&#x27;m definitely buying the same product line again when I need more brushes.</li>
            <li> beautiful and soft skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush due to all of the positive reviews I read about it and it did not disappoint. This is my first kabuki brush and I am amazed at how soft and full the brush is. It feels so nice on the skin, I use it every morning to apply my pressed powder and it makes me look flawless, I would recommend it to all and for the quality of product that you are getting, you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> Received this item on time and the price was good. Great for traveling. This brush is soft and fluffy. It&#x27;s a good one to stick in your purse for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> I orginally bought this brush to get me over $25 to make the free shipping. I was also in need of a new brush as well. Boy was I happy when I opened this puppy and used it. The brush is soooo soft. My face is very picky and loves to be super sensitive. This brush gave me no problems, didn&#x27;t irrate my skin and put my make up on flawless. My hubby even told me I don&#x27;t know what you did with your makeup but it looks very natural and a lot better. So, to me this brush passed the test. I was sold then and even ordered other make up brushes by ecotool. I haven&#x27;t had a problem either about the bristles coming off while I&#x27;m putting on my make up. Terrific brush for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Fell apart. Shoddy construction.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> These wonderful brushes do not shed!  They apply mineral powder foundation flawlessy.  And they are a fabulous buy.  I will NEVER spend $30 on a kabuki brush from BE again - I&#x27;ve purchased several and they all shed.</li>
            <li> I bought the same type of brush from sephora for 29$ and it sheds like crazy. I&#x27;ve used this for a week now, its very soft and hasn&#x27;t shed a single hair. So far very please and the price is amazing!</li>
            <li> this brush is really very gud..i love it..it is so smooth..its bristles are very soft..small and handy..comes with a cover lid to protect the bristles..i m very happy with it</li>
            <li> I LOVE This brush. the actual brush is SOFT SOFT and i love that it retracts into its protective case.</li>
            <li> Some girl stole my kabuki that I had from Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s Bare Bronze line (I used to work there, so it was cheap with my discount). I had to get a new one and found this little gem at Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it. It is incredibly soft, and whenever my friends come over they comment on how soft it is. It feels expensive even though it&#x27;s stupid cheap. It is insanely convenient to be able to retract it and cover it so I don&#x27;t have to worry about anything in my bag getting on it or leftover powder on the brush getting into my bag. It closes up to be quite small, although it might be a bit bulky if you carry around a smaller-sized makeup bag in your purse... but I think that its as small as it can be while still being functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm is that the bristles are a bit dense. I had to buy another, larger, non-retractable brush that has its hairs more spread out which is more functional for all-over application.  This brush I use for more targeted applications of blushes &amp; bronzers... so while I can throw this in my bag and use it for everything, its better at that. Overall its a great brush especially if you want an all-purpose brush that you want to throw in your bag when you travel.</li>
            <li> Soft and easy to use and carry.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest little brush i have ever owned.This person was remalkle for inventing this awesome brush&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerly,&lt;br /&gt;  Brenda</li>
            <li> I love how this retracts and has a lid.  When I first tried to make it restract, I couldn&#x27;t figure it out and realized it was because I was trying to twist it instead of slide it. It&#x27;s well designed so you don&#x27;t have to worry about smashing the bristles when putting the lid on. I use it for mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li> This brush is too hard for me. It feels rough on the face. I have other ecotools products that i LOVE but this brush is not my favorite. Maybe my face is to sensitive.</li>
            <li> This is super soft! Doesn&#x27;t shed. I have always had such great experience with Ecotools brushes and this is no exception! This is great for putting on powder. It is a little big, but definitely still pretty portable (I keep it in my purse for touch ups throughout the day.) I LOVE this brush and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3FVQWVTMCHWNN]]I love Ecotools products. This portable retractable Kabuki Brush is perfect size for your purse. Ecotools makes the most reasonably priced, high quality brushes available. The quality of the brush rivals that of high end brushes like Aveda&#x27;s kabuki brush. Soft and supple while it perfectly distributes your mineral makeup evenly, all while being environmentally friendly. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> It was hard to wash this because the bristles were close together. So the water never dried out and the brush ended smelling.  So I never used it again after I washed it.</li>
            <li> This is a good size brush, and easy to travel with. Really soft, and feels wonderful on your face. It didn&#x27;t shed, which I hear can be a problem. And it did a great job of evenly applying mineral foundation. Also, for what you&#x27;re getting, you cannot beat the price. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  I love being able to keep it covered.  It keeps in clean.  The bristles are so soft and dense.  It does a great job of getting the powder on without making it feel like you are exfoliating with bristles!&lt;br /&gt;The company behind ecotools is exceptional also.  I had a problem with my first brush because it must have been dented during shipping to the drugstore.  I contacted Paris Presents Inc. and Stacy got back to me right away and sent a replacement brush and a gift.  I will stick with this brand from now on!  I have the 5 piece make-up set too.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for applying face powder without leaving coarse little bristles behind. The price was great, too. These brushes tend to be expensive and you take the risk of buying it only to have it shed all over your face. The fact that it&#x27;s retractable means it won&#x27;t scatter powder all over the inside of your purse or wherever you keep it. Great brush!</li>
            <li> Nice product, received quick.</li>
            <li> Initially, I loved this brush.  I am sensitive to most brushes but this one did not irritate my skin.  However, after less than five weeks of using it, all of the pieces started coming un-glued.  The entire brush fell apart!  I tried returning the item but apparently, I am past the allowable return date.  What a disappointment...</li>
            <li> I wish the brush was thicker, but compared to other brushes on Amazon, this is really well-priced.  The cap also doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, so I might end up throwing it away and keeping the plastic display holder that it came in.  The brush is very smooth though and feels very nice on your skin.</li>
            <li> granted, this is my only kabuki ever, but it is damn good. it is SO SOFT and is great at putting on powder. there&#x27;s no shedding, it&#x27;s very easy to clean, and is way cheaper than other brushes i&#x27;ve seen. it&#x27;s also got a nice cover if you need to take it around with you. my only beef with it is that after a year of use, the sliding tube that holes the brush kind of broke off of the outside metal tube. it&#x27;s basically just super glued in. so i super glued it back. but yea, i was surprised when it just popped out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best kabuki brush I ever used with the best price! ecotools are amazing! their price is very good, and it&#x27;s Eco friendly! I definetely recommend this brush and all the other ecotools! they are best in the market!!! it&#x27;s espically great for mineral products!!!!! love it!!!</li>
            <li> i use bareminerals mineral makeup, and i thought my brushes shed because they were old... so i bought a new set eventually with NEW brushes and they ended up shedding more. was definitely a pain to pick off like 10 bristles after you&#x27;re done/in between applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought this brush to keep in my purse when i decide to travel with my makeup. this brush is SOOO soft and is GREAT for mineral makeup. i bought a different set which had another kabuki in it because i love it so much. it&#x27;s not prickly like the bareminerals brush, and i feel like it takes in product much better, also. LOVE buffing with this brush!</li>
            <li> This is retractable and is just fun to use!  The brush feels soft against my cheeks and applies powder easily and smoothly.  A nice product!</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for any time. Very soft. Retracts into it&#x27;s protective case easily. Shorter handle, but easy to hold. Perfect for me.</li>
            <li> My mom has this and I wanted one, so I got it! Perfect!</li>
            <li> I have bought a couple of other brushes at target and other stores.  From the minute I opened it I could tell this one is better.  The brushes are soft but hold their shape.  The system of putting on the lid takes a little getting used to, but it serves its purpose well for keeping the brush protected.  Will be easy to travel with as well.</li>
            <li> These EcoTools brushes are fabulous. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong here... Initially I was concerned they wouldn&#x27;t be soft enough, however they are the softest I have ever felt. I have no idea how these are made, but +1 to EcoTools... Will buy more of these!</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel or to prevent the brush from getting messed up. I&#x27;ve owned high, mid and low end brushes. These top them all! Plus I am not left wondering about the animal the hair came from as this are not animal hair.</li>
            <li> I have great things to say about the actual product but not so great things to say about how it arrived. It was simply thrown into a generic brown envelope and the metal cap became bent and malformed during shipment. As a result, the metal cap was more oval-ish than round and wouldn&#x27;t fit onto the the brush. After I tried to re-bend it back to a more round shape it sort of fits onto the brush but it&#x27;s still not perfect. The actual brush, on the other hand, is great! It&#x27;s a good quality brush to travel with or keep in your purse and it&#x27;s far less expensive than name-brand brushes from a cosmetics counter at a department store. I just wish whoever ships this out would package it carefully so that it doesn&#x27;t arrive in a damaged condition!</li>
            <li> So pleased with this brush. First one I&#x27;ve ever found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and it does miraculous things with my powder. Wonderfully soft and great design for keeping it compact and protected on the go. Can&#x27;t believe a brush at this price point is so much better than any others I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> This brush felt soft and silky and I loved it, until it fell apart less than a week after purchase.  Granted I didn&#x27;t pay a fortune for it, but still expected it to last longer than four days.  I&#x27;ve tried gluing the base back together, but it won&#x27;t stay.  More than a little disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush is nice and portable. It did break after about a year of use and I re-ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is fantastic! It&#x27;s the perfect brush to replace a natural kabuki brush as it is soft and you can control your coverage.  HOWEVER, the apparatus that allows the brush to retract into the base is in dire need of a redesign.  Unfortunately, after only two or three washings, the cover that holds the brush base detaches. I have three of these brushes (one in my gym bag, one in my travel bag, and one in my bathroom).  Each one has come apart.  I still use them because I love the brush so much, but it is so disappointing not to be able to retract them for more compact (and sanitary!) storage. I hope EcoTools will look into this design flaw.  It&#x27;s not as simple as using better glue because I have tried hot glueing AND super glueing the bases back into place and they still come apart.</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes for mineral makeup!! Super soft and does not shed!</li>
            <li> My favorite brush for applying loose powder. Its soft and fluffy and feels good on skin. I love that it has a cap, so I can keep it hygienic.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush!! I love how it retracts and is SO easy to carry around with me everywhere I go! It works great for applying blushes, and face powders. I would highly recommend this for anyone who finds themselves applying makeup when they are out and about a lot</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this much yet, but I love the design and practicality of it.  I hate throwing my brushes into a makeup bag to get covered in germs for me to smear all over my face!  This is compact and convenient to throw into any bag along with your mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> Me encant&amp;oacute; este producto porque las cerdas de la brocha queda protegida del resto de art&amp;iacute;culos que tenemos en el bolso de maquillaje y as&amp;iacute; no se contamina, de f&amp;aacute;cil manejo y guardado, mi hermana quedo encantada y quiere uno para ella. Recomendado</li>
            <li> The basic things everyone wants out of their makeup brushes are softness, easy care, bristles that don&#x27;t shed, and effectiveness at putting on the makeup they are intended to be used with. This brush, and every other Ecotools brush I have tried, fit every criteria. The Ecotools line also has the bonus feature of using kind-to-the-earth materials--synthetic bristles (no animal products!) and recycled aluminum. (Their other brushes have bamboo handles, which I approve of as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Softness:  Other brushes I tried poked my skin and were uncomfortable. The Ecotools brushes are soft and don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy care: I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid castile soap to clean the brushes, then stand them upright to dry in a ceramic toothbrush holder I have repurposed for my brushes. They are just as good as new after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shedding: I have never seen a single bristle shed, though another brand shed horrendously the first time I washed them--what a waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: Fit the tool to the job and you will do fine. Many of the Ecotools brushes are perfect in both shape and size for mineral makeup. The kabuki brush is perfect for on-the-go application of anything from mineral concealer to mineral foundation to mineral blush. It also works great with compact-style makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like this retractable kabuki brush because it has a cap that completely covers and protects the bristles. Some of the smaller brushes I used to carry in my purse, even though I had them wrapped in a cloth case, got battered pretty quickly. The kabuki brush is proof against any of that. I&#x27;ve had it for many months at this point, carrying it in my purse everywhere, and it is just a nice as the day I purchased it. I highly recommend it--and at a fraction of the price that you might pay for brushes of lesser quality, it is as easy on your pocketbook as on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second EcoTools retractable kabuki. I used the first one for a couple of years until the bristles started to wear out--I liked it so much that I purchased a second one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works just as well, but they seem to have changed it somehow--it has an odd smell to it, very noticeable when you use it to put powder right around your nose! I&#x27;m hoping it will fade.</li>
            <li> I have used Eco-tools for years now and they are superb. They last a long time and don&#x27;t tangle like other brushes do. These are quite good.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago.  I was able to use it twice to apply blush. The third time I attempted to use it, it fell apart.  The section that holds the brush became unglued from the bottom portion of the tube. Tried to glue it back together with crazy glue and let it dry over night but, this did not work and the sections would not stay glued together.  As it is not cost effective to return this item it went into the trash and i will not buy Ecotools again.</li>
            <li> It Is a great travel &amp; non-travel brush it was really soft but it BROKE! It was put together with weak glue that wore off a week or so after using it. Would I buy it again? No...</li>
            <li> Love this little brush. It is perfect for putting on powder and blush. It is very soft, and I absolutely love how it folds up inside of itself (keeps it clean and compact). I would recommend this earth friendly item!</li>
            <li> Love it! Does a great job of blending out foundation powder. I use Bare Minerals or Smashbox foundation powder. When I don&#x27;t use this brush, the powder goes on unevenly. I love the environmental aspects of this company.</li>
            <li> Brush is firm and is of excellent quality.  The retractable feature is a great idea.  I wish the diameter of the brush head was a little bigger.  I also see these tools at the local super drug and would definitely buy again. Well  made.</li>
            <li> I prefer my travel brushes to be retractable, so I was glad I found this for way less than the store prices. Minimal to no shedding, no noticeable smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kabuki at a local drug store. I love the whole Eco tools line of brushes so I decided to give this one a try. I love it, love it, love it. Super soft and it applies your make up flawlessly. The retractable feature is also a huge plus. I took it with me to the Mac store to compare to their Kabuki and I must say I was way more satisfied with this one. Price wise, softness, and over all performance.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and after recieving a \\&quot;free\\&quot; brush with the clinique powder I recently purchased at a dept. store, I could not believe how scratchy and uncomfortable that brush was to use...it made my sensitive skin even worse! So I went out in search of a new powder brush. I figured I&#x27;d have to shell out $30 or so for a good one, but when I came across this one, I decided I&#x27;d just give it a shot (mostly because I was too lazy to go to another store). Wow! This brush is soooo soft I couldn&#x27;t believe it!It must be the softest makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever used! The bristles are perfect and don&#x27;t fall out all the time like the ones in many brushed I&#x27;ve used and the retractable feature makes it super easy to store and keep clean. I would definitely reccomend it!</li>
            <li> thanks not as good as the other one they use to make but its still good</li>
            <li> I have been using bare minerals powder makeup for 5 years and have gone through every brand of Kabuki brush out there. This the best, most affordable one I have ever used! I am going back and buying two more, one for my mom and the other for an extra. The bristles are soooo soft and i love that it retracks and had a lid, makes one less thing to make a mess in my makeup bag. Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush! The bristles don&#x27;t come off during makeup application like some other brushes, and the retractable feature is great, allowing for me to keep it neatly stored in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> I was almost skeptical to buy this brush after reading some reviews, but it was the price I was looking for and I loved the Eco quality so went for it. It is a super soft brush in a perfect size for applying powder. It picks up the right amount of powder to leave a smooth finish on the skin, no need to tap off the brush, so no mess! I have had no troubles with the case or retractable mechanism. It is a nice compact size and fits perfectly in my small make up bag. It is worth the buy and measures up to much more expensive Kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a retractable brush that I could keep in my makeup bag while on the go, and this works great for that purpose.  I use it primarily for blush.  It really is super soft, as advertised, and it seems like a good quality brush.  Even the little bag it came in was made from recycled materials.  I love that it comes with a cap, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about makeup residue getting all over the inside of my bag.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. Powdered makeup doesn&#x27;t fall off the bristles, it applys everything nicely but the best thing I love about it is how it does not fall apart, the bristles do not fall out even after cleaning &amp; that fact of how easy it is to clean. After it dries it is exactly as before you washed it. Other brushes that I have used in the past never seem to be the same after they dry but this just bounces back to brand new again. Totally amazing!</li>
            <li> Soft, compact, and brush hairs do not fall out easily. Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> This is a nice, soft brush that is a great replacement for the powder puff I have been using to apply my mineral powder foundation for the last few years. I was tired of the weird streaky look I was getting with the puff, so I decided to try a brush. This brush is LARGE and the fact that it&#x27;s retractable is a bonus- it&#x27;s easy to carry along with you, travel with, and also stays cleaner when not in use. And it is a great applicator- the powder goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any powdery streaks on my face. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is that the brush came apart into four pieces (cap, base, brush, retracting mechanism) when I was trying to remove it from the packaging and now it doesn&#x27;t retract anymore. If I futz with it a bit I can get it to slide back into the cap, but most of the time I just leave it out, which is fine but defeats the purpose of a retractable brush! Just be careful when pulling it from the cloth packaging it comes in.</li>
            <li> I really love how soft the brushes are! It feels great on my soft skin! It is helping with my acne to have such I better brush now!!</li>
            <li> Super soft kabuki brush!  Gives a flawless, airbrushed finish!  No hair fallout and uber easy to clean!  Great, fast shipping!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> have had it for over a month, hasn&#x27;t shed one hair and is still soft</li>
            <li> This is a great tool, especially for the price. The brush is extremely soft and retracts which is great for travel!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  I already had one, which I keep in my bag, so this second brush will be at home.  It&#x27;s incredibly soft, durable, and very, very portable, given the retraction.  This brush, along with a spoolie for my eyebrows, is really all I need.  Highly recommended....I would buy two more if these disappeared.</li>
            <li> I ordered a second one so that I could have one in my purse and one at my makeup table. I do love this brush but it does have a flaw. When I got my first one I had no problems at all washing it but I think I may have used water that was too hot one time and the brush fell out of the handle and it came apart. It was only glued together so I figured I would just glue it back together and that did work for a while. But it did fall apart again and so I reassembled it and drilled a hole in the side of the bottom where the inner tube sits and put a little screw in there. That held tight for a year but the screw got loose and I resorted to a piece of duct tape over it to keep it tight. I just got my new one which I will be more careful cleaning but I might  just drill that too and use a small bolt to keep it tight before it happens again. This may seem like a lot of work for a brush but when you feel this brush you will understand. The actual  brush head however did not fall apart and it has not lost one single bristle either! I carry this brush in my purse loaded with some powder at all times. I also adore the little kabuki that comes in the minerals set.</li>
            <li> I got this brush today, and I&#x27;m sure, like others, I had to try it out straight away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally buy Bobbi Brown make up brushes, but I found that the powder brushes shed an awful lot after a lot of use and cleaning, so I wanted to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies!!!! This kabuki brush is one of the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a mineral powder foundation and it looks flawless when applied with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you really get what you paid for AND so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good quality, sturdy kabuki brush. That does not shed, is super soft and compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it. It really is worth it!</li>
            <li> I looooove how soft this brush is. It&#x27;s amazing. I can&#x27;t believe i got sucked into buying the expensive $40 brush from Bare Minerals when i first started using their makeup like ten years ago. I finally decided it was time to replace it and decided to try this from Amazon... its actually much softer and better and sheds less (not at all so far, actually, in the 3 months i&#x27;ve had it) than the expensive old brush. After finding this, i ended up reading some articles about how fancy brushes are one of the most overrated, overpriced things in beauty/makeup products.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful brush for a great price and a great cause!  It&#x27;s compact and stays clean; the metal case is easy to remove with one hand (grip the brush base with your palm while you remove the top part of the case with your thumb and forefinger) so that you can hold your compact with one hand and remove the cap of the brush with the other.  No hairs fall out!</li>
            <li> So soft!  I just dab it onto my pressed powder and smooth over my face.  Make up goes on smooth and the brush feels like baby bunny hair, so soft.  No problem with the hairs falling out either like with other similar products.  It&#x27;s a steal for the price!</li>
            <li> Love this retractable kabuki brush. It fits perfectly into my makeup bags.</li>
            <li> I use this brush daily. It is compact and applies powder perfectly on the go. There is little to no shedding and is so soft. I am very satisfied with this brush!</li>
            <li> This was my first EcoTools purchase, chosen because of it is made of synthetic and recycled materials. It seems like all the good reviews are justified. It is well made and I love that I can carry it in my make-up bag without worrying about the brush getting dirty or ruined. I am quickly falling in love with EcoTools and have ordered several other brushes since. I would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for travel and as a spare while cleaning my primary brush and was very surprised at the quality for the price. Would definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my Bare Escentuals Kabuki Brush, and I couldn&#x27;t resist the price of this Ecotools product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is retractable so that I can pack it easily when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is very soft and feels like silk as it glides across my face. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it picks up very little product and does not offer good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy the Bare Escentuals Kabuki Brush again at about three times the price, but I think it is worth it since my last one lasted several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage and don&#x27;t mind spending more time to get your makeup on, you might like this, but it just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> As advertized, great product!</li>
            <li> Seems like a great brush. I gave it 4 stars because the cap is a little loose fitting. Wish it was a bit more snug.</li>
            <li> This brush wasn&#x27;t as soft as I hoped it would be, but it&#x27;s still a good one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the bristles are very soft. No shedding whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel and great color.</li>
            <li> Not dense enough for good liquid foundation makeup, and yet the bristles are a bit tight for easy application of blush...so I like/use it as a travel foundation applicator that I take in my purse (especially since it closes and won&#x27;t make a mess), but it cannot compare to a good quality flat top kabuki brush for home use.  I would say it&#x27;s good but definitely not great.</li>
            <li> I got the retractable kabuki for my mom for Christmas. The brush feels great and retracts fine. However, the cap was a bit warped. That made it kind of snag the bristles unless it is pushed on at just the right angle.</li>
            <li> Part of the reason to have a retractable kabuki is to have a portable kabuki. The top on this thing is a total joke. If your brush is meant to simply sit on your countertop with nothing ever coming close to making it fall, then this is for you. If, however, you have a makeup case or basket or drawer, and you want a brush that will stay clean, forget about it. And if you&#x27;re wanting something for your purse - definitely skip this puppy. The brush is soft, which is the only positive thing I can say about this item. :(</li>
            <li> Works good and brush seems of good quality but the open/close slider (???) seems like it wont last for a long time.  But at this price, I would mid replacing if it breaks in a year.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a stocking stuffer. It was exactly what she wanted. After one week, the brush section detached. Due to the retractable element, I&#x27;m not sure how others have managed to re glue.&lt;br /&gt;It was inexpensive enough but I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. This is my 2nd brush that I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon from EcoTools. It lasts long, it&#x27;s compact but has a nice weight to it, and puts powder on evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this brush for a couple of weeks now, so I can&#x27;t speak of its lasting-quality, but it is a perfect size for the small cosmetics bag, no bristles have fallen off, it is soft and functional. At this price point I will not mind purchasing another should it last only a few months.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush and looks like good quality.  i am giving them as a gift so i don&#x27;t have a full report yet.</li>
            <li> Nice brush and I love the casing, but I&#x27;m starting to think the retractor in my brush is broken?  Not sure if it&#x27;s worth it to return and get a new one, but just thought I&#x27;d share to see if anyone experienced the same thing.</li>
            <li> This brush was not what I expected. I wanted a powder brush....this would be more of a blush brush. It does not retract far enough for my needs. However, it is a nice brush. Good quality.</li>
            <li> I like this Kabuki mainly because it is a retractable brush.  I can take it with me.  I was using the version from elf, but it is not as easy for travel.  I like the latter one better.  This one is nice though.  It has good bristles, and is dense enough to get the job done.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be as \\&quot;great\\&quot; as the other.  But it is the best one I have found thus far for travel...so beggar&#x27;s can&#x27;t be choosers :)</li>
            <li> Retractable brush whats not to love!</li>
            <li> I have found that these retractable brushes are as good as the $50 ones they sell. I love there softness and they don&#x60;t shed.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. Well after a year of using it and it&#x27;s still in great shape. I love that it contracts into the case, and it&#x27;s the perfect size for a swoosh of blush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice! :0)</li>
            <li> Really great brush, the container is very durable.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years and it&#x27;s still in great shape!</li>
            <li> I need it for travelling, thought it will be smaller&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much (quality and soft) that&#x27;s why I keep it&lt;br /&gt;guess this one will be good for home base make up tools&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;searching retractable slimmer/shorter kabuki for travelling&lt;br /&gt;to be continued ,,,</li>
            <li> Very fluffy brush. Perfect for blush or bronzer. What makes it even better is that it is retractable. So the brush stays protected at all times if you take this with you in your purse.</li>
            <li> An excellent brush for applying powdered mineral facial make-up.  Tucks away easily when not in use.</li>
            <li> I have used Ecotools for years so I didn&#x27;t think twice about ordering a new brush online. I liked the idea of a retractable kabuki brush but this one broke into pieces when I tried to close it (without any use of force, it just fell apart). In this case, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Not the super dense brush I was expecting</li>
            <li> This was a good brush, but the little part that you use to adjust it wouldn&#x27;t stay put like other similar brushes I have used.</li>
            <li> Very High quality brush... larger than most travel size brushes + comes with nice travel pouch for purse.</li>
            <li> I use Bareminerals foundation and the Kabuki brush of their brand shed like a shaggy dog, this one did not, and gives gorgeous coverage. It is one of my staples, it&#x27;s soft and thick and offers full-coverage w/my mineral foundation powder.</li>
            <li> One day of use and the handle broke off.  I could have had that happen with a tool from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> I think I would prefer this brush if it didn&#x27;t retract.  I find it a little hard to use on a daily basis because it tends to fan in when you are trying to use it.  It would be really great for traveling though.</li>
            <li> Arrived in two pieces and not even glue could put it back together. Thankfully Amazon called it a wash and didn&#x27;t make me ship it back to them for a refund (probably would&#x27;ve cost more both financially and environmentally to do so!).</li>
            <li> Very soft exactly what i wanted im in love with this brush!</li>
            <li> Love this for using loose powder on the go. Load it up, twist down.  Clinique did it in the 80s, and I still do it today.</li>
            <li> I used this brush no more than 15 times and it fell apart on me. I attempted to return it but I was outside my return window.  Perhaps I will stick to getting some items at a &amp;#34;Real&amp;#34; store where I could have gotten an exchange for the poor workmanship.</li>
            <li> Does anyone else&#x27;s have a strong smell? Maybe a chemical or something on it. Still has not gone away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Soft and easy to use . Product sometimes clumps up in the brush though, which I don&#x27;t like . I have to replace every couple of months . But I love retractable for my makeup bag and for touchups on the go.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft! Some of the reviews had me thinking twice about purhasing this brush but I love it.</li>
            <li> This brush is large and so very soft.  It is one of my favorites because of the bristle density and how gentle on the skin it is. It works well to distribute powder and stores neatly and easily without making a mess, but it is too large to be truly &#x27;purse friendly&#x27; or fit in a makeup bag, which to me is the whole point of a retractable brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After regular use for about a year it is still super-soft, fluffy, in good shape and not shedding at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like it and the quality for the price is extremely good.  I would probably buy this again, but not specifically for &#x27;on the go&#x27; use as it was a lot bulkier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a retractable Kabuki brush for travel. Makeup brushes can be so expensive and I didn’t want to spend a lot on this item. I came across Ecotools, which I have never used before. I’m very pleased. The product feels much more expensive than it was. The bristles are soft and there is no excessive shedding. It seems to grab and apply the product quite nicely.  I would highly recommend this product and am eager to try more from this brand.</li>
            <li> A very soft yet stable brush, it was so nice just to use it on my face.  It made me realize how much my old one had gotten tough.  It retracts like it should and is what I would consider to be a great size for powder.  Great for travel so it doesn&#x27;t get crimped or messy.</li>
            <li> Great brush. I love the retractable feature. Great for travel too.</li>
            <li> I like the brush because it&#x27;s retractable, eco-friendly, and size is small so it fits nicely in my cosmetic bag. The brush is soft, but it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;incredibly soft&amp;#34; as product description says. I wished the actual brush itself was bit bigger/wider. Considering everything, it&#x27;s an overall good brush.</li>
            <li> great product. Soft and applies powder smoothly. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> This brush is very high quality at an excellent price. The bristles are very soft and do not break off. The cap is designed for travel. This is an essential makeup tool. Would also make a great gift for your favorite fairy.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush! It&#x27;s super soft and picks up the perfect amount of powder for light touch ups. It&#x27;s perfectly sized and easily fits into my carry around makeup bag. I would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I got this because I kept reading about &amp;#34;kabuki&amp;#34; brushes and this one was priced well and had good reviews. I use it to apply my MAC SKinFinish natural powder. This works great, and I love that it retracts--takes up a lot less space that way, and doesn&#x27;t sprinkle loose powder all over everything because it&#x27;s covered in my bag. As other reviewers said, the bristles do NOT fall off (and that always used to happen with my standard MAC one. I think it gives powder a nice natural finish.</li>
            <li> It is really annoying when i try to put my foundation on and find brush bristles on my face sheds A LOT!!!!</li>
            <li> Great brush, great price. No shedding! My only complaint is that the lid doesn&#x27;t fit on very tight but I can deal with that.</li>
            <li> The first (and only) time I used this brush, the hairs started coming out. At first it was just one or two, but then a clump of hairs came out. I returned it. I&#x27;m going to try the Ecotools five-piece set. I&#x27;m hoping there was a problem with the casing for this brush and that the brand&#x27;s nonretractable brushes will be better. I did like the texture of the hairs.</li>
            <li> Goes everywhere I go! Love!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this particular item because I already have an EcoTools kabuki brush and really like it. The brush I received was a different, cheap one. If I had known that I wasn&#x27;t going to get one identical to the one I already have, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it. I was very disappointed with the item that came in the mail. The only &#x27;good&#x27; thing was that I received it about 3 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> This brush from ecotools is a must-have! This is the only brush I regularly carry around with me. The retractable feature comes in handy more than I thought, especially since I started to keep it in my purse. Since it has a cap to go on it, I like to run the brush in my powder I&#x27;d use to touch-up before I go out, and when I need to, I can just pull it out and it keeps the powder packed inside so i don&#x27;t need to carry the actual powder with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this brush so far, but I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks so far. It does not shed - which was what I was looking for - even if it doesn&#x27;t last very long (as stated in some reviews) I&#x27;m okay with that at this price with no shedding :)&lt;br /&gt;3/24/14 - the brush is still going strong, with no shedding. I did find this brand at Walmart, as an FYI, right about the same price. I bought the blush brush then as well and love it too :-)</li>
            <li> Soft and portable. The price in Amazon is much cheaper than other places.</li>
            <li> This is my second one, the first lasted a few years before the glue finally gave way inside and it came apart. For the money I think I definitely got more than enough use out of it, and liked it so much that I bought the same product again. It&#x27;s really soft on your skin, and I use it for my bare minerals powder foundation. I clean it with a spray on daily brush cleanser from Sephora, which works great. It doesn&#x27;t shed much at all and holds its shape really well.</li>
            <li> its very good to carry in your makeup bag.. and i love it to apply powder.. but not so good for blush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush but base was not glued to handle properly. As a result, the handle would detach when retracting the brush. Brush is soft and appears to be well made. Product was returned.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. Brush would not raise up for use much less retract.  Didn&#x27;t cost enough to pay for return shipping.  Their other brushes are nice, but don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> This is the softest brush I have found and what a great price!  Only a few fibers fell out at first (maybe 8 at the most).  I really like that it is retractable too!</li>
            <li> This little brush is great, I read all of the reviews before getting it and am glad I got it.  I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  The construction seems very sturdy and I haven&#x27;t experienced any loose hairs. I use it every day and the bristles are super soft, good buy for your money.</li>
            <li> great mineral makeup brush for travel.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Provides perfect, even coverage and is soft and lightweight.</li>
            <li> Total crap, fell apart the first time I used it. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It completely came apart into 3 different pieces, cant even get it to stay together if I try</li>
            <li> My first kabuki brush, well one that wasn&#x27;t purchased a part of mineral powder package. It works so much better, I&#x27;m sorry I waited this long to make the investment.</li>
            <li> I use EcoTools Retractable Kabuki Brush to apply Valana Minerals Stardust Luxury Mineral Foundation. The brush is super soft, quite dense, doesn&#x27;t shed and applies powder evenly and generously allowing for fuller coverage. It also holds up very well with regard to washing/air-drying and is very travel friendly. I like EcoTools makeup brushes because they are effective, affordable, easily accessible and eco-friendly. I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase EcoTools Retractable Kabuki Brush when necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I wash my makeup brushes weekly with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Unscented Baby-Mild Castile Bar Soap.</li>
            <li> This is my 6th brush; I have one for each powder that I use. They wash up nicely with mild face soap and warm water and do not fall apart after being cleaned. You can also take them on the go with you fully loaded with touch up powder if needed.</li>
            <li> This is a great, affordable kabuki brush. The bristles are incredibly soft and silky, with just the right amount of density. This brush works amazing with mineral foundation. I use BareMinerals and the application is even and looks very natural, don&#x27;t need a lot of product either!! Added bonus: retractable for easy and mess-free travel in purse or suitcase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note for anyone who&#x27;s looking to use this brush with liquid foundation: I tried using this brush with liquid foundation too, to test versatility, and it was a no-go; the brush seems just too dense for a smooth application; the bristles tend to drag as you buff/stipple the liquid onto your skin. Also, as you buff your face, the liquid foundation gets worked deeper into the bristles and makes cleaning more time-consuming than when powder mineral foundation is used.</li>
            <li> the softest, best brush. It picks up product well, doesn&#x27;t shed, and the retractile bristles make it super easy to keep it nice.</li>
            <li> Broke within a month of use..</li>
            <li> My favorite powder brush ever - love this thing!</li>
            <li> Love the retractable kabuki.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this brush for blushes and loose mineral powders.  It is very soft, and the retractable brush will be great for traveling!</li>
            <li> I loved this when it arrived, it was super soft and I loved that it was retractable-was hoping for no more powder mess in my make up bag. This brush lasted for two days.  The interior of the brush came unglued and was utterly useless.  I tried using glue to re-secure it but it would not hold.  Like some other reviews said, it was not cost effective to send it back.  Complete waste of money and had to throw it away.  I do not recommend this company or any of it&#x27;s make up products to anyone. So dissappointed.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say that this brush is awesome, it&#x27;s the only one I use, buffs my powder foundation better than any other brush and is more sanitary/convenient than loose brushes. BUT I think Amazon has a bad stock of this. I&#x27;ve bought this brush three separate times from Amazon and each time it&#x27;s broken right out of the package. I still have this same brush I bought from Walgreens months ago, however. It gets daily use, has been washed multiple times, and has never shed. I bought this as a backup since I lost my first ecotools kabuki from two years ago recently. Btw, that old silver aluminum one was built better than this newer bronze one. I talked with live chat and they said they&#x27;ve noticed similar complaints and will look into it. Overall, I highly recommend this brush, but don&#x27;t buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a store and I LOVE IT. I hated the brushes that came with my mineral makeup, this one works beautifully. If you&#x27;re unsure of ordering it here, it runs around the same at Wal-Mart. Buy it. You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given this 5 stars if the bottom part hadn&#x27;t been loose.  I have to be careful when I open the brush because half the time I get the wrong end coming out and it&#x27;s not supposed to do that.  Other than that, this brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> Excelent brush, very soft and usefull for my travel makeup, I&#x27;m gonna use it a lot to touch up my makeup</li>
            <li> Love this because it is sooo soft, applies powder evenly, and the retractable feature keeps bristles straight and together without ever smooshing out.</li>
            <li> Mine actually fell apart after a few weeks and I had to glue it back together.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when it arrived but the packaging it come in made it really hard to get the brush out without bending the bristles. The bristles are soft but the cap seems tight and very think, worried that the cap will eventually crack because of that.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear makeup but when I do, I use a little concealer and mineral powder. Then it goes back in the drawer and sits for weeks....months....? So I like to have a retractable brush which will keep the brush in good shape and clean (especially if I am traveling). A few years ago I couldn&#x27;t even find one and ended up buying a regular one. I&#x27;m so happy retractable brushes are back! I wouldn&#x27;t want anything else. The brush is super soft and feels like a fancy high quality brush, not something you can find at drugstores. Great product. I hope it&#x27;s here to stay.</li>
            <li> It smells like perfume.  I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever for applying face powder.  It is very soft and easy to work with. In fact, I like it so much that I gave one to my daughter-in-law and she also likes it.</li>
            <li> This broke in about 3 months.  Was not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> THis is a cool retractable brush but I did not think it was very soft.  I do have sensitive skin so if you have that type of skin as well, I would recommend looking for a different brush.</li>
            <li> This product works great, I read the reviews and went ahead and bought it. Great deal for the price. Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> This retractable brush broke apart in my small, soft hands the very first time I opened it. I had owned the brush for less than a minute. The brand is highly recommended on Makeup Alley, so I was surprised and disappointed that the functionality of the mechanism relies on a single smear of dried-up glue. I think it will be repairable with Gorilla Glue, but I hadn&#x27;t planned to need to fix it before I could use it, so only one star for this EcoTools product and I will think twice before buying another.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely brush. Very soft and doesn&#x27;t leave little pieces of brush hair all over your face. I use this with bare minerals and love the buffing effect it has. The brush comes with a cap and the handle of the brush slides up to cover the brush and keep its shape. You can very easily adjust the brush by sliding it up a little (which makes the brush firmer) for a heavier coverage or keeping the brush fully open for a bronzer or mineral powder.&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great brush for the price</li>
            <li> The brush works for mineral foundation, bronzer and/or finishing powder. The retractable aspect makes it easy to slip into your makeup bag or store in your cosmetics box. As is usual with EcoTools brushes, the bristles are super soft and it is a breeze to clean. [[ASIN:B002BGI404 Ecotools Make-Up Kabuki Brush Retractable]]</li>
            <li> i just love it. it&#x27;s so soft and puts my foundation on very well. plus, it fits so perfectly in my little pouch.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Best blush brush I&#x27;ve used. Very soft and full. Easily packable for travel and purse, and large enough for daily use. Excellent quality, eco-friendly, and great price. You will not be disappointed! I&#x27;m ordering another one just in case I lose the one I have.</li>
            <li> I love my ecotools retractable Kabuki. I have many ecotools brushes but this is one of my favorite! It&#x27;s so soft! I use it mostly to apply foundation and it helps my foundation blend beautifully! Love this brush!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is really soft to the touch and is easy to clean. It applies my blush perfectly and I like how I can easily fold it up to store it or to throw it in my purse or make-up bag. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This retractable Kabuki is so cute and convenient. I am used to using Ecotools brushes and I have many. I was just looking for a portable powder brush that doesn&#x27;t mess up my make up bag. I went between this brush and a too faced retractable brush, but I decided on this one based on prior experience with the brand and the wonderful price compared to the other one. The brush is very soft, as was expected, and very cute. It retracts effortlessly and I had no problems with the snap on cover. It also came in a reusable pouch. All in all a wonderful brush that is soft and doesn&#x27;t shed, just as I expected it to be. (The price is really good for such an exceptional brush)Do not hesitate to buy.</li>
            <li> Great, small, easy and does exactly what it says it will do. I have no complaints and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> lovely brush thank you</li>
            <li> I tried the blush brush first and loved the price and how soft it was. Since the Bare Essential brushes are three times the price and last no more than six months I thought as long as these last six months they are worth it. These brushes are so soft and Don&#x27;t shed at all like the Bare essentials do. I&#x27;ve only owned them for a month so I don&#x27;t know how long they will last but don&#x27;t foresee them falling apart as fast as the BE&#x27;s do. I have bought them as gifts for my family because of how impressed I am with them. I was a little worried they wouldn&#x27;t pick up the foundation very well, but was proven wrong again. They do a great job picking up and applying the foundation and warmth. Highly highly recommend. I have bought all the brushes now.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this brush is.  The fact that it&#x27;s retractable is super convenient for not getting powder on other things when you place it in your bag.  I use it to apply my powder foundation and it does an excellent job.  I had the same brush (but in silver) for a couple of years now and I haven&#x27;t found one better.</li>
            <li> Thought this could not possibly live up to the hype but it does. Very soft and cruelty-free bristles and bamboo handle- so nice. Seems impossible that this could be as fine after the fortune I&#x27;ve been shelling out for Clinique and MAC brushes for so long. I can afford to replace much more easily although so far the quality seems about the same as previous brushes. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another retractable brush that I had from a different brand (Two Faced), which was wonderful.  This one from EcoTools does not even compare to the other one.  The bristles are not very soft.  The only positive I have is that it retracts.</li>
            <li> This brush is protected by the metal covering, which is telescoped for its use.The brush itself is extremely soft and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I have several Eco-Tools brushes, and I&#x27;ll never purchase any other brand. They&#x27;re blissfully soft, they&#x27;ve lasted me for years and I&#x27;m still using them, and they&#x27;re eco friendly! I bought the kabuki brush a few years ago and was thrilled with it. I just bought another because I finally realized I needed  a second brush to use when I&#x27;m cleaning the first (they take a little while to dry after washing). I use these guys for Bare Minerals Foundation. A few of my smaller brushes (for eyeshadow, etc) by this brand have started to have issues with the brush head loosening from the handle, but they are still useable. The kabuki is still flawless after years of constant wear, as is my blush brush.</li>
            <li> Was great.  Fell apart after 6 months and was utterly unusable due to it&#x27;s retractable construction.  Looked like a giant wad of hot glue and bristles inside.  Kind of ruined the magic.  Won&#x27;t be buying any retractables from them again.</li>
            <li> I think mineral make-up is one of the best discoveries in history.  As directed, I&#x27;ve always applied mine with a kabuki brush. Even though I try to wash my brushes often, I still worried about how hygenic using an exposed brush on my skin each day could be. I have a retractable blush brush that I adore, so I went in search of a retractable kabuki brush. After seeing how much they cost in the store, I was delighted to find this one so reasonably priced. It works okay, but kabuki brushes tend to be fulller and stiffer for better coverage. This one really feels more like a loose powder blush brush.  If you have blemishes or skin imperfections that require heavier coverage, this brush won&#x27;t work for you. Also, the brush extends a little too far so the cap does not slide on as easily as it should.  For the price I suppose I&#x27;m not too disappointed, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend or buy it again.</li>
            <li> it is great for powder and blush application on the go. the cap makes it sanitary. very sleek packaging and densely packed. it is great for the ones looking for a good brush for powder and blush application on the go. the price, quality and amazon&#x27;s services are awesome.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price. Very soft and hair stays on the brush.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> This is the BEST make-up brush ever. I had to buy a spare! Ecotool products are also for sale at Bed Bath and Beyond for a little more money. I bought my blush brush there.</li>
            <li> Came apart the first time I used it.  My daughter has one and loves it.  Guess I just got the lemon in the bunch.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft and it picks up the blush color easily, best buy ever! Value for money too</li>
            <li> The texture is not rough and scratchy.  I is heaven sent to be retractable to help it stay clean from dirt.  I love it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and soft but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my more expensive brushes.  It is a very good brush for the price and I do like the fact you can close the lid on it so great for travel.</li>
            <li> Yes, as previous reviews have stated this brush is very soft. But when I apply my mineral foundation, I like to really buff it into my skin for good coverage. Perhaps that&#x27;s just me, but this brush does not allow you to that. It is too soft. I also noticed it doesn&#x27;t hold the product very evenly, and thus doesn&#x27;t disperse the product as evenly as I&#x27;d like. A good price, but not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have had this for months.  Use it frequently.  Great travel brush to keep in your purse!  Unlike many reviewers I have not had any problems with it falling apart.  Maybe newer design?  It did change colors right before I bought it.  I think when it was the silver kabuki body it was not as good??????</li>
            <li> super soft, great value. you do need to wash it more often as it picks up more oil from your face. overall great brush</li>
            <li> This was a great product until one day the retractable part broke and I had to throw it away. I don&#x27;t even know how it happened, but I didn&#x27;t abuse the product to happen that way.</li>
            <li> Super soft, great to carry in a make up bag or purse but broke in a week</li>
            <li> This brush works better than any high dollar big name blush brush!  I ordered another one because I was so impressed.....I love it and highly recommend !  Thanks, Annemarie C</li>
            <li> High-quality, great look and size. I love the brush and use it for travel. The brush fibers are packed to make a very thick brush, allowing for high saturation of whatever product you&#x27;re using. I use it for either blush/bronzer, or as a blending brush when I attempt to contour.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected. But started to fall apart after a few months. I put it back together every time. It just doesn&#x27;t stay together for very long. It&#x27;s a very good brush but the construction is very poor.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s soft and works perfectly with my bronzer</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the same brush. It is soft and does not shed bristles, and being able to shrink it into the tube for travel is very handy. My first one lasted through about a year of daily use and has now become stiff and has some broken bristles. For the price, I&#x27;m happy to replace it once a year.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft to the touch but the cap of the brush is not fitting at all. It is very loose so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I needed a brush to use for my powder foundation and couldn&#x27;t find one that I liked in local stores or pharmacies that wasn&#x27;t a ridiculous price. So finally it occurred to me to check Amazon and this brush seemed like a good option as I was looking for something simple with a cover. Turns out it is better than I even expected! It is just the right size, works great, and is super soft! Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a handy brush, that retracts and looks attractive. It fits well in my make up bag and applies powder well. I would definitely suggest this in lieu of a powder puff.</li>
            <li> When this first arrived my wife was excited to use it. It looked like a nice brush. However after only a couple of uses the retractable part broke. She didn&#x27;t drop it or anything, the barrel just slid right off and wouldn&#x27;t stay on. this meant the lid wouldn&#x27;t stay on anymore either because the inside part is smaller. She&#x27;s really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great foundation brush - love that it is in a case to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t come out ladies...that&#x27;s all I need to say.  However, I have been using Ecotools brushes for several years and after washing/cleaning them the brushes still are outstanding and don&#x27;t lose their bristles.  Love, love, love them!</li>
            <li> A little flimsy but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I like this.  Love that it retracts.  Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> The brush falls apart - its not an original EcoTools. The brush is cheap and doesnt hold powder.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy!</li>
            <li> Have used the brush for a week now, and it seems fine, but it turns out i prefer a longer handle to work with. This is a great compact little brush.</li>
            <li> quality is very fine, smooth and soft, easy to clean, not that easy to dry, but very suitable for traveling. I have it with me in my daily make up bag and just simply love it.</li>
            <li> This brush is incredibly soft, much softer than other expensive brands.  It works very well, I plan on purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I always buy Ecotools Kabuki brushes. This retractable one last through wash after wash after wash and is super soft. An all round great brush</li>
            <li> Super soft and wonderful.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is very soft and works well. The handle to the brush fell a art after 3 weeks of daily use. Still able to use the brush, but the retractable handle is no longer retractable.</li>
            <li> I love the cruelty-free premise of EcoTools, so I gave this brush a try after reading mostly positive reviews. The brush handle broke the second time I used it.  The brush itself wasn&#x27;t bad, but the &amp;#34;retractable&amp;#34; cover/handle is very cheaply made.  Bummer--I really did want to love this. Also the product description plays up the packaging like it&#x27;s a bag you would keep or something, but it&#x27;s just slightly thicker plastic. I ended up buying a retractable Real Techniques brush at Ulta instead in time for my trip, and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I love how it can be neatly stored in its own cover.</li>
            <li> This item completely fell apart after using it only a few times. I cannot return it because I started using it after the window to return it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I got this brush on sale at rite aid. so far its a very good kabuki brush. even better than some over priced brushes from sephora. i would definitely recommend getting this instead of the 30 dollar ones. the only thing is it closes kinda awkwardly. other retractable brushes i have seen twist shut. this one you have to push it up then place the cap on then push it back down</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my Bare Escentuals kabuki brush -- but wanted to avoid the high cost. After reading other positive reviews online, I decided to try this item from Ectools.  I am glad that I did.  The bristles are much softer than the BE model.  For the cost, the quality is very high. The soft bristles are securely attached and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding over the past two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that seems to make this a \\&quot;travel model\\&quot; is that you can twist and base, the bristles recoil, and you can put a metal lid on top.  I appreciate this feature because make-up brushes sometimes get crushed and misshapen while traveling.  That is a nice added feature and it doesn&#x27;t impact the way you use it at home on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because my old powder brush needed replacement.  I liked the compact nature of it to fit in my makeup bag.  I was happily surprised to discover how soft it is.  REALLY REALLY REALLY soft.  The price is great too.  You could go to Sephora and easily pay 5x for a similar brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.</li>
            <li> Very practical. Lightweight, but decent quality. Soft bristles that don&#x27;t fall out and stick to my face. I carry it in my bag and use it to apply a powder foundation with sunscreen in the afternoons when I feel like I need a sunscreen reinforcement, but don&#x27;t want to use a lotion.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. Very soft, I use it with my bareminerals powder foundation. I like the retractable design. I would buy more.</li>
            <li> The brush is beautifully made, ultra-soft to the face, and super convenient. I can easily retract the brush, put the lid on, and take it on a trip in a bag, or even at home, easily have it free-standing on the counter instead of having the brush touch some surface when rested and have an icky feeling that it may not be completely clean. I also have used other brushes, including ones by Mac, and this by far is the softest and most pleasant to use. I have had it for almost two years now and even after a number of washing/cleaning, it is still as good as new. Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
            <li> love this brush, soft and compact! ecotools is probably one of my favorite brush brands. came in quickly, very happy!</li>
            <li> While it is very very soft, I found that it unevenly spreads my powder foundation. The bristles are also very dense, which causes it to be stiffer than other kabuki brushes and adds to the odd application of foundation.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Evenly applies my bronzer and has very soft bristles. Concerned about washing it because I don&#x27;t want the water to rust inside the re-tractable part!</li>
            <li> The outside of the handle part came unglued, rendering the product useless.  Cheaply made.  I would not buy again or recommend.</li>
            <li> After 35+ years of using makeup, I have finally found the PERFECT makeup brush for use with loose mineral makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are wonderful and do not shed, even after cleaning.  And since the bristles retract, the brush stays far cleaner than any other makeup brushes I have ever used, which also makes it the perfect on-the-go brush, for both daily touch-ups and traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish ALL of my makeup brushes were available this way - eye, lip and concealer!</li>
            <li> I love my brush! It works great to apply my mineral makeup. It is awesome! Highly recommend this item to everyone.</li>
            <li> EcoTools r a great product. It is large &amp; full. Also, it is soft, not stiff &amp; rough like so many other brushes. Great coverage. Easy close 2 keep clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but I feel like I cant get any blush or bronzer on with it. I went back to my old stiff kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> Bought it to keep in my makeup bag. Perfect size and the bristles won&#x27;t lose shape.</li>
            <li> This is a nice make up tool. I use it for my mineral powder and goes on smoothly. The only thing that I&#x27;m not sure about is how to clean it. I typically will wash all of my brushes in warm soapy water, but because this is attached to the metal, I&#x27;m sure if it will rust or dry properly.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is great for my purse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other retractable brushes and eventually they get gunked up and fall apart when you wash. This one has gone through at least 5 washes and still in one piece. Very nice brush. I use it daily to powder on face powder.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE FACT ITS RECYCLED ANIMAL FUR THAT IS WHAT MADE ME BY IT. ITS NOT KILLING THEM FOR FUR.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does! The retractable part is a bit confusing though, and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get it to a complete close.</li>
            <li> The retraction is loose, so it doesn&#x27;t always stay up when it&#x27;s being used. There&#x27;s probably a better retractable brush you can buy but this is the only one that EcoTools have available and I really like Eco Tools brushes.</li>
            <li> This item does not retract but does have an inner tube that pulls out over the bristles to ease capping.  Bristles are soft and seems well made but is not as advertised.  Still, overall, will work OK for travel.</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles and cruelty free!  Easy to travel with and because it is retractable, the brush retains it shape.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it is very soft and compacts well. It is the perfect addition to my travel make up bag. It is not as stiff as I would have expected from a kabuki brush, the bristles are not as tightly compacted as in a traditional brush, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> No issues with thus product.  I have very sensitive skin and have no problems with this brush.  Great for powder foundation.</li>
            <li> My favorite and only brush.  Great for traveling and keeping clean.  Easily slides into it&#x27;s case when not in use.  The brush is very very soft and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, the color and the way it feels on your skin. I wish ecotools would make this brush a regular sized brush as well. Brushes are a hassle to clean, but are great to use and feel so nice on your skin.</li>
            <li> Opens up a little awkwardly. I like it; the brush is soft. But, to open the brush, one does not rotate the bottom part of the canister to cause the brush to protrude.  Instead, you pop the canister back with your hand to expose the brush. It is not what I expected (although I now realize that the video clip demonstrates correctly how one opens the canister.</li>
            <li> I am very good at taking care of my brushes. They are stored in a BE bag carefully. I&#x27;ve had many of my brushes for ten years, and they look and feel like new. This is important to note, which is why I&#x27;m giving the background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this to apply a highlighter and bronzer, and it worked well, though it isn&#x27;t up to (for example) Bare Escentuals Kabuki Brush quality. The bristle are soft enough and plentiful, but they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; the product the way BE brushes do. They are also not as soft, and shed a tad more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my gripe is that the ENTIRE brush- the whole cover to the brush itself- fell off within two weeks. It had no locking mechanism or anything where I could just slip it back on. I&#x27;d have to glue or tape it back together. (Which would look and feel tacky, to say the least!) I have no children or anyone around who touches or uses my brushes. So I know that it wasn&#x27;t destroyed by a careless third party. I have NEVER seen a makeup brush- even cheap dollar store ones- fall apart so fast. I&#x27;m not seeking my money back, because it was not enough of a cost output to warrant sending it back. Maybe this is just a fluke- but I will steer clear of this brand forever, despite the good reviews many people have given their brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s back to Revlon brushes for me! They&#x27;re a good drugstore brush brand that I can trust...I will never buy Eco Tools brushes again. If I have the income again in the future, I&#x27;d return to my Bare Escentuals brushes for any new purchases. I felt I owed fellow shoppers a review and a warning- spend your hard-earned dollars on a better brush!</li>
            <li> Washed it like 2 times and the brush completely fell apart from the metal bit at the bottom. The quality of the brush itself is pretty good so I&#x27;m thinking of just using that and throwing away the metal stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and Powder brush from Eco Tools and I like this one better.  Price is very reasonable for such a quality brush.  I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I like the brush, but after a few days the metal fell apart on it. I can fiddle with it and still get it to close if I slide the brush back into the bottom piece, but it&#x27;s very difficult to pull up the part the covers the brush. I have had much better luck with my retractable pink one by a different brand.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  It is compact and really soft.  Plus, it has a nifty tube that comes up so you can close the brush without mangling the hairs.  As an added bonus, it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> To be able to keep a brush this soft in my purse, is a treat :)  I love this brush.</li>
            <li> other retractable kabuki better. If you are looking for a dense kabukis for foundation buffing (especially a liquid or cream) go with the other.....this is a soft not so dense brush that seems better suited for powder foundations and/or blushes....maybe even finishing powders.</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles and I love that it retracts!</li>
            <li> Love the quality and usefulness of this brush, I have one in the office and keep one in my travel makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I love having the brush covered when not in use.  The bristles are soft and do not come away when using.  A quality brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect for all around use - powder, blush, bronzer, etc. It fits perfectly into my (smallish) hands and is wonderfully travel size. I bring it around everywhere with me!</li>
            <li> I was upset at the fact that when I got it the one piece came separate right away and seemed to have been cheaply put together but overall great brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a compact, &amp;#34;take with you anywhere&amp;#34; brush.  The brush is fine - like any other kabuki brush, but the cap keeps falling off (it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; closed like a lipstick).  This is particularly annoying when you throw it in your makeup bag and then you find that it just gets dirty because the cap is constantly falling off.  Makes me not want to use it on my face anymore.</li>
            <li> Really soft.  Really portable.  Great price on Amazon compared to stores.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, so soft. I&#x27;ve thrown all my others away. Great portable size and cover to throw in your purse. I have one each for purse, home and office and will continue to order these as replacements.</li>
            <li> Love it! So soft and satisfies my inner germaphobe. Works really well with powders too.</li>
            <li> Very soft and compact, I love it!</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and soft. I&#x27;ve been wanting this for a while and it&#x27;s exactly what i wanted!&lt;br /&gt;Good brush that won&#x27;t get messed up and for on-the-go.</li>
            <li> A really like this brush. It is pretty and it compacts which is what i was looking for. I wish it was a little skinner, but then Im guess the brush wouldnt be big enough to apply powder</li>
            <li> Great brush. Super soft. I love that you could retract the brush so that it doesn&#x27;t dirty your makeup bag or purse, and it also doesn&#x27;t get dirty. I use it for setting powder (translucent powder) and i use it throughout the day to touch-up my makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bulky - not as compact as you would think.  But it is practical and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the price but not thick enough in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  I use it daily.  It holds up and is inexpensive.  Fits in my purse perfectly!</li>
            <li> I found the three products that I ordered to be too stiff, smell bad, and not at all comfortable for the hand. The Kabuki was like dragging sandpaper across my face and smelled the worst of the lot.  They are cheap and it shows in all ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have sent them all back to Amazon - instead I tried to make do with them as replacements for my Bare Escentuals brushes and they simply will not do the job for me.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for applying pressed powder. It is a nice size and has a good feel. I love that it is retractable so I can keep it clean.</li>
            <li> The best brush I&#x27;ve owned!! Very soft! I use for applying bronzer or blush but would prob be very good for for minerals also!!</li>
            <li> Really nice brush. Cruelty free. Would love to see a smaller version for even better portability. Would try more products from this brand.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many of these, from Mac to a drug store brand.  This one beats it all, this is the 3rd one purchased in 4 years, not because they don&#x27;t last, but because i use it everyday and think its a good idea to throw away makeup after a years use.  I also purchased the smaller EcoTools but it did not feel as thick and soft as this size.  so easy to apply my mineral foundation and does not clump, looks professional each and every time.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush about a year ago and I&#x27;ve taken it all over with me. I wash it about once a week, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever shed except for when I washed it the very first time(which is expected because I&#x27;m usually pretty tough on new brushes since I hate finding tiny hairs on my products.) I love this brush and even after multiple drops and many, many washes it works amazingly!</li>
            <li> Great brush and important to me is that it is eco friendly. Very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> This is a soft and portable kabuki brush. I&#x27;ve had is for several weeks and use it almost everyday.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of kabuki brush for a couple years now. Previously, I used to buy the Bare Minerals brand Kabuki which is 4 times as expensive. This brush is just as good - if not better! - than the Bare Minerals (or more expensive brand name kabuki) brush. It&#x27;s super soft and gives a fresh, even look to your makeup when applying. I cannot think of one thing to complain about with this brush. I do replace it every 3 months because of bacteria build up, but at 7-8$ it&#x27;s no big deal. Best part of all is this brush is made from recycled materials and is **cruelty free**!!!! I will never buy another brand of kabuki ever again. I save so much money for what is essentially the same brush. Two thumbs up, I highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> The product arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy received the product and it was broken</li>
            <li> It works great, the bristles are soft. I use it daily and doesn&#x27;t shed even after 10 months&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I needed something that would fit inside my purse and whats great about this one is that the top doesn&#x27;t fall off-like with other brands. I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> The bottom got detached the second time I used it. Brush itself is good though. Will look for a higher quality one that won&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush! Took me a minute to figure out the retractor part, part of the handle comes up to go around the brush rather than the brush going down in the handle. Very soft brush.</li>
            <li> Super soft Kabuki Brush!  Works great.  Highly recommend this product and all EcoTools products.</li>
            <li> I love eco tools! I use this one for my bareminerals foundation &amp; it works perfectly. It blends so nicely &amp; it packs easily so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting smushed or the bristles getting bent. I wish they had more retractable brushes!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this brush on a whim at my local K-mart.  I didn&#x27;t expect anything, let alone to find this little thing came from heaven.  The brushes are so soft they had to be stolen from an angel wing.  The aluminum handle and bristle guard are strong and haven&#x27;t bent yet, and I&#x27;m rough on things.  I did have one instance where the whole round of bristles pulled out of the brush, I swear it was the summer heat on the glue as the brush was in my truck when it happened.  I used some Loctite gel super glue (My favorite) around the original glue and placed the round of bristles back in the original location and have been going on strong for at least 3 months.  I loved it so much I just bought myself another one on Amazon so that I could wash it and keep using the same one.  I had a MAC brush and the bristles are awfully shedding all over my face after a minimum of use.  Won&#x27;t do a MAC brush again.</li>
            <li> I used a $25 Bare Escentuals brush for 3 years until it was worn out.  This one seems even better and I love that it has the case.  I think it will hold it&#x27;s shape longer because of the case.  Very soft bristles.  Works great with my bare minerals powder.</li>
            <li> This brush is a lot like Bare Minerals full coverage brush for much less money. Very soft. So far hairs haven&#x27;t fell out of the brush like a lot of cheap brushes do.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these at a local store and love it so much.  The bristles feel great and I love the way that it retracts so that the residual powder does not get make-up on anything else.  When I opened this brush from Amazon the retractable mechanism came apart and is not useable at all.  I think my specific product was just defected because I have used the exact same one for over a year and it has worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li> This was for a Christmas gift, and she loved it.  I think it was exactly what she wanted for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Very soft and works great. It&#x27;s a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> got this to replace my retractable kabuki brush i got from bare minerals to use with their products. this works perfectly with mineral products, and i actually like the brush a LOT more than other kabuki brushes I&#x27;ve had before, even the more expensive ones. I started replacing a lot of my brushes with the ecotools brand because the hairs on the brush are so soft and never irritating to the skin. if you&#x27;re someone who has sensitive skin that tends to break out whenever you change things, this may be a good choice for you as a brush. the hairs are strong also, haven&#x27;t had any fall out upon cleaning, use, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would totally recommend this to anyone looking for a great kabuki brush for a great price</li>
