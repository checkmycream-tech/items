            <li>This is my favorite blend to clean with.</li>

            <li>Yummy citrus smell and a great essential oil.  </li>
            <li>Great essential oil.  </li>

            <li>We love this scent, it is fresh and uplifting.  </li>
            <li>I use it in my diffuser and the whole house smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Love the blend it smells wonderful and makes home feel so calm and adds just enough that it really feels clean.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and light.  </li>
            <li>However, Edens Garden is significantly cheaper in price.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Edens Garden purchase, and I will be getting more.  </li>
            <li>use it to relax, diffuse and clean with.</li>
            <li>It has a citrus/ clean smell.</li>
            <li>also diffuse it in the bathroom and clean with it...</li>
            <li>Hubby comments on how clean the house smells when I use it.</li>
            <li>It is uplifting and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>I used it through the dark and dreary winter days and it did a good job of chasing away the blahs!</li>
            <li>I use this a lot in the summertime to make my own natural bug spray.</li>
            <li>This oil blend is very fragrant and I look forward to using more products from Eden&#x27;s Garden</li>

            <li>It smells very crisp and clean.</li>

            <li>Smells so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Great service fast shipping and terrific prices</li>
            <li>The Purification blend is what I recently ordered and am beyond pleased!</li>
            <li>I primarily use it in my steam mop and it makes the whole house smell so fresh.</li>
            <li>It is definitely fresh but the lemon is quite overpowering.</li>
            <li>I put some on a cotton ball and throw it in the bottom of the garbage can to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li>it smelled so fresh and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; in the house.</li>
            <li>My favorite Edens Garden blend so far.</li>
            <li>The Purification Synergy Blend is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Makes the air smell crisp and clean (even when I haven&#x27;t done much cleaning!).</li>
            <li>very pure oils....</li>
            <li>I do Young Living Essential Oils, although they are 100% pure with no other chemicals or additives, Edens Garden has wonderful oils as well.</li>
            <li>Smells great but not long lasting.  </li>
            <li>It is not as good as taking down inflammation like the thieves oil.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little earthier than I wanted, but it still smells good and has a relaxing scent.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but I wish the lemongrass was a bit more subtle in the blend.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>it is my second time buying because I love the smell...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more thank you.</li>
            <li>I imagine I&#x27;ll be getting more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>it works great for long lasting pain relief on my knee</li>
            <li>Also, you can use it in nontoxic household cleaners, which is why I purchased it in the first place.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite essential oil blends.</li>
            <li>However it arrived quickly and appears high quality.</li>
            <li>Great scent but does not last very long!</li>
            <li>It has such a clean scent and works well!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, i added a few drops for a cotton ball and put it in the vaccum</li>
            <li>Very relaxing when placed in a diffuser.</li>
            <li>I use it in a diffuser and it smells the whole house up.  </li>
            <li>Did not have much scent to it like everyone was claiming.  </li>
            <li>I really want to like this, but cant say that I do.</li>
            <li>And it really does keep the bugs away.</li>
            <li>Straight out of the bottle</li>
            <li>Caution: Know that it does have a bit of color to the oil, for those that use white or light linens.</li>
            <li>The citrus scents blend together so well and leaves a nice clean and uplifting scent behind.</li>
            <li>I was not sure I was going to like it, but once it was diffusing, it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like young living purification.</li>
            <li>my favorite blend hands down!  </li>
            <li>This essential oil blend has a wonderfully fresh scent that can be used both as a pick me up and as a relaxer.</li>
            <li>Bought to use in my new diffuser</li>
            <li>puts off a nice clean, small citrus small.  </li>
            <li>So much to learn and use different oils.</li>
            <li>works as well as young living</li>
            <li>I really like this essential oil.</li>
            <li>I use it to freshen the house, freshen the dogs (applied to their fur, not their skin), or blended with almond oil in a roller bottle for direct application to my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I have used it for cleaning so far</li>
            <li>I compare this brand to young living.</li>
            <li>Really feels cleansing after a long day.</li>
            <li>I dilluted it with distilled water to make a Febreeze type of spray to put on the furniture to calm down the doggy smells there.  </li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils and I have ordered twice from Edens Garden.</li>
            <li>Cheaper and get the same use as the purification oil at Young Living!  </li>
            <li>No wet basement smell!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is my first Edens Garden purchase, and I will be getting more.  </li>
            <li> use it to relax, diffuse and clean with.</li>

            <li> also diffuse it in the bathroom and clean with it...</li>
            <li> Hubby comments on how clean the house smells when I use it.</li>
            <li> It is uplifting and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I used it through the dark and dreary winter days and it did a good job of chasing away the blahs!</li>
            <li> I use this a lot in the summertime to make my own natural bug spray.</li>
            <li> This oil blend is very fragrant and I look forward to using more products from Eden&#x27;s Garden</li>

            <li> I primarily use it in my steam mop and it makes the whole house smell so fresh.</li>
            <li> It is definitely fresh but the lemon is quite overpowering.</li>
            <li> I put some on a cotton ball and throw it in the bottom of the garbage can to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> it smelled so fresh and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; in the house.</li>
            <li> My favorite Edens Garden blend so far.</li>
            <li> The Purification Synergy Blend is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Makes the air smell crisp and clean (even when I haven&#x27;t done much cleaning!).</li>
            <li> very pure oils....</li>
            <li> I do Young Living Essential Oils, although they are 100% pure with no other chemicals or additives, Edens Garden has wonderful oils as well.</li>
            <li> Smells great but not long lasting.  </li>
            <li> It is not as good as taking down inflammation like the thieves oil.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little earthier than I wanted, but it still smells good and has a relaxing scent.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I wish the lemongrass was a bit more subtle in the blend.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> it is my second time buying because I love the smell...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more thank you.</li>
            <li> I imagine I&#x27;ll be getting more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> it works great for long lasting pain relief on my knee</li>
            <li> Also, you can use it in nontoxic household cleaners, which is why I purchased it in the first place.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite essential oil blends.</li>
            <li> However it arrived quickly and appears high quality.</li>
            <li> Great scent but does not last very long!</li>
            <li> It has such a clean scent and works well!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, i added a few drops for a cotton ball and put it in the vaccum</li>
            <li> Very relaxing when placed in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I use it in a diffuser and it smells the whole house up.  </li>
            <li> Did not have much scent to it like everyone was claiming.  </li>
            <li> I really want to like this, but cant say that I do.</li>
            <li> And it really does keep the bugs away.</li>
            <li> Straight out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Caution: Know that it does have a bit of color to the oil, for those that use white or light linens.</li>
            <li> The citrus scents blend together so well and leaves a nice clean and uplifting scent behind.</li>
            <li> I was not sure I was going to like it, but once it was diffusing, it was amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like young living purification.</li>
            <li> my favorite blend hands down!  </li>
            <li> This essential oil blend has a wonderfully fresh scent that can be used both as a pick me up and as a relaxer.</li>
            <li> Bought to use in my new diffuser</li>
            <li> puts off a nice clean, small citrus small.  </li>
            <li> So much to learn and use different oils.</li>
            <li> works as well as young living</li>
            <li> I really like this essential oil.</li>
            <li> I use it to freshen the house, freshen the dogs (applied to their fur, not their skin), or blended with almond oil in a roller bottle for direct application to my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have used it for cleaning so far</li>
            <li> I compare this brand to young living.</li>
            <li> Really feels cleansing after a long day.</li>
            <li> I dilluted it with distilled water to make a Febreeze type of spray to put on the furniture to calm down the doggy smells there.  </li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils and I have ordered twice from Edens Garden.</li>
            <li> Cheaper and get the same use as the purification oil at Young Living!  </li>
            <li> No wet basement smell!</li>
            <li> I like it for when my children don&#x27;t feel good or if they come home sick</li>
            <li> They scent does not last long, but I&#x27;m using in a diffuser,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it in a diffuser in my bedroom as it is supposed to repel mosquitoes, which have been a real problem lately.  </li>
            <li> Bottle size is smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because it&#x27;s not exactly Coolwater or Hugo Boss</li>
            <li> but my uses have been limited to aromatherapy</li>
            <li> I tried this and had no real craving for coffee for 3 days.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful if you use medicine that interacts with grapefruit.</li>
            <li> Used along with other oils it&#x27;s also good in defending the common cold!</li>
            <li> This oil is strong (meaning it&#x27;s not diluted like some other oils, not strong in a bad way).  </li>
            <li> Every morning, I wipe down the bathrooms with it to perk up our days and give the impression of &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to leave it at 4/5 stars since they probably could have balanced the other scents a little</li>
            <li> Sometimes I add a little lavender oil at night.</li>
            <li> I know there are some cleaning uses (like putting a few drops on a cotton ball in the dryer, or on an air purifyer filter)</li>
            <li> i make powdered carpet refresher, shoe deoderizer, add a few drops to my laundry wash or onto dryer balls, diffuse it as a room deoderizer...</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on baking soda and sprinkled on my carpet to freshen it in between cleanings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it in combination with an electronic indoor bug killer and on the nights when I didn&#x27;t run the diffuser, I got bitten a few times.  </li>
            <li> I  was really sort of disappointed in this after reading all the raving reviews.  </li>
            <li> It neutralizes/ eliminates unpleasant scents.</li>
            <li> I use a couple of drops over a base of coconut oil before I start my day, as an alternative to perfume.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bottle size is smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Love the blend it smells wonderful and makes home feel so calm and adds just enough that it really feels clean. Will order again quality is good!</li>
            <li> Great blend, on the citrus end, but takes care of any fowl smells in your house</li>
            <li> I use this combined with the Spearmint oil in my car vents.  Every one always comments on how great my car smells.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations. . . would order again......</li>
            <li> I like this scent. Not as strong as what I am used to.</li>
            <li> Comparable to the more expensive brand. Smells wonderful in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, I just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> This oil is strong (meaning it&#x27;s not diluted like some other oils, not strong in a bad way).  The Edens Garden website says this blend has Eucalyptus, Grapefruit, Lemon, Lemongrass and Lime however the only thing I smell when putting it in a vapor diffuser is a lemon-honey cough drop.  I also own a fan diffuser that doesn&#x27;t use water, in that one it smells fresh, it would be a great kitchen scent.&lt;br /&gt;For those not using it for aromatherapy I know there are some cleaning uses (like putting a few drops on a cotton ball in the dryer, or on an air purifyer filter) but my uses have been limited to aromatherapy so I&#x27;m going to leave it at 4/5 stars since they probably could have balanced the other scents a little better.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great oil blend!  It is definitely fresh but the lemon is quite overpowering.</li>
            <li> This brand is very aromatic and I loved it. I only had to use a couple of drops as compared to another brand.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite oils! I use it in my laundry, in the diaper pail and in a diffuser to cover the smell of my neighbors&#x27; cooking.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and clean. I put some on a cotton ball and throw it in the bottom of the garbage can to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> Very sweet blend. Love how it makes me feel refreshed and energized.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this scent</li>
            <li> Got one for my daughter as well.</li>
            <li> i make powdered carpet refresher, shoe deoderizer, add a few drops to my laundry wash or onto dryer balls, diffuse it as a room deoderizer... the list goes on! Really pleasant, lightly citrus scent leaves everything clean smelling (per the boyfriend, it&#x27;s neither &amp;#34;too feminine nor too hippy&amp;#34;. ;-)</li>
            <li> Love it and I am using it in a homemade cleaning solution.  It arrived quickly, smells fabulous and is a great consistency.</li>
            <li> I cannot get enough of this scent in my home. It does what it says, purifies the air with a variety of oils.</li>
            <li> it is my second time buying because I love the smell...I use it in my homemade floor cleaner and also in the warmers and my house smells like a spa :)</li>
            <li> I do Young Living Essential Oils, although they are 100% pure with no other chemicals or additives, Edens Garden has wonderful oils as well. I would definitely order from them all the time.</li>
            <li> I like this oil.  One of the tips was to put a drop in the palm of your hand, rub hands together, cup hands over nose and mouth and inhale six times to take away the craving for coffee.  I tried this and had no real craving for coffee for 3 days.</li>
            <li> The smell is so refreshing!</li>
            <li> Great scent. Love the citrus scent. Very relaxing when placed in a diffuser. Really feels cleansing after a long day.</li>
            <li> Love the smell in humidifier</li>
            <li> This is my favorite blend to clean with. I primarily use it in my steam mop and it makes the whole house smell so fresh. I like using natural products to clean with and these oils are a great value to make your own supplies.</li>
            <li> Yummy citrus smell and a great essential oil.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li> It has such a clean scent and works well! I like it for when my children don&#x27;t feel good or if they come home sick, I just diffuse it into the air.</li>

            <li> works as well as young living</li>

            <li> This is just the scent i was looking for. I&#x27;m glad i found you guys I&#x27;ll be back for more thank you.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite smell!! Smells exactly like young living purification.</li>
            <li> Great price and product!</li>
            <li> The smell is a little earthier than I wanted, but it still smells good and has a relaxing scent. It&#x27;s a good quality oil.</li>
            <li> Use for muscle ache &amp; migraine</li>
            <li> Shipping was quicker than expected. This smells amazing! It&#x27;s no too strong and has a calming effect. Love it.</li>
            <li> It has a citrus/ clean smell. I put a few drops on baking soda and sprinkled on my carpet to freshen it in between cleanings.</li>
            <li> I use this a lot in the summertime to make my own natural bug spray. It&#x27;s strong, and works great!</li>
            <li> Great Transaction, product of great quality, delivery was quick and experience was wonderful!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used it yet, but it smells great!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I bought several gift packs for fiends and family last year from edema garden. Their prices on oils are and I find the quality to be good. I use this oil often. I buy from this company often especially when buying gifts for others</li>
            <li> I have been using Eden&#x27;s Garden oils for over two years now and just love the quality. The Purification blend is what I recently ordered and am beyond pleased! It has some of my all-time favorite scents in it, so I knew it had to be good. I use a couple of drops over a base of coconut oil before I start my day, as an alternative to perfume. I just love the clean, refreshing, and uplifting scent! I feel more focused, energetic, and alert after I put it on. And my husband compliments me on the scent. I imagine I&#x27;ll be getting more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like this essential oil. I bought it to use in my homemade laundry soap and it works well. It keeps the laundry smelling good.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, especially to mask kitchen odors in my office. This oil blend is very fragrant and I look forward to using more products from Eden&#x27;s Garden</li>
            <li> I  was really sort of disappointed in this after reading all the raving reviews.  Did not have much scent to it like everyone was claiming.  I dilluted it with distilled water to make a Febreeze type of spray to put on the furniture to calm down the doggy smells there.  Did not notice any difference that it made.  I really want to like this, but cant say that I do.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, i added a few drops for a cotton ball and put it in the vaccum and it smells so good after i vaccum.... also diffuse it in the bathroom and clean with it... love it</li>
            <li> it works great for long lasting pain relief on my knee but you have to be careful if you use medicine that interacts with grapefruit.It is not as good as taking down inflammation like the thieves oil.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, seems to do it&#x27;s job.  I add it laundry, especially when cleaning the dogs&#x27; blankets and beds.</li>
            <li> I purchased this primarily because I&#x27;d heard of its ability to keep away mosquitoes. When I first tried it, the smell was a bit strong, yet it quickly dissipates and within minutes I don&#x27;t realize I&#x27;m wearing it. And it really does keep the bugs away. I can tell a noticeable difference between the times I&#x27;m wearing it and when I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and fresh</li>
            <li> I love Purification Synergy Blend! It&#x27;s a must have to purify the air in your home. Used along with other oils it&#x27;s also good in defending the common cold! This is a multifaceted oil for home and body, it&#x27;s a great oil to depend on! http://emaxgal.wordpress.com/</li>
            <li> Love the smell- fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> The citrus notes add to the brightness of this synergy blend.  This is pure happiness in a bottle!  It smells clean and light.  I use it to freshen the house, freshen the dogs (applied to their fur, not their skin), or blended with almond oil in a roller bottle for direct application to my skin.  Every morning, I wipe down the bathrooms with it to perk up our days and give the impression of &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;. My husband loves the scent too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blend was included in the 32 bottle set from Eden&#x27;s Garden as a Christmas gift from my husband and children. I used it through the dark and dreary winter days and it did a good job of chasing away the blahs!</li>
            <li> I use this in my essential oil diffuser.  It smells great, but I think the scent is week, so I find myself using almost twice the number of drops of this one that I do when I use a doTerra brand oil.  However, Edens Garden is significantly cheaper in price.  So, for aromatherapy purposes, I will probably purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love this oil in the humidifier</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh and clean.  I put in bath, in floor vents to freshen house and in diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is my first Edens Garden purchase, and I will be getting more.  We love this scent, it is fresh and uplifting.  My children like getting next to the diffuser for a whiff.  It&#x27;s perfect for this long winter.</li>
            <li> I diffused this oil today as we were doing some spring cleaning...it smelled so fresh and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; in the house. Straight out of the bottle I was not sure I was going to like it, but once it was diffusing, it was amazing. Good blend of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Another amazing product by Edens Garden!</li>
            <li> Great for one of those days that you need to get out of your head. It helps me think and focus!</li>
            <li> very pure oils....great scents.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT.... we have this going all the time after school and in the bedrooms at night with a couple others blended in. No colds or flu in this house :)</li>
            <li> Purchased this to help eliminate &amp;#34;doggy&amp;#34; odors.  It works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Love this in my diffuser.  puts off a nice clean, small citrus small.  great product.</li>
            <li> very nice oil.  wonderful fragrance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good EO that I plan to use for washing musky clothes and towels with. It smells very crisp and clean. Also, you can use it in nontoxic household cleaners, which is why I purchased it in the first place.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I wish the lemongrass was a bit more subtle in the blend. However it arrived quickly and appears high quality.</li>
            <li> Love this synergy blend!  Fresh and light. Makes the air smell crisp and clean (even when I haven&#x27;t done much cleaning!). Hubby comments on how clean the house smells when I use it. Will be reordering in the larger size soon as I&#x27;ve been diffusing it almost daily for over a week and plan to use regularly.  My sinuses seem clearer on the days when I&#x27;m diffusing it as well which is a great added bonus!</li>
            <li> This smells really good to the senses. It&#x27;s smells nice on the body. Not too girly or feminine. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because it&#x27;s not exactly Coolwater or Hugo Boss but it does smell good from a man&#x27;s perspective.</li>
            <li> I love Edens Garden products.  The Purification has a great smell to it.  I use it in my diffuser to kill odors.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Bought to use in my new diffuser and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> just what I needed, worked great</li>
            <li> Excellent scent, used for making a tick prevention recipe and have used in cleaning. I love Edens Garden brand.</li>
            <li> I use these BEAUTIFUL oils every day!&lt;br /&gt;I would not want to be without them!</li>
            <li> Love the scent! Very refreshing. I made an air fresher using this oil blend and just love the crisp refreshing scent that the citrus blend leaves.</li>
            <li> This essential oil blend has a wonderfully fresh scent that can be used both as a pick me up and as a relaxer. Sometimes I add a little lavender oil at night. My favorite Edens Garden blend so far.</li>
            <li> my favorite blend hands down!  Cheery and uplifting!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite essential oil blends. I use it in my diffuser to make the apartment smell wonderful, or when I meditate to help clear the mind.</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils and I have ordered twice from Edens Garden. I love that I can try oils at a price I can afford, and the quality is excellent. The Purification Synergy Blend is by far my favorite. I use it in my diffuser and the whole house smells amazing. The citrus scents blend together so well and leaves a nice clean and uplifting scent behind. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this essential oil and I have used it for cleaning so far and it smells like pledge! It smells really good. It was a great price and I would recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it in a diffuser in my bedroom as it is supposed to repel mosquitoes, which have been a real problem lately.  I&#x27;m using it in combination with an electronic indoor bug killer and on the nights when I didn&#x27;t run the diffuser, I got bitten a few times.  It puts a very pleasant, clean smell into the air.  I also used this with epsom salt for a fabric softener, but the smell seemed to change.  I don&#x27;t mind it, it just doesn&#x27;t smell the same.  I will purchase this oil again.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite oil blends and the price is great also.</li>
            <li> Love this oil to.  Cheaper and get the same use as the purification oil at Young Living!  Have used to remove orders around the house, my daughters snow boots and have use in a load of laundry.  Great oil!</li>
            <li> Edens Garden have quality oils I am never dis appointed. Great service fast shipping and terrific prices</li>
            <li> Smells delicious!!! Every bit as good as Young Living in my opinion!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great but not long lasting.  They scent does not last long, but I&#x27;m using in a diffuser,  so I don&#x27;t know if that is their reason, I guess I was expecting more, but it does smell great, and not over powering.</li>
            <li> great product... takes the itch away from bug bites fast</li>
            <li> This oil has a great clean smell.  I diffuse often. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I compare this brand to young living. This purification I wasn&#x27;t sure would work as well, but it does. And smells great, too:)</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Diffuse regularly. Kids actually ask for this scent specifically</li>
            <li> Very happy with this oil. It is uplifting and clean smelling. It neutralizes/ eliminates unpleasant scents. I even added it to mop water after we had some water infiltrate the basement. No wet basement smell!</li>
            <li> Very clean, citrus scent.  I love it in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> This blend has a nice light scent to it, my clients love it. Caution: Know that it does have a bit of color to the oil, for those that use white or light linens.</li>
