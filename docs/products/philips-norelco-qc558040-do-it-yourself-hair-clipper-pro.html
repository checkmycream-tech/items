            <li>And shipping is also good.</li>
            <li>It does a good job and is quieter than my old-fashioned yet reliable Oster trimmer.</li>
            <li>It was a good idea.  </li>
            <li>if its fair to judge its performance based on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The already good build quality has been stepped up a bit.</li>
            <li>Great for sculpting and keeping pesky neck hair neat and under control, this is a handy trimmer to have around.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll start off with The Good: You may not have had a clipper with a rotating head before</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco QC5170 hair clipper for a couple of years (along with a Remington ShortCut) and have been very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>Buzzed my head using the &amp;#34;1/2&amp;#34; setting, and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love the rotating head though, it comes in very handy in usage.</li>

            <li>include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
            <li>Awesome, easy to use, clean cutter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be honest and say being bald is not something I&#x27;m fond of</li>
            <li>It does do a nice job of clipping, but if you&#x27;re shaving your head a blade is faster and cuts closer.</li>
            <li>She liked it</li>
            <li>Handy..</li>
            <li>Having read almost all the reviews, I then decided to buy one to have my own haircut.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to shave my own head...</li>
            <li>and then when it came I shaved my own head.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving this clipper/shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I really liked the shaving head too.</li>
            <li>very good..works perfect</li>
            <li>I found them effective for trimming beard and mustache, and trimming hair on arms and legs.</li>
            <li>If you self-cut your own hair to one length like me...GET IT!&lt;br /&gt;-Branden</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in your hand and all of the parts feel well</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also nice to have two shaving guards.</li>
            <li>A handy portable hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>It gets very close to the head and around the ears perfectly.  </li>
            <li>it is very good.fast and excellent</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t have the need to, but the option would be nice).  </li>
            <li>Very good!&lt;br /&gt;Please keep one thing in mind, its always better if a barber cuts your hair, then any machine!!!</li>
            <li>The heads are best for shorter hair, though, so this is mainly for guys, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>Day 1: First impression is very good.</li>
            <li>great clipper, worth the money, thanks philips for this awesome hair clipper.</li>
            <li>it is a good product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nice fit and feel to the hand and good attachments.</li>
            <li>this thing is great for a quick close shave of the dome.  </li>
            <li>Lithium battery is great and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>though is that it is fully washable and very easy to take care of.  </li>
            <li>very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use it as a zero and it is very easy to cut my hair by myself.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to change heads.  </li>
            <li>very easy.  </li>
            <li>I find this clipper very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Plus it was very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clipper fits well in my hand and has non-slip grip points to make sure it stays put (and keeps both my ears safe!).</li>
            <li>The cordless feature is a plus, making trimming in a place like a shower easy to do without cords getting in the way or limiting your movement, and the 60 hours of battery life is also pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>Very good product, does what it says it does really.</li>
            <li>This shaver is the best so far.</li>
            <li>and this was the best I have used so far for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent replacement for my old worn out clippers.</li>
            <li>it is the best hair clipper as far as i know!&lt;br /&gt;i can make my hair cut all by myself now.</li>
            <li>The directions say it&#x27;s good for 60 minutes of cordless use, but we&#x27;ve noticed that after about 45 minutes the clippers start to sound slower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also worth getting this even if you don&#x27;t plan on shaving your head bald since the shaving attachment does a great job getting rid of neck hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also worth getting this even if you don&#x27;t plan on shaving your head bald since the shaving attachment does a great job getting rid of neck hair.</li>
            <li>By far the best head shaver value for the money.</li>
            <li>Handy design makes shaving more</li>
            <li>Easy and cheap - works great.</li>
            <li>Really powerful and very handy.</li>
            <li>Very nice, well made (doesn&#x27;t feel like cheap plastic junk), easy to use and handle hair clipper.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly as described, much better than my old shaver.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it&#x27;s the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had, and I&#x27;ve had several.</li>
            <li>They break very easily and I haven&#x27;t been able to find replacements anywhere online.</li>
            <li>My son first time tried on me and he did a great job .  </li>
            <li>THE PLASTIC ATTACHMENTS WITH TEETH ARE VERY CHEAPLY MADE AND</li>
            <li>very comfortable to self use.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use and cuts hair</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very smooth for the skin.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and versatile.</li>
            <li>feel the build quality is pretty good, nice weight and rubberised grib for water proofing.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>Very good so far as I used it just like five or six times.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>pain, no muss, no missed areas, no gouges in your top.</li>
            <li>I have used it for more than 2 months.</li>
            <li>B0026IBSVE B0026IBSVE]] and was able to give myself a haircut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that, with practice, it could work for you, too.</li>
            <li>Nothing better on the market for ease of use, and accuracy.  </li>
            <li>But if you are looking for anything that cuts more than 19/32 of an inch</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for years and have tried many products.</li>
            <li>and they seemed to miss a lot being more made for the face.</li>
            <li>I felt the 3 headed norelco&#x27;s worked better for this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was  previously able to do this with a longer machine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than using a razor blade for your head.</li>
            <li>Today I decided to use the bald attachment (foil) and it resulted in a baby smooth head!  </li>
            <li>and it is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I will make sure he gets a remarkably healthy gift for the holidays.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>will be buying more again soon.</li>
            <li>I like being able to swivel the head</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li>I hope the quality of clipper will be better.</li>
            <li>The guards seem more flimsy.</li>
            <li>This has some nice features- comfortable to grip, rotating head, does not nick your scalp, etc</li>
            <li>Love this product, couldn&#x27;t recommend it with more enthusiasm</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>I love Philips and their products.</li>
            <li>I have been through many types and brands of hair clippers.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>LOVE THE SESIGN</li>
            <li>I love Phillips Norelco</li>
            <li>and I have never been satisfied with the resulting quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but this one is much better...</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;you can do it by yourself and make some awesome short hair style.</li>
            <li>Would recommend better quality shavers.</li>
            <li>Anything more than that I would probably not recommend.</li>
            <li>Love this clipper.  </li>
            <li>I mostly bought it for when I travel abroad and need to be able to run on 220V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the adjust-ability of the shaving head.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>He likes this better than leaving it on the counter where it could get bumped around, knocked off, inadvertently doused in water, etc.  </li>
            <li>Could it have come with more bells and whistles?</li>
            <li>Yes, it could have, but what it lacks in those it makes up for in quality and ease of use.e likes this better than leaving it on the counter where it could get bumped around, knocked off, inadvertently doused in water, etc.  </li>
            <li>Could it have come with more bells and whistles?</li>
            <li>Love the rotating head feature.</li>
            <li>Whoever says bald isnt sexy, hasnt met Michael Jordan, Bruce Willis, or Sean Connery.</li>
            <li>I can not understand why I am so handsome after using this clipper</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with the performance of this unit as a trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to charge it for more than 40 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product!</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve never used it for more than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Now, he gets a great haircut whenever he wants one.  </li>
            <li>I let it charge up, then fired it off, and was satisfied with the noise.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it can run while plugged in, just in case you run out of juice.  </li>
            <li>It was OK.</li>
            <li>It is even better than all the hair clips I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>, am really glad that I did.</li>
            <li>For the most part, this thing works like a champ.</li>
            <li>So many rechargeable devices these days will not function if plugged in.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this hair clipper.</li>

            <li>for the guy with short hair does a great job and saves you bucks at teh barber.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m moving, I can find a comfortable position for my hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is great and gives a solid haircut.</li>
            <li>In his barber too comfortable, by the summer, every day can feel cool!Love it</li>
            <li>This comes as more than 5530 card slots, but wins in the can of shaving the head</li>
            <li>The only drawback is maybe the range of clippers a wider set would have been welcome</li>
            <li>It is simply reliable and great.</li>
            <li>Good clipper in overall, but can be better.</li>
            <li>So Far So good.  </li>
            <li>Still, I have never been able to shave along the back of my head with a reliable good result.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy, fits well in the hand, and really is a good dual purpose device.  </li>
            <li>but this one is a superior product by far.  </li>
            <li>This one on the other hand is very very good.</li>
            <li>The battery easily lasts a full shave.</li>
            <li>The trimming head cuts precisely and cleanly.</li>
            <li>Super easy to fade.</li>
            <li>The easily adjustable head and swiveling blades make it super efficient.</li>
            <li>It just fits really well in my hand, is very easy to hold onto&lt;br</li>
            <li>after the first one I shipped back not as used because of one of the bags contained lots of bits, amazon I can not fault every thing put wright straight away with in hours ,now the hair clipper is a fantastic hair cutter ,the head shaver is so gentle I am glad I have bought it delivery most excellent</li>
            <li>Norelco hair clipper has many features.&lt;br /&gt;It recharges very fast and cordless make it easier to use.</li>
            <li>The very first thing I noticed was that it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty ok..</li>
            <li>So far, very pleased.</li>
            <li>had originally given this unit four stars out of five because I didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>had originally given this unit four stars out of five because I didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what more to say about a hair trimmer - it does exactly what it says it does and does it well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to me that strong plastic-like materials are available these days and Philips can spend another 25 cents per clipper to get this right.  </li>
            <li>Also, the head on the close shave mode came off during shaving and exposed the live blades, which I did not find amusing.  </li>
            <li>It took under 10 minutes to a clean shaven head with the balding attachment.</li>
            <li>I can fade up my hair and get a clean shave with these clippers.</li>
            <li>It is nice for the side or the back but not for the top of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can easily clean this by running it under water, but you must wait until it dries to use it.  </li>
            <li>There is a light that flashes when the battery gets low, which is a good reminder to plug it in to the charger.</li>
            <li>But the fully adjustable depth of the trimmer heads is nice, very smooth movement to raise and lower to give you more or less distance from the cutters to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received just got a haircut, very easy to use, easy to clean, do not know how long can use the knife head, now quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>Works very well and makes my head very smooth.</li>
            <li>you see my other reviews, you will notice that I love Phillips Norelco products, but I still treat them fairly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s not much to say about it, it works like you think it should/would, great for keeping hair short/shaven, maintaining beard etc.</li>
            <li>With one full charge, I could use it again after 3 weeks without re-charging.</li>
            <li>you get a full charge in around 1 hours time.</li>
            <li>Good choice overall.</li>
            <li>takes about 2 hrs for a full change...</li>
            <li>Absolutely pain free also!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid, fairly priced cutter.</li>
            <li>hair clipper works on bolding men as well as those who have a full head of hair and want to shave it all off.</li>
            <li>This allows for four or five full hair trims.</li>
            <li>like that eventhough the clipper comes with only 2 combs, it allows for a good number of hair length settings.</li>
            <li>Although I can&#x27;t testify that both these figures are true, I can say it took about an hour to charge.</li>
            <li>My son will be thrilled that we don&#x27;t have to use the incredibly loud Wahl anymore to shorten his hair when spring</li>
            <li>But after seeing just how well this worked trimming my son&#x27;s hair, I had to bump it up to the full 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>But after seeing just how well this worked trimming my son&#x27;s hair, I had to bump it up to the full 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>Fast, convenient,  able to cut at zero length.</li>
            <li>Since I got mine, I&#x27;ve already ordered a couple more as gifts and the people I sent them to like them just as much as I do.</li>
            <li>nice design, you can shave from different angles, strongly recommend to buy</li>
            <li>like my older version better a whole lot better</li>
            <li>Just be aware the the plastic guards are flimsy and can break easily.</li>
            <li>I also like that this is pretty easy to keep up.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the way most foils (older models) worked against my head</li>
            <li>Quick recharge time.  </li>
            <li>light weight, nice feel in your hand, quiet.    </li>
            <li>The size is awesome for simply storing in a drawer till next use.</li>
            <li>This groomer definitely saves me s lot of time which I appreciate and it gives me a nice smooth bald head.</li>
            <li>before I got the hang of things and was able to give myself decent haircuts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nowadays I give myself a quick cut &amp; shave before I go out to some functions since the swivel blade is a life</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I did find it to get weaker on the 4th haircut, which is at about 45 minutes of use - but the battery charges quickly in about an hour, so</li>
            <li>She likes it because it&#x27;s quick to use &amp; cordless.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable clippers work like a charm and are super convenient.  </li>
            <li>Andis Super AGR+</li>
            <li>I also wish there were more options for length, but I&#x27;m sure I can buy extra accessories</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a quick tip, the numbers refer to 8ths of an inch.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t turn out to be a huge deal, since I got the hang of pulling it away from my head quickly when that happened, but it&#x27;s something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this product very much!</li>
            <li>but overall it is a very satisfying purchase.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is not at all useful for trimming the full beasrd that I have, but would probably do well if you want that two-day since shaving look.&lt;br /&gt;The blades in the balder attachment are a bit frail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many models of other known brands too, and has been the most comfortable.</li>
            <li>not for me, but give to my friend,he love it,nice，but not too much people need it，just for no-hair man, DIY may be funny</li>
            <li>The blades are also self-sharpening stainless steel, and cleanup is easy.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor, charged quickly and the headshaving attachment adjusts to the contours of your head.</li>
            <li>Works really well, cleans easy, lots of shaving options.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty solid, fairly priced cutter.</li>
            <li>I wish they had a more comprehensive meter to show how much is left of the battery, but you can operate it while corded if you run out in the middle of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating head is really the big point here for people who are shaving their own head or just trimming their own hair, since it&#x27;s going to allow VERY easy use at the back of the head, where, as a head shaver for more than a decade, I know the most frustration can arise.  </li>
            <li>I used the previous model and I loved it too, this is improvement in several ways, it has a shaving attachment, is washable and looks more sci-fi-like :)</li>
            <li>No trips to the barber ever again, the various settings allow pretty much every kind of cut I&#x27;ll ever need, from a light trim to shaved completely bald, and it is very easy to figure out and use.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic, I really recommend and I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and the attachments are very scientifically made, light, portable and even a kid can handle.</li>
            <li>He really loves the shaving attachment to keep his head baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>Battery is so much better than the old Remmington and Whal&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far really satisfied.</li>
            <li>Worth to buy!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Get this thing, its worth it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>you will feel how equal and nicely cut done by this machine......</li>
            <li>If you do not care about the electrical shaving, Philips offers better models.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money I padt for it.</li>
            <li>Today I have cut my hair on my own, the learning curve from then initial cut allows me to cut my hair within 15 minutes</li>
            <li>just wish the comb attachments were more like on the rugged old Oster: Finer teeth and tougher material.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s a bit pricier than the QC5170, the improved design, performance, and features are worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to know what the overall level</li>
            <li>useful and washable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth getting in addition to a primary top of the line clippers and should help save money in the long run.</li>
            <li>I ended up returning it right away for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Note to others, right off the bat</li>
            <li>Right now my hubby uses a holder meant for a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Used it right away</li>
            <li>A hair clipper is just a hair clipper, right?</li>
            <li>Super easy to clean since you can rinse the entire thing under running water, and the blade can be detached.</li>
            <li>shave was great, but I expected that since it&#x27;s a brand new blade compared to the Philips I have right now.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I still had the combs from the old model and they fit this one.  </li>
            <li>Being able to get a comfortable hold while getting the right angle is critical, and they&#x27;ve really mastered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually use a corded Wahl clipper, but I&#x27;m finding this Norelco to be great for travel.</li>
            <li>Great for keeping small hair cut..</li>
            <li>I found that swivel head is good, but is not really useful feature.</li>
            <li>The gift to my husband, is very convenient and quick, not afraid of water can be cleaned with water, the husband like it very much</li>
            <li>The flat design makes it very very easy to hold.</li>
            <li>first day I received it, I had a stubble and tried it right away.</li>
            <li>Was AMAZED at how easily these clippers cut through my naturally course hair.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable, light, doing the job properly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good for a person who doesn&#x27;t want very short hair or to get completely bald head.</li>
            <li>True enough but easily remedied by purchasing an inexpensive hand mirror to check the results.</li>
            <li>break very, very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>recommend this Hair clipper to everyone who wants fair outcomes that comes fast, without going to the barber.&lt;br /&gt;The regular shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Easily adjusts for various hair lengths, cuts evenly and charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>The Bodygroom was OK, but the battery died several months ago.</li>
            <li>I have owned several cutters of different brands and this is the overall best.</li>
            <li>so funny item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it first to see how close it would shave.</li>
            <li>manufacturer is aware of this as they instruct trimming the neck hair downward.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind though you need to first use the clipper to get a close cut and then use the shaver attachment.</li>
            <li>Plus I love the fact that you can use it corded if the battery runs low even tjough</li>
            <li>Never had a cleaner bald shave,  until I bought this shaver,  it works like magic,  my head is softer than a baby&#x27;s butt,  also used it for my beard, which gave me same result,  </li>
            <li>i would definitely recommend this product to everybody :)</li>
            <li>Solid build and sophisticated design.</li>
            <li>I got an irritation in my skin from the first shaving.</li>
            <li>A bit too short for top of the head</li>
            <li>The hair-cutting mode works pretty well, but the close shave mode, I find lacking.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does and does it well.</li>
            <li>&quot; that hold this clipper pretty well.</li>
            <li>The first time using it , the foil had a hole in, and one of the blades,had came off, and put the hole in the foil.</li>
            <li>Much better than the larger corded beasts like Wahls.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>The machine is a real treat!</li>
            <li>I really like this hair trimmer - a lot!</li>
            <li>Start with the longest setting (5) when you first try it</li>
            <li>with all the different size adjustment you are sure to find the one that suits your needs.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed I use once a week.</li>
            <li>this Norelco QC5580/40 has a good handy design but here is the defects:&lt;br /&gt;1. very noisy with uncomfortable vibration</li>
            <li>This little machine is outstanding and easy</li>
            <li>Overall, i am happy with as it does its clipping well, is small, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cordless puts it a step above the large, loud Wahl unit I&#x27;ve been using to buzz his hair for the last couple of years, I could use it to trim my beard when I let it grow sometimes, and to shave my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unit arrived in perfect shape, with a sticker on it that it&#x27;s not for sale since we received these before they&#x27;re available to the public.  </li>
            <li>I used many different kinds of Hair Clippers over the past 6 years and, so I have a really good experience with Hair Clippers.</li>
            <li>The hair part works fairly well, but takes extra time to fuss with in the back.</li>
            <li>The beard portion is great if you get a thick mange and want a FAST trim.</li>
            <li>A POSITIVE  NOTE</li>
            <li>Took me a few minutes to figure out how to adjust this for varying lengths, but once I did I have been very pleased with this.  </li>
            <li>The product was exactly as advertised and works very well.</li>
            <li>However, minor Cons aside, it&#x27;s one of the better cordless hair trimmers I&#x27;ve used in quite a while.around.</li>

            <li>The clipper is fine; I usually just get a buzz cut and the result seems to be okay.  </li>
            <li>Handy (literally), small enough to travel with and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>reviewed commented that it&#x27;s easy to miss places on the back of your head.</li>
            <li>The only problem with this is the length settings are too easily moved.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses this a lot - it saves a ton of money on professional haircuts, plus he can do quick touch ups whenever he needs to.</li>
            <li>so simple and easy to use and will put Barbers out of business.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made, feels solid, and the battery lasts for 5-6 cuts easy.</li>
            <li>Rotatable clipper makes it easy to access the different parts.</li>
            <li>I buzz my head with this every week, and the battery is strong and only requires charging after 5 uses.  </li>
            <li>The combs that came with this were much more limited.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The length adjustment is done by rotating a large ring that surrounds the clipper attachment port.</li>
            <li>Think of it as a large foil shaver.</li>
            <li>I have a large job for it.</li>
            <li>I have a large job for it.</li>
            <li>The clipper and shaving attachments fit into the holder easily, and seat with a solid click to know they are properly installed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple of times, but it works better than my previous corded clippers in that it cuts better and is easier to handle and adjust to the desired length.</li>
            <li>Was doing fine with short clipper at step 3.</li>
            <li>Results were just fine, no irritation, and the charge lasted for several uses.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent rig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as the Wahl Senior, but it&#x27;s definitely adequate enough to trim my whole head without stalling.</li>
            <li>Seems to cut a little better than the last version which was already good enough.</li>
            <li>Another problem is that the length setting noted with lines need to also be numbered to accurately note what settings one uses for various areas of the haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product cuts your hair very well.</li>
            <li>Love the support for world wide electricity.</li>
            <li>The clipper is light enough and ergonomically fits in the palm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>While it could be used on a persons face as well I didn&#x27;t feel it was working very well on my face.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks Philips, Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Saves me so much money because I don&#x27;t need to go to the barbershop.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco QC5580/40 Do it yourself hair clipper is more than what I expected.</li>
            <li>between them is just too much.</li>
            <li>does everything they say it does very well and 4) has paid for itself by the 4th or 5th use.</li>
            <li>It really couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.</li>
            <li>very neet</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>the blade is really bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that the head rotates to accommodate any angle for easier use.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>good.i like it.it is very good.but</li>
            <li>I like the 360 rotation, makes DIY trimming much easier.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to just turn the blade the way you need it to cut whatever side of your hair.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t any cons that come to mind.  </li>
            <li>The guide combs are very adjustable.  </li>
            <li>I knocked off one star because the head shaving attachment doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>Also, I hoped to use it without any combs to shape the bottom edge of my beard, but it doesn&#x27;t really work for that.  </li>
            <li>clipper was much easier for he and I to control.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I don&#x27;t think that you can really groom your head like a barber.</li>
            <li>Really helps get your dome from any angle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Blades are stainless steel and self sharpening</li>
            <li>They would not operate while plugged in, and the batteries were very iffy.  </li>
            <li>This makes for a much quicker haircut than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a real close head shaving, stick to the razor.</li>
            <li>When I used it, it took 4 mins to cut my whole head.</li>
            <li>My husband got this and it works very well.</li>
            <li>The plastic combs readily break....</li>
            <li>I did not experience the issue of the shaving head adjusting itself when too much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m coping with a scalp condition, and buzzing my head gave me some much needed relief.</li>
            <li>I really like this clipper</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no way to see what the charge is, the light doesn&#x27;t come on until it starts getting low.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no way to see what the charge is, the light doesn&#x27;t come on until it starts getting low.  </li>
            <li>Combined with the lack of a cord, the unit is very maneuverable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you like your hair longer, this won&#x27;t be of much use to you.</li>
            <li>And so on.&lt;br /&gt;- Additional precision comb for really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Holds charge very well.</li>
            <li>so very versatile for clipping the hair.</li>
            <li>Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li>Small in size and the option to rotate the blade seems to be pretty handy.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and definitely worth the extra $$ to get the cordless model!</li>
            <li>The fact that it only takes an hour to charge (and hour for an hour) is pretty cool too.  </li>
            <li>battery life is wonderful, lasting 3-5 full length hair cutting sessions before needing to be recharged.</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected!</li>
            <li>And for the price, like other reviews have mentioned, it could have come with a better storage bag.</li>
            <li>And for the price, like other reviews have mentioned, it could have come with a better storage bag.</li>
            <li>No disassembling to clean or sharpen is a big bonus.</li>
            <li>In the older version the adjustment numbers were in a window on the handle and much easier to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to change things out - two buttons opposite each other and whatever attachment you have pulls right off.  </li>
            <li>Another 5 minutes with the vacuum cleaner to clean up the hair.</li>
            <li>So this immediately made a HUGE difference in two major ways - first, no need to pop off one attachment and pop on another for different length cuts.  </li>

            <li>Luckily for me I use the same setting on my whole head</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a nice touch, even though the pouch is a wee bit small to handle everything, and is not all that sturdy in terms of construction.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and does a good job of removing thick topical hair as well as trimming quite close.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s suppose to last an hour on a full charge</li>
            <li>The clipper is pretty loud and vibrates quite a bit.</li>
            <li>and this is where this thing SHINES, is the fact that with the Wahl, you HAVE to come at the hair from the top of the unit, it&#x27;s about 7 or 8 inches long, so getting the nape of the neck and around the ears can be a real pain with a wiggly 9 year old who doesn&#x27;t like that loud buzz of the Wahl...  </li>

            <li>You just need to be careful how you handle the parts as they are plastic and look like they&#x27;d break easily if dropped.</li>
            <li>Have used an Oyster Classic for awhile, so I&#x27;m used to precision cuts.</li>
            <li>Particularly the head shaver.</li>
            <li>I love cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li>For low cost shaver, you simply cannot ask for more.  </li>
            <li>I decided on this hair clipper over a norelco shaver as my main intention was to manage the balding head.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s cordless is a bonus, no problems with finding extension cords to use this trimmer over a particular surface to catch hair.  </li>
            <li>Main adv is its washable.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I even owned a early generation Philips rechargable clipper that didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>They are clearly high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This was honestly a good deal, especially since its rechargeable and the battery last a very long time.</li>
            <li>This comes with two attachments that allow for a short trim or direct on your skin trim for clean edges.</li>
            <li>The engine seems to be strong and the blade is washable (albeit needs to be detached from the machine, unlike some other brands).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Brauns my whole adult life</li>
            <li>The shaver provides a reasonably close shave that does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>They always cut great, but unfortunately the battery life made them unreliable.  </li>
            <li>Actually does a nice job if you take the time to be thorough and go back and forth over the same areas to get an even finish.</li>
            <li>Went through countless trimmers before i found this one, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s kind of delicate</li>
            <li>What I like perhaps the most is that it will work with the cord it the batteries are dead.  </li>
            <li>- haven&#x27;t used it more than a few times.</li>
            <li>I like to close shave my head every 2-4 weeks and normally takes me about 12 minutes using my wahl clipper.</li>
            <li>I do find that you need to press down and apply some pressure to get a cleaner shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star because the clipper quality is not as good as expected.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy, how the twisting of the clipper head allowed me to do the back of my head with such ease.</li>
            <li>shaves your head down to an onion and easy to use</li>
            <li>The swivel makes a huge difference when you switch hands or reach into other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Extremely ease to use and makes buzzing my head convenient and cheap.</li>
            <li>I spent almost half an hour to have my initial cut with the help of my wife, and the result was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>issue I have is the new hair lenght guide.</li>
            <li>I would like a new foil and set of blades, or a new head assy.</li>
            <li>I normally  would use clippers without any comb and then jump into a hot shower to remove the last 16th or so.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a fantastic feature for cutting your own hair, since it avoids having to become a contortionist to get the job</li>
            <li>Battery life indicator light only flashes when charging or when the battery is low.  </li>
            <li>Most of the other reviewers have mentioned pretty much all the good and bad about this product, but I plan to provide a comparison with my old hair</li>
            <li>I began shaving my head at a very early age in life</li>
            <li>It came with charged enough that I used it the  first day out the box.</li>
            <li>Okay... I don&#x27;t usually give reviews but had to on this shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s my third clipper, but my first of this brand.</li>
            <li>It also has small increment increases in trimming to allow for a more defined look.</li>
            <li>I was probably 5-6 haircuts deep (the first two resulted in me just going bald)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the Philips Norelco QC5580 Diy Hair Clipper and Balder is a pretty solid shaver.</li>
            <li>Being able to turn the direction of the cutter made doing the nape of the neck and around the ears a TOTALLY different experience than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Being able to turn the direction of the cutter made doing the nape of the neck and around the ears a TOTALLY different experience than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed that it never got clogged up -- this is the first home haircut gadget I&#x27;ve tried that managed such a feat.</li>
            <li>removing them is pretty simple</li>
            <li>I primarily use my clipper to shave my head down bald</li>
            <li>i like this item very much for a maintenance of my short hair and even a complete shaving.</li>
            <li>This is the first pair of hair clippers that I have owned that can give me a complete bald without needing to jump between clippers and traditional razor blades.</li>
            <li>My normal razors are the standard \\&quot;straight up\\&quot; design, so you&#x27;re always holding this thing up and perpendicular to the surface of your head.  </li>
            <li>April 2013 - Finally got to use it to buzz my son&#x27;s head down, and it was phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>little bit  hard for a freshman,but it is a really a good clipper because it is very convenient</li>
            <li>My other trimmer still worked but fairly quickly got to where it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge but won&#x27;t work on the cord either.  </li>
            <li>Amazing versatility - much better and easier to control cutting length than earlier version that finally died on me after 5 years</li>
            <li>An important part was missing from the Phillips Norelco</li>
            <li>wish I could cut my hair short as much as 0 degree w/o having to switch to trimmer head.</li>
            <li>Very simple to use &amp; very versatile.</li>
            <li>It shaves my head completely bald in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>He says it is comparable to a professional cut.</li>
            <li>waste time, Dont hesitate just buy it and enjoy it!!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I will buy a replacement foil and just be extra gentle with it.</li>
            <li>Far exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li>Did not get injured, but made me wonder how solid the build on this item really is.  </li>
            <li>the old version, the head pivots</li>
            <li>I use it for complete shaving of my head</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have much hair and want to do simple use buy it.</li>
            <li>Complete head shaving done in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>The shape of the blade also made it feel natural - like a comb in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the shaving foil for my face, and while it works well enough, I&#x27;d much rather use a shaving blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shaves my head completely bald in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li>Loads of use so far and no sign</li>
            <li>Opps, only realised after you clipped a part of your head you need to do the whole head</li>
            <li>rotational head wasnt much of a feature but did help when i used my left hand.</li>
            <li>Wahl Sterling Professional</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re 6 years old, that&#x27;s close to a buzz cut.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s a bit pricier than the QC5170, the improved design, performance, and features are worth the cost.my hair, the pivot feature made it simple to shave the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some may find it a tad pricey, but I think it is certainly worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>After many years, the blades dulled and I had to cut really really slow to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I think it wil be possible to use this guide effectively in the future but wull have to take it easy and slow down the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I specifically bought this model because of the new guide that apparently lets you cut in .5 increments.</li>
            <li>Here is a quick run down of some of the stand out features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other trimmer attachments would be useful if I did not go for the bald look, I suppose, but for me they remain unused.</li>
            <li>Other than that, though, the Norelco wins in every way.</li>
            <li>On the second use I wanted to change a comb attachment and even though I red the manual before first use, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get it of the clipper</li>
            <li>I have been clipping and shaving my head since my early 20s and have bought and used all the major hair clipper brands out there.</li>
            <li>rotating head makes it easy to go over all the different parts of my head.&lt;br /&gt;The close shaver takes a few passes, but I had that issue with shavers before I had a beard.</li>
            <li>and this is the first I&#x27;ve been able to find for a long time that gets down to 1mm or less.    </li>
            <li>compared to a standard razor which takes a minute to shave my whole face baby smooth, the Philips loses big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pro&#x27;s : Small / Light, Battery Life, and a shaving head that swivels 180 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>No more pulling hair from cheap clippers...</li>
            <li>Since we have this clipper now, he doesn&#x27;t wait as long between haircuts, and this makes it much, much easier to keep up with.</li>
            <li>There has been much cursing and minor blood-letting when this occurs.</li>
            <li>Normally I use a larger Wahl clipper with varying sized \\&quot;combs\\&quot; to let you change out the depthof the cut.  </li>
            <li>This is the 2nd one i had to buy within 8 months, the overall product is good, but the blade has broken out of its installation twice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a step up from previous clippers I have tried (mostly in the $20-$40 range), but it also costs more than my previous foray into hair clippers, so I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this product for almost a year and use it regularly to keep what&#x27;s left of my hair very close to the scalp.</li>
            <li>Saving $$ isn&#x27;t the major point</li>
            <li>It has the power and ease of use to make cutting hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Not to mention these foils are dull as hell and cheaply constructed.</li>
            <li>I bought this to clear off the hair that is left on my head.</li>
            <li>My old one just stopped working one day, actually it wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  </li>
            <li>This came in the mail and he thought it wasn&#x27;t even working, he could barely feel it.  </li>
            <li>After several uses there&#x27;s been no indication of nicks or razor burn to his skin, though someone with sensitive skin might notice something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one area that the Norelco falls short in comparison with my old remmington is the shape of the blade.  </li>
            <li>good for hair cutting</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to make sure that you lather correctly and shave slowly to eliminate knicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>shaving head attachment is kind of mediocre.</li>
            <li>My husband had been putting off getting a new trimmer for a long time, to the point where he was in pain every time he tried to shave his head.  </li>
            <li>My cut was a little iffy at first (bearing in mind that I am no expert at self-haircuts -- yet!), so my wife did some final snipping and shaving to even things out.</li>
            <li>However, the overall time that it took for me to clip the bulk of it with this little gadget and her to snazz it up was quite a bit shorter than it normally takes for her to do my whole head with scissors and a razor.</li>
            <li>this is buy for a friend, I do not exactly know this product but look like he&#x27;s very like it</li>
            <li>The rotating shaver head allows for easy access to hard to reach areas (like behind your ears) and makes for a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I had the old version (2 of the old version) and they are NOT fully washable and went broken several times because it got water in when I try to clean it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find the same flaw in this model, so I called Norelco to buy a replacement before I needed it in the middle of a haircut.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use - I clean up the edges at the base of his neck, and I also get to do his back.</li>
            <li>This one just happened to present itself to me at the right time and so within a few days it was on my doorstep</li>
            <li>Not bad for quick and dirty crew cuts.</li>
            <li>I was scared at first going that low, but these clippers are crazy smooth even on the lowest settings.  </li>
            <li>I went slowly and spent about 30 mins clipping, and the clipper&#x27;s battery power remained strong during that time.</li>
            <li>careful where you use this on the more delicate parts of your anatomy!</li>
            <li>tried the clipper on my beard with the same shaver, but it doesnt work well on my soft loose beard.</li>
            <li>I tried several other clippers through the years but none match this one because it 1) is cordless and thus very convenient, 2) holds a charge for quite a long time, 3)</li>
            <li>I owned an older model that went from a #9 down to a #1.  </li>

            <li> This &amp;#34;would&amp;#34; be a great system if the &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; or the adjustable risers that attach to the blades, weren&#x27;t so</li>

            <li> for that its good.</li>
            <li> good choice</li>
            <li> As good as any wald</li>

            <li> good battery life..</li>
            <li> And shipping is also good.</li>
            <li> It does a good job and is quieter than my old-fashioned yet reliable Oster trimmer.</li>
            <li> It was a good idea.  </li>
            <li> if its fair to judge its performance based on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The already good build quality has been stepped up a bit.</li>
            <li> Great for sculpting and keeping pesky neck hair neat and under control, this is a handy trimmer to have around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll start off with The Good: You may not have had a clipper with a rotating head before</li>
            <li> I loved the thing</li>
            <li> good  </li>
            <li> cousin loved it.</li>

            <li> good and nice,i like it</li>
            <li> This product is sensational.</li>
            <li> This machine is the best and most innovative on the market.</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t a perfect DIY short hair cut it is the best I have found</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> My Husband  love this item great for baldness  shaving</li>
            <li> What Kinh shaving of Phelps wonderful and powerful advise them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco QC5170 hair clipper for a couple of years (along with a Remington ShortCut) and have been very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> Buzzed my head using the &amp;#34;1/2&amp;#34; setting, and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love the rotating head though, it comes in very handy in usage.</li>
            <li> The clipper attachment give you that perfect suede feeling head and the close shave attachment is great for when you want to go full blown, bowling ball smooth.  </li>
            <li> Good price, Good product, I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li> Just love this cordless/corded hair clipper!  </li>

            <li> include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
            <li> Awesome, easy to use, clean cutter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest and say being bald is not something I&#x27;m fond of</li>
            <li> It does do a nice job of clipping, but if you&#x27;re shaving your head a blade is faster and cuts closer.</li>
            <li> She liked it</li>
            <li> Handy..</li>
            <li> Having read almost all the reviews, I then decided to buy one to have my own haircut.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to shave my own head...</li>
            <li> and then when it came I shaved my own head.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving this clipper/shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I really liked the shaving head too.</li>
            <li> very good..works perfect</li>
            <li> I found them effective for trimming beard and mustache, and trimming hair on arms and legs.</li>
            <li> If you self-cut your own hair to one length like me...GET IT!&lt;br /&gt;-Branden</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in your hand and all of the parts feel well</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also nice to have two shaving guards.</li>
            <li> A handy portable hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> It gets very close to the head and around the ears perfectly.  </li>
            <li> it is very good.fast and excellent</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t have the need to, but the option would be nice).  </li>
            <li> Very good!&lt;br /&gt;Please keep one thing in mind, its always better if a barber cuts your hair, then any machine!!!</li>
            <li> The heads are best for shorter hair, though, so this is mainly for guys, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> Day 1: First impression is very good.</li>
            <li> great clipper, worth the money, thanks philips for this awesome hair clipper.</li>
            <li> it is a good product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice fit and feel to the hand and good attachments.</li>
            <li> this thing is great for a quick close shave of the dome.  </li>
            <li> Lithium battery is great and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> though is that it is fully washable and very easy to take care of.  </li>
            <li> very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use it as a zero and it is very easy to cut my hair by myself.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to change heads.  </li>
            <li> very easy.  </li>
            <li> I find this clipper very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Plus it was very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clipper fits well in my hand and has non-slip grip points to make sure it stays put (and keeps both my ears safe!).</li>
            <li> The cordless feature is a plus, making trimming in a place like a shower easy to do without cords getting in the way or limiting your movement, and the 60 hours of battery life is also pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li> Very good product, does what it says it does really.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best so far.</li>
            <li> and this was the best I have used so far for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for my old worn out clippers.</li>
            <li> it is the best hair clipper as far as i know!&lt;br /&gt;i can make my hair cut all by myself now.</li>
            <li> The directions say it&#x27;s good for 60 minutes of cordless use, but we&#x27;ve noticed that after about 45 minutes the clippers start to sound slower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also worth getting this even if you don&#x27;t plan on shaving your head bald since the shaving attachment does a great job getting rid of neck hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also worth getting this even if you don&#x27;t plan on shaving your head bald since the shaving attachment does a great job getting rid of neck hair.</li>
            <li> By far the best head shaver value for the money.</li>
            <li> Handy design makes shaving more</li>
            <li> Easy and cheap - works great.</li>
            <li> Really powerful and very handy.</li>
            <li> Very nice, well made (doesn&#x27;t feel like cheap plastic junk), easy to use and handle hair clipper.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly as described, much better than my old shaver.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it&#x27;s the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had, and I&#x27;ve had several.</li>
            <li> They break very easily and I haven&#x27;t been able to find replacements anywhere online.</li>
            <li> My son first time tried on me and he did a great job .  </li>
            <li> THE PLASTIC ATTACHMENTS WITH TEETH ARE VERY CHEAPLY MADE AND</li>
            <li> very comfortable to self use.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use and cuts hair</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very smooth for the skin.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and versatile.</li>
            <li> feel the build quality is pretty good, nice weight and rubberised grib for water proofing.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Very good so far as I used it just like five or six times.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> pain, no muss, no missed areas, no gouges in your top.</li>
            <li> I have used it for more than 2 months.</li>
            <li> B0026IBSVE B0026IBSVE]] and was able to give myself a haircut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that, with practice, it could work for you, too.</li>
            <li> Nothing better on the market for ease of use, and accuracy.  </li>
            <li> But if you are looking for anything that cuts more than 19/32 of an inch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for years and have tried many products.</li>
            <li> and they seemed to miss a lot being more made for the face.</li>
            <li> I felt the 3 headed norelco&#x27;s worked better for this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was  previously able to do this with a longer machine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than using a razor blade for your head.</li>
            <li> Today I decided to use the bald attachment (foil) and it resulted in a baby smooth head!  </li>
            <li> and it is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I will make sure he gets a remarkably healthy gift for the holidays.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> will be buying more again soon.</li>
            <li> I like being able to swivel the head</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> I hope the quality of clipper will be better.</li>
            <li> The guards seem more flimsy.</li>
            <li> This has some nice features- comfortable to grip, rotating head, does not nick your scalp, etc</li>
            <li> Love this product, couldn&#x27;t recommend it with more enthusiasm</li>
            <li> and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li> I love Philips and their products.</li>
            <li> I have been through many types and brands of hair clippers.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> LOVE THE SESIGN</li>
            <li> I love Phillips Norelco</li>
            <li> and I have never been satisfied with the resulting quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this one is much better...</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;you can do it by yourself and make some awesome short hair style.</li>
            <li> Would recommend better quality shavers.</li>
            <li> Anything more than that I would probably not recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this clipper.  </li>
            <li> I mostly bought it for when I travel abroad and need to be able to run on 220V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the adjust-ability of the shaving head.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> He likes this better than leaving it on the counter where it could get bumped around, knocked off, inadvertently doused in water, etc.  </li>
            <li> Could it have come with more bells and whistles?</li>
            <li> Yes, it could have, but what it lacks in those it makes up for in quality and ease of use.e likes this better than leaving it on the counter where it could get bumped around, knocked off, inadvertently doused in water, etc.  </li>
            <li> Could it have come with more bells and whistles?</li>
            <li> Love the rotating head feature.</li>
            <li> Whoever says bald isnt sexy, hasnt met Michael Jordan, Bruce Willis, or Sean Connery.</li>
            <li> I can not understand why I am so handsome after using this clipper</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with the performance of this unit as a trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to charge it for more than 40 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve never used it for more than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Now, he gets a great haircut whenever he wants one.  </li>
            <li> I let it charge up, then fired it off, and was satisfied with the noise.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it can run while plugged in, just in case you run out of juice.  </li>
            <li> It was OK.</li>
            <li> It is even better than all the hair clips I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> , am really glad that I did.</li>
            <li> For the most part, this thing works like a champ.</li>
            <li> So many rechargeable devices these days will not function if plugged in.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this hair clipper.</li>

            <li> Easy, light, effortless!</li>

            <li> Good product, let&#x27;s see how long it will work, at the moment it worked perfectly, I like especially when it works in 110 and 220 VAC as well</li>

            <li> Clean up is easy as well.</li>
            <li> Recently, I just started using this product and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> Attachments are easy to add/remove, and clean up was easy-peasy.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave of face and head.  </li>
            <li> Great for bald people looking for a simple and smart/quick shave!</li>
            <li> fantastic product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m moving, I can find a comfortable position for my hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is great and gives a solid haircut.</li>
            <li> In his barber too comfortable, by the summer, every day can feel cool!Love it</li>
            <li> This comes as more than 5530 card slots, but wins in the can of shaving the head</li>
            <li> The only drawback is maybe the range of clippers a wider set would have been welcome</li>
            <li> It is simply reliable and great.</li>
            <li> Good clipper in overall, but can be better.</li>
            <li> So Far So good.  </li>
            <li> Still, I have never been able to shave along the back of my head with a reliable good result.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy, fits well in the hand, and really is a good dual purpose device.  </li>
            <li> but this one is a superior product by far.  </li>
            <li> This one on the other hand is very very good.</li>
            <li> The battery easily lasts a full shave.</li>
            <li> The trimming head cuts precisely and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Super easy to fade.</li>
            <li> The easily adjustable head and swiveling blades make it super efficient.</li>
            <li> It just fits really well in my hand, is very easy to hold onto&lt;br</li>
            <li> after the first one I shipped back not as used because of one of the bags contained lots of bits, amazon I can not fault every thing put wright straight away with in hours ,now the hair clipper is a fantastic hair cutter ,the head shaver is so gentle I am glad I have bought it delivery most excellent</li>
            <li> Norelco hair clipper has many features.&lt;br /&gt;It recharges very fast and cordless make it easier to use.</li>
            <li> The very first thing I noticed was that it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty ok..</li>
            <li> So far, very pleased.</li>
            <li> had originally given this unit four stars out of five because I didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> had originally given this unit four stars out of five because I didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what more to say about a hair trimmer - it does exactly what it says it does and does it well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to me that strong plastic-like materials are available these days and Philips can spend another 25 cents per clipper to get this right.  </li>
            <li> Also, the head on the close shave mode came off during shaving and exposed the live blades, which I did not find amusing.  </li>
            <li> It took under 10 minutes to a clean shaven head with the balding attachment.</li>
            <li> I can fade up my hair and get a clean shave with these clippers.</li>
            <li> It is nice for the side or the back but not for the top of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can easily clean this by running it under water, but you must wait until it dries to use it.  </li>
            <li> There is a light that flashes when the battery gets low, which is a good reminder to plug it in to the charger.</li>
            <li> But the fully adjustable depth of the trimmer heads is nice, very smooth movement to raise and lower to give you more or less distance from the cutters to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received just got a haircut, very easy to use, easy to clean, do not know how long can use the knife head, now quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works very well and makes my head very smooth.</li>
            <li> you see my other reviews, you will notice that I love Phillips Norelco products, but I still treat them fairly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s not much to say about it, it works like you think it should/would, great for keeping hair short/shaven, maintaining beard etc.</li>
            <li> With one full charge, I could use it again after 3 weeks without re-charging.</li>
            <li> you get a full charge in around 1 hours time.</li>
            <li> Good choice overall.</li>
            <li> takes about 2 hrs for a full change...</li>
            <li> Absolutely pain free also!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid, fairly priced cutter.</li>
            <li> hair clipper works on bolding men as well as those who have a full head of hair and want to shave it all off.</li>
            <li> This allows for four or five full hair trims.</li>
            <li> like that eventhough the clipper comes with only 2 combs, it allows for a good number of hair length settings.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t testify that both these figures are true, I can say it took about an hour to charge.</li>
            <li> My son will be thrilled that we don&#x27;t have to use the incredibly loud Wahl anymore to shorten his hair when spring</li>
            <li> But after seeing just how well this worked trimming my son&#x27;s hair, I had to bump it up to the full 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> But after seeing just how well this worked trimming my son&#x27;s hair, I had to bump it up to the full 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Fast, convenient,  able to cut at zero length.</li>
            <li> Since I got mine, I&#x27;ve already ordered a couple more as gifts and the people I sent them to like them just as much as I do.</li>
            <li> nice design, you can shave from different angles, strongly recommend to buy</li>
            <li> like my older version better a whole lot better</li>
            <li> Just be aware the the plastic guards are flimsy and can break easily.</li>
            <li> I also like that this is pretty easy to keep up.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way most foils (older models) worked against my head</li>
            <li> Quick recharge time.  </li>
            <li> light weight, nice feel in your hand, quiet.    </li>
            <li> The size is awesome for simply storing in a drawer till next use.</li>
            <li> This groomer definitely saves me s lot of time which I appreciate and it gives me a nice smooth bald head.</li>
            <li> before I got the hang of things and was able to give myself decent haircuts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nowadays I give myself a quick cut &amp; shave before I go out to some functions since the swivel blade is a life</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> I did find it to get weaker on the 4th haircut, which is at about 45 minutes of use - but the battery charges quickly in about an hour, so</li>
            <li> She likes it because it&#x27;s quick to use &amp; cordless.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable clippers work like a charm and are super convenient.  </li>
            <li> Andis Super AGR+</li>
            <li> I also wish there were more options for length, but I&#x27;m sure I can buy extra accessories</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a quick tip, the numbers refer to 8ths of an inch.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t turn out to be a huge deal, since I got the hang of pulling it away from my head quickly when that happened, but it&#x27;s something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this product very much!</li>
            <li> but overall it is a very satisfying purchase.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is not at all useful for trimming the full beasrd that I have, but would probably do well if you want that two-day since shaving look.&lt;br /&gt;The blades in the balder attachment are a bit frail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many models of other known brands too, and has been the most comfortable.</li>
            <li> not for me, but give to my friend,he love it,nice，but not too much people need it，just for no-hair man, DIY may be funny</li>
            <li> The blades are also self-sharpening stainless steel, and cleanup is easy.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor, charged quickly and the headshaving attachment adjusts to the contours of your head.</li>
            <li> Works really well, cleans easy, lots of shaving options.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty solid, fairly priced cutter.</li>
            <li> I wish they had a more comprehensive meter to show how much is left of the battery, but you can operate it while corded if you run out in the middle of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating head is really the big point here for people who are shaving their own head or just trimming their own hair, since it&#x27;s going to allow VERY easy use at the back of the head, where, as a head shaver for more than a decade, I know the most frustration can arise.  </li>
            <li> I used the previous model and I loved it too, this is improvement in several ways, it has a shaving attachment, is washable and looks more sci-fi-like :)</li>
            <li> No trips to the barber ever again, the various settings allow pretty much every kind of cut I&#x27;ll ever need, from a light trim to shaved completely bald, and it is very easy to figure out and use.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic, I really recommend and I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and the attachments are very scientifically made, light, portable and even a kid can handle.</li>
            <li> He really loves the shaving attachment to keep his head baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> Battery is so much better than the old Remmington and Whal&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far really satisfied.</li>
            <li> Worth to buy!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Get this thing, its worth it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> you will feel how equal and nicely cut done by this machine......</li>
            <li> If you do not care about the electrical shaving, Philips offers better models.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money I padt for it.</li>
            <li> Today I have cut my hair on my own, the learning curve from then initial cut allows me to cut my hair within 15 minutes</li>
            <li> just wish the comb attachments were more like on the rugged old Oster: Finer teeth and tougher material.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s a bit pricier than the QC5170, the improved design, performance, and features are worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to know what the overall level</li>
            <li> useful and washable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth getting in addition to a primary top of the line clippers and should help save money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning it right away for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Note to others, right off the bat</li>
            <li> Right now my hubby uses a holder meant for a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Used it right away</li>
            <li> A hair clipper is just a hair clipper, right?</li>
            <li> Super easy to clean since you can rinse the entire thing under running water, and the blade can be detached.</li>
            <li> shave was great, but I expected that since it&#x27;s a brand new blade compared to the Philips I have right now.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I still had the combs from the old model and they fit this one.  </li>
            <li> Being able to get a comfortable hold while getting the right angle is critical, and they&#x27;ve really mastered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use a corded Wahl clipper, but I&#x27;m finding this Norelco to be great for travel.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping small hair cut..</li>
            <li> I found that swivel head is good, but is not really useful feature.</li>
            <li> The gift to my husband, is very convenient and quick, not afraid of water can be cleaned with water, the husband like it very much</li>
            <li> The flat design makes it very very easy to hold.</li>
            <li> first day I received it, I had a stubble and tried it right away.</li>
            <li> Was AMAZED at how easily these clippers cut through my naturally course hair.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable, light, doing the job properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good for a person who doesn&#x27;t want very short hair or to get completely bald head.</li>
            <li> True enough but easily remedied by purchasing an inexpensive hand mirror to check the results.</li>
            <li> break very, very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> recommend this Hair clipper to everyone who wants fair outcomes that comes fast, without going to the barber.&lt;br /&gt;The regular shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Easily adjusts for various hair lengths, cuts evenly and charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> The Bodygroom was OK, but the battery died several months ago.</li>
            <li> I have owned several cutters of different brands and this is the overall best.</li>
            <li> so funny item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it first to see how close it would shave.</li>
            <li> manufacturer is aware of this as they instruct trimming the neck hair downward.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind though you need to first use the clipper to get a close cut and then use the shaver attachment.</li>
            <li> Plus I love the fact that you can use it corded if the battery runs low even tjough</li>
            <li> Never had a cleaner bald shave,  until I bought this shaver,  it works like magic,  my head is softer than a baby&#x27;s butt,  also used it for my beard, which gave me same result,  </li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this product to everybody :)</li>
            <li> Solid build and sophisticated design.</li>
            <li> I got an irritation in my skin from the first shaving.</li>
            <li> A bit too short for top of the head</li>
            <li> The hair-cutting mode works pretty well, but the close shave mode, I find lacking.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does and does it well.</li>
            <li> &quot; that hold this clipper pretty well.</li>
            <li> The first time using it , the foil had a hole in, and one of the blades,had came off, and put the hole in the foil.</li>
            <li> Much better than the larger corded beasts like Wahls.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> The machine is a real treat!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair trimmer - a lot!</li>
            <li> Start with the longest setting (5) when you first try it</li>
            <li> with all the different size adjustment you are sure to find the one that suits your needs.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed I use once a week.</li>
            <li> this Norelco QC5580/40 has a good handy design but here is the defects:&lt;br /&gt;1. very noisy with uncomfortable vibration</li>
            <li> This little machine is outstanding and easy</li>
            <li> Overall, i am happy with as it does its clipping well, is small, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cordless puts it a step above the large, loud Wahl unit I&#x27;ve been using to buzz his hair for the last couple of years, I could use it to trim my beard when I let it grow sometimes, and to shave my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unit arrived in perfect shape, with a sticker on it that it&#x27;s not for sale since we received these before they&#x27;re available to the public.  </li>
            <li> I used many different kinds of Hair Clippers over the past 6 years and, so I have a really good experience with Hair Clippers.</li>
            <li> The hair part works fairly well, but takes extra time to fuss with in the back.</li>
            <li> The beard portion is great if you get a thick mange and want a FAST trim.</li>
            <li> A POSITIVE  NOTE</li>
            <li> Took me a few minutes to figure out how to adjust this for varying lengths, but once I did I have been very pleased with this.  </li>
            <li> The product was exactly as advertised and works very well.</li>
            <li> However, minor Cons aside, it&#x27;s one of the better cordless hair trimmers I&#x27;ve used in quite a while.around.</li>
            <li> However, minor Cons aside, it&#x27;s one of the better cordless hair trimmers I&#x27;ve used in quite a while.</li>
            <li> The clipper is fine; I usually just get a buzz cut and the result seems to be okay.  </li>
            <li> Handy (literally), small enough to travel with and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> reviewed commented that it&#x27;s easy to miss places on the back of your head.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this is the length settings are too easily moved.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses this a lot - it saves a ton of money on professional haircuts, plus he can do quick touch ups whenever he needs to.</li>
            <li> so simple and easy to use and will put Barbers out of business.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, feels solid, and the battery lasts for 5-6 cuts easy.</li>
            <li> Rotatable clipper makes it easy to access the different parts.</li>
            <li> I buzz my head with this every week, and the battery is strong and only requires charging after 5 uses.  </li>
            <li> The combs that came with this were much more limited.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The length adjustment is done by rotating a large ring that surrounds the clipper attachment port.</li>
            <li> Think of it as a large foil shaver.</li>
            <li> I have a large job for it.</li>
            <li> I have a large job for it.</li>
            <li> The clipper and shaving attachments fit into the holder easily, and seat with a solid click to know they are properly installed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of times, but it works better than my previous corded clippers in that it cuts better and is easier to handle and adjust to the desired length.</li>
            <li> Was doing fine with short clipper at step 3.</li>
            <li> Results were just fine, no irritation, and the charge lasted for several uses.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent rig.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as the Wahl Senior, but it&#x27;s definitely adequate enough to trim my whole head without stalling.</li>
            <li> Seems to cut a little better than the last version which was already good enough.</li>
            <li> Another problem is that the length setting noted with lines need to also be numbered to accurately note what settings one uses for various areas of the haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product cuts your hair very well.</li>
            <li> Love the support for world wide electricity.</li>
            <li> The clipper is light enough and ergonomically fits in the palm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> While it could be used on a persons face as well I didn&#x27;t feel it was working very well on my face.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks Philips, Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Saves me so much money because I don&#x27;t need to go to the barbershop.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco QC5580/40 Do it yourself hair clipper is more than what I expected.</li>
            <li> between them is just too much.</li>
            <li> does everything they say it does very well and 4) has paid for itself by the 4th or 5th use.</li>
            <li> It really couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.</li>
            <li> very neet</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> the blade is really bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that the head rotates to accommodate any angle for easier use.</li>
            <li> It worked very well.</li>
            <li> good.i like it.it is very good.but</li>
            <li> I like the 360 rotation, makes DIY trimming much easier.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to just turn the blade the way you need it to cut whatever side of your hair.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t any cons that come to mind.  </li>
            <li> The guide combs are very adjustable.  </li>
            <li> I knocked off one star because the head shaving attachment doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> Also, I hoped to use it without any combs to shape the bottom edge of my beard, but it doesn&#x27;t really work for that.  </li>
            <li> clipper was much easier for he and I to control.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t think that you can really groom your head like a barber.</li>
            <li> Really helps get your dome from any angle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Blades are stainless steel and self sharpening</li>
            <li> They would not operate while plugged in, and the batteries were very iffy.  </li>
            <li> This makes for a much quicker haircut than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a real close head shaving, stick to the razor.</li>
            <li> When I used it, it took 4 mins to cut my whole head.</li>
            <li> My husband got this and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The plastic combs readily break....</li>
            <li> I did not experience the issue of the shaving head adjusting itself when too much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m coping with a scalp condition, and buzzing my head gave me some much needed relief.</li>
            <li> I really like this clipper</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no way to see what the charge is, the light doesn&#x27;t come on until it starts getting low.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no way to see what the charge is, the light doesn&#x27;t come on until it starts getting low.  </li>
            <li> Combined with the lack of a cord, the unit is very maneuverable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you like your hair longer, this won&#x27;t be of much use to you.</li>
            <li> And so on.&lt;br /&gt;- Additional precision comb for really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Holds charge very well.</li>
            <li> so very versatile for clipping the hair.</li>
            <li> Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li> Small in size and the option to rotate the blade seems to be pretty handy.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and definitely worth the extra $$ to get the cordless model!</li>
            <li> The fact that it only takes an hour to charge (and hour for an hour) is pretty cool too.  </li>
            <li> battery life is wonderful, lasting 3-5 full length hair cutting sessions before needing to be recharged.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected!</li>
            <li> And for the price, like other reviews have mentioned, it could have come with a better storage bag.</li>
            <li> And for the price, like other reviews have mentioned, it could have come with a better storage bag.</li>
            <li> No disassembling to clean or sharpen is a big bonus.</li>
            <li> In the older version the adjustment numbers were in a window on the handle and much easier to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to change things out - two buttons opposite each other and whatever attachment you have pulls right off.  </li>
            <li> Another 5 minutes with the vacuum cleaner to clean up the hair.</li>
            <li> So this immediately made a HUGE difference in two major ways - first, no need to pop off one attachment and pop on another for different length cuts.  </li>

            <li> Luckily for me I use the same setting on my whole head</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a nice touch, even though the pouch is a wee bit small to handle everything, and is not all that sturdy in terms of construction.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a nice touch, even though the pouch is a wee bit small to handle everything, and is not all that sturdy in terms of construction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and does a good job of removing thick topical hair as well as trimming quite close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s suppose to last an hour on a full charge</li>
            <li> The clipper is pretty loud and vibrates quite a bit.</li>
            <li> and this is where this thing SHINES, is the fact that with the Wahl, you HAVE to come at the hair from the top of the unit, it&#x27;s about 7 or 8 inches long, so getting the nape of the neck and around the ears can be a real pain with a wiggly 9 year old who doesn&#x27;t like that loud buzz of the Wahl...  </li>

            <li> You just need to be careful how you handle the parts as they are plastic and look like they&#x27;d break easily if dropped.</li>
            <li> Have used an Oyster Classic for awhile, so I&#x27;m used to precision cuts.</li>
            <li> Particularly the head shaver.</li>
            <li> I love cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> For low cost shaver, you simply cannot ask for more.  </li>
            <li> I decided on this hair clipper over a norelco shaver as my main intention was to manage the balding head.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s cordless is a bonus, no problems with finding extension cords to use this trimmer over a particular surface to catch hair.  </li>
            <li> Main adv is its washable.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I even owned a early generation Philips rechargable clipper that didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> They are clearly high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This was honestly a good deal, especially since its rechargeable and the battery last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This comes with two attachments that allow for a short trim or direct on your skin trim for clean edges.</li>
            <li> The engine seems to be strong and the blade is washable (albeit needs to be detached from the machine, unlike some other brands).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Brauns my whole adult life</li>
            <li> The shaver provides a reasonably close shave that does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> They always cut great, but unfortunately the battery life made them unreliable.  </li>
            <li> Actually does a nice job if you take the time to be thorough and go back and forth over the same areas to get an even finish.</li>
            <li> Went through countless trimmers before i found this one, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s kind of delicate</li>
            <li> What I like perhaps the most is that it will work with the cord it the batteries are dead.  </li>
            <li> - haven&#x27;t used it more than a few times.</li>
            <li> I like to close shave my head every 2-4 weeks and normally takes me about 12 minutes using my wahl clipper.</li>
            <li> I do find that you need to press down and apply some pressure to get a cleaner shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star because the clipper quality is not as good as expected.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy, how the twisting of the clipper head allowed me to do the back of my head with such ease.</li>
            <li> shaves your head down to an onion and easy to use</li>
            <li> The swivel makes a huge difference when you switch hands or reach into other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Extremely ease to use and makes buzzing my head convenient and cheap.</li>
            <li> I spent almost half an hour to have my initial cut with the help of my wife, and the result was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> issue I have is the new hair lenght guide.</li>
            <li> I would like a new foil and set of blades, or a new head assy.</li>
            <li> I normally  would use clippers without any comb and then jump into a hot shower to remove the last 16th or so.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a fantastic feature for cutting your own hair, since it avoids having to become a contortionist to get the job</li>
            <li> Battery life indicator light only flashes when charging or when the battery is low.  </li>
            <li> Most of the other reviewers have mentioned pretty much all the good and bad about this product, but I plan to provide a comparison with my old hair</li>
            <li> I began shaving my head at a very early age in life</li>
            <li> It came with charged enough that I used it the  first day out the box.</li>
            <li> Okay... I don&#x27;t usually give reviews but had to on this shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s my third clipper, but my first of this brand.</li>
            <li> It also has small increment increases in trimming to allow for a more defined look.</li>
            <li> I was probably 5-6 haircuts deep (the first two resulted in me just going bald)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the Philips Norelco QC5580 Diy Hair Clipper and Balder is a pretty solid shaver.</li>
            <li> Being able to turn the direction of the cutter made doing the nape of the neck and around the ears a TOTALLY different experience than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Being able to turn the direction of the cutter made doing the nape of the neck and around the ears a TOTALLY different experience than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed that it never got clogged up -- this is the first home haircut gadget I&#x27;ve tried that managed such a feat.</li>
            <li> removing them is pretty simple</li>
            <li> I primarily use my clipper to shave my head down bald</li>
            <li> i like this item very much for a maintenance of my short hair and even a complete shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the first pair of hair clippers that I have owned that can give me a complete bald without needing to jump between clippers and traditional razor blades.</li>
            <li> My normal razors are the standard \\&quot;straight up\\&quot; design, so you&#x27;re always holding this thing up and perpendicular to the surface of your head.  </li>
            <li> April 2013 - Finally got to use it to buzz my son&#x27;s head down, and it was phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> little bit  hard for a freshman,but it is a really a good clipper because it is very convenient</li>
            <li> My other trimmer still worked but fairly quickly got to where it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge but won&#x27;t work on the cord either.  </li>
            <li> Amazing versatility - much better and easier to control cutting length than earlier version that finally died on me after 5 years</li>
            <li> An important part was missing from the Phillips Norelco</li>
            <li> wish I could cut my hair short as much as 0 degree w/o having to switch to trimmer head.</li>
            <li> Very simple to use &amp; very versatile.</li>
            <li> It shaves my head completely bald in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> He says it is comparable to a professional cut.</li>
            <li> waste time, Dont hesitate just buy it and enjoy it!!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I will buy a replacement foil and just be extra gentle with it.</li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> Did not get injured, but made me wonder how solid the build on this item really is.  </li>
            <li> the old version, the head pivots</li>
            <li> I use it for complete shaving of my head</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have much hair and want to do simple use buy it.</li>
            <li> Complete head shaving done in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> The shape of the blade also made it feel natural - like a comb in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the shaving foil for my face, and while it works well enough, I&#x27;d much rather use a shaving blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shaves my head completely bald in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li> Loads of use so far and no sign</li>
            <li> Opps, only realised after you clipped a part of your head you need to do the whole head</li>
            <li> rotational head wasnt much of a feature but did help when i used my left hand.</li>
            <li> Wahl Sterling Professional</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re 6 years old, that&#x27;s close to a buzz cut.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s a bit pricier than the QC5170, the improved design, performance, and features are worth the cost.my hair, the pivot feature made it simple to shave the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some may find it a tad pricey, but I think it is certainly worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> After many years, the blades dulled and I had to cut really really slow to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I think it wil be possible to use this guide effectively in the future but wull have to take it easy and slow down the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I specifically bought this model because of the new guide that apparently lets you cut in .5 increments.</li>
            <li> Here is a quick run down of some of the stand out features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other trimmer attachments would be useful if I did not go for the bald look, I suppose, but for me they remain unused.</li>
            <li> Other than that, though, the Norelco wins in every way.</li>
            <li> On the second use I wanted to change a comb attachment and even though I red the manual before first use, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get it of the clipper</li>
            <li> I have been clipping and shaving my head since my early 20s and have bought and used all the major hair clipper brands out there.</li>
            <li> rotating head makes it easy to go over all the different parts of my head.&lt;br /&gt;The close shaver takes a few passes, but I had that issue with shavers before I had a beard.</li>
            <li> and this is the first I&#x27;ve been able to find for a long time that gets down to 1mm or less.    </li>
            <li> compared to a standard razor which takes a minute to shave my whole face baby smooth, the Philips loses big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s : Small / Light, Battery Life, and a shaving head that swivels 180 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> No more pulling hair from cheap clippers...</li>
            <li> Since we have this clipper now, he doesn&#x27;t wait as long between haircuts, and this makes it much, much easier to keep up with.</li>
            <li> There has been much cursing and minor blood-letting when this occurs.</li>
            <li> Normally I use a larger Wahl clipper with varying sized \\&quot;combs\\&quot; to let you change out the depthof the cut.  </li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one i had to buy within 8 months, the overall product is good, but the blade has broken out of its installation twice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a step up from previous clippers I have tried (mostly in the $20-$40 range), but it also costs more than my previous foray into hair clippers, so I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for almost a year and use it regularly to keep what&#x27;s left of my hair very close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> Saving $$ isn&#x27;t the major point</li>
            <li> It has the power and ease of use to make cutting hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Not to mention these foils are dull as hell and cheaply constructed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to clear off the hair that is left on my head.</li>
            <li> My old one just stopped working one day, actually it wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  </li>
            <li> This came in the mail and he thought it wasn&#x27;t even working, he could barely feel it.  </li>
            <li> After several uses there&#x27;s been no indication of nicks or razor burn to his skin, though someone with sensitive skin might notice something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one area that the Norelco falls short in comparison with my old remmington is the shape of the blade.  </li>
            <li> good for hair cutting</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to make sure that you lather correctly and shave slowly to eliminate knicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> shaving head attachment is kind of mediocre.</li>
            <li> My husband had been putting off getting a new trimmer for a long time, to the point where he was in pain every time he tried to shave his head.  </li>
            <li> My cut was a little iffy at first (bearing in mind that I am no expert at self-haircuts -- yet!), so my wife did some final snipping and shaving to even things out.</li>
            <li> However, the overall time that it took for me to clip the bulk of it with this little gadget and her to snazz it up was quite a bit shorter than it normally takes for her to do my whole head with scissors and a razor.</li>
            <li> this is buy for a friend, I do not exactly know this product but look like he&#x27;s very like it</li>
            <li> The rotating shaver head allows for easy access to hard to reach areas (like behind your ears) and makes for a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> I had the old version (2 of the old version) and they are NOT fully washable and went broken several times because it got water in when I try to clean it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find the same flaw in this model, so I called Norelco to buy a replacement before I needed it in the middle of a haircut.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use - I clean up the edges at the base of his neck, and I also get to do his back.</li>
            <li> This one just happened to present itself to me at the right time and so within a few days it was on my doorstep</li>
            <li> Not bad for quick and dirty crew cuts.</li>
            <li> I was scared at first going that low, but these clippers are crazy smooth even on the lowest settings.  </li>
            <li> I went slowly and spent about 30 mins clipping, and the clipper&#x27;s battery power remained strong during that time.</li>
            <li> careful where you use this on the more delicate parts of your anatomy!</li>
            <li> tried the clipper on my beard with the same shaver, but it doesnt work well on my soft loose beard.</li>
            <li> I tried several other clippers through the years but none match this one because it 1) is cordless and thus very convenient, 2) holds a charge for quite a long time, 3)</li>
            <li> I owned an older model that went from a #9 down to a #1.  </li>
            <li> This is my only complaint - while the adjustment ring moves smoothly and has nice, solid click stops, the length markings are on the comb attachment and are hard to read (white letters on black, which is nice, but VERY small text - at least small to my aging eyes).</li>
            <li> So this got my head done in less time than I&#x27;m used to, but I could get that same result by buying new blades for my current one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The short length of the machine makes it impossible to see over the cutting hand with a rear view mirror to trim upward at the neck, which is the correct way and a very important part of a good hair cut.</li>
            <li> Since my 2+ year old QC5170 still is quite sharp, I expect the blades on this model to keep their edge for some time.</li>
            <li> Takes much too long and is too much trouble.</li>
            <li> The unit has a powerful motor, and does not get bogged down like cheaper units.</li>
            <li> I let my (extremely thick and wavy) hair go for way too long before trying it out, and it zipped right through.</li>
            <li> trimmer has just two blade attachments, with twisting-adjustment heights, so you have about 10-12 different heights with much less hassle and far fewer pieces.  </li>
            <li> So...i&#x27;m not sure how much money I am saving by using the clippers...</li>
            <li> It looks like an alien spacecraft and it shaves very well.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> the battery last for long time.</li>
            <li> Attach the &#x27;foil&#x27; shaver and your bald in no time flat.</li>
            <li> the shaver attachement is very tedious to use and to have an effective shave you should go over and over the area which irritates it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I also buzz my 9 year old&#x27;s hair down to almost nothing in the warmer seasons, I thought this could kill a couple birds with one stone.  </li>
            <li> Two shaver attachments which allow you shave short or directly to the skin with little to no</li>
            <li> For all the guys out there who are bald and less than 26 years old this is your product.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin you may want to use caution and don&#x27;t overdo the shave process less</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin you may want to use caution and don&#x27;t overdo the shave process less</li>
            <li> only shave my head when it&#x27;s dry, with an electric razor, and am always looking for something good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As mentioned in some other reviews, the plastic attachment is thin and cheap.</li>
            <li> Saving myself a lot of money, but I am feeling terribly guilty about not supporting my barber of so many years.</li>
            <li> The recommended replacement interval is a year, but with regular cleaning mine fell apart (two tiny springs and three other components) after four months.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s quite handy to rotate the blade when switching to my other hand and shaving my head at otherwise awkward angles.</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;- highly portable - small &amp; lightweight</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought this years ago, very convenient to use wireless and the battery charge lasts me a few weeks on average use once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> The battery long life reduces the amount of time charging.</li>
            <li> that makes my hand hurts for holding it too long</li>
            <li> My husband is in the military, and as such is always getting his hair cut to stay within regs.</li>
            <li> you could cause minor skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> you could cause minor skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> opened this the moment I received it and used it without reading the long manual.</li>
            <li> started with the long clipper and immediately I knew it wont work for me.</li>
            <li> I did not try wet washing the clipper but just brushed off the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its all I expected and then some, the only thing I can think of that could be improved on</li>
            <li> Charges from empty in an hour, not several</li>
            <li> two smaller ones cracked within the first six months and now the largest comb has broken.  </li>
            <li> Edge could not clear by self</li>
            <li> Not sure if the rotating head actually makes the job easier or not, still trying to get used to cutting my own hair with it.</li>
            <li> Usually have to clip first, then shave, and shave repeatedly; still leaves a little stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer to see, like my other razors, that there&#x27;s 83% left or something when I start just in case</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer to see, like my other razors, that there&#x27;s 83% left or something when I start just in case</li>
            <li> This left sharp edges and the product was unusable.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using the norelco 3 headed models but they took a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, you can still use it if you leave it overthere to dry out.</li>
            <li> Quiet, smooth cutting.</li>
            <li> now am the owner of two motor units and a single set of working combs.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also versatile as to whether you want to leave a (very) little bit of length or buzz the hair off completely.</li>
            <li> Will see how long the foil lasts before needing replacement though as replacements are about thirty five dollars shipped and that is over half the price of this entire item!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always annoying to have to pay the barber the same amount as the great hair guys - no more of that!</li>
            <li> This, with the smaller body that actually lays parallel to the surface you are cutting, really is a much easier device to maneuver and handle.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for the guys who want short buzz cut like 1mm or less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the market for a new hair trimmer because unfortunately the bad outweighs the good features.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Package come as described, a bag, a long clipper, a short clipper, a shaver, a power cable for US plugs, a small brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> I only use it twice after I got it few months ago</li>
            <li> After a couple of minutes, I got convinced that I would never really like electric shave.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Turning the dial on the body allows for roughly 2mm increments.</li>
            <li> But was curious on step 0/1 (0.3mm) and tried on my head.</li>
            <li> Shave do not performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Panasonic wet n dry&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am certainly not trained to cut hair or shave necks.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is it doesn&#x27;t sit flat on the sink.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> It takes me, seriously, 5 minutes to cut my 7 year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Except for the inoperative shaver, though, other functions are intact.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works.  </li>
            <li> Sharp razor.</li>
            <li> Then on the small one, it&#x27;s not enough.</li>
            <li> I cant use a razor due to razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This cuts close as hell with minimal irritation!</li>
            <li> only reason I gave it 4 stars,  is that it is small in away</li>
            <li> so the knife should still be sharp</li>
            <li> I now shave my head every other day.</li>
            <li> price value versus other electric shaver/groomer devices.</li>
            <li> I should note that other clippers have not given me this problem, I don&#x27;t know why this one does.</li>
            <li> Other than this</li>
            <li> Simple military cut shouldn&#x27;t be this hard.</li>
            <li> In addition, it would be near-perfect to have a second mirror on a stand to actually see from behind.</li>
            <li> your hair will get down low enough and because you&#x27;re trying so hard to shave down the uneven spots that it leaves it may irritate your scalp for hours after as it does mine.</li>
            <li> the other hand, the battery life is enough for at least three hair cuts without being recharged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually now on my third one now because I&#x27;ve broken two previous plastic combs and couldn&#x27;t replace them.</li>
            <li> Only wish it had a small precision trimmer attachment for those tight places.</li>
            <li> A hard case would have been preferable, especially for the amount traveling he does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A hard case would have been preferable, especially for the amount traveling he does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t just your average trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Whether I went side to side or up to down, it would leave patches of hair.  </li>
            <li> It took my down to a days growth stubble in the area&#x27;s I tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it can cut lower than a #1, at 5 ascending increments down to 0.</li>
            <li> Just brush the hair off and wipe down with a damp towel.</li>
            <li> Shaving down to the skin with the razor accessory can take some patience depends on your hair type.  </li>
            <li> I shave down to the skin once a week</li>
            <li> I shave down to the skin once a week</li>
            <li> use this on my head without the guard in place and even then it DOES NOT get my hair down to 0mm as you would expect it to (as it is advertised to).</li>
            <li> The lowest this clipper can get my hair down to is about0.5 -  1mm.</li>
            <li> Been using this for the same feature from Philips the past 5 years!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp as well as convenient， I used it all the time 4 saving money apprently!</li>
            <li> No more holding clippers at odd or difficult angles to get the right cut.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why the sizes are so limited.  </li>
            <li> But they dulled after a month or less of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Well half way through my shave (head)</li>
            <li> When shaving the back of one&#x27;s head or neck area, it&#x27;s always been difficult for me to properly hold the clippers.</li>
            <li> and i was done in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> The plastic combs are as flimsy as in previous models.  </li>
            <li> I had the previous version for while and gave it to my dad.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It does a nice job with trimming the bolding man&#x27;s thin hair as well as cutting off the thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaving head snaps easily into place on the base.  </li>
            <li> Can reach everywhere around the head with little pproblem.</li>
            <li> me,There&#x27;s  a little too noise compare with panasonic&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> complaints about this (other than the small length markings)</li>
            <li> complaints about this (other than the small length markings)</li>
            <li> This little hair clip is a mini monster.</li>
            <li> Little things like this make a difference.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for self cutting or for curing other people&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Has enough power to cut my tough hair.</li>
            <li> As with cutting my hair, the pivot feature made it simple to shave the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a premium priced hair cutting system, those fragile and integral parts of the system, should definitely be indestructible.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> I used to hate buzzcuts and wouldn&#x27;t go lower than a 2 on the sides ever, but this thing has redefined how precise I can get.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks to trim my beard, mustache and hair.</li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive skin so using any shaver, electric or manual, is generally an uncomfortable experience.</li>
            <li> I like it because shaving my hair means I don&#x27;t have to waste time with my hair except 10 minutes on Sunday mornings.</li>
            <li> way too heavy and not washable)&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no indicator as to battery level and it doesn&#x27;t slow down; it just stops when it&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> The shape is wrong and it doesn&#x27;t cut closely enough when used in a stabbing motion to try to cut a straight line.</li>
            <li> I bought these since I was tired of paying $20+ a week for some shoddy barber to give me a standard haircut that I could do myself.  </li>
            <li> no cap is provided in order to prevent the cutting element from piercing stuff while traveling nor other solution for preventing the fragile combs from breaking.</li>
            <li> The instructions are a little confusing.</li>
            <li> Also, the locking mechanism is weak, so occasionally while cutting my hair, the comb would suddenly shift to a shorter setting.</li>
            <li> This thing is useless for shaving the back of one&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> So based on past reviews, I bought this</li>
            <li> the shortest setting (1 or 0 with out the small plastic head it comes with)</li>
            <li> The inches are not written clearly enough so that makes it a bit difficult.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether it is designed like this or</li>

            <li> In the past 5 years, I went through 2 of them.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not sticking up in the air, you get all the coverage you need with small rotations of the wrist while holding</li>
            <li> I was told by a \\&quot;Supervisor\\&quot; that the part was not for sale and not available!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lazy about it it won&#x27;t cut closely or it takes forever to get it done.</li>
            <li> Only two are provided and they are both VERY thin.  </li>
            <li> should mention that unless you are cutting your hair extremely short, or you have a lot of practice, you&#x27;ll probably want someone to do a little trimming after you use this.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing this clipper shaver combo, I have seriously cut my grooming time in half!</li>
            <li> The clipper and shaving heads rotate 90 degrees in each direction on the base, making it easy to maneuver and reach difficult spots on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SO TAKE CARE WHEN USING ON HARD</li>
            <li> Shaver head click-rotates 180 degrees allowing you to trim even those hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cons: no power,  head too narrow, very slow cutting, fragile materials and design.    </li>
            <li> Will not break, unless you are clumsy.</li>
            <li> ONLY buy this if you want it for hair cutting and beard trimming.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried shaving electrically since at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> As you can see from the product page, the remmington has about 2.5 inches of cutting surface, whereas the Norelco has only about 1.5 inches.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the people who wrote negative reviews about this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking at least 5 -before</li>
            <li> With a turn of a knob you can adjust the length you are cutting, using the standard 1 through 5 comb numbering system.</li>
            <li> Trimming guards feel a bit thin and would probably break, chip or crack if dropped on a hard surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is such a bad barber.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.  </li>
            <li> and I found the articulating feature to be clumsy and unnecessary</li>
            <li> Imagine being half way done cutting your hair and the battery dying.</li>
            <li> use the zero (no attachment) setting, and there&#x27;s no great in-between between no attachment and the attachment&#x27;s shortest setting.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality for the plastic.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, cutting with the grain of the hair is not accurate.</li>
            <li> Lithium Ion battery allows for approximately 60 minutes of cordless use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Wahl was a trooper, but alas, I had to retire it.</li>
            <li> I very warily selected this product after a very disappointing purchase of the Skull Shaver ..... and after 3 months or so of use, I&#x27;ve been delightfully surprised ever since!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this for any guy who is sick and tired of spending over an hour clipping, lathering, and shaving their head to give this a serious shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The other annoying thing about these pricey Norelco clippers is that the replacement foils are $10+ per blade.</li>
            <li> No good for cutting hair around ears.</li>
            <li> but I noticed that happens if you hold it wrong.</li>
            <li> Pulling firmly on the attachments removes them from the base.  </li>
            <li> for the batter, it was fully charged in just shy of an hour after taking it from the box.</li>
            <li> so unfortunately it&#x27;s still easier for me to use my manual Gilette Fusion rather than this.  </li>
            <li> so unfortunately it&#x27;s still easier for me to use my manual Gilette Fusion rather than this.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m afraid to drop it (accidentally)</li>
            <li> Before I worried about accidentally cutting the power cord.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is disappointing though that this clipper doesn&#x27;t come with some sort of stand.</li>
            <li> It snaps on the attachment port and can pivot just like the hair cutting combs.</li>
            <li> There is no way I&#x27;d use anything else anymore for cutting his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;m going to snap one of them.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the razor attachment is very mediocre...</li>
            <li> I am a bad haircut technology.so,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ugly now</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the cut it provides - not a solution to my self barbering challenge.</li>
            <li> Both adjust at the turn of a dial on the base.  </li>
            <li> This is annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good for me, great value, it work well.</li>
            <li> The best I had. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver. Even give myself hair trim ups with it.</li>
            <li> like my older version better a whole lot better so I have gone back to</li>
            <li> An important part was missing from the Phillips Norelco QC5580/40.  Except for the inoperative shaver, though, other functions are intact.</li>
            <li> No need to get wordy... this product cuts your hair very well. I like it short (either 1.0 or 0.5) and it does it well. Battery is so much better than the old Remmington and Whal&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No pain, no muss, no missed areas, no gouges in your top. If you are like me and would rather mow your own once a week and keep it dapper... THIS is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t needed the foil yet, so I can&#x27;t speak to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pays for itself in 3 uses!</li>
            <li> My husband loves using this shaver. Works like a charm. He especially loves that it is cordless. Great buy and easy to use</li>
            <li> Very good so far as I used it just like five or six times.</li>
            <li> easy to use. I have used it for more than 2 months. i use it twice a months. Good !</li>
            <li> Good Product, i like it</li>
            <li> I like the way you can turn the head from side to side and adjust the hair lenght  guard. I like the you can change the head from clippers to a shaving head.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Really good for being wireless! Battery lasted for 4 shaves over the course of a month. There is no indicator as to battery level and it doesn&#x27;t slow down; it just stops when it&#x27;s dead. Have used an Oyster Classic for awhile, so I&#x27;m used to precision cuts. The Norelco is great for the price!</li>
            <li> As mentioned in some other reviews, the plastic attachment is thin and cheap. Actually, the attachment that came with mine didn&#x27;t even lock into any setting (i.e. 1, 2, or 3) so I couldn&#x27;t use it. I ended up returning it right away for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: I was buying this to replace a Norelco Bodygroom I had purchased about 4 years ago. The Bodygroom was OK, but the battery died several months ago. I contacted Norelco to inquire about replacing the battery, but they said it was out of warranty and they couldn&#x27;t do anything to salvage the clipper. What a waste. If you&#x27;re spending $70-$80 on clippers, they should last longer than that. The other annoying thing about these pricey Norelco clippers is that the replacement foils are $10+ per blade. Not to mention these foils are dull as hell and cheaply constructed. No thanks. I&#x27;m done wasting my money on these gimmick clippers. I picked this up for $25&gt; [[ASIN:B0026IBSVE B0026IBSVE]] and was able to give myself a haircut. It wasn&#x27;t a great haircut, but not bad for my first time. I&#x27;m sure that, with practice, it could work for you, too.</li>
            <li> I buzz my head with this every week, and the battery is strong and only requires charging after 5 uses.  You can also use it immediately when plugged in if the battery&#x27;s dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the zero (no attachment) setting, and there&#x27;s no great in-between between no attachment and the attachment&#x27;s shortest setting.  Embrace your baldness.</li>
            <li> Actually does a nice job if you take the time to be thorough and go back and forth over the same areas to get an even finish.</li>
            <li> Really good product, well made, good value and easy to use. Highly recommended for self cutting or for curing other people&#x27;s hair.  I have owned several cutters of different brands and this is the overall best.</li>
            <li> Nothing better on the market for ease of use, and accuracy.  No cord to boot!  Some reviews say this is flimsy...Will not break, unless you are clumsy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty ok.. Battery very good. Love the support for world wide electricity. BUT, the plastic breaks. It&#x27;s the second time I&#x27;m purchasing this but probably the last one. Poor quality for the plastic. 5 stars for the device, 1 star for the hardware.</li>
            <li> Tried several shaving products. This shaver is the best so far. You don&#x27;t need multiple runs to cut the hair. Clean up is easy as well.</li>
            <li> I very warily selected this product after a very disappointing purchase of the Skull Shaver ..... and after 3 months or so of use, I&#x27;ve been delightfully surprised ever since! This shaver does it all for me. No trips to the barber ever again, the various settings allow pretty much every kind of cut I&#x27;ll ever need, from a light trim to shaved completely bald, and it is very easy to figure out and use. You just need to be careful how you handle the parts as they are plastic and look like they&#x27;d break easily if dropped.</li>
            <li> good for hair cutting IF IF IF you wear your hair UNDER 1/2 inch all over...&lt;br /&gt;the razor attachment is very mediocre...nowhere close to as good a shave as a norelco triple head will give you...ONLY buy this if you want it for hair cutting and beard trimming.  for that its good.</li>
            <li> Comfortable grip, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could cut my hair short as much as 0 degree w/o having to switch to trimmer head.</li>
            <li> Recently, I just started using this product and it&#x27;s great.  My haircut looked the way barbers/stylists did it,  which I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going to anymore.</li>
            <li> This thing is useless for shaving the back of one&#x27;s head.  Whether I went side to side or up to down, it would leave patches of hair.  It left the back of my head irritated for hours after having went over it several times with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips Norelco corporate has refused to email to me the form for the 45-day money back guarantee.  On three occasions, the lackey said he would e-mail it, but it never got e-mailed!  I consider this to be fraudulent and have disputed the transaction with my bank.</li>
            <li> Great for head and face. It maintains uniform hair after only one pass. Can reach everywhere around the head with little pproblem.</li>
            <li> With this product, I don&#x27;t need to go to barber shop anymore. I used it almost every 2 weeks just to trim my hair and stays short &amp; well organized hair afterwards. Very simple to use &amp; very versatile. The battery has very good life. With one full charge, I could use it again after 3 weeks without re-charging. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Went through countless trimmers before i found this one, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best multi use shavers out there. Also works when plugged in.</li>
            <li> Amazing versatility - much better and easier to control cutting length than earlier version that finally died on me after 5 years</li>
            <li> I owned an older model that went from a #9 down to a #1.  The combs that came with this were much more limited.  Luckily I still had the combs from the old model and they fit this one.  I am not sure why the sizes are so limited.  Other than that it works.  My old one just stopped working one day, actually it wouldn&#x27;t turn off.  It just kept running until it died then wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore.  Hopefully this one will last longer.  But if you are looking for anything that cuts more than 19/32 of an inch then I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I am using this clipper on the short setting. It does not pull the hair but does not cut it evenly either. I have to pass the clipper 3-4 times, but even that doesn&#x27;t always guarantee a perfect cut. I found that swivel head is good, but is not really useful feature. On the second use I wanted to change a comb attachment and even though I red the manual before first use, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get it of the clipper - it never happened to me with another clippers.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the battery life is enough for at least three hair cuts without being recharged. The clipper is light enough and ergonomically fits in the palm. I like the charge indicator as well.&lt;br /&gt; Good clipper in overall, but can be better.</li>
            <li> good choice so funny item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;long time i used this item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great. Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t describe your seller or shipping experience (you can do that at amazon.com/feedback).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
            <li> that is meet my expectation....</li>
            <li> it is a good product and easy to use. the 180 rotation design is brilliant. i have already used it several times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for years and have tried many products. The quickest has always been a 3 or 4 bladed razor. But they dulled after a month or less of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to use and electric razor. I didn&#x27;t like the way most foils (older models) worked against my head and they seemed to miss a lot being more made for the face. I ended up using the norelco 3 headed models but they took a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this once with about 4 days growth. It took under 10 minutes to a clean shaven head with the balding attachment. While it could be used on a persons face as well I didn&#x27;t feel it was working very well on my face. I felt the 3 headed norelco&#x27;s worked better for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper worked well also. I tried it first to see how close it would shave. It took my down to a days growth stubble in the area&#x27;s I tried. As good as any wald but was easier to use on my head with the adjust-ability. If I had hair this would be the ultimate product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is I&#x27;m very impressed with the speed of this product and the way the foil adjusts its angle of my head and is sort of spring loaded foil. Best balding shaver I have used for my head. Defiantly faster than what I had been doing and took about the same amount of time a razor would have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps others like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for guys looking to go bald with an electrical option as I have been looking for!</li>
            <li> Was AMAZED at how easily these clippers cut through my naturally course hair.  Attachments are easy to add/remove, and clean up was easy-peasy.</li>
            <li> So far really satisfied. The engine seems to be strong and the blade is washable (albeit needs to be detached from the machine, unlike some other brands). Small in size and the option to rotate the blade seems to be pretty handy.</li>
            <li> Very good product, does what it says it does really. This product is sensational. This product is fantastic, I really recommend and I</li>
            <li> little bit  hard for a freshman,but it is a really a good clipper because it is very convenient&lt;br /&gt;But you cannot make some fashion haircut with this</li>
            <li> I am happy with this. Amazing good result, best recmended , best in price too, let&#x27;s you try it. Thanks</li>
            <li> My son first time tried on me and he did a great job .  This little machine is outstanding and easy</li>
            <li> Awesome, easy to use, clean cutter. Worth to buy!!&lt;br /&gt;I think it require you read the instruction thoroughly, and make out the usage of all the accessory. Then enjoy it, I will let you have a great cut experience.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Philips, Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful piece of machinery. It has the power and ease of use to make cutting hair quick and easy. One problem is trimming the neck hair. The short length of the machine makes it impossible to see over the cutting hand with a rear view mirror to trim upward at the neck, which is the correct way and a very important part of a good hair cut. I was  previously able to do this with a longer machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer is aware of this as they instruct trimming the neck hair downward. Unfortunately, cutting with the grain of the hair is not accurate. The neck hair needs to be trimmed upward. I am working on a solution and plan to will call the manucfacturer for advice. Another problem is that the length setting noted with lines need to also be numbered to accurately note what settings one uses for various areas of the haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two items are inconveniet. I hope to work them out. This machine is the best and most innovative on the market. Waul, the biggest name in the market came out with an adjustable model, which they had to withdraw because of mechanical problems.</li>
            <li> Thank you Philips for making such a product. Man, this thing is a miracle!!! Saves me so much money because I don&#x27;t need to go to the barbershop. I use the bald head. It&#x27;s way better than using a razor blade for your head. This thing works like a charm and gives you the best bald ever. I&#x27;m going to be honest and say being bald is not something I&#x27;m fond of but this thing makes it something manageable. For all the guys out there who are bald and less than 26 years old this is your product. Buy it and you&#x27;ll be a happier guy.</li>
            <li> Super easy to clean since you can rinse the entire thing under running water, and the blade can be detached. The head shave attachment can be used on facial hair as well. Not sure if the rotating head actually makes the job easier or not, still trying to get used to cutting my own hair with it.</li>
            <li> Quick recharge time.  Smooth shave of face and head.  Good price here on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the adjustable attachment for a very close head haircut for about a month.  Today I decided to use the bald attachment (foil) and it resulted in a baby smooth head!  Very satisfied.  Will see how long the foil lasts before needing replacement though as replacements are about thirty five dollars shipped and that is over half the price of this entire item!!!</li>
            <li> Comfortable, light, doing the job properly. Battery holds a lot of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 3 years now with a regular set of wahl clippers from walmart.  I bought this one because it can cut lower than a #1, at 5 ascending increments down to 0. I was scared at first going that low, but these clippers are crazy smooth even on the lowest settings.  No nicks.  I used to hate buzzcuts and wouldn&#x27;t go lower than a 2 on the sides ever, but this thing has redefined how precise I can get.  Super easy to fade. Get this thing, its worth it.</li>
            <li> I use it to cut my hair, and my beard. It does the job and it&#x27;s water resistant so u can wash it or use it while taking a shower. I like it.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.  I bought it to keep my head shaved close.    Pros:  light weight, nice feel in your hand, quiet.    Cons: no power,  head too narrow, very slow cutting, fragile materials and design.    Buy something else.</li>
            <li> Best bald razor i ever had</li>
            <li> THE PLASTIC ATTACHMENTS WITH TEETH ARE VERY CHEAPLY MADE AND I&#x27;VE HEARD THAT THEY&#x27;LL EVEN BREAK OFF FALLING ON CARPET. SO TAKE CARE WHEN USING ON HARD FLOOR.I ALSO HEARD THOSE PARTS CAN&#x27;T BE REPLACED.&lt;br /&gt;ON A POSITIVE  NOTE ; I GOT THE CLOSEST HEAD SHAVE I EVER HAD, AND CLEANING WAS A SNAP!</li>
            <li> Good one for that almost bald look without using razor</li>
            <li> Excellent value, works better than expected.</li>
            <li> I have a philips Norelco shaver and it works great.  So based on past reviews, I bought this and it is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> good product ,i use it for several time, it is good. it  can works in 110 and 220 V AC</li>
            <li> Best clippers I have used to cut my hair. The easily adjustable head and swiveling blades make it super efficient. Also, battery seems to last longer than stated.</li>
            <li> I just got my clippers yesterday.  The balder attachment worked fantastic and was very easy to use.  It is going to save me a lot of money on getting my head shaved every week at the hairstylist!</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s : Small / Light, Battery Life, and a shaving head that swivels 180 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s kind of delicate so I&#x27;m afraid to drop it (accidentally), shaver accessory head doesn&#x27;t last forever, and the device can&lt;br /&gt;be cumbersome at times (especially when using to cut the back of my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for the price and the fact that it has a Lithium Battery I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Saving myself a lot of money, but I am feeling terribly guilty about not supporting my barber of so many years. I will make sure he gets a remarkably healthy gift for the holidays. So...i&#x27;m not sure how much money I am saving by using the clippers...but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is excellent. The blade does not scratch my scalp, and the cut is just fine.</li>
            <li> I shave every day and this product gave me a razor shave.  The trimmer is great as well. Just buy it.</li>
            <li> I works well, I can use this to cut my hair myselef.&lt;br /&gt;To me,There&#x27;s  a little too noise compare with panasonic&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Great for bald people looking for a simple and smart/quick shave! Although the trimmer feature for example if u try to use it for trimming your beard or on the ear sides its not gonna work even it the shortest setting (1 or 0 with out the small plastic head it comes with)</li>
            <li> I used the previous model and I loved it too, this is improvement in several ways, it has a shaving attachment, is washable and looks more sci-fi-like :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not much to say about it, it works like you think it should/would, great for keeping hair short/shaven, maintaining beard etc.</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;- highly portable - small &amp; lightweight&lt;br /&gt;- worldwide voltage&lt;br /&gt;- corded &amp; cordless use&lt;br /&gt;- quiet&lt;br /&gt;- oiling maintenance-free &amp; fully washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- the various length settings which are adjusted by the zoom ring do not lock in place securely enough &amp; can slide off with pressure.&lt;br /&gt;- no cap is provided in order to prevent the cutting element from piercing stuff while traveling nor other solution for preventing the fragile combs from breaking.</li>
            <li> My husband had been putting off getting a new trimmer for a long time, to the point where he was in pain every time he tried to shave his head.  This came in the mail and he thought it wasn&#x27;t even working, he could barely feel it.  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> This product is simple to use, and works well. Particularly the head shaver. Keep in mind though you need to first use the clipper to get a close cut and then use the shaver attachment. I do find that you need to press down and apply some pressure to get a cleaner shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star because the clipper quality is not as good as expected. It seems a tad too flimsy.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco QC5580/40 Do it yourself hair clipper is more than what I expected. It&#x27;s compact and the attachments are very scientifically made, light, portable and even a kid can handle. Amazon has excellent products that anyone can enjoy. Thank you for you product.&lt;br /&gt;Bon</li>
            <li> fantastic product. i bought it for my son who is now at army service. he use it at field conditions. the battery last for long time. very comfortable to self use.</li>
            <li> will be buying more again soon.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week to shave my head and it works great!</li>
            <li> Fits everything I was looking to upgrade to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can wireless shave my head using either hand and not have to worry about changing positions to accommodate the wired connectivity. These cut and shave the smoothest. The size is awesome for simply storing in a drawer till next use. The battery long life reduces the amount of time charging. And finally a head shave attachment that actually shaves your head like its intended to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to buy this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the first pair of hair clippers that I have owned that can give me a complete bald without needing to jump between clippers and traditional razor blades. I normally  would use clippers without any comb and then jump into a hot shower to remove the last 16th or so. Now no need for that. The clippers get closer to the skin than anything before and if I want to smooth it out I just swap heads. It came with charged enough that I used it the  first day out the box. I like being able to swivel the head so I don&#x27;t have to contort my arm. Plus I love the fact that you can use it corded if the battery runs low even tjough you get a full charge in around 1 hours time. This groomer definitely saves me s lot of time which I appreciate and it gives me a nice smooth bald head.</li>
            <li> It shaves my head completely bald in a matter of minutes. It leaves no hair on the head. It is also great because it is cordless. I can get to every part on my head at any angle. Very easy to clean as well. This is a wonderful product, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> I can easily cut my hair within 10 min. Strong battery after couple of times use. Sharp razor. Good choice overall.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with a strong built and durable.&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use on yourself and very accurate concerning trimming your hair by yourself I didn&#x27;t need to look on the mirror to see the cut....you will feel how equal and nicely cut done by this machine......well done Philips.....i will recommend it to anyone either your shave your hair or trim or whatever a cut you do it for yourself .</li>
            <li> After 3 times to use, I feel it is good product for me.I hope the quality of clipper will be better.</li>
            <li> wanted bald...got bald, all by myself!</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my Philips Norelco QC5530 and I bought this. It&#x27;s just not the same. The guards seem more flimsy. The adjustment is just not as good as the older model. There&#x27;s 2 heads and the guard size diff. between them is just too much. Then on the small one, it&#x27;s not enough. I could trim my hair with one guard on last time, now I gotta use both. Simple military cut shouldn&#x27;t be this hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for almost a year and use it regularly to keep what&#x27;s left of my hair very close to the scalp. It&#x27;s always annoying to have to pay the barber the same amount as the great hair guys - no more of that! I tried several other clippers through the years but none match this one because it 1) is cordless and thus very convenient, 2) holds a charge for quite a long time, 3) does everything they say it does very well and 4) has paid for itself by the 4th or 5th use. It&#x27;s also versatile as to whether you want to leave a (very) little bit of length or buzz the hair off completely. The rotating head feature is the icing on the cake. It really couldn&#x27;t be easier to use. Takes care of neck hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewed commented that it&#x27;s easy to miss places on the back of your head. True enough but easily remedied by purchasing an inexpensive hand mirror to check the results. That&#x27;s always a good idea anyway, right?</li>
            <li> Okay... I don&#x27;t usually give reviews but had to on this shaver. I bought it to shave my head and must say it is hands down the best bald shaver I&#x27;ve ever used and is the best face shaver I&#x27;ve ever used too! I&#x27;ve also used these balders (Conair HG300 CleanHead, Skull Shaver Bald Eagle and Philips Norelco SensoTouch 1150x) and they don&#x27;t compare to this one.</li>
            <li> This this is awesome. Seems to cut a little better than the last version which was already good enough. The battery definately lasts longer and if charges quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue I have is the new hair lenght guide. I specifically bought this model because of the new guide that apparently lets you cut in .5 increments. Well half way through my shave (head) the guide reset itself to 0! This left me with a closer cut than I wanted. I think it wil be possible to use this guide effectively in the future but wull have to take it easy and slow down the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balder attachment is ideal for shaving your face by the way! I cant use a razor due to razor burn and ingrown hairs. This cuts close as hell with minimal irritation! I have sensitive skin and this was the best I have used so far for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> Never had a cleaner bald shave,  until I bought this shaver,  it works like magic,  my head is softer than a baby&#x27;s butt,  also used it for my beard, which gave me same result,  only reason I gave it 4 stars,  is that it is small in away that makes my hand hurts for holding it too long</li>
            <li> This has some nice features- comfortable to grip, rotating head, does not nick your scalp, etc.. However, I bought this strictly for bald shaving and it just does not do an acceptable job. Usually have to clip first, then shave, and shave repeatedly; still leaves a little stubble. Takes much too long and is too much trouble. It does do a nice job of clipping, but if you&#x27;re shaving your head a blade is faster and cuts closer.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s my third clipper, but my first of this brand. Very comfortable to use and cuts hair very neet, I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> Extremely ease to use and makes buzzing my head convenient and cheap. Love this product, couldn&#x27;t recommend it with more enthusiasm</li>
            <li> Took me a few minutes to figure out how to adjust this for varying lengths, but once I did I have been very pleased with this.  Works great.</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t a perfect DIY short hair cut it is the best I have found and I have tried many.  The only problem with this is the length settings are too easily moved.  Luckily for me I use the same setting on my whole head so I intend to glue the setting in place.</li>
            <li> I love this product perfect for my daily needs very handy and cut my hair and beard beautifully,better than the old model I used.</li>
            <li> not for me, but give to my friend,he love it,nice，but not too much people need it，just for no-hair man, DIY may be funny</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for my old worn out clippers. Nice fit and feel to the hand and good attachments. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Almost perfect but the shaver attachement is very tedious to use and to have an effective shave you should go over and over the area which irritates it.</li>
            <li> l cannot get my product warrenty  because l could not put my australia post code in the form. how can l get product warrenty ?.</li>
            <li> So Far So good.  takes about 2 hrs for a full change...</li>
            <li> great clipper, worth the money, thanks philips for this awesome hair clipper. i would definitely recommend this product to everybody :)</li>
            <li> Good product, let&#x27;s see how long it will work, at the moment it worked perfectly, I like especially when it works in 110 and 220 VAC as well</li>
            <li> I needed this product to use for my neck since I wear a wig.  I am certainly not trained to cut hair or shave necks.  EASY</li>
            <li> After using this for almost a year, I can wholeheartedly recommend this product. Solid build and sophisticated design. Saving $$ isn&#x27;t the major point, it&#x27;s the time saved every time you would go to a barbershop that makes this a wonder</li>
            <li> I have the older version, I have got this new one which is much better , fully washable and great trimmer. I love Philips and their products.</li>
            <li> I always use it to hairdressing now.</li>
            <li> AAA product.  Been using this for the same feature from Philips the past 5 years!</li>
            <li> Just love this cordless/corded hair clipper!  Makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works great - perfect at stubble.</li>
            <li> excellent clipper.  i can&#x27;t do without it for cutting my own hair</li>
            <li> Good quality, it also charges on 220 volts too so you can use in Europe without need of a any additional inverters, just get a corresponding plug adapter.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made guard for the price.</li>
            <li> I have philips clipper from couple years and I really like it. this Norelco QC5580/40 has a good handy design but here is the defects:&lt;br /&gt;1. very noisy with uncomfortable vibration&lt;br /&gt;2. I got an irritation in my skin from the first shaving. the blade is really bad.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for a person who doesn&#x27;t want very short hair or to get completely bald head. I don&#x27;t recommend it for the guys who want short buzz cut like 1mm or less.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable in the hand and easy to use with the rotating shaver.  Absolutely pain free also!  No more pulling hair from cheap clippers...this thing is great for a quick close shave of the dome.  The clipper attachment give you that perfect suede feeling head and the close shave attachment is great for when you want to go full blown, bowling ball smooth.  Worth every penny and definitely worth the extra $$ to get the cordless model!</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas present.  He really loves the shaving attachment to keep his head baby smooth.  He says it is comparable to a professional cut.</li>
            <li> I love cutting my own hair. I do it once every two weeks and have been doing it for 10+ years now. It saves TIME and money. I have been through many types and brands of hair clippers. I even owned a early generation Philips rechargable clipper that didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked. This one on the other hand is very very good. So far the charges hold and the cut is great. The ergonomic styling makes it so easy to cut. It takes me, seriously, 5 minutes to cut my 7 year old&#x27;s hair. He is fussy and the time saved is great for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;There have been complaints of the adjuster moving but I noticed that happens if you hold it wrong. Keep you hand on top of the device and away from the power button and you should be fine. Works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this hair clipper.</li>
            <li> Good price, Good product, I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste time, Dont hesitate just buy it and enjoy it!!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!!!</li>
            <li> I can fade up my hair and get a clean shave with these clippers. I really like the fact that the head rotates to accommodate any angle for easier use.</li>
            <li> Muhteşem bir makine. Tavsiye ederim.</li>
            <li> nice design, you can shave from different angles, strongly recommend to buy</li>
            <li> had used it twice, very good!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Excellent power and battery life! Love it!</li>
            <li> The clipper is fine; I usually just get a buzz cut and the result seems to be okay.  Only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that I can often see the lines along where I cut it (the lines caused by the clipper) then I had to trim it again and again to make it perfect.  I only use it twice after I got it few months ago so the knife should still be sharp and I assumed that is something the manufacture can improve from the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I like about the clipper though is that it is fully washable and very easy to take care of.  I had the old version (2 of the old version) and they are NOT fully washable and went broken several times because it got water in when I try to clean it.</li>
            <li> good job this do,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use for my head every two weeks and does a well job</li>
            <li> My Husband  love this item great for baldness  shaving also does  not irritate the skin@All Great Product.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. LOVE THE SESIGN</li>
            <li> it is the best hair clipper as far as i know!&lt;br /&gt;i can make my hair cut all by myself now.</li>
            <li> The gift to my husband, is very convenient and quick, not afraid of water can be cleaned with water, the husband like it very much</li>
            <li> The clipper is strong. You can actually do it yourself. The inches are not written clearly enough so that makes it a bit difficult.</li>
            <li> It looks like an alien spacecraft and it shaves very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient. I changed my hairstyle at the night I received the item. it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Works great - I like to have my hair very short and this is the first I&#x27;ve been able to find for a long time that gets down to 1mm or less.    Easy and cheap - works great.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my friend. He loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a much more expensive professional-level hair clipper with all the attachments. Still, I have never been able to shave along the back of my head with a reliable good result. The rotation feature of this clipper helps a lot. In addition, it would be near-perfect to have a second mirror on a stand to actually see from behind. When shaving the back of one&#x27;s head or neck area, it&#x27;s always been difficult for me to properly hold the clippers. This unit actually solves that problem. It&#x27;s worth getting in addition to a primary top of the line clippers and should help save money in the long run.</li>
            <li> after the first one I shipped back not as used because of one of the bags contained lots of bits, amazon I can not fault every thing put wright straight away with in hours ,now the hair clipper is a fantastic hair cutter ,the head shaver is so gentle I am glad I have bought it delivery most excellent well done.</li>
            <li> I love Phillips Norelco products.&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco hair clipper has many features.&lt;br /&gt;It recharges very fast and cordless make it easier to use.</li>
            <li> I have not tried shaving electrically since at least 20 years. The reason being that it irritates my skin and I have never been satisfied with the resulting quality.&lt;br /&gt;I got the opportunity to try and change my mind with this one. It does traditional shaving but has also an attachment that would allow the use as hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I received it, I had a stubble and tried it right away. After a couple of minutes, I got convinced that I would never really like electric shave. I still felt the shaving burn and the shaving was not that neat.&lt;br /&gt;As compared to a standard razor which takes a minute to shave my whole face baby smooth, the Philips loses big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday my girlfriend was home and she suggested trimming my hairs. I like my haircut short and she is used doing it. She liked it but she thought the max lenght is too short. It is nice for the side or the back but not for the top of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s to like:&lt;br /&gt;- Light&lt;br /&gt;- Multi-uses&lt;br /&gt;- cordless&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Good battery life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to like:&lt;br /&gt;- A bit too short for top of the head&lt;br /&gt;- Maybe a close shave but by this time my face would be red and irritated for days&lt;br /&gt;- There are cheaper options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a all rounder shaving device, this may be it. If you do not care about the electrical shaving, Philips offers better models.</li>
            <li> What Kinh shaving of Phelps wonderful and powerful advise them</li>
            <li> It worked very well. very good cut. very easy to use. fully washable. the only thing that worries me is that. It seems that water can come into the body. when you hold it vertically, you can see water coming out of the  bottom of the clipper. However, you can still use it if you leave it overthere to dry out. I am not sure whether it is designed like this or</li>
            <li> I bought this to clear off the hair that is left on my head. Works very well and makes my head very smooth. Easy to use and the head rotates so you can get those hairs that run a different direction. Well worth the money I padt for it. Amazon did have a coupon iused to reduce the price.</li>
            <li> low the price afterc I bought it</li>
            <li> this is buy for a friend, I do not exactly know this product but look like he&#x27;s very like it</li>
            <li> I bought the QC5580/40 for the balder feature. For that it works well. The other trimmer attachments would be useful if I did not go for the bald look, I suppose, but for me they remain unused. The trimmer is not at all useful for trimming the full beasrd that I have, but would probably do well if you want that two-day since shaving look.&lt;br /&gt;The blades in the balder attachment are a bit frail. The recommended replacement interval is a year, but with regular cleaning mine fell apart (two tiny springs and three other components) after four months. I will buy a replacement foil and just be extra gentle with it.</li>
            <li> good.i like it.it is very good.but I am a bad haircut technology.so,I&#x27;m ugly now</li>
            <li> Great product.  Easily adjusts for various hair lengths, cuts evenly and charges quickly.  What I like perhaps the most is that it will work with the cord it the batteries are dead.  My other trimmer still worked but fairly quickly got to where it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge but won&#x27;t work on the cord either.  Good job Norelco!</li>
            <li> Easy to use..Handy.. good battery life..</li>
            <li> it &#x27;s a good product, I can cut myself , haha</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Brauns my whole adult life but this one is much better...Easy to cut my hair too and it looks great...</li>
            <li> Quiet, smooth cutting. I like the 360 rotation, makes DIY trimming much easier. It also has small increment increases in trimming to allow for a more defined look.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. I recommend. And shipping is also good.</li>
            <li> i like this item very much for a maintenance of my short hair and even a complete shaving. It is easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Fits in your hand well and easy to maneuver. I now shave my head every other day. It takes about 3 minutes. , and there is no irritation. Unit is also easy to clean. Far exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> Like it but the attachment doesn&#x27;t get low enough for me.</li>
            <li> I bought these since I was tired of paying $20+ a week for some shoddy barber to give me a standard haircut that I could do myself.  Note to others, right off the bat you&#x27;re not going to be giving yourself salonesque  cuts. You&#x27;ve got to practice, practice, practice! I was probably 5-6 haircuts deep (the first two resulted in me just going bald) before I got the hang of things and was able to give myself decent haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swivel blade helps A LOT! It is so much easier to just turn the blade the way you need it to cut whatever side of your hair. It also comes with several accessories for shaving, hair lengths, combs, precision blades, etc. This was honestly a good deal, especially since its rechargeable and the battery last a very long time. Definitely worth at least trying out. Nowadays I give myself a quick cut &amp; shave before I go out to some functions since the swivel blade is a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Panasonic electric shaver before this and man did it suck. This thing blows that out of the water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hair clipper I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Having read almost all the reviews, I then decided to buy one to have my own haircut.  I spent almost half an hour to have my initial cut with the help of my wife, and the result was pretty good.  Today I have cut my hair on my own, the learning curve from then initial cut allows me to cut my hair within 15 minutes and I am satisfied.  I would recommend this product to those who maintain extremely short hair and would like to cut their hair by themselves.</li>
            <li> Received just got a haircut, very easy to use, easy to clean, do not know how long can use the knife head, now quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advisable to get one for summer days.&lt;br /&gt;you can do it by yourself and make some awesome short hair style.</li>
            <li> The hair-cutting mode works pretty well, but the close shave mode, I find lacking.  Or maybe I&#x27;m too used to shaving razors instead.  Also, the head on the close shave mode came off during shaving and exposed the live blades, which I did not find amusing.  Did not get injured, but made me wonder how solid the build on this item really is.  Would recommend better quality shavers.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought this years ago, very convenient to use wireless and the battery charge lasts me a few weeks on average use once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly as described, much better than my old shaver. For low cost shaver, you simply cannot ask for more.  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> vary good product highly recommended</li>
            <li> Works great for Shaving my head. Have not used the the attachments. Only negative is it doesn&#x27;t sit flat on the sink.</li>
            <li> Shaver&#x27;s not that great - and I found the articulating feature to be clumsy and unnecessary - haven&#x27;t used it more than a few times.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the cut it provides - not a solution to my self barbering challenge.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent rig. I use this for my hair and my beard. The hair part works fairly well, but takes extra time to fuss with in the back. Still works best if someone else does it for you. It&#x27;ll pay for itself in 2 haircuts. Not bad for quick and dirty crew cuts. Anything more than that I would probably not recommend. The beard portion is great if you get a thick mange and want a FAST trim. I can shave quicker using this than scissors and a dollarshaveclub razor. Great for that scruff look.</li>
            <li> Love this clipper.  I use it as a zero and it is very easy to cut my hair by myself.  I used to go to the barber once a week but now only go once a month saving me a couple hundred dollars a year.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks to trim my beard, mustache and hair. It does a good job and is quieter than my old-fashioned yet reliable Oster trimmer. I mostly bought it for when I travel abroad and need to be able to run on 220V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the comb attachments were more like on the rugged old Oster: Finer teeth and tougher material.</li>
            <li> It is such a bad barber. I just used it twice and never want to try it again. I think this machine could not call &amp;#34;a barber&amp;#34;, cause  that isn&#x27;t haircut, it just pulled my hair up.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  It has a great feel to the unit and is lightweight, which comes in handy when holding your hand above your head.  Love the adjust-ability of the shaving head.  It is very easy to change heads.  There really isn&#x27;t any cons that come to mind.  It does exactly what it says it does and does it well.</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave my own head... and then when it came I shaved my own head.</li>
            <li> I like the swiveling thing.  That makes it easier to get different parts of my head and beard.  It was a good idea.  The guide combs are very adjustable.  It even works well around my ears.  I knocked off one star because the head shaving attachment doesn&#x27;t do much.  Also, I hoped to use it without any combs to shape the bottom edge of my beard, but it doesn&#x27;t really work for that.  The shape is wrong and it doesn&#x27;t cut closely enough when used in a stabbing motion to try to cut a straight line.</li>
            <li> So far, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very good! It&#x27;s a solid, fairly priced cutter. Already Do-It-Myself. It&#x27;s so easy to do that. I like this product very much!</li>
            <li> very easy.  I love it</li>
            <li> I trim the hair of the guys close to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair clipper works on bolding men as well as those who have a full head of hair and want to shave it all off. It does a nice job with trimming the bolding man&#x27;s thin hair as well as cutting off the thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a step up from previous clippers I have tried (mostly in the $20-$40 range), but it also costs more than my previous foray into hair clippers, so I&#x27;m not sure if its fair to judge its performance based on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean and charge.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as advertised and works very well.</li>
            <li> This hair clipper and shaver has a lot of features in one package.  Cordless and rechargeable, it recharges in about an hour.  The clipper has 2 attachments, one for longer hair and another precision attachment for a closer clip.  Both adjust at the turn of a dial on the base.  Pulling firmly on the attachments removes them from the base.  The clipper head is removed by pressing on tabs on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head snaps easily into place on the base.  The shaver provides a reasonably close shave that does not irritate my sensitive skin.  The clipper and shaving heads rotate 90 degrees in each direction on the base, making it easy to maneuver and reach difficult spots on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can easily clean this by running it under water, but you must wait until it dries to use it.  It is not waterproof so it cannot be used in the shower.  This item comes with charging cord, brush, and a storage bag that holds everything.</li>
            <li> My husband is in the military, and as such is always getting his hair cut to stay within regs. Once before we tried doing haircuts at home with a hair clipper like the barber uses, but let&#x27;s just say that didn&#x27;t quite come out as planned (Thankfully his hair grows back quickly.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper was much easier for he and I to control. I think being cordless helps with that. Before I worried about accidentally cutting the power cord. The fact that the shaving head can rotate 180* makes it easier to control. No more holding clippers at odd or difficult angles to get the right cut. The blades are also self-sharpening stainless steel, and cleanup is easy. Just brush the hair off and wipe down with a damp towel. No disassembling to clean or sharpen is a big bonus. This comes with two attachments that allow for a short trim or direct on your skin trim for clean edges. After several uses there&#x27;s been no indication of nicks or razor burn to his skin, though someone with sensitive skin might notice something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the batter, it was fully charged in just shy of an hour after taking it from the box. The directions say it&#x27;s good for 60 minutes of cordless use, but we&#x27;ve noticed that after about 45 minutes the clippers start to sound slower. This allows for four or five full hair trims. Since we have this clipper now, he doesn&#x27;t wait as long between haircuts, and this makes it much, much easier to keep up with. The battery is Lithium Ion, so no worries about \\&quot;battery memory\\&quot; issues or anything like that. There is a light that flashes when the battery gets low, which is a good reminder to plug it in to the charger. You can use it while plugged in to charge, but personally I prefer waiting a bit to use it cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is disappointing though that this clipper doesn&#x27;t come with some sort of stand. Right now my hubby uses a holder meant for a shaving brush. It attaches to the bathroom mirror and has metal \\&quot;arms\\&quot; that hold this clipper pretty well. He likes this better than leaving it on the counter where it could get bumped around, knocked off, inadvertently doused in water, etc.  And for the price, like other reviews have mentioned, it could have come with a better storage bag. A hard case would have been preferable, especially for the amount traveling he does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is certainly a great clipper. Could it have come with more bells and whistles? Yes, it could have, but what it lacks in those it makes up for in quality and ease of use.e likes this better than leaving it on the counter where it could get bumped around, knocked off, inadvertently doused in water, etc.  And for the price, like other reviews have mentioned, it could have come with a better storage bag.

            <li> I used many different kinds of Hair Clippers over the past 6 years and, so I have a really good experience with Hair Clippers. I have to say, the Philips Norelco QC5580/40 Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper Pro is the best one that I ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco QC5170 hair clipper for a couple of years (along with a Remington ShortCut) and have been very pleased with its performance. This new version takes that up a notch with some excellent new features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The already good build quality has been stepped up a bit. The clipper fits well in my hand and has non-slip grip points to make sure it stays put (and keeps both my ears safe!). The clipper and shaving attachments fit into the holder easily, and seat with a solid click to know they are properly installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length adjustment is done by rotating a large ring that surrounds the clipper attachment port. This is my only complaint - while the adjustment ring moves smoothly and has nice, solid click stops, the length markings are on the comb attachment and are hard to read (white letters on black, which is nice, but VERY small text - at least small to my aging eyes). In the older version the adjustment numbers were in a window on the handle and much easier to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the old version, the head pivots 180 degrees in both directions. That&#x27;s a fantastic feature for cutting your own hair, since it avoids having to become a contortionist to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting performance is smooth and easy. Since my 2+ year old QC5170 still is quite sharp, I expect the blades on this model to keep their edge for some time. I fully expect I will run out of hair to cut before these go dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit also comes with a head shaving attachment. Think of it as a large foil shaver. It snaps on the attachment port and can pivot just like the hair cutting combs. Of course, the length of cut can&#x27;t be adjusted with the ring since this is shaver designed to shave to the skin. The foil can be removed from the cutters for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t shave my head with it, but I did use it to shave the back of my neck. Performance was excellent - no pulls or pinches, and my neck was left perfectly smooth. As with cutting my hair, the pivot feature made it simple to shave the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit also comes with the usual items (charger, cleaning brush) and includes a small pouch to store everything. That&#x27;s a nice touch, even though the pouch is a wee bit small to handle everything, and is not all that sturdy in terms of construction. But it&#x27;s functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints about this (other than the small length markings) and I recommend it highly. It&#x27;s also worth getting this even if you don&#x27;t plan on shaving your head bald since the shaving attachment does a great job getting rid of neck hair. While it&#x27;s a bit pricier than the QC5170, the improved design, performance, and features are worth the cost.my hair, the pivot feature made it simple to shave the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit also comes with the usual items (charger, cleaning brush) and includes a small pouch to store everything.

            <li> Excellent in all ways, except.. Although the power adaptor works with 110v or 240v, it doesn&#x27;t have inter-changable power-pins on its plug pack.  Instead, I have to use one of those retro-fit US to AU power plug convertors - which is cumbersome. If I was in the US, I would have given 5/5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to the bald look and I&#x27;m loving this clipper/shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The rotating head makes it easy to go over all the different parts of my head.&lt;br /&gt;The close shaver takes a few passes, but I had that issue with shavers before I had a beard.</li>
            <li> Just revived the clipper and it works fine. I really liked the shaving head too. I hope it works fine for some time!&lt;br /&gt;the combs also look fine.&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t think that you can really groom your head like a barber. I use it for complete shaving of my head and I have no idea if you could style your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have much hair and want to do simple use buy it. In terms of battery all Philips products work fine.</li>
            <li> Day 1: First impression is very good. Works as advertised. Powerful motor, charged quickly and the headshaving attachment adjusts to the contours of your head. Will update again in a month if it still holds up..  Update (6 months later..): By far the best head shaver value for the money. Complete head shaving done in 10 minutes. Difficult to work on some corners around the ears, but you are probably better of using a razor. quality product from Philips.</li>
            <li> Works great on charge. Has enough power to cut my tough hair. Only problem is, it has only up to number 5. No attached trimmer. These are the only reason, I have given 4 star.</li>
            <li> Using the std guide on this product leaves you with hair standing at about 1/4 inch. Attach the &#x27;foil&#x27; shaver and your bald in no time flat. Easy to use, and easy cleanup. Three attachments and cordless. Love the rotating head feature. Really helps get your dome from any angle. Whoever says bald isnt sexy, hasnt met Michael Jordan, Bruce Willis, or Sean Connery.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco QC5580 Diy Hair Clipper and Balder is a cordless shaver designed to keep hair neatly trimmed and in check.  I began shaving my head at a very early age in life so I&#x27;ve owned plenty of electric hair trimmers and clippers over the years. I also have extremely sensitive skin so using any shaver, electric or manual, is generally an uncomfortable experience. They&#x27;ve made a lot of shaving advancements over the years and the Philips Norelco QC5580 Diy Hair Clipper and Balder is a pretty good example of that. Here are my thoughts;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Shaver head click-rotates 180 degrees allowing you to trim even those hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Lithium Ion battery allows for approximately 60 minutes of cordless use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Blades are stainless steel and self sharpening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Two shaver attachments which allow you shave short or directly to the skin with little to no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Lightweight, easily portable and comes with a storage/travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Handy design makes shaving more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to wash and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Fully charges in 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Trimming guards feel a bit thin and would probably break, chip or crack if dropped on a hard surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shaving down to the skin with the razor accessory can take some patience depends on your hair type.  That being said, it&#x27;s quite possible for you to miss spots on the back of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life indicator light only flashes when charging or when the battery is low.  It would be nice to know what the overall level is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A bit pricey for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No charging stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Philips Norelco QC5580 Diy Hair Clipper and Balder is a pretty solid shaver. It&#x27;s powerful and does a good job of removing thick topical hair as well as trimming quite close. Great for sculpting and keeping pesky neck hair neat and under control, this is a handy trimmer to have around. If you have sensitive skin you may want to use caution and don&#x27;t overdo the shave process less you could cause minor skin irritation.  I shave down to the skin once a week so unfortunately it&#x27;s still easier for me to use my manual Gilette Fusion rather than this.  However, minor Cons aside, it&#x27;s one of the better cordless hair trimmers I&#x27;ve used in quite a while.around.

            <li> noise occurred after  two or three  months and can not repair</li>
            <li> Most of the other reviewers have mentioned pretty much all the good and bad about this product, but I plan to provide a comparison with my old hair clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you see my other reviews, you will notice that I love Phillips Norelco products, but I still treat them fairly.  I have always used a  [[ASIN:B0015K9BXQ Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable, Cordless, Haircut Kit]] to cut my hair.  In the past 5 years, I went through 2 of them.  They always cut great, but unfortunately the battery life made them unreliable.  I had to charge it before EVERY TIME I needed a haircut.  They would not operate while plugged in, and the batteries were very iffy.  Sometimes, even after a full night of charging, they would cut off on me mid-haircut!  I took the Remmington apart and discovered that it has 3 built-in Ni-Cd AAA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco improved on the battery shortfall of the Remmington.  It has a built-in li-ion battery and I was able to make it through 4 haircuts over the course of 2 months before I had to recharge it!  AMAZING!  Also, if I do happen to start a haircut on a low battery, I can plug it in and it will operate on the cord!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one area that the Norelco falls short in comparison with my old remmington is the shape of the blade.  As you can see from the product page, the remmington has about 2.5 inches of cutting surface, whereas the Norelco has only about 1.5 inches.  The shape of the blade also made it feel natural - like a comb in your hand.  This makes for a much quicker haircut than the Norelco.  Other than that, though, the Norelco wins in every way.</li>
            <li> I usually use a corded Wahl clipper, but I&#x27;m finding this Norelco to be great for travel. It&#x27;s cordless and keeps enough charge to do about 3 haircuts based on my experience. It&#x27;s not as powerful as the Wahl Senior, but it&#x27;s definitely adequate enough to trim my whole head without stalling. I did find it to get weaker on the 4th haircut, which is at about 45 minutes of use - but the battery charges quickly in about an hour, so it&#x27;s not much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that eventhough the clipper comes with only 2 combs, it allows for a good number of hair length settings. With the precision comb, you can trim from 1mm to 3mm. the standard comb allows for 3mm to 15mm lengths. Turning the dial on the body allows for roughly 2mm increments. I&#x27;ve used the shaving foil for my face, and while it works well enough, I&#x27;d much rather use a shaving blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norleco is a well-built clipper and perfect for my travel needs.</li>
            <li> I can not understand why I am so handsome after using this clipper</li>
            <li> very good..works perfect</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift about a year ago, and the person I bought it for loves it!</li>
            <li> I have been clipping and shaving my head since my early 20s and have bought and used all the major hair clipper brands out there. The issue I have always had was clipping my hair and then having to shave it with a traditional razor. It takes a long time to make sure that you lather correctly and shave slowly to eliminate knicks and cuts. Since purchasing this clipper shaver combo, I have seriously cut my grooming time in half! I HIGHLY recommend this for any guy who is sick and tired of spending over an hour clipping, lathering, and shaving their head to give this a serious shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> These work well for personal grooming. I found them effective for trimming beard and mustache, and trimming hair on arms and legs. The unit has a powerful motor, and does not get bogged down like cheaper units. The trimming head cuts precisely and cleanly. I have been pleased with the performance of this unit as a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the shaving attachment did not work as well. My experience is that it tends to miss spots and pull. It does not work as well as the standalone shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I primarily use it for trimming, I am overall pleased with the product, and would be happy to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Of course Amazon delivered it 3 days early than expected. Used it right away and i was done in less than 10 minutes. I like to close shave my head every 2-4 weeks and normally takes me about 12 minutes using my wahl clipper. Now my problem is who should i give my wahl clipper to. You can also use it as a beard shaver and somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Works great and the different guards give you many options. Just be aware the the plastic guards are flimsy and can break easily.</li>
            <li> The first time using it , the foil had a hole in, and one of the blades,had came off, and put the hole in the foil. I would like a new foil and set of blades, or a new head assy. I was shaving my head</li>
            <li> It shaves my head completely bald in a matter of minutes.  It leaves no hair on the head.  It is also great because it is cordless.  I can get to every part on my head at any angle.  Very easy to clean as well.  This is a wonderful product, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> for the guy with short hair does a great job and saves you bucks at teh barber.....use it once a week</li>
            <li> I find this clipper very easy to use. I have a  shoulder injury that makes it difficult to do the things I use to be able to do so when I saw this clipper had a swivel head I decided to give it a try. This clipper makes it easy for me to cut my hair by myself without fatiguing my shoulder.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I&#x27;d expected. The shaving clip-on does not shave as close as I thought it would. If you&#x27;re looking for a real close head shaving, stick to the razor.</li>
            <li> Easy, light, effortless! I don&#x27;t understand the people who wrote negative reviews about this thing. They are clearly high. This thing is amazing. I have coarse brillo pad-like hair (stop laughing.) I keep it short to this end. I have been buzzing it for years with a corded Wahl. After many years, the blades dulled and I had to cut really really slow to get the job done. My Wahl was a trooper, but alas, I had to retire it. I chose this because of its pivoting head and rechargeable Li-Ion battery. An hour to charge and an hour to use... I was sold. Although I can&#x27;t testify that both these figures are true, I can say it took about an hour to charge. When I used it, it took 4 mins to cut my whole head. The clippers plowed through my hair like it was nothing. I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy, how the twisting of the clipper head allowed me to do the back of my head with such ease. If you self-cut your own hair to one length like me...GET IT!&lt;br /&gt;-Branden</li>
            <li> Very good. useful and washable.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of times, but it works better than my previous corded clippers in that it cuts better and is easier to handle and adjust to the desired length.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Achieves bald scalp without nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Good price value versus other electric shaver/groomer devices.</li>
            <li> The instructions are a little confusing. My husband got this and it works very well. It has a lot of options.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use, fits well in your hand, and easy to give yourself a trim whenever needed too. Hubby is very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works great. Trims head and beard to the levels I like. Only wish it had a small precision trimmer attachment for those tight places. Otherwise a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one i had to buy within 8 months, the overall product is good, but the blade has broken out of its installation twice. Hope going to check on the warranty and see what they say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair clipper for a year so I feel I can give a thorough review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall.. After a year of use I&#x27;m in the market for a new hair trimmer because unfortunately the bad outweighs the good features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start off with The Good: You may not have had a clipper with a rotating head before but it&#x27;s an awesome feature! I primarily use my clipper to shave my head down bald so it&#x27;s quite handy to rotate the blade when switching to my other hand and shaving my head at otherwise awkward angles. It fits nicely in your hand and all of the parts feel well designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is wonderful, lasting 3-5 full length hair cutting sessions before needing to be recharged. I&#x27;ve never had to charge it for more than 40 minutes or so. After a year I haven&#x27;t experienced any loss degradation to the battery&#x27;s capacity. And have no fear of your clipper dying on you mid-use; it can be operated while plugged into the wall charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to clean as all of the parts can be cleaned under running water and it&#x27;s also nice to have two shaving guards. The trimmer can also be used without a guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my head without the guard in place and even then it DOES NOT get my hair down to 0mm as you would expect it to (as it is advertised to). The lowest this clipper can get my hair down to is about0.5 -  1mm. What&#x27;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful where you use this on the more delicate parts of your anatomy! The blades are very sharp (which is a good thing) and it can catch my skin when I use it to shave my under arms and The Great Down-Under. There has been much cursing and minor blood-letting when this occurs. I should note that other clippers have not given me this problem, I don&#x27;t know why this one does. Perhaps it&#x27;s the shape of the blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Balder&amp;#34; attachment is totally a gimmick. I shave my head regularly (with a razor and shaving cream) and bought this clipper specifically for the Balder feature hoping to speed up the task. You have to make multiple passes on your head- I&#x27;m talking at least 5 -before your hair will get down low enough and because you&#x27;re trying so hard to shave down the uneven spots that it leaves it may irritate your scalp for hours after as it does mine. Shaving your head with the balder attach takes me about 10-15 minutes, and even then you won&#x27;t be truly bald. Well, not by my standards.</li>
            <li> This is really wonderful. My husband uses this a lot - it saves a ton of money on professional haircuts, plus he can do quick touch ups whenever he needs to. Very easy to use - I clean up the edges at the base of his neck, and I also get to do his back.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Philips Norelco QC5530/40, a very similar clipper 3 years ago and like it a lot.  I&#x27;ve two problems with it though:  #1  The plastic combs readily break....two smaller ones cracked within the first six months and now the largest comb has broken.  #2 was the unavailability of a replacement set from Phillips support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to me that strong plastic-like materials are available these days and Philips can spend another 25 cents per clipper to get this right.  Other than this I loved the thing and now I&#x27;ll have to look around for another product.</li>
            <li> Edge could not clear by self</li>
            <li> Great!!!  good  power, battery life, blades.  I  use it about 15 minutes twice a week for  shave  my head  and beard.</li>
            <li> Perfect hair clipper, it&#x27;s very helpful, I love it very much!&lt;br /&gt;And I buy it with a lowest price, HOHO...</li>
            <li> Battery is amazing.  More importantly the clipper is unreal.  Loads of use so far and no sign/feel of dulling/catching.  I shave my head to 1 every two weeks.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> I decided on this hair clipper over a norelco shaver as my main intention was to manage the balding head. Face shavers are plenty and theres always the blades.&lt;br /&gt;I opened this the moment I received it and used it without reading the long manual. Package come as described, a bag, a long clipper, a short clipper, a shaver, a power cable for US plugs, a small brush.&lt;br /&gt;I started with the long clipper and immediately I knew it wont work for me. The short clipper did. Was doing fine with short clipper at step 3. But was curious on step 0/1 (0.3mm) and tried on my head. Opps, only realised after you clipped a part of your head you need to do the whole head again!&lt;br /&gt;The rotational head wasnt much of a feature but did help when i used my left hand. Guess that is the feature we all need.&lt;br /&gt;I feel the build quality is pretty good, nice weight and rubberised grib for water proofing.&lt;br /&gt;Over all great product. I managed to clip my hair in ten minutes by myself. Another 5 minutes with the vacuum cleaner to clean up the hair. I did not try wet washing the clipper but just brushed off the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the clipper on my beard with the same shaver, but it doesnt work well on my soft loose beard.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;would&amp;#34; be a great system if the &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; or the adjustable risers that attach to the blades, weren&#x27;t so fragile.&lt;br /&gt;They break very, very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I now am the owner of two motor units and a single set of working combs.&lt;br /&gt;For a premium priced hair cutting system, those fragile and integral parts of the system, should definitely be indestructible.</li>
            <li> A handy portable hair trimmer. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good!&lt;br /&gt;Please keep one thing in mind, its always better if a barber cuts your hair, then any machine!!!</li>
            <li> Buzzed my head using the &amp;#34;1/2&amp;#34; setting, and was very pleased with it. I did not experience the issue of the shaving head adjusting itself when too much pressure is applied. It took two or three passes and I was done. I went slowly and spent about 30 mins clipping, and the clipper&#x27;s battery power remained strong during that time. I&#x27;m coping with a scalp condition, and buzzing my head gave me some much needed relief. Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> Actually, my wife uses it to cut my hair &amp; we both like it.  She likes it because it&#x27;s quick to use &amp; cordless.  I like it because shaving my hair means I don&#x27;t have to waste time with my hair except 10 minutes on Sunday mornings.</li>
            <li> Shave do not performs as expected. No good for cutting hair around ears. Comb easy to be damaged etc. No carring case.</li>
            <li> need to be for longer hair!!!!!!!!!! have to have a marine crew cut for this to work ,or be bald</li>
            <li> The adjustable clippers work like a charm and are super convenient.  The battery life is wonderful and charges very quickly.  It&#x27;s suppose to last an hour on a full charge but i&#x27;ve never used it for more than 15 minutes.  Definitely recommended to do-it-yourself hair cutters.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy for cut hair by myself.&lt;br /&gt;Good using experience, haven&#x27;t found any problem. multiple length selection.&lt;br /&gt;I already use it twice.</li>
            <li> I really like this clipper, it&#x27;s very smooth for the skin.</li>
            <li> The best thing about Philips Norelco DIY hair clipper is that it really is DIY!  I no longer have to shave my husbands head for him.  Now, he gets a great haircut whenever he wants one.  This clipper and balder is really very, very good.  It gets very close to the head and around the ears perfectly.  It works wonderfully and my husband looks great!  Very nice, well made (doesn&#x27;t feel like cheap plastic junk), easy to use and handle hair clipper.</li>
            <li> I shave my head, so when I saw something with the word \\&quot;balder\\&quot; in the name for the Vine program, I had to try it out.  Of course, they changed the name now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only shave my head when it&#x27;s dry, with an electric razor, and am always looking for something good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a Braun for a year or two, then had changed to a nice Panasonic, and have been very happy with that one.  Results were just fine, no irritation, and the charge lasted for several uses. Plus it was very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I also buzz my 9 year old&#x27;s hair down to almost nothing in the warmer seasons, I thought this could kill a couple birds with one stone.  Cordless puts it a step above the large, loud Wahl unit I&#x27;ve been using to buzz his hair for the last couple of years, I could use it to trim my beard when I let it grow sometimes, and to shave my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unit arrived in perfect shape, with a sticker on it that it&#x27;s not for sale since we received these before they&#x27;re available to the public.  I let it charge up, then fired it off, and was satisfied with the noise.  Lower pitch than my Panasonic, but not quite so loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple different attachments for the trimming, and the shaver.  It&#x27;s very easy to change things out - two buttons opposite each other and whatever attachment you have pulls right off.  I&#x27;ve had no problems removing or inserting any of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the shaving foil on, and gave it a try.  The very first thing I noticed was that it&#x27;s easy to use.  My normal razors are the standard \\&quot;straight up\\&quot; design, so you&#x27;re always holding this thing up and perpendicular to the surface of your head.  With the longer body, that means a lot of pivoting and movement.  This, with the smaller body that actually lays parallel to the surface you are cutting, really is a much easier device to maneuver and handle.  Since it&#x27;s not sticking up in the air, you get all the coverage you need with small rotations of the wrist while holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the bonus for the shaving was that the head rotates around, so regardless of what part of my head I am shaving, or what angle and direction I&#x27;m moving, I can find a comfortable position for my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was great, but I expected that since it&#x27;s a brand new blade compared to the Philips I have right now.  So this got my head done in less time than I&#x27;m used to, but I could get that same result by buying new blades for my current one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning was a breeze, it opens up like any electric razor and comes with a brush to get stubble out of the blades and the inside of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t buzzed my son&#x27;s head yet since it&#x27;s been around zero here recently, not buzzing weather.  But the fully adjustable depth of the trimmer heads is nice, very smooth movement to raise and lower to give you more or less distance from the cutters to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life has been just about what they&#x27;ve stated, I get from 50 to about 65 minutes of use.  I wish they had a more comprehensive meter to show how much is left of the battery, but you can operate it while corded if you run out in the middle of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating head is really the big point here for people who are shaving their own head or just trimming their own hair, since it&#x27;s going to allow VERY easy use at the back of the head, where, as a head shaver for more than a decade, I know the most frustration can arise.  Being able to get a comfortable hold while getting the right angle is critical, and they&#x27;ve really mastered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy, fits well in the hand, and really is a good dual purpose device.  My son will be thrilled that we don&#x27;t have to use the incredibly loud Wahl anymore to shorten his hair when spring comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit April 2013 - Finally got to use it to buzz my son&#x27;s head down, and it was phenomenal.  Normally I use a larger Wahl clipper with varying sized \\&quot;combs\\&quot; to let you change out the depthof the cut.  So this immediately made a HUGE difference in two major ways - first, no need to pop off one attachment and pop on another for different length cuts.  Second, and this is where this thing SHINES, is the fact that with the Wahl, you HAVE to come at the hair from the top of the unit, it&#x27;s about 7 or 8 inches long, so getting the nape of the neck and around the ears can be a real pain with a wiggly 9 year old who doesn&#x27;t like that loud buzz of the Wahl...  With this, it was just amazingly easy.  Being able to turn the direction of the cutter made doing the nape of the neck and around the ears a TOTALLY different experience than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  Night and day.  There is no way I&#x27;d use anything else anymore for cutting his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had originally given this unit four stars out of five because I didn&#x27;t like that there&#x27;s no way to see what the charge is, the light doesn&#x27;t come on until it starts getting low.  I&#x27;d prefer to see, like my other razors, that there&#x27;s 83% left or something when I start just in case I have a large job for it. But after seeing just how well this worked trimming my son&#x27;s hair, I had to bump it up to the full 5 stars.  There is nothing that compares to this.of the cut.

            <li> I got a used one, still have creams on it. damn</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Performs as advertised. Very comfortable and versatile. I love the fact that it can run while plugged in, just in case you run out of juice.  I used to use Remington shortcuts for buzz cuts but this one is a superior product by far.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is great and gives a solid haircut. The problem, as others have stated, is the flimsy plastic combs included. They break very easily and I haven&#x27;t been able to find replacements anywhere online. I&#x27;m actually now on my third one now because I&#x27;ve broken two previous plastic combs and couldn&#x27;t replace them.</li>
            <li> OMG. This little hair clip is a mini monster. I had a similar item and used it for 12 years. One day I left it lugged at home and we had a blackout. Once the power was back it was not working anymore. So I purchased another one (different brand) It was OK. Until I received this one from Amazon. It is even better than all the hair clips I&#x27;ve ever owned. Really powerful and very handy. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job as required and anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is good&lt;br /&gt;It cut the hair and align it as described</li>
            <li> Do not buy this!  The plastic combs are as flimsy as in previous models.  I had one and accidentally dropped it on a linoleum floor from 4 feet and two of the tines broke.  This left sharp edges and the product was unusable.  I was surprised to find the same flaw in this model, so I called Norelco to buy a replacement before I needed it in the middle of a haircut.  I was told by a \\&quot;Supervisor\\&quot; that the part was not for sale and not available!</li>
            <li> save a lot of money if go out for haircut</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, just i thought could use it for my face too but no, it is not an option for face shaving, only for head.</li>
            <li> Fast, convenient,  able to cut at zero length. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Dont miss out on this product before you try anything else.</li>
            <li> These are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable - check. The battery easily lasts a full shave. I&#x27;ve never run out. It can probably go 30 to 60 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof - check. You can wash them easily and even operate under the shower, but you&#x27;d get better performance dry.&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight and non-fatiguing - check. Much better than the larger corded beasts like Wahls.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to grip - check. The flat design makes it very very easy to hold. The swivel makes a huge difference when you switch hands or reach into other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other clippers I&#x27;ve tried and gotten rid of after i found these:&lt;br /&gt;- Andis Super AGR+ Cordless Rechargeable Clipper (the mercedes of cordless clippers! way too heavy and not washable)&lt;br /&gt;- Wahl Sterling Professional -- it&#x27;s what my barbers and fancy hair stylists used! Heaving and corded.&lt;br /&gt;- Wahl Peanut - corded and cordless&lt;br /&gt;- Panasonic wet n dry&lt;br /&gt;- Remington HC600 ceramic blade cordless</li>
            <li> The machine is a real treat! Works smooth, the outcomes were great. The instruction were accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Hair clipper to everyone who wants fair outcomes that comes fast, without going to the barber.&lt;br /&gt;The regular shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> In his barber too comfortable, by the summer, every day can feel cool!Love it This comes as more than 5530 card slots, but wins in the can of shaving the head</li>
            <li> I really like this hair trimmer - a lot! I purchased one for myself a while back and I can honestly say it&#x27;s the best trimmer I&#x27;ve had, and I&#x27;ve had several. Since I got mine, I&#x27;ve already ordered a couple more as gifts and the people I sent them to like them just as much as I do. I don&#x27;t know what more to say about a hair trimmer - it does exactly what it says it does and does it well. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works really well, cleans easy, lots of shaving options.  Like has been said, you must use it ofter.  If you&#x27;re lazy about it it won&#x27;t cut closely or it takes forever to get it done.</li>
            <li> more fonction, best price.</li>
            <li> I Love It! I looked at everything here, bought this, am really glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Good quality and very ergonomic. I&#x27;ve used many models of other known brands too, and has been the most comfortable.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Save our family money with this device.</li>
            <li> cousin loved it. was given as a gift.</li>
            <li> it is very good.fast and excellent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp as well as convenient， I used it all the time 4 saving money apprently!</li>
            <li> Love the balder! i didnt have to use a razor. If needed I can also do it myself!</li>
            <li> Great for keeping small hair cut..</li>
            <li> Reaching that point in my life where it may be advisable to have all the hairs on my head the same length, I decided it was time I picked up some clippers.  This one just happened to present itself to me at the right time and so within a few days it was on my doorstep and I was giving it a spin.  I&#x27;ve since used it four times and I must say that I&#x27;m really impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t just your average trimmer.  The rotating shaver head allows for easy access to hard to reach areas (like behind your ears) and makes for a comfortable shave.  The cordless feature is a plus, making trimming in a place like a shower easy to do without cords getting in the way or limiting your movement, and the 60 hours of battery life is also pretty awesome.  I&#x27;ve only charged it once, and as I said; I&#x27;ve already used it four times.  The fact that it only takes an hour to charge (and hour for an hour) is pretty cool too.  The self-sharpening blades and lightweight design are added bonuses.  I also like that this is pretty easy to keep up.  The provided brush is easy to use and cleans out the shaver head rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my only issue here is the trimming guards themselves.  Only two are provided and they are both VERY thin.  Getting them on and off the shaver is a bit of a pain and I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;m going to snap one of them.  I also wish there were more options for length, but I&#x27;m sure I can buy extra accessories (I don&#x27;t have the need to, but the option would be nice).  That said, for what it is I&#x27;m very happy.  Some may find it a tad pricey, but I think it is certainly worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Handy (literally), small enough to travel with and very comfortable. The only drawback is maybe the range of clippers a wider set would have been welcome but overall it is a very satisfying purchase.</li>
            <li> Its all I expected and then some, the only thing I can think of that could be improved on is it could be a bit narrower</li>
            <li> I had the previous version for while and gave it to my dad.&lt;br /&gt;This updated version works even BETTER!!!  It cuts much much better , water resistant, awesome battery.. It is simply reliable and great. I recommend it to you.</li>
            <li> I like my cut short all over.  It does the job for me.</li>
            <li> For the most part, this thing works like a champ. I let my (extremely thick and wavy) hair go for way too long before trying it out, and it zipped right through. I was amazed that it never got clogged up -- this is the first home haircut gadget I&#x27;ve tried that managed such a feat. All I had to do was shake it out now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating head is great. Combined with the lack of a cord, the unit is very maneuverable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length adjustment is. . .interesting. There are two comb heads, each with five length settings. However, the longest setting is only 5/8\\&quot;. Unless you&#x27;re 6 years old, that&#x27;s close to a buzz cut. So if you like your hair longer, this won&#x27;t be of much use to you. Also, the locking mechanism is weak, so occasionally while cutting my hair, the comb would suddenly shift to a shorter setting. This didn&#x27;t turn out to be a huge deal, since I got the hang of pulling it away from my head quickly when that happened, but it&#x27;s something to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head attachment is kind of mediocre. I doubt I&#x27;ll use it again unless I get caught with my regular rotary-head shaver uncharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that unless you are cutting your hair extremely short, or you have a lot of practice, you&#x27;ll probably want someone to do a little trimming after you use this. My cut was a little iffy at first (bearing in mind that I am no expert at self-haircuts -- yet!), so my wife did some final snipping and shaving to even things out. However, the overall time that it took for me to clip the bulk of it with this little gadget and her to snazz it up was quite a bit shorter than it normally takes for her to do my whole head with scissors and a razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Wahl trimmer with about 16 different plastic snap-on blade attachments, that had gradually become misaligned.&lt;br /&gt;THIS trimmer has just two blade attachments, with twisting-adjustment heights, so you have about 10-12 different heights with much less hassle and far fewer pieces.  The fact that it&#x27;s cordless is a bonus, no problems with finding extension cords to use this trimmer over a particular surface to catch hair.  I use it for facial and head hair trimming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple months now. Overall, i am happy with as it does its clipping well, is small, and is easy to use. I wasnt quite sure i&#x27;d like it , because of its weird body design, but it works. It comes with 2 combs and 1 shaving tool. The combs are plastic but are good quality. Attaching/ removing them is pretty simple and i doubt they will break. The thing i dont get with the combs is they have no mm designation; instead they put #&#x27;s between 1-5 so you will need to look through the manual to find the equivalent mm size.The clipper is pretty loud and vibrates quite a bit. Its only got 1 speed setting. I love the rotating head though, it comes in very handy in usage.</li>
            <li> shaves your head down to an onion and easy to use</li>
            <li> The best clipper I have ever used</li>
            <li> Very good product and excellent seller.</li>
            <li> Lithium battery is great and recharges quickly.  Like the multiple heads and ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great product! I bought it as a Christmas gift for my father and he loves it! He is using it since Christmas every day and has no problems. Told me that this is the best head shaver he has ever used!</li>
            <li> Everyone once in a while you come along a product that rises well above the standard. This is one of them. A hair clipper is just a hair clipper, right? I would have agreed until I tried this one. Here is a quick run down of some of the stand out features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The shape. It just fits really well in my hand, is very easy to hold onto&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used plugged or unplugged. So many rechargeable devices these days will not function if plugged in. This is annoying. But in this case, the engineers went the extra step and designed this hair clipper so it can be used plugged in or unplugged. Little things like this make a difference. Imagine being half way done cutting your hair and the battery dying. You definitely want the option of plugging in and finishing up!&lt;br /&gt;- The swivel head. 180 degrees of swivel, and it clicks into place at several locations along the way, so it stays where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;- The adjustable comb. With a turn of a knob you can adjust the length you are cutting, using the standard 1 through 5 comb numbering system. Here&#x27;s a quick tip, the numbers refer to 8ths of an inch. #1 is 1/8 of an inch. #3 is 3/8 of an inch. And so on.&lt;br /&gt;- Additional precision comb for really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;- Additional shaver attachment, for closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;- Charges from empty in an hour, not several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could actually go on. I really enjoyed using this hair clipper. It feels good in my hand, I have complete control, it&#x27;s easy to use, and I got a good result the first time I used it. Here&#x27;s one more tip. Start with the longest setting (5) when you first try it so you don&#x27;t accidentally cut too short. Then ease your way back through shorter settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say. This is a great, well designed product that I will be getting a lot of use from. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> does a great job if you want to cut your own hair</li>
            <li> good and nice,i like it</li>
            <li> so simple and easy to use and will put Barbers out of business. with all the different size adjustment you are sure to find the one that suits your needs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for one month now. This is exactly what I needed I use once a week. Main adv is its washable.&lt;br /&gt;Great product at this price.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty solid, fairly priced cutter. The heads are best for shorter hair, though, so this is mainly for guys, I&#x27;d say. It&#x27;s well made, feels solid, and the battery lasts for 5-6 cuts easy. All told it would be perfect for those who shave their heads and/or have easy-to-trim beards or &#x27;staches. My last Norelco shaver lasted for years, so here&#x27;s hoping this does too.</li>
            <li> Holds charge very well. Adjustable height so very versatile for clipping the hair. Rotatable clipper makes it easy to access the different parts. Love it.</li>
