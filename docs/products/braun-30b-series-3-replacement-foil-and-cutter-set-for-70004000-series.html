            <li>Good shipping</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 6 months and still works good.</li>
            <li>The Braun 7000-Series Syncro Shaver Replacement Foil &amp; Cutter Set was exactly what I wanted, it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Given that the cutter set stands up well over time, it would be nice to have the ability to purchase just the foil at a reduced price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pleased to continue using my good ol&#x27; Braun Shaver.</li>
            <li>My husband needed a new head for his Braun razor and this was perfect.  </li>
            <li>+ Fit the device perfectly and performs to a high standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(It shaves better than the newer models).</li>
            <li>This appears to be more of a Braun problem than an Amazon one.  </li>
            <li>What more can you say?</li>
            <li>I have read that some versions of the 7000 series foils do not fit, but this one fit my 7526 Braun Synchro perfectly, and works great.</li>
            <li>Shipping was speedy, leaving me a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>I love my Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>MUCH better than recommended replacement for 8985.</li>
            <li>As a result I am out of pocket for two sets of postage and also when the refund was make more money was deducted.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I was looking for, it arrived on time, and cost wise</li>
            <li>When I first got the 8985, I thought it did a good job.</li>
            <li>This is my second time Iam buying this very very good product.</li>
            <li>Perfect, new in wrapper, original manufacturer, reasonable price, shipped promptly, and I didn&#x27;t have to get in my car!  </li>
            <li>It works better than the original.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly after my order.</li>
            <li>Product matched perfectly with my shaver and it has been working very well so far.  </li>
            <li>Works fine and received promptly</li>
            <li>my experience, Braun manufactures a very good product, which typically lasts for many years before the shavers themselves need to be replaced.</li>
            <li>and they aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit my series 7</li>
            <li>I have order 2 of these replacements and they fit well</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t try to cheap out and get the one piece that breaks...</li>
            <li>This will allow me to have a smooth cut with my electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Came in original packaging.</li>
            <li>Although the manufacturer recommends replacing the foil and cutter overy 2 years, I&#x27;ve found that replacing them every year or so improves the shaving experience significantly.</li>
            <li>It originally came with the thicker blades that are also the recommended replacement blades.</li>
            <li>This design does seem better at catching the facial hair for a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I am thinking of sending this back and order the cheaper one from a more honest seller.</li>
            <li>it works great, giving a much closer shave than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>It was also a great pricepoint and the delivery was as expected.</li>
            <li>However when they are sharp they are great.</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased that this foil has the updated hexagonal grid pattern rather than my old circular hole pattern in the original foil.  </li>
            <li>The Braun now performs better than it did when I got it brand new with the thicker blades.</li>
            <li>Installation is trivial and, if one hasn&#x27;t replaced the foil and cutter ina  while, well worth it.</li>
            <li>I quickly found it on Amazon and it was at my door quickly and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Company resent it and it came right away.</li>
            <li>They were reasonably priced and they were quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>Shaver is 10 years old and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to keep my 10 year old shaver going strong.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Much better replacement for my 8000-Series shaver than the actual 8000-Series replacement.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted,</li>
            <li>It is getting hard to find these accessories in the stores now, so it&#x27;s nice to see them available online.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it fit my razor, but it performed at the level that I was used to.  </li>
            <li>Not only did iit fit it  works every time with no snags or problems.</li>
            <li>Oh and these are much cheaper too.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Greg</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I have owned many other electric razors in my life.  </li>
            <li>The original owner said the razor simply didn&#x27;t work for him.  </li>
            <li>I think this company should do better at less packaging and a lower postal rate.</li>
            <li>If you have a 7000 series Braun, drop a few bucks more than the cheapo models and get the real deal.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>I have an old Braun 8985 which works very well, but is beginning to show its age.  </li>
            <li>This happened to me a few months ago, and its happened many times over the years.</li>
            <li>This product....gave my razor what it needed to operate as if it were brand New.  </li>
            <li>My shaver now shaves as if it was brand new, for a fraction of the cost of a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Just try renewing your blades yearly and it will be like getting a new razor.  </li>
            <li>No problem switching the new parts.  </li>
            <li>The battery is no longer functional, but the new heads make it seem to be a new toy, just means I&#x27;m tied to AC.</li>
            <li>Beats the price of a new shaver.</li>
            <li>the razor works like a new one</li>
            <li>It makes your machine shave like new again.</li>
            <li>Once I got the new foil and cutter</li>
            <li>Made his razor work like new again.</li>
            <li>I got the razor for Xmas when it was new</li>
            <li>and they are identical with the exact same packaging too (30B).</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t for me at first as it left visible marks on my face that remained all day.  </li>
            <li>It still maintains a long lasting charge and shaves close and clean.</li>
            <li>This was a far cry from the quality and reliability that had shaped my opinion of Braun and its products.  </li>
            <li>Now I can keep my old razor for another couple of years</li>
            <li>The Braun shaver gives the closest shave next to a straight razor.</li>
            <li>The picture for this item is an old customer picture according to the company selling it.</li>
            <li>As far as the quality goes they are Braun and work like Braun.</li>
            <li>Every year for my birthday I buy myself a replacement foil and cutter for my old Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>If you have an old Braun, you should do this, too.</li>
            <li>This razor by far is the loudest ha</li>
            <li>We have been unsuccessfully trying to find a replacement for his old razor.</li>
            <li>This was much easier and cheaper than going to a local retailer to buy it</li>
            <li>and wow.</li>
            <li>still operating with old one, we will use in do time</li>
            <li>The new foil and cutter essentially gave me a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>These replacement parts are getting harder to find in retail locations and if available, more expensive.  </li>
            <li>I once had my barber shave me, and he chased me out of the shop with his straight razor OPEN, and told me to never come back for a shave.  </li>
            <li>Germans are apparently incapable of making anything but high-quality products.</li>
            <li>My old parts were long overdue for replacement.</li>
            <li>My fault probably, as I was quite confused by the many similar products with similar appearance and numbers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an 8000 series Braun electric razor for a few years now, and when I went to replace the cutter and foils a 2nd time I was surprised to find how quickly the quality of the replacement parts had gone down hill.  </li>

            <li> This razor by far is the loudest ha</li>
            <li> We have been unsuccessfully trying to find a replacement for his old razor.</li>
            <li> This was much easier and cheaper than going to a local retailer to buy it</li>
            <li> and wow.</li>
            <li> still operating with old one, we will use in do time</li>
            <li> The new foil and cutter essentially gave me a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> These replacement parts are getting harder to find in retail locations and if available, more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I once had my barber shave me, and he chased me out of the shop with his straight razor OPEN, and told me to never come back for a shave.  </li>
            <li> Germans are apparently incapable of making anything but high-quality products.</li>
            <li> My old parts were long overdue for replacement.</li>
            <li> My fault probably, as I was quite confused by the many similar products with similar appearance and numbers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an 8000 series Braun electric razor for a few years now, and when I went to replace the cutter and foils a 2nd time I was surprised to find how quickly the quality of the replacement parts had gone down hill.  </li>
            <li> and they are durable, long lasting.</li>
            <li> Meets all expectations and used previous one for nearly 2 years.</li>
            <li> but I wonder for how long.</li>
            <li> Should have bought them a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This replacement pack is identical to the one listed as \\&quot;Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000) \\&quot; and sells for about $20 by other sellers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to judge sometimes when to buy new foil and cutter set.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers for the past 20 years, but it is getting more difficult to locate the correct replacement foil and cutter set for my model.  </li>
            <li> with the original cutting assembly, perhaps too long.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s minor considering such an improvement over the past two 8000-Series replacements I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> these become harder to find in a year...</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it is helpful especially in the winters.</li>
            <li> This might have been OEM, but still from China, and lasted longer than expected.</li>
            <li> THIS DUE</li>
            <li> The motor is great but the blades get dull after cutting all those tough little hairs... j</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I decided to follow the advice of previous reviewers and try the 7000 series on the 8000.  </li>
            <li> A black plastic piece fell off the shaving head.</li>
            <li> I bought this from the previous reviews saying that this is the one to buy instead of the one that was made for it.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I was disappointed in was the rather large S&amp;H charge to send the cutter and foil set by mail.  </li>
            <li> Braun will tell you that the foil and cutting head need to be replaced every 18 months, but I shaved much longer than that</li>
            <li> Part does not fit my shaver?</li>
            <li> I returned this item as it did not fit my razor.  </li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews I ordered the 7000-series replacements instead</li>
            <li> The one I received was a Series 3, which will not fit the series 7.</li>
            <li> it was at least $10 cheaper than at Sears or other department stores.</li>
            <li> Replacing was a snap, literally, and using the shaver after replacement with this new cutting assembly improved the shave from my Braun.  </li>
            <li> Slightly improved foil configuration allows easier shaving of my thick beard.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my getting dull cutter.  </li>
            <li> These foils wear out every few years and are a bit expensive to replace.  </li>
            <li> the cutting block just isn&#x27;t sharp so you have to order another one</li>
            <li> The ridge between the foils grabbed at the hair on my face painfully without fail and the cutters were notably dull and chewed up my neck.  </li>
            <li> and you wont go wrong.</li>
            <li> My beard is very tough.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I am VERY disappointed as in the past</li>
            <li> If you have a Braun electric razor eventually you will need to replace the foil and cutting block.</li>

            <li> These foils wear out every few years and are a bit expensive to replace.  Given that the cutter set stands up well over time, it would be nice to have the ability to purchase just the foil at a reduced price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, Braun manufactures a very good product, which typically lasts for many years before the shavers themselves need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Part does not fit my shaver?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an 8000 series Braun electric razor for a few years now, and when I went to replace the cutter and foils a 2nd time I was surprised to find how quickly the quality of the replacement parts had gone down hill.  The ridge between the foils grabbed at the hair on my face painfully without fail and the cutters were notably dull and chewed up my neck.  This was a far cry from the quality and reliability that had shaped my opinion of Braun and its products.  Thankfully, I followed some reviewer suggestions and gave this 7000 series replacement a try.  Not only did it fit my razor, but it performed at the level that I was used to.  Just picked up a 2nd set in case these become harder to find in a year...</li>
            <li> Verry Happy.  This product....gave my razor what it needed to operate as if it were brand New.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> Walmart no longer carries replacement parts for the Braun 7000 series electric razors.Amazon had the parts. They were reasonably priced and they were quickly shipped. Now I can keep my old razor for another couple of years (It shaves better than the newer models).</li>
            <li> Best buy for the buck.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. The replacement foil and cutter came in no time at all. The Braun shaver gives the closest shave next to a straight razor. And who has time for that every day?</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for, it arrived on time, and cost wise it was at least $10 cheaper than at Sears or other department stores. My shaver now shaves as if it was brand new, for a fraction of the cost of a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I returned this item as it did not fit my razor.  My fault probably, as I was quite confused by the many similar products with similar appearance and numbers.  This appears to be more of a Braun problem than an Amazon one.  Amazon promptly credited the return with no questions, which is one of the big reasons I shop with them.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.I resive this four day befor estimeted deliry day.This is my second time Iam buying this very very good product.Thaks. G.</li>
            <li> Just try renewing your blades yearly and it will be like getting a new razor.  The motor is great but the blades get dull after cutting all those tough little hairs... j</li>
            <li> I purchased this Braun 7000 replacement foil and cutter set for my 8000 series (8585 razor).  Works fine and fits perfectly on my razor. Can&#x27;t beat the price for the 7000 replacement versus the 8000 series....</li>
            <li> This is just your standard issue replacement cutter and foil. Fits perfect and works perfectly. What more can you say? I change mine out once a year if I remember...</li>
            <li> These replacement parts are getting harder to find in retail locations and if available, more expensive.  No problem switching the new parts.  Came in original packaging.</li>
            <li> Braun will tell you that the foil and cutting head need to be replaced every 18 months, but I shaved much longer than that with the original cutting assembly, perhaps too long.  Replacing was a snap, literally, and using the shaver after replacement with this new cutting assembly improved the shave from my Braun.  I was quite pleased that this foil has the updated hexagonal grid pattern rather than my old circular hole pattern in the original foil.  This design does seem better at catching the facial hair for a closer shave.  The only thing I was disappointed in was the rather large S&amp;H charge to send the cutter and foil set by mail.  I think this company should do better at less packaging and a lower postal rate.</li>
            <li> It works better than the original.</li>
            <li> Much better replacement for my 8000-Series shaver than the actual 8000-Series replacement.  Only on issue in that the travel cover no longer stays in place but that&#x27;s minor considering such an improvement over the past two 8000-Series replacements I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Was very happy to find it on Amazon.com as We could not get a replacemt head for a perfectly good electric shaver in the stores</li>
            <li> I have an old Braun 8985 which works very well, but is beginning to show its age.  When I read the reviews of the replacement cutter series 8000 I decided to follow the advice of previous reviewers and try the 7000 series on the 8000.  To the point: It fits perfectly, looks good, cuts great, and is cheaper.  Works for me.    [[ASIN:B002LPAFRA Braun 7000-Series Syncro Shaver Replacement Foil &amp; Cutter Set]]</li>
            <li> I have read that some versions of the 7000 series foils do not fit, but this one fit my 7526 Braun Synchro perfectly, and works great. If you have a 7000 series Braun, drop a few bucks more than the cheapo models and get the real deal.</li>
            <li> 1st order was lost in the mail. Company resent it and it came right away. Meets all expectations and used previous one for nearly 2 years. Well made!</li>
            <li> The battery is no longer functional, but the new heads make it seem to be a new toy, just means I&#x27;m tied to AC. Beats the price of a new shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the series 3 in disguise.  Buy the cheaper one they are the same.  The picture for this item is an old customer picture according to the company selling it.</li>
            <li> This replacement pack is identical to the one listed as \\&quot;Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000) \\&quot; and sells for about $20 by other sellers. However, Buy-it-now-store lists this for $24.85 as \\&quot;Braun 7000-Series Syncro Shaver Replacement Foil &amp; Cutter Set\\&quot;. I have ordered and received both packs and they are identical with the exact same packaging too (30B). Don&#x27;t be fooled by the \\&quot;Buy-it-now-store\\&quot; people and save your money! I am thinking of sending this back and order the cheaper one from a more honest seller. As far as the quality goes they are Braun and work like Braun. Good luck &amp; Happy shopping.</li>
            <li> Although the manufacturer recommends replacing the foil and cutter overy 2 years, I&#x27;ve found that replacing them every year or so improves the shaving experience significantly. This replacement set keeps works perfectly in the Braun 7000-series razor, provding a cleaner, smoother, faster shave. Installation is trivial and, if one hasn&#x27;t replaced the foil and cutter ina  while, well worth it.</li>
            <li> A black plastic piece fell off the shaving head. It still works but I wonder for how long. Is it an integral part or extraneous?</li>
            <li> This replacement set added life to the shaver.  I thought I was going to have to toss the razor. I have owned many other electric razors in my life.  My beard is very tough.  I once had my barber shave me, and he chased me out of the shop with his straight razor OPEN, and told me to never come back for a shave.  However, I tire of using a blade and this razor gives me some relief.  And the replacement set was a blessing and money saver.</li>
            <li> the price was really good They were a good buy for the money.  the razor works like a new one</li>
            <li> My husband needed a new head for his Braun razor and this was perfect.  It was also a great pricepoint and the delivery was as expected.</li>
            <li> Every year for my birthday I buy myself a replacement foil and cutter for my old Braun shaver. If you have an old Braun, you should do this, too. It makes your machine shave like new again.</li>
            <li> This razor by far is the loudest ha but this foil fits it perfectly. I would buy this again not a problem and will</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers for the past 20 years, but it is getting more difficult to locate the correct replacement foil and cutter set for my model.  I quickly found it on Amazon and it was at my door quickly and at a reasonable price.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> everything  met our expectations</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how to rate this. If you have a Braun electric razor eventually you will need to replace the foil and cutting block. The problem is sometimes the cutting block just isn&#x27;t sharp so you have to order another one and they aren&#x27;t cheap. This happened to me a few months ago, and its happened many times over the years. However when they are sharp they are great.</li>
            <li> We have been unsuccessfully trying to find a replacement for his old razor. Finally found one at amazon. Not only did iit fit it  works every time with no snags or problems.</li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find these accessories in the stores now, so it&#x27;s nice to see them available online.  My husband loves his shaver, but he does need to change this about once a year.</li>
            <li> Germans are apparently incapable of making anything but high-quality products.</li>
            <li> The replacement came in a timely fashion and was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my getting dull cutter.  The price was competitive and the product is what  was advertised.  Shipping was speedy, leaving me a satisfied customer.  Good business seller.</li>
            <li> Works fine and received promptly</li>
            <li> Worked but was 3000 series</li>
            <li> The new foil and cutter essentially gave me a new shaver.  Should have bought them a long time ago. Arrived very quickly after my order. Would buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I purchased the razor used on craigslist.  The original owner said the razor simply didn&#x27;t work for him.  It didn&#x27;t for me at first as it left visible marks on my face that remained all day.  Once I got the new foil and cutter it works great, giving a much closer shave than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my series 7</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun shaver for about 10 years.  I replace the cutter every couple of years, but that shaver keeps on doing a great job.  It still maintains a long lasting charge and shaves close and clean.</li>
            <li> Product matched perfectly with my shaver and it has been working very well so far.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This part arrived  in good time and it fit my razor perfectly. This was much easier and cheaper than going to a local retailer to buy it</li>
            <li> I love my Braun shaver. I think it&#x27;s the best shaver on the market.  I think the self cleaning is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have order 2 of these replacements and they fit well but the quality of my shaving leaves a lot to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x60;t wait to replace this Braun shaver soon..</li>
            <li> Have bought this before and always happy</li>
            <li> My husband needed the shaver replacements and he said these work great. Made his razor work like new again. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Por this originale item the price is fair , will buy again when  the time ask for</li>
            <li> MUCH better than recommended replacement for 8985. When I first got the 8985, I thought it did a good job. It originally came with the thicker blades that are also the recommended replacement blades. After reading a few reviews I ordered the 7000-series replacements instead and wow. The Braun now performs better than it did when I got it brand new with the thicker blades. Oh and these are much cheaper too. HIGHLY recommend. Cheers!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to keep my 10 year old shaver going strong. Slightly improved foil configuration allows easier shaving of my thick beard. I am pleased to continue using my good ol&#x27; Braun Shaver. Thanks, Greg</li>
            <li> Good product......... Good shipping</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> + Fit the device perfectly and performs to a high standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Way, way overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;- Took quite some time getting here.</li>
            <li> Back to the same as it was before. I use it everyday and it is helpful especially in the winters.</li>
            <li> very happy with the braun blades.</li>
            <li> Fits my razor perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought this extra foil and cutter when I bought a 7000 series Braun Razor. THIS IS NOT THE CORRECT PART. The foil and cutter for the 7000 series is a one piece and what I got was a two piece foil and cutter for another model. I suggest that Amazon look at what they have on their site and correct their mistake. As a result I am out of pocket for two sets of postage and also when the refund was make more money was deducted. THIS DUE TO NO FAULT OF MINE. Needless to say I am VERY disappointed as in the past I have always found Amazon very good. NOT THIS TIME!!!!!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my Braun 8985.  I bought this from the previous reviews saying that this is the one to buy instead of the one that was made for it.  I have been using this for 6 months and still works good.</li>
            <li> The replacement cutter that I ordered was for a Braun Series 7 razor.  The one I received was a Series 3, which will not fit the series 7. I would like for them to send the correct item when ordering an item.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I got my as birthday gift need to replace them and they are durable, long lasting. I will recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> This might have been OEM, but still from China, and lasted longer than expected. Buy USA. and you wont go wrong.</li>
            <li> Perfect, new in wrapper, original manufacturer, reasonable price, shipped promptly, and I didn&#x27;t have to get in my car!  I will definitely order here next time!  Shaver is 10 years old and still going strong.  Get both pieces at once...don&#x27;t try to cheap out and get the one piece that breaks...it&#x27;s not worth it.  The two pieces work together like both halves of a pair of scissors.  I&#x27;ll be back next year for another!</li>
            <li> This will allow me to have a smooth cut with my electric shaver.  My old parts were long overdue for replacement.</li>
            <li> I got the razor for Xmas when it was new and I love it. It&#x27;s hard to judge sometimes when to buy new foil and cutter set. It says it last 18 months and I think maybe it last longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;My last on lasted it 2.5 years.</li>
            <li> Braun products are the best. Just the best shaver and blades give the closest shave.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted,</li>
            <li> still operating with old one, we will use in do time</li>
            <li> The Braun 7000-Series Syncro Shaver Replacement Foil &amp; Cutter Set was exactly what I wanted, it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Fits and works perfectly</li>
