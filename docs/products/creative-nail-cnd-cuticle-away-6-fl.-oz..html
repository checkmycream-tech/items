            <li>I love this cuticle gel!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>These are the kinds of products I LOVE!</li>
            <li>This stuff is really amazing</li>
            <li>Then I like to soak them in some warm water with lemon and mineral oil.</li>
            <li>I liked this product...  </li>
            <li>NOW I CAN SAVE MY MONEY AND DO MY OWN NAILS.  </li>
            <li>I recommend soaking your hands in a warm solution of water and olive oil.</li>
            <li>Works well, nice scent....</li>
            <li>+use any conditioning oil after removing the product by warm water and</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve got nice, clean and attractive nails.</li>
            <li>Ok it took actually more than one min as advised to work but after  five min it did and a good job indeed</li>
            <li>This was more cost effective though.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it really is amazing or not, but works okay for me.</li>
            <li>but so far i was impressed.</li>
            <li>I liked this cuticle remover, works great on my cuticles and makes my nails and hands smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>I find it best to clean the nails and shape them first.</li>
            <li>Great product does exactly what it says it does no complaints.</li>
            <li>but I still like the Sally Hanson rapid dissolving cuticle gel better.</li>
            <li>Will order again in 5 years when I run out :)</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Great product - gently removes cuticles, as promised.  </li>
            <li>This product keeps your cuticles in great shape - and removes unwanted cuticles gently and safely.</li>
            <li>I have better luck just soaking and softening than with this product.</li>
            <li>In fact, my over-the-counter Sally Hanson did a better job for me than this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>This product is used at most salons, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Creative Nail Cuticle Away worked so much better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>It is ok i guess.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Works much better than I had thought it would.</li>
            <li>Use the appropriate tools.</li>
            <li>If you have no time to go to the nail salon and your cuticles are looking like they have seen better days</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you get much more than the Sally Hansen product</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this helps.. :)to seal in the moisture to the cuticle better.  </li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>Hope this helps.. :)</li>
            <li>This works better and faster than the Sally Hansen cuticle removing gel.</li>
            <li>I love CND products, and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I really love this cuticle remover.  </li>
            <li>Then clipping the excess skin is easy as 1,2,3 :)</li>
            <li>Makes more easy to control cuticles when used twice a week.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing on most things, not just fingernails..</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been working great.  </li>
            <li>Cuticles are dissolved and minimized, making at home manicures and pedicures easy and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Before using this product I never worried about my cuticles, but it was really easy.</li>
            <li>It works fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>This size lasts a decent amount of time, and the price is fair.</li>
            <li>Just use some nail cuticle pushers with this, file the nails and you have instant beautiful manicured hands.</li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great cuticle remover for both the professional nail artist (which is where I saw it the first time), as well as for the practice-at-home-wanna-be-professional-nail-artist!</li>
            <li>Huge bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is the cuticle remover that my salon uses and they always did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>I soak my finger tips in a bowl of warm water for 2-3 minutes, apply this gentle product, and use a cuticle pusher to remove excess cuticles.</li>
            <li>Could have gotten this product for free out of my tap.</li>
            <li>Squeezes out perfectly, so far so good.</li>
            <li>One of the best purchases that I have ever made and 100% worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>Upon my first use of this cuticle remover, my cuticles were about 90% better.  </li>
            <li>I use it in between manicures just to keep the cuticles clean and from getting out of control.  </li>
            <li>see the cuticles come right off!</li>
            <li>and I have to say that my cuticles have not yet grown back... pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This works very well for me, although I get better results when I leave it on for five minutes instead of the 1-2 minutes suggested by the instructions.</li>
            <li>finally i can make a good manicure for myself.</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle that&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and I have barely made a dent in the bottle - love this stuff!</li>
            <li>The product was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>This brand works quick.</li>
            <li>This product makes the mani and pedis quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Removes cuticles quickly.</li>
            <li>This product just melted the cuticle away quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you can figure out a routine that works for you, and you&#x27;re reasonably skilled at applying polish, this pretty much eliminates the need to go to a salon.</li>
            <li>Will be using for a long time, especially since the size is great!</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions for either product and don&#x27;t leave it on too much longer than a minute, it should work fine.  </li>
            <li>bottle is big enough and price is very good.</li>
            <li>The thing I miss most about a professional manicure is the state of my cuticles.  </li>
            <li>PLEAS TRY IT AND WORTH MONEY.</li>
            <li>Just like most things, it&#x27;s important to follow the package instructions if one is not already trained in proper cuticle removal.</li>
            <li>If you use this twice on each nail cuticle it works better, the bottle is a pretty good size so it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, my cuticles are still neat and soft 10 days later with no change to my regular routine (I often use a calendula ointlment before bed).  </li>
            <li>Love this product as it makes my cuticles &amp;#34;disappear.&amp;#34; You can&#x27;t beat the price for this large size and it is better than any other cuticle remover I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This cuticle gel is a terrific value for the price, and the bottle is well-designed, clean, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it was very gentle on my nails.</li>
            <li>The product is very gentle and without any smell.</li>
            <li>This first and then Cuticle Eraser.</li>
            <li>Push back the cuticles with an orange stick or, better yet, a cuticle pushing too.  </li>
            <li>I work in a salon and this is the exact product we use.</li>
            <li>:) For cuticle areas that grow back</li>
            <li>I have found the key to healthy cuticles is too moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.  </li>
            <li>so maybe it does exactly what its suppose to</li>
            <li>I used this product exactly as directed, but it didn&#x27;t work for me, and gives me hangnails after using.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN E NAIL TECHNICIAN FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND USED MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS...</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend makes quick work for problem cuticles.</li>
            <li>It takes longer than a minute to soften my cuticles, but it works, for most of the dead skin will come off easily.</li>
            <li>it is just normal!!</li>
            <li>Although the size of the bottle is more than I really needed (just for my use only)</li>
            <li>FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN SALLY HASSEN INSTANT CUTICLE REMOVER.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as good if not better.  </li>
            <li>This large bottle works well.  </li>
            <li>Well, I forgot that there may be a sealer between the bottle and cap, so now a large drop comes out.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is HUGE, so it will last you forever.</li>
            <li>My one gripe is that the opening sometimes allows for too much product to seep out</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t have to use to much of it.  </li>
            <li>After having a baby and not finding nearly as much time for the nail salon, I decided to try a cuticle solution.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this cuticle remover.  </li>
            <li>it really works!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>I was using it weekly and my cuticles began to show signs of weakness and became sore to the touch, from removing to much of the cuticle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the initial removing of old stubborn cuticles, I  did not need to use this more than once to twice a month.  </li>
            <li>One of the first times I&#x27;ve ordered something new like this and</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work that well, but better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I had tried four or five other products before trying this and it works better than anything else I have used.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and, due to the size of the bottle, not expensive.</li>
            <li>I leave on for approximately a minute, and I am able to gently push back any excess/dead skin very easily with a stainless steel cuticle pusher and wash away.</li>
            <li>I really cannot tell much of a difference between this and the Sally Hansen as far as use or effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>also like that creative nail is  a little gentler than the Sally Hansen version.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE MY NAILS DONE TOO FREQUENTLY.  </li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to a friend and just soaking my cuticles with vaseline for a few minutes, did a better job.</li>
            <li>I have cuticles that very quickly grow down onto nail bed.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li>However, this product comes in such a large bottle at such an economical price that this one will be the one I continue to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used drugstore brands in the past and CND just does a better over all job.</li>
            <li>I expect that this bottle will last me a good while since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>A little watery, but does the job fine</li>
            <li>The price isn&#x27;t more than two or three dollars than drugstore brands but it is definitely worth it, and with such a big bottle I probably won&#x27;t have to purchase again for at least a year.</li>
            <li>This bottle is enormous and inexpensive and the product works very well.  </li>
            <li>This item works in just minutes and is not harsh on the skin at all.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS PROFESSIONAL STYLE.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>You will still need a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the size of the product for the money.</li>
            <li>It works for me so far...</li>
            <li>and my nails looked like I had been to a professional for a manicure.</li>
            <li>After keeping it on for one minute use a cuticle pusher and your cuticles will look like you got a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>it stings just a little, but if you are more careful than I am when pushing back your cuticles, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it, and the size off the bottle can last you for awhile.</li>
            <li>This product softens cuticles, removes dead skin, it makes easy to push back cuticles and no need to cut them off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an alright product: it didn&#x27;t exactly do what I expected it to.</li>
            <li>Then, gently pushing cuticles back with a cuticle pusher, only as needed.</li>
            <li>I generally just apply a small dab over the nail bed, wipe it off after five minutes, and then clean things up with a cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li>It is quite large, but will last a really long time.</li>
            <li>so I cut it down a little more.  </li>
            <li>it will last a very long time because it&#x27;s such a large bottle.  </li>
            <li>It easily removed my tough cuticles with one application, no chemical smell</li>
            <li>Followed the directions exactly as the bottle said and the results were no different than just soaking my hands in water for a little while.  </li>
            <li>When I first began the CND Shellac process quite a few months ago, I had on hand several tubes of the Sally Hansen cuticle remover gel and wanted to use them up before purchasing this product exclusive to CND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first used this over a week ago and it completely removed my dried, rough cuticles.</li>

            <li> Great product - gently removes cuticles, as promised.  </li>
            <li> This product keeps your cuticles in great shape - and removes unwanted cuticles gently and safely.</li>
            <li> I have better luck just soaking and softening than with this product.</li>
            <li> In fact, my over-the-counter Sally Hanson did a better job for me than this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This product is used at most salons, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Creative Nail Cuticle Away worked so much better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> It is ok i guess.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Works much better than I had thought it would.</li>
            <li> Use the appropriate tools.</li>
            <li> If you have no time to go to the nail salon and your cuticles are looking like they have seen better days</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you get much more than the Sally Hansen product</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this helps.. :)to seal in the moisture to the cuticle better.  </li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> Hope this helps.. :)</li>
            <li> This works better and faster than the Sally Hansen cuticle removing gel.</li>
            <li> I love CND products, and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I really love this cuticle remover.  </li>
            <li> Then clipping the excess skin is easy as 1,2,3 :)</li>
            <li> Makes more easy to control cuticles when used twice a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing on most things, not just fingernails..</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been working great.  </li>
            <li> Cuticles are dissolved and minimized, making at home manicures and pedicures easy and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Before using this product I never worried about my cuticles, but it was really easy.</li>
            <li> It works fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> This size lasts a decent amount of time, and the price is fair.</li>
            <li> Just use some nail cuticle pushers with this, file the nails and you have instant beautiful manicured hands.</li>
            <li> Works fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cuticle remover for both the professional nail artist (which is where I saw it the first time), as well as for the practice-at-home-wanna-be-professional-nail-artist!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is the cuticle remover that my salon uses and they always did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> I soak my finger tips in a bowl of warm water for 2-3 minutes, apply this gentle product, and use a cuticle pusher to remove excess cuticles.</li>
            <li> Could have gotten this product for free out of my tap.</li>
            <li> Squeezes out perfectly, so far so good.</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases that I have ever made and 100% worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Upon my first use of this cuticle remover, my cuticles were about 90% better.  </li>
            <li> I use it in between manicures just to keep the cuticles clean and from getting out of control.  </li>
            <li> see the cuticles come right off!</li>
            <li> and I have to say that my cuticles have not yet grown back... pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This works very well for me, although I get better results when I leave it on for five minutes instead of the 1-2 minutes suggested by the instructions.</li>
            <li> finally i can make a good manicure for myself.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle that&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and I have barely made a dent in the bottle - love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The product was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> This brand works quick.</li>
            <li> This product makes the mani and pedis quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Removes cuticles quickly.</li>
            <li> This product just melted the cuticle away quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you can figure out a routine that works for you, and you&#x27;re reasonably skilled at applying polish, this pretty much eliminates the need to go to a salon.</li>
            <li> Will be using for a long time, especially since the size is great!</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions for either product and don&#x27;t leave it on too much longer than a minute, it should work fine.  </li>
            <li> bottle is big enough and price is very good.</li>
            <li> The thing I miss most about a professional manicure is the state of my cuticles.  </li>
            <li> PLEAS TRY IT AND WORTH MONEY.</li>
            <li> Just like most things, it&#x27;s important to follow the package instructions if one is not already trained in proper cuticle removal.</li>
            <li> If you use this twice on each nail cuticle it works better, the bottle is a pretty good size so it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, my cuticles are still neat and soft 10 days later with no change to my regular routine (I often use a calendula ointlment before bed).  </li>
            <li> Love this product as it makes my cuticles &amp;#34;disappear.&amp;#34; You can&#x27;t beat the price for this large size and it is better than any other cuticle remover I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This cuticle gel is a terrific value for the price, and the bottle is well-designed, clean, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it was very gentle on my nails.</li>
            <li> The product is very gentle and without any smell.</li>
            <li> This first and then Cuticle Eraser.</li>
            <li> Push back the cuticles with an orange stick or, better yet, a cuticle pushing too.  </li>
            <li> I work in a salon and this is the exact product we use.</li>
            <li> :) For cuticle areas that grow back</li>
            <li> I have found the key to healthy cuticles is too moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.  </li>
            <li> so maybe it does exactly what its suppose to</li>
            <li> I used this product exactly as directed, but it didn&#x27;t work for me, and gives me hangnails after using.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN E NAIL TECHNICIAN FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND USED MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS...</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend makes quick work for problem cuticles.</li>
            <li> It takes longer than a minute to soften my cuticles, but it works, for most of the dead skin will come off easily.</li>
            <li> it is just normal!!</li>
            <li> Although the size of the bottle is more than I really needed (just for my use only)</li>
            <li> FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN SALLY HASSEN INSTANT CUTICLE REMOVER.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as good if not better.  </li>
            <li> This large bottle works well.  </li>
            <li> Well, I forgot that there may be a sealer between the bottle and cap, so now a large drop comes out.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is HUGE, so it will last you forever.</li>
            <li> My one gripe is that the opening sometimes allows for too much product to seep out</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t have to use to much of it.  </li>
            <li> After having a baby and not finding nearly as much time for the nail salon, I decided to try a cuticle solution.  </li>
            <li> I really do like this cuticle remover.  </li>
            <li> it really works!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> I was using it weekly and my cuticles began to show signs of weakness and became sore to the touch, from removing to much of the cuticle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the initial removing of old stubborn cuticles, I  did not need to use this more than once to twice a month.  </li>
            <li> One of the first times I&#x27;ve ordered something new like this and</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well, but better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I had tried four or five other products before trying this and it works better than anything else I have used.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and, due to the size of the bottle, not expensive.</li>
            <li> I leave on for approximately a minute, and I am able to gently push back any excess/dead skin very easily with a stainless steel cuticle pusher and wash away.</li>
            <li> I really cannot tell much of a difference between this and the Sally Hansen as far as use or effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> also like that creative nail is  a little gentler than the Sally Hansen version.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE MY NAILS DONE TOO FREQUENTLY.  </li>
            <li> I ended up giving it to a friend and just soaking my cuticles with vaseline for a few minutes, did a better job.</li>
            <li> I have cuticles that very quickly grow down onto nail bed.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> However, this product comes in such a large bottle at such an economical price that this one will be the one I continue to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used drugstore brands in the past and CND just does a better over all job.</li>
            <li> I expect that this bottle will last me a good while since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little watery, but does the job fine</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t more than two or three dollars than drugstore brands but it is definitely worth it, and with such a big bottle I probably won&#x27;t have to purchase again for at least a year.</li>
            <li> This bottle is enormous and inexpensive and the product works very well.  </li>
            <li> This item works in just minutes and is not harsh on the skin at all.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS PROFESSIONAL STYLE.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> You will still need a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the size of the product for the money.</li>
            <li> It works for me so far...</li>
            <li> and my nails looked like I had been to a professional for a manicure.</li>
            <li> After keeping it on for one minute use a cuticle pusher and your cuticles will look like you got a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> it stings just a little, but if you are more careful than I am when pushing back your cuticles, it works very well.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it, and the size off the bottle can last you for awhile.</li>
            <li> This product softens cuticles, removes dead skin, it makes easy to push back cuticles and no need to cut them off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright product: it didn&#x27;t exactly do what I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Then, gently pushing cuticles back with a cuticle pusher, only as needed.</li>
            <li> I generally just apply a small dab over the nail bed, wipe it off after five minutes, and then clean things up with a cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li> It is quite large, but will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> so I cut it down a little more.  </li>
            <li> it will last a very long time because it&#x27;s such a large bottle.  </li>
            <li> It easily removed my tough cuticles with one application, no chemical smell</li>
            <li> Followed the directions exactly as the bottle said and the results were no different than just soaking my hands in water for a little while.  </li>
            <li> When I first began the CND Shellac process quite a few months ago, I had on hand several tubes of the Sally Hansen cuticle remover gel and wanted to use them up before purchasing this product exclusive to CND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first used this over a week ago and it completely removed my dried, rough cuticles.</li>
            <li> (my guess is over 2 years so far) and I still have half of a bottle left.  </li>
            <li> I have found that both products if left on too long and used incorrectly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed it removes stains on my nails left by dark polish, so sometimes I use it over the entire nail.</li>
            <li> It is what I was missing for professional results at home.  </li>
            <li> Minimal nipping with the cuticle trimmer was necessary to remove hang nails.  </li>
            <li> It works in a few seconds and is not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought what a waste of money, BUT, then I let the solution sit on my nail, massage it into the skin and within a few minutes skin was falling off.</li>
            <li> Just like all of the CN products, this is above and beyond the other cuticle removers.</li>
            <li> and I have had this product for a very long time</li>
            <li> It does dry out your hands and nails alot</li>
            <li> Try sleeping with a heavy cuticle cream and moisturize daily as well, especially after washing hands.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful to not leave it on too long.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the base of my nail so clean looking and ready for polish.</li>
            <li> I left it on as long or a little longer thab they said, and used an orange stick,</li>
            <li> The only negative is that you use a lot since the opening is quite large compared to other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Put it on, rubbed it in a little and then used a cuticle pusher to push back on the cuticle.</li>
            <li> I have always had bad cuticles and now they are looking healthy and my nails are stronger...</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for quite a bit longer than the instructions recommend, especially on my toe cuticles, and it has never been a problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried trimming, pushing, grooming with other products, but my cuticles were still out of control.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers noted that this product worked well</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed that it dries out my nails as other products tend to do.</li>
            <li> And I only used my cuticle clipper for one small clip.  </li>
            <li> Sorry It&#x27;s my first time trying to get rid of cuticle by myself.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how the product is supposed to work, I thought it was supposed to actually remove dead skin</li>
            <li> Cuts my manicure time down by 5-7 mins.  </li>
            <li> it dosen&#x27;t even make a mess.</li>
            <li> n have a very difficult time in pushing the back and keeping them soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products in the past with varying results but this one worked as described.  </li>
            <li> When that is done I apply this and after a moment or so, I push away the dead skin with a metal cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li> few weeks ago I purchased this product and began using it.  </li>
            <li> the product does remove dead cuticle skin and the surrounding area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any other product, and at this point, I&#x27;m not sure if I would want to!</li>
            <li> I have very tight cuticles</li>
            <li> As I recall I left the sally Hansen on a little too long and it harmed my cuticles causing the nails to weaken forming painful hangnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used the Sally Hansen in the past and it&#x27;s stronger and it works</li>
            <li> I did this once only and have just been using a sandwich bag and gloves with my handmade cuticle oil and cream at night as the band aids can get expensive.</li>
            <li> I did this once only and have just been using a sandwich bag and gloves with my handmade cuticle oil and cream at night as the band aids can get expensive.</li>
            <li> The bottle is not too small.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the lose skin that came off, leaving a much cleaner base and smoother edge when I applied polish.  </li>
            <li> Makes nail polish application much easier at the base of the cuticles.</li>
            <li> If too much is removed you can get infected causing pain and very bad looking nails.</li>
            <li> In 1 minute it removes and looses the all the hardened skin from around the toes, no matter how tough the skin is.</li>
            <li> Would not buy again, needless to say.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not work.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t cause any uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It can be painful if you apply to broken skin.  </li>
            <li> I used to remove cuticle by cutting them off and in couple days they looked ugly.</li>
            <li> Buy this product and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have the worst cuticles in the world.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Squeezes out perfectly, so far so good. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it, &amp; it&#x27;s lasting me awhile now!</li>
            <li> This large bottle works well.  The product was shipped quickly.  The only negative is that you use a lot since the opening is quite large compared to other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Works fine but I still like the Sally Hanson rapid dissolving cuticle gel better. This was more cost effective though.</li>
            <li> Very effective.  No sting.  Huge bottle.  Will order again in 5 years when I run out :)</li>
            <li> This works very well for me, although I get better results when I leave it on for five minutes instead of the 1-2 minutes suggested by the instructions. I generally just apply a small dab over the nail bed, wipe it off after five minutes, and then clean things up with a cuticle pusher. I&#x27;ve also noticed it removes stains on my nails left by dark polish, so sometimes I use it over the entire nail. If you can figure out a routine that works for you, and you&#x27;re reasonably skilled at applying polish, this pretty much eliminates the need to go to a salon.</li>
            <li> This is the cuticle remover that my salon uses and they always did a fantastic job. I&#x27;ve used drugstore brands in the past and CND just does a better over all job. It easily removed my tough cuticles with one application, no chemical smell and it was very gentle on my nails. The price isn&#x27;t more than two or three dollars than drugstore brands but it is definitely worth it, and with such a big bottle I probably won&#x27;t have to purchase again for at least a year.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after hearing Carla Marie&#x27;s What&#x27;s Trending segment on the Elvis Duran show.  She RAVED about it.  Well, I got it and didn&#x27;t see what the big deal was about it.  I couldn&#x27;t even tell if it was working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  The bottle is HUGE, so it will last you forever.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> finally i can make a good manicure for myself. bottle is big enough and price is very good. and i dont like when somebody do manicure to me? so this is perfect for to do this self. i reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Great product - gently removes cuticles, as promised.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my skin like some products.  I love the size of the bottle, which gives it great value.  My one gripe is that the opening sometimes allows for too much product to seep out but that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and, due to the size of the bottle, not expensive. Works great. I will recommend this cuticle remover to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> It works &amp; brightens too.</li>
            <li> I was beginning to panic - couldn&#x27;t find in local stores, used to get at my nail salon - but don&#x27;t have acrylics done anymore.  This product keeps your cuticles in great shape - and removes unwanted cuticles gently and safely.</li>
            <li> This works, it will melt your cuticles away with no effort.</li>
            <li> I have cuticles that very quickly grow down onto nail bed. I have better luck just soaking and softening than with this product. In fact, my over-the-counter Sally Hanson did a better job for me than this product.</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases that I have ever made and 100% worth the money spent. The cuticle away is a gel substance that you just put on the cuticle area, let it sit for a moment and you can just clip away. I use this every time I give myself a manicure. I find it best to clean the nails and shape them first. Then I like to soak them in some warm water with lemon and mineral oil. When that is done I apply this and after a moment or so, I push away the dead skin with a metal cuticle pusher. Then clipping the excess skin is easy as 1,2,3 :)</li>
            <li> A lot of product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Cuts my manicure time down by 5-7 mins.  No need for the cuticle nippers which I do not like using.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Followed directions, but did not work for me.  I left it on as long or a little longer thab they said, and used an orange stick, but no luck.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I cut the tip off and nothing came out so I cut it down a little more.  Well, I forgot that there may be a sealer between the bottle and cap, so now a large drop comes out.  I&#x27;m a bit leery of this product.  Would not buy again, needless to say.</li>
            <li> No results from this product.</li>
            <li> This bottle is enormous and inexpensive and the product works very well.  I usually leave it on for quite a bit longer than the instructions recommend, especially on my toe cuticles, and it has never been a problem.  It can be painful if you apply to broken skin.  Cuticles are dissolved and minimized, making at home manicures and pedicures easy and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Amazing! At first, I thought what a waste of money, BUT, then I let the solution sit on my nail, massage it into the skin and within a few minutes skin was falling off. LOVE IT. I use this in conjunction with CND Cuticle Eraser. This first and then Cuticle Eraser.</li>
            <li> This cuticle remover works great.  You really don&#x27;t have to use to much of it.  I use it in between manicures just to keep the cuticles clean and from getting out of control.  I expect that this bottle will last me a good while since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, meabe liquid soap is the same</li>
            <li> This works okay, I wouldn&#x27;t say the greatest for it is fine.  If you use this twice on each nail cuticle it works better, the bottle is a pretty good size so it should last a long time.  It does dry out your hands and nails alot so as soon as you do your nails use lotion on them.</li>
            <li> Great product does exactly what it says it does no complaints. Would highly recommend makes quick work for problem cuticles.</li>
            <li> To save some money, I&#x27;ve been doing my nails at home.  The thing I miss most about a professional manicure is the state of my cuticles.  I&#x27;ve tried trimming, pushing, grooming with other products, but my cuticles were still out of control.  This product is used at most salons, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  BINGO! It is what I was missing for professional results at home.  Just rub on and leave for about a minute. Push back the cuticles with an orange stick or, better yet, a cuticle pushing too.  I was amazed at the lose skin that came off, leaving a much cleaner base and smoother edge when I applied polish.  Minimal nipping with the cuticle trimmer was necessary to remove hang nails.  Another great CND product!</li>
            <li> This item works in just minutes and is not harsh on the skin at all.  It is a must have for everyone!</li>
            <li> I feel like it takes care of my cuticles.  Before using this product I never worried about my cuticles, but it was really easy.</li>
            <li> It works well, would recommend this to anyone who does their nails at home.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that well, but better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> After having a baby and not finding nearly as much time for the nail salon, I decided to try a cuticle solution.  Other reviewers noted that this product worked well so I gave it a try. I agree. The solution works well to assist with the removal of cuticles.  I ended up purchasing cuticle pushers and found that the solution with those tools gave me a great looking &amp;#34;manicure&amp;#34; without having to run to the salon.</li>
            <li> tHIS IS THE BEST CUTICLE REMOVER I HAVE TRIED AND GET THE BEST RESULTS OVE ALL.. PLEAS TRY IT AND WORTH MONEY.</li>
            <li> Not as good as stores brands</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle that&#x27;s easy to apply. I can&#x27;t tell if it really is amazing or not, but works okay for me. Maybe just the soaking of my fingers softens up the cuticle. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d repurchase.</li>
            <li> Creative Nail Cuticle Away worked so much better than I thought it would.  I&#x27;ve used other products in the past with varying results but this one worked as described.  Put it on, rubbed it in a little and then used a cuticle pusher to push back on the cuticle. I used it about a week ago and I have to say that my cuticles have not yet grown back... pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Love using the product!</li>
            <li> It is ok i guess. I used it only once as i just got it. I will give it another try but so far i was impressed.</li>
            <li> I had tried four or five other products before trying this and it works better than anything else I have used.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have always bought cuticle remover at Wal-Mart. This brand works quick. Will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I use this product at home &amp; then push back my cuticles before applying my Cnd Shellac polish.  Saves money from paying for manicures over time!</li>
            <li> I love this cuticle gel! It goes into your nails well and does help soften away the cuticle.</li>
            <li> Love it! I work in a salon and this is the exact product we use.</li>
            <li> It takes longer than a minute to soften my cuticles, but it works, for most of the dead skin will come off easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing on most things, not just fingernails.. It works on stubborn callous skin on the bottom of your feet (eww gross, I know)</li>
            <li> I have the worst cuticles in the world.  Upon my first use of this cuticle remover, my cuticles were about 90% better.  I can&#x27;t wait to try it the second time!</li>
            <li> The wife and I have both been using this, and it seems to be working well. We leave it on for about 2-3 minutes however. One minute does nothing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this removes excess cuticles. It leaves the base of my nail so clean looking and ready for polish. I&#x27;ll never clip my cuticles again.</li>
            <li> I liked this product...  it will last a very long time because it&#x27;s such a large bottle.  There is no odor and I have not noticed that it dries out my nails as other products tend to do.</li>
            <li> This product is a must-have for the manicure enthusiast. I soak my finger tips in a bowl of warm water for 2-3 minutes, apply this gentle product, and use a cuticle pusher to remove excess cuticles. Works like a charm. Despite using this product once a week, I expect this bottle to last me months. Salon quality. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Ok it took actually more than one min as advised to work but after  five min it did and a good job indeed</li>
            <li> It works good happy w the purchase</li>
            <li> A little watery, but does the job fine</li>
            <li> When I first began the CND Shellac process quite a few months ago, I had on hand several tubes of the Sally Hansen cuticle remover gel and wanted to use them up before purchasing this product exclusive to CND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I purchased this product and began using it.  I really cannot tell much of a difference between this and the Sally Hansen as far as use or effectiveness.  I think one does equally well.  However, this product comes in such a large bottle at such an economical price that this one will be the one I continue to use.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN SALLY HASSEN INSTANT CUTICLE REMOVER.  THIS IS PROFESSIONAL STYLE. I REALLY CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE MY NAILS DONE TOO FREQUENTLY.  NOW I CAN SAVE MY MONEY AND DO MY OWN NAILS.  LUV THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright product: it didn&#x27;t exactly do what I expected it to. I ended up giving it to a friend and just soaking my cuticles with vaseline for a few minutes, did a better job.</li>
            <li> Great product and no issues !! Look is feel great after</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product as well as the delivery time.. I have always had bad cuticles and now they are looking healthy and my nails are stronger...cheers</li>
            <li> Works much better than I had thought it would. In 1 minute it removes and looses the all the hardened skin from around the toes, no matter how tough the skin is. It works painless. Use the appropriate tools. It&#x27;s a gel, so it dosen&#x27;t even make a mess. I would never believe this product. It is great. I refuse to go in for a pedicure, but this product does the job fully.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not work. Followed all instructions. It did not do a thing. Do not waste your money. You will still need a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the perfect medium. It does soften and dissolve cuticles but it doesn&#x27;t sting or soften and dissolve nails.</li>
            <li> If you have no time to go to the nail salon and your cuticles are looking like they have seen better days, this is a great product to get those crusty looking cuticles. Just use some nail cuticle pushers with this, file the nails and you have instant beautiful manicured hands.</li>
            <li> I like the generous quantity of the product and it seems to do what it claims to do, so I do recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading a lot of reviews.  I like to garden and, even though I use leather gloves, my hands have never looked great.  I first used this over a week ago and it completely removed my dried, rough cuticles. And I only used my cuticle clipper for one small clip.  Best of all, my cuticles are still neat and soft 10 days later with no change to my regular routine (I often use a calendula ointlment before bed).  Buy this product and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I really do like this cuticle remover.  It works fairly easily.  I do not like that it stings just a little, but if you are more careful than I am when pushing back your cuticles, it works very well.  It lasts forever.  I do my nails once a week and I have had this product for a very long time (my guess is over 2 years so far) and I still have half of a bottle left.  If I ever run out, I will purchase it again.  It&#x27;s a great cuticle remover for both the professional nail artist (which is where I saw it the first time), as well as for the practice-at-home-wanna-be-professional-nail-artist!</li>
            <li> This product makes the mani and pedis quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;You see the cuticles come right off! It does the work for you.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it, and the size off the bottle can last you for awhile.</li>
            <li> It works. This size lasts a decent amount of time, and the price is fair. These are the kinds of products I LOVE!</li>
            <li> Love this product as it makes my cuticles &amp;#34;disappear.&amp;#34; You can&#x27;t beat the price for this large size and it is better than any other cuticle remover I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work that well for me, but it was alright.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s happy, and we&#x27;re pleased with the timely delivery.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the size of the product for the money. Removes cuticles quickly. Definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> One of the first times I&#x27;ve ordered something new like this and it really works!&lt;br /&gt;Love it! Recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  I like the fact that you get much more than the Sally Hansen product and it&#x27;s just as good if not better.  I have used the Sally Hansen in the past and it&#x27;s stronger and it works but you have to be careful to not leave it on too long.  You could go into a cuticle area that you don&#x27;t need to and injure the cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that creative nail is  a little gentler than the Sally Hansen version.  As I recall I left the sally Hansen on a little too long and it harmed my cuticles causing the nails to weaken forming painful hangnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&gt; Update 9/17/14&lt;br /&gt;  I have found that both products if left on too long and used incorrectly can cause damage to the nail and cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you follow the directions for either product and don&#x27;t leave it on too much longer than a minute, it should work fine.  For stubborn cuticle areas I reapplied it rather than leaving it on longer.  It works for me so far...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip... After the initial removing of old stubborn cuticles, I  did not need to use this more than once to twice a month.  I was using it weekly and my cuticles began to show signs of weakness and became sore to the touch, from removing to much of the cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;  Remember the cuticle serves a purpose and some cuticle is needed for protection.  If too much is removed you can get infected causing pain and very bad looking nails.:) For cuticle areas that grow back I recommend soaking your hands in a warm solution of water and olive oil. Then apply a nail cuticle cream or oil after.  I have found the key to healthy cuticles is too moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.  Try sleeping with a heavy cuticle cream and moisturize daily as well, especially after washing hands. Then, gently pushing cuticles back with a cuticle pusher, only as needed. Using the CND 1 to 2 times monthly thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I received a great tip from a women that had beautiful nails, she said she sometimes uses band aids after applying a cuticle oil, (she used argon), to seal in the moisture to the cuticle better.  I did this once only and have just been using a sandwich bag and gloves with my handmade cuticle oil and cream at night as the band aids can get expensive. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.. :)to seal in the moisture to the cuticle better.  I did this once only and have just been using a sandwich bag and gloves with my handmade cuticle oil and cream at night as the band aids can get expensive. :)    Hope this helps.. :)</li>
            <li> Just like all of the CN products, this is above and beyond the other cuticle removers. Just like most things, it&#x27;s important to follow the package instructions if one is not already trained in proper cuticle removal.</li>
            <li> Great product. I like it. I do not know if is needed, but i like it. The bottle is not too small.</li>
            <li> Sorry It&#x27;s my first time trying to get rid of cuticle by myself. Not a pro on this. But it works good on my fingers.</li>
            <li> This works better and faster than the Sally Hansen cuticle removing gel. It is a salon quality product.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to use product as of yet;but it has a great smell and I can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
            <li> I love CND products, and this is one of my favorites. This cuticle gel is a terrific value for the price, and the bottle is well-designed, clean, and easy to use. It works in a few seconds and is not harsh on the skin. I apply a drop to each nail and spread along the cuticle. I leave on for approximately a minute, and I am able to gently push back any excess/dead skin very easily with a stainless steel cuticle pusher and wash away. I have been using this for months and I have barely made a dent in the bottle - love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product just melted the cuticle away quickly.  Made removal of the skin easier and my nails looked like I had been to a professional for a manicure.</li>
            <li> Works well, nice scent....</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> This remover does a great job - I&#x27;ve saved a lot of money with my at home manicures. I&#x27;ve never tried any other product, and at this point, I&#x27;m not sure if I would want to!</li>
            <li> The product is very gentle and without any smell. And it didn&#x27;t cause any uncomfortable. But it just soften my cuticle ....not remove it.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job! Will order next time.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions exactly as the bottle said and the results were no different than just soaking my hands in water for a little while.  Very disappointed.  Could have gotten this product for free out of my tap.</li>
            <li> Wipes product away instantly!</li>
            <li> I have very tight cuticles n have a very difficult time in pushing the back and keeping them soft. This stuff is really amazing and I hope they keep making it.</li>
            <li> Works perfect - the best cuticle softener I have ever used. It is quite large, but will last a really long time. Makes nail polish application much easier at the base of the cuticles.</li>
            <li> I used to remove cuticle by cutting them off and in couple days they looked ugly. This product softens cuticles, removes dead skin, it makes easy to push back cuticles and no need to cut them off. +use any conditioning oil after removing the product by warm water and voi la you&#x27;ve got nice, clean and attractive nails. Makes more easy to control cuticles when used twice a week.</li>
            <li> the product is suppose to help with the removal of the cuticle. i personal dont think it worked that well. but I didnt go to nail school so maybe it does exactly what its suppose to and I just am unaware.</li>
            <li> I liked this cuticle remover, works great on my cuticles and makes my nails and hands smooth and clean.  Get tons of compliments on both.</li>
            <li> Not as good as some reviews have said. it is just normal!!</li>
            <li> This did not work for me.  Nothing else to say.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t do anything when I applied it to my cuticles. I am not sure how the product is supposed to work, I thought it was supposed to actually remove dead skin but it had no effect when I used it.</li>
            <li> Nail cuticle away is good. You can buy a cvs brand though Sally Hansen and get the same effect.</li>
            <li> I used this product exactly as directed, but it didn&#x27;t work for me, and gives me hangnails after using.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL CUTICLE REMOVER!  I HAVE BEEN E NAIL TECHNICIAN FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND USED MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS...THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Although the size of the bottle is more than I really needed (just for my use only) the product does remove dead cuticle skin and the surrounding area.  Great find at a great price.</li>
            <li> This product is great! After keeping it on for one minute use a cuticle pusher and your cuticles will look like you got a professional manicure. I&#x27;ve been doing my nails myself and my cuticles were the only thing that did not look like the salon. Not anymore! Will be using for a long time, especially since the size is great!</li>
            <li> I really love this cuticle remover.  So far it&#x27;s been working great.  I let it sit on the cuticles for a minute and then scrape them off and my nails look great.</li>
            <li> Works well.&lt;br /&gt;Nice size bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Wish i had two of them.&lt;br /&gt;One for me and one for daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays everyone!</li>
