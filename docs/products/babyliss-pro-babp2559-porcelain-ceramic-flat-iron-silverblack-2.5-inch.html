            <li>Its the perfect size for someone with medium to full hair.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this straightener.</li>
            <li>For the price, I am so very pleased iwth my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many flatirons and have never been happy.</li>
            <li>I used the MaxiGlide for many years but decided to give this one a try because of the lower price and great reviews.  </li>
            <li>I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It straightens beautifully and easily</li>
            <li>VERY HOT!!!  </li>
            <li>I really love this flat-iron!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this hair straightener!</li>
            <li>and it works amazing.</li>
            <li>It has worked amazing for me.</li>
            <li>Gives hair great shine and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is spectacular a must buy.</li>
            <li>Also, the estimated delivery was acurate and the straightener came nicely packed.</li>
            <li>so this brand wasn&#x27;t a go for me although I liked the look and feel of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my hair stayed straight all day; I was very very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>But for my own fine/thin strands, there is just no way this iron could get the job done.</li>
            <li>You will not need any additional straightening or shining serums of any kind.</li>
            <li>excellent product works very well in Venezuela</li>
            <li>Very happy with purchase, highly recommend this, I just hope it lasts a while.</li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments on how healthy my hair is and how good it looks from using this iron.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job ironing my hair quickly</li>
            <li>This is the best straightener on the market by far!</li>
            <li>So far my experience with this product has been wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have always bought store brand and have even tried a friend&#x27;s CHI, but this one was by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>I am happy with the sender, product arrived on time and it was exactly what I had ordered.</li>
            <li>Works fine for me!</li>
            <li>the plates are large, i would not recommend it for those with shorter hair because it is not that great for detailing&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was super excited, it did a great job of straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks glossy and healthy after using it.</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED MANY</li>
            <li>Quality product and phenomenal results.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but i think its  better to have someone iron your hair for you</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I bought this two years ago, and while it&#x27;s held up great, and is a good product, I was considering buying one just to set aside for the future when this eventually craps</li>
            <li>I love my Babyliss...</li>
            <li>) babyliss is a top brand in hair tools...like everyone here</li>
            <li>I think this iron works better than the  chi</li>
            <li>Love it love</li>
            <li>and she says this one is WAAAY better</li>
            <li>Great communication, fast shipment, etc.   </li>
            <li>For the price I paid, the product more than met my expectations.      </li>
            <li>I do not use the highest heat setting, but I am still able to get sleek, shiny hair.       </li>
            <li>She comes to the office all days like a Queen now :)  </li>
            <li>can straighten the top and sides in about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I was completely pleased with.</li>
            <li>I love when items ship quicker than estimated.</li>
            <li>My hair never looked better.</li>
            <li>To be safe I unplug it after I am done.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Babyliss!!  :)</li>
            <li>I love that it has heat control settings.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>i love this iron.</li>
            <li>I could not ask for a better product.</li>
            <li>-Love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the switch to a 2 &amp;1/2 in iron.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t straighten my hair often, maybe once a week at the most</li>
            <li>Love this iron.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>With this iron it is So much faster and looks great.</li>
            <li>Oh well, it&#x27;s probably the user not the machine :)</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and very efficient.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY products, but even after using this (or any iron)</li>
            <li>It works ok...</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE ABOUT TO</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Two thumbs up!  :)</li>
            <li>it is the best flat iron around.</li>
            <li>This the best flat iron on the market.</li>
            <li>This is the best line of Flat irons.</li>
            <li>My stylist and I were puzzled for atleast a year, she looked at this flat iron and said she thought it was a good brand, so I kept using it (and kept having to get my hair chopped every 2 months!!!)</li>
            <li>Excellent flat iron.  </li>
            <li>(found it by Googling \\&quot;best flat iron\\&quot;)!</li>
            <li>The best flat iron you can buy at this or any price!  </li>
            <li>My wife has been very pleased with it, and I was happy to get a quality product that will hopefully last awhile.</li>
            <li>But, this iron works quickly and effectively and you won&#x27;t have to pass it through your hair several times to get wonderful results.</li>
            <li>Works great so far!!</li>
            <li>I strongly encourage anyone who has an experience like mine to make sure they put it in writing as I did</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things to use on my hair, its easy to use and works on almost any hair type.</li>
            <li>It left my hair silky smooth and looking great!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how straight and shiny my hair looks now!!!    </li>
            <li>It gets very hot and leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super quick at straightening the hair yet costs lower than the high dollar ones that claim to be the best.</li>
            <li>Porcelain ceramic gives a smooth, healthy silky shine.</li>
            <li>but I am happy so far.</li>
            <li>Using it at this temperature my hair has stayed healthy, no fried ends, and it stays smooth after styling.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for your good service.</li>
            <li>the money.shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li>The porcelain really flattens your hair nicely and the temperature control allows any hair type to be able to use this iron without damaging your hair.  </li>
            <li>and it works as good as new.</li>
            <li>I purchased this about 3 weeks ago and it&#x27;s been working fine till now.</li>
            <li>It always leaves my hair flawless and noticeably shinier and it takes much less time to do my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this product as a gift for my wife for mothers day and so far she is very pleased and satisfied.</li>
            <li>this is a very good flat iron and I was very happy with the results this product gave me ,the only thing that I did not like was that the temp on the iron I couldn&#x27;t see if the temp was to high</li>
            <li>My hair is really resistant and frizzy, so having the higher temperature options is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time trying others this is the best!</li>
            <li>I have used cheap brands bought at Target and/or Walmart that do not work that well before</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light weight and not bulky...</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>it was a great purchase back then.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-large plates are great for saving time and covering larger amounts of hair</li>
            <li>my hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and glides over hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>This iron is amazing at flattening out all the issues and makes my hair perfectly  straight.  </li>
            <li>and if you can get one get it worth every penny, but you probably won&#x27;t find one as cheap as I did. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The temperature control is great and it heats up and cools down VERY quickly!</li>
            <li>I have purchased many different high-end, highly-priced flat irons, and Babyliss Pro BABP2559 has delievered the most impressive results.</li>
            <li>fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks you again!!!</li>
            <li>With the use of Babyliss Pro BABP2559 2.5 inch plate flat iron, I am able to have beautiful, silky smooth, straight hair without damage to my hair or my pocket.     </li>
            <li>i love the way my hair feels its just that combing takes time and sometimes hurts and after a while my hair gets puffy and very very curly...</li>
            <li>It had good grip and was easy to straighten my hair since it was big.</li>
            <li>The straightener works great for my long curly hair.   </li>
            <li>My wife has purchased a Babyliss Flatiron twice in the past and it seems to be the best brand for straightening her hair without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived in a timely manner, and I was excited.</li>
            <li>it gets real hot</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my new flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several and this its baby far the best.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best flat iron I have ever bought .</li>
            <li>This is by far the best flat iron I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>so i suggest buying a glove of some sort other than that its a perfect buy for anyone wanting to het that straight look for your hair.</li>
            <li>I like the cool to the touch outer plates as well.</li>
            <li>Heavy, but does an incredible job of creating sleek runway hair.</li>
            <li>Along with her kids came 3 heads full of lice...reoccurring and reoccurring.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m used to full body hair.</li>
            <li>so I hope thats not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>IT IS A GOOD FLAT IRON THAT I MAY HAVE TO ANOTHER OF JUST AS</li>
            <li>Got our order quickly within a week after purchasing.</li>
            <li>A quick look at my picture tells you...</li>
            <li>She says it heats up quickly and does save her lots of time because of the width.</li>
            <li>It also shipped quicker than quick.</li>
            <li>It makes it smooth and light and straight</li>
            <li>It makes the process reasonably quick.</li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t listen and it melted my beautiful little comb...     </li>
            <li>It does get VERY HOT and of course because it is 2 1/2 inches</li>
            <li>-Design of this flat iron makes it more stable on a counter top</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for smooth, silky, board straight hair with no fly-a-ways this is your iron!</li>
            <li>I choose this for the size of the plates as i have long hair and also for the good reviews given by you guys.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning it and buying a new one, since I was pleased with the way it worked, and am hoping that the one I got was just defective.  </li>
            <li>A great bargain when compared to the CHI at half the cost.</li>
            <li>I have tried out soooo many flat irons over this years, and this one by far is the best you can get, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very effective and inexpensive ( well not as expensive as the Chi&#x27;s and the FHI&#x27;s) product and it looks more expensive than it costs and more importantly does a superb job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth $90 and Amazon sells for so much less, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I have curly long hair and this flat iron works great for me!  </li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair straight, silky and light.  </li>
            <li>it worth $40 and change?</li>
            <li>I had a Sedu flat iron before and this product is much better!</li>
            <li>My stylist indicated that this is more of a professional grade product.  </li>
            <li>(particularly useful while traveling)</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and it straightens my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had the older version of this product which I really loved, so I wanted nothing else but the same thing.</li>
            <li>So I need a flat iron that can do the job on its own and this one does the job.  </li>
            <li>irons my hair super fast and gets very hot.</li>
            <li>Something i want to notice is about the on/off button; it doesn&#x27;t turn on right away after i click it, besides if you use an extension you must unplugged everything and turn off all appliances of your room to see if it will on.</li>
            <li>I plugged it up right away and tried it out.</li>
            <li>I been used this flat iron for 9 years , is the best, I&#x27;m hair stylist i can do hairs faster than other</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem with the iron and count on it for beautiful sleek results on my extra coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I   would highly recommend this item to anyone who is trying to reduce straightening   time while still maintaining smooth and shiny hair..</li>
            <li>It straighten and can give a nice bump to long hair.</li>
            <li>Very wide plates at 2.5 inch straightens the hair MUCH faster because it is able to hold more hair.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair and this make my hair pin straight</li>
            <li>I have extremly curly hair, i turned it on the hottest setting (450) and instead of having to go through hours of trying to get what was in the end only wavy hair, it only took me about 30 to 40 minutes, which is great for hair like mine.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, has heat settings up to 450 degrees (and the buttons aren&#x27;t located on the side where you can accidentally change temps without knowing), and makes my hair stick straight in minutes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s porcelain plates glides over ones hair effortlessly and it made my hair super straight, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>AND IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SUPER DUPER STRAIGHT.</li>
            <li>I agree with the reviews that the 2 1/2 inches is perfect for medium to long hair, takes less time.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast, with is a bonus for me because having 3 kids I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on putting myself together.</li>
            <li>heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>It still worked great but was larger and heavier than the flat irons they make now</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li>very fast and stays hot</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>but it seemed to get extremely hot to the point that it started melting the plastic (or whatever material that is) that holds the plates in place.</li>
            <li>you can get through more hair faster and not have to continually go over the same hair because it does get so hot.</li>
            <li>she can blow that hot steam away.      </li>
            <li>i look like i got a big cotton on top of my head  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>But I figured babybliss is a well known brand, and I&#x27;d most likely hae no problems.</li>
            <li>and it never failed me</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>the handle does get hot but not to the point of burning your hand.</li>
            <li>The temperature sets up to 450 which it is more than enough</li>
            <li>BUT with this tool my hair stayed straight all day!</li>
            <li>product:&lt;br /&gt;-gets hot</li>
            <li>Okay, so last year I let my friend and her 3 kids move in with us for a while.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my first Babyliss at the recommendation of my hairdresser friend.</li>
            <li>This iron didnot only leave my   hair healthy looking and shiny,but it also reduced the time I use to spend   straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>You can go out in the rain and Texas humidity and it will stay straight!</li>
            <li>This is the first 2.5 inch straightener that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Works like a charm and gets really hot...</li>
            <li>it gose up to 450 and get really hot.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews about it getting so hot</li>
            <li>and it was shiny without being greasy looking and it stayed straight until I washed it, no bedtime kinks!  </li>
            <li>it had melting plastic seeping out all sides of the hot iron ....</li>
            <li>Great hair straightener for thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Like many on here, I&#x27;m comparing this flat iron to my 2\\&quot; Chi that I finally dropped one too many times.</li>
            <li>This is the widest flat iron I have ever purchased and it works great on my long hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Ive never been more satisifed with a flat iron than this one.</li>
            <li>DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND IN NEW CONDITION.</li>
            <li>i read all the reviews and waited days before finally buying this one...and it was working just perfect for at least two  months...</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have ever been able to use that keeps my hair straight &amp; with out frizz.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty large also.</li>
            <li>Then, I came across this hair thing, and after seeing the positive reviews, we ordered it.</li>
            <li>It works so fast and it makes my hair look so pretty as though it was salon styled.  </li>
            <li>It also got hot really fast.</li>
            <li>was good but was just too small).  </li>
            <li>These flat irons are perfect for my long hair which takes over an hour to flat iron.</li>
            <li>and back with me, and is still kicking strong.</li>
            <li>A year later the iron is still going strong.</li>
            <li>so I was nervous but purchased it because of the large plate size</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth and my first day back in the office after using someone said your hair looks longer and really straight.  </li>
            <li>Just one thing to be careful make sure you pick the right temperature setting on the dial for your grade of hair because you could burn your hair if the setting is 2 high.</li>
            <li>Coarse to thin/ fine hair.</li>
            <li>OVERALL, I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED WITH MY FLAT IRON.</li>
            <li>Size is two large to really style your hair with.</li>
            <li>its very quick..heats up fast and will be ready in a minute..</li>
            <li>this straight.  </li>
            <li>i recomend it highly!</li>
            <li>Hence, no tired arms.  </li>
            <li>It does the job soooo fast.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine/thin hair</li>
            <li>it gives my hair a \\&quot;body\\&quot;, rather than just it being straight...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a flat-iron before, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare this one to...</li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hispanic hair.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive compared to others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>i hope i was helpful, because you guys were very helpful to me</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>It was actually much cheaper than the lower-rated one she was dying to have.</li>
            <li>I love the wide plates as it makes straightening your hair quicker.</li>
            <li>It really leaves my hair really straight.</li>
            <li>and it made me very self-conscious about myself.  </li>
            <li>was pin straight within 30-45 mins of use.  </li>
            <li>It leaves it shiny and straight with no effort and it lasts through the whole day.</li>
            <li>I have curly wavy hair so getting my hair to go straight was doable</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but I have to recommend this Iron to everyone that wants to straighten thier hair.</li>
            <li>I was hoping I could count on these reviews since this iron is very low-priced.</li>
            <li>Chi fast but still fast)  </li>
            <li>I decided I needed to find a solution fast inorder to reduce   the straightening time, so I bought this iron..</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s so wide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone two days with utterly straight hair without the need for touch ups.</li>
            <li>When I straighten my hair with this iron it is board straight.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind straight hair with some fullness to it.</li>
            <li>However if I reduce the heat setting my hair does not get completely straight.</li>
            <li>And is very durable...</li>
            <li>taking lot of time to finish whole hair..</li>
            <li>(Although I admit I don&#x27;t use it much since all heat does damage).  </li>
            <li>I WANT THE WHOLE COLLECTION</li>
            <li>and i dont straighten much</li>
            <li>Its very Efficient and helps me get through my hair in no time!&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>but the few times i have  used it was really nice.</li>
            <li>The first one still works, but I wanted a new one since it&#x27;s days might be numbered, but who knows?  </li>
            <li>and it straightened my long, curly hair very quickly</li>
            <li>The shine that it gives me makes me glad my old flat iron broke.</li>
            <li>The plates of the iron do not touch together to give your hair that super straight finish, but if used along with a flat iron that has smaller plates, it works great in helping to straighten out super thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Gets super hot, super fast and cuts the time I used to spend straightening my hair in half.</li>
            <li>The product does indeed get hot and touching your hair can give a little sting</li>
            <li>It does a great job of straightening my hair, but when i FIRST plugged it in, it started making a weird rattling/ticking noise and makes it the whole time the device is plugged in.</li>
            <li>Sometimes my hair tangles even after I comb it, and other straighteners I have owned with a comb have made it look more sleek after straightening.  </li>
            <li>Ater reading all the reviews, I was excited to finaly buy a flat iron that worked for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>After I used it a couple of times it was great but the third time I used it on my niece&#x27;s hair, when I was finishing it burned a small piece of hair off and the plates melted.</li>
            <li>when i set it to the highest setting my hair gets veryyy flat and smooth which is not something i particularly like nor find flattering on ME)&lt;br</li>
            <li>careful when ironing the ends of your hair (this iron is super powerful</li>
            <li>I then used the babyliss pro  1 inch flat iron to reach my hair roots   that I couldn&#x27;t reach with the bigger flat iron, and I had an amazing result!</li>
            <li>one problem for the 400F-450F do not comb until the hair is cool (they actually said that)</li>
            <li>Was looking for an affordable and effective flat iron that was wide and light enough to straighten my 16-18inch hair and this was what the doctor ordered.     </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this flat iron...</li>
            <li>It is very easy and fast to use.tries others in the past did come close.</li>
            <li>I can feel the difference between the two when I flat iron my hair - this one has a more professional feel and professional results.</li>
            <li>After spending half of the evening at the brick &amp; mortar stores looking for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; hair thing, I decided to check out the Amazon reviews to see if there was a better way to figure out which hair thing wouldn&#x27;t break after a year.</li>
            <li>I was replacing an older version of a Babyliss Iron I bought years ago for over $100.  </li>
            <li>older eyes can&#x27;t see it the temp...</li>
            <li>This heats up fast and hot, and I love my other baby bliss (blue one)</li>
            <li>my hair very soft and shiny after i am done straightening  it!</li>
            <li>It gets super hot so be careful.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s had other straightners, but by far, this is her favorite.  </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant at first with this product because of the cheap price.  </li>
            <li>and so when i get near the end of my hair i like to curve the iron so that the ends are not stick straight nor blunt and unnatural looking)</li>
            <li>We both have lots of hair- wavy waist length hair that normally takes forever to straighten.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li>Holds straightness for longer then normal.</li>
            <li>It helps speed up the normal process of straightening.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and kind of thick</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard some people say that straightening irons need to be kept flat when not in use, to not wrap the cord around the body, etc, but I have pretty much given this a severe beating since day 1 and have had no</li>
            <li>The reviews were spot on, it works great, heats up in a split second and can tame my very wavy hair after sleeping with it wet overnight.  </li>
            <li>live the hair shine and smoth</li>
            <li>so I decided to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>Will review again once I&#x27;ve had the new one for a while.</li>
            <li>She loves this new iron.</li>
            <li>Now, I have a new straightener</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing for the price especially, it cut my hair time down to thirty or forty minutes tops!</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Interesting thing is that the RED LIGHT indicator lights up red after straightener has warmed up for a bit.</li>
            <li>I have bought 3 different brand   high end flat iron, paying as much as $200.00 for a flat iron, in search for one   that would provide with amazing results and short amount of time straightening   my hair..</li>
            <li>This product tames our hair to a lovely sleek manageable texture in no more than 10 minutes...</li>
            <li>same exact one I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Anyone have any thoughts or experience the same noise upon first use of this product?</li>
            <li>But, it does get hot on the outside as well.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted 6 years with almost daily use.  </li>
            <li>One note: I have fine hair so I can&#x27;t speak for how it works on thick hair or on the higher settings.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot, works quickly for those with thick hair.</li>
            <li>9 years ago I bought this same model of flat iron, back in the day it cost more</li>
            <li>THIS FLAT IRON IS PERFECT,IT GETS HEATED VERY FAST</li>
            <li>I used the straightener for the first time on freshly washed, air dried hair with a smidgen of heat protestant serum at 375 degrees.  </li>
            <li>The heat does not dry my hair and my hair looks shinny and straight as I like it.</li>
            <li>I am ok with this product but the only compliant is ,i&#x27;m not able to straighten large sections of hair ...</li>
            <li>When I first got this flat iron</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had mine for years and was lucky enough to spot it at marshalls for $20.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I had problems with it right away, but within 4 months I started noticing my hair was getting extremely dry and fried at the ends.  </li>
            <li>1-1/4inch flat irons take forever to smooth out long tresses.</li>
            <li>THIS BY FAR OUTWEIGHS THEM ALL.  </li>
            <li>Even at the highest temp my daughters hair still looks soft and not fried.</li>
            <li>I have had my BabylissPro since I was 18 years old...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s old.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the old model but decided to purchase this model based on user&#x27;s reviews.  </li>
            <li>Since I like to have both curly and straight hair, I do not use this daily.  </li>
            <li>This is coming from a Professional stylist that likes to share product/tool knowledge .</li>
            <li>This is a miracle for me because I have chemical sensitivies and can&#x27;t use any hair products near my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I SO missed having straight, silky hair - and this one gave it back to me!  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>(now it takes me 15-20 min to straighten) and give results that would last for more than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was able to straighten all of my thick, almost-elbow-length hair in about 10 minutes, and my daughter&#x27;s waist-length hair in about five.  </li>
            <li>I have thick wavey shoulder length hair &amp; was able to straighten my hair in under 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>flat iron is ama zing takes half thr time to flat iron your hair leaving it silky smooth worth the price</li>
            <li>Straight, flat, and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m half Spanish and have what you consider that thick coarse curly hair but with this product my hair comes out nice and straight!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t connect it with this flat iron right away, in fact it took me over a year to finally be convinced it was the straightener, because my daughter used it as well</li>
            <li>I bought this product mainly based on reviews from my teenage nieces and the reviews posted on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I owned a Babyliss iron, same model but an older version</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with coarse and frizzy hair since high school</li>
            <li>Since I have long hair I decided to purchase this product and it really works just like my Chi brand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this flat iron for several years now and first learned of it when my stylist used the brand on my hair.</li>
            <li>Doesnt get as hot as I expected.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this model I bought a Revlon Wet to Straight 2 inch (cost about $30, was okay but took forever to straighten my thick hair) and a Chi 1.5 inch (was recommended by my hair stylist, cost $80,</li>
            <li>so it was only the new hair that i had my sis ironed for me...</li>
            <li>It straightens fast and you don&#x27;t have to go over the same area several times like the Chi.</li>
            <li>Has extra wide irons heats quickly very much worth</li>
            <li>I did note other&#x27;s issues that the handle gets hot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The major con to this is it works too well.....</li>
            <li>Got my hair cut too short and couldn&#x27;t use the flat iron very well.</li>
            <li>I have fairly fine textured hair, but it&#x27;s thick.  </li>
            <li>So after I decided I needed a new flat iron, I definitlly knew I would buy a babyliss product, but was thinking about upgrading it to the babyliss nano.</li>
            <li>i got a very thick hair though :)</li>
            <li>If you are buying it for a young person it works well enough.</li>
            <li>i had to get professional help to get back on track.  </li>
            <li>This baby has wide plates making flattening fast.  </li>
            <li>With CHI, my hair instantly turned into a complete frizz against the GA heat.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is true, but she said this product can be too harsh for daily use for some hair textures.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and gets hot so I can straighten my thick hair in minutes.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, I ordered my own, just received it 3 days ago</li>
            <li>I love the larger size plates for initially straightening out the thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I had an older flat iron by the same manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>After checking almost every possible cause for my fried hair I finally decided to purchase a new straightener</li>
            <li>Significantly less damaging than my last straightener, this one was definitely worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>I can see how it would straighten thick, coarse hair just fine.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why does that happens or is it just an isolated case as the instructions says that it must be connected direct to power supply, uhmm i&#x27;m just a little coward for that.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble adapting to the size of the flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have waisted 4 yrs of my natural hair life buying popular/expensive flat irons, straightening serums.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used it only once, but that&#x27;s enough to prove itself!</li>
            <li>Also, The iron works really well with hair extensions( silky, wet and wavy and body waves) and all types of coarse hair.     </li>
            <li>because when I initially called they simply said \\&quot;oh, do u want a replacement\\&quot; like it was normal for a flat iron to smoke and the plates to melt.</li>
            <li>I have very thick wavy hair (2b hair type) that needs to be flat ironed on the top and sides or I resemble a clown.  </li>
            <li>Hope it lasts as long as my old iron.</li>
            <li>One pass down each section of hair is all is needed to get the job done and the width makes that pass go much faster.  </li>
            <li>My usual setting is 350-375 and that seems to be just right without burning my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used so much sparys &amp; shampoos &amp; other name brand flat iron</li>
            <li>I have super curly, thick hair (think Diana Ross) and not only does this iron leave my hair bone straight and shiny, but it cut my ironing time from an hour and a half to 45 mins</li>
            <li>It takes about 20 minutes for me to flat iron all of my hair with barely any touch ups for about two days.</li>
            <li>The rest of their length was left open by at least a full centimeter.</li>
            <li>A little on the heavy side to hold, yet it is great for my thick hair and straightening my hair (10 minutes) in half the time my old iron took!</li>
            <li>The person needs to KNOW that people with thin or fine hair should use a tension comb to guide the hair while ironing it.</li>

            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Its the perfect size for someone with medium to full hair.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this straightener.</li>
            <li> For the price, I am so very pleased iwth my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many flatirons and have never been happy.</li>
            <li> I used the MaxiGlide for many years but decided to give this one a try because of the lower price and great reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It straightens beautifully and easily</li>
            <li> VERY HOT!!!  </li>
            <li> I really love this flat-iron!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair straightener!</li>
            <li> and it works amazing.</li>
            <li> It has worked amazing for me.</li>
            <li> Gives hair great shine and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is spectacular a must buy.</li>
            <li> Also, the estimated delivery was acurate and the straightener came nicely packed.</li>
            <li> so this brand wasn&#x27;t a go for me although I liked the look and feel of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hair stayed straight all day; I was very very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> But for my own fine/thin strands, there is just no way this iron could get the job done.</li>
            <li> You will not need any additional straightening or shining serums of any kind.</li>
            <li> excellent product works very well in Venezuela</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase, highly recommend this, I just hope it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I have had so many compliments on how healthy my hair is and how good it looks from using this iron.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job ironing my hair quickly</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener on the market by far!</li>
            <li> So far my experience with this product has been wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have always bought store brand and have even tried a friend&#x27;s CHI, but this one was by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the sender, product arrived on time and it was exactly what I had ordered.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me!</li>
            <li> the plates are large, i would not recommend it for those with shorter hair because it is not that great for detailing&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was super excited, it did a great job of straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks glossy and healthy after using it.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED MANY</li>
            <li> Quality product and phenomenal results.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but i think its  better to have someone iron your hair for you</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I bought this two years ago, and while it&#x27;s held up great, and is a good product, I was considering buying one just to set aside for the future when this eventually craps</li>
            <li> I love my Babyliss...</li>
            <li> ) babyliss is a top brand in hair tools...like everyone here</li>
            <li> I think this iron works better than the  chi</li>
            <li> Love it love</li>
            <li> and she says this one is WAAAY better</li>
            <li> Great communication, fast shipment, etc.   </li>
            <li> For the price I paid, the product more than met my expectations.      </li>
            <li> I do not use the highest heat setting, but I am still able to get sleek, shiny hair.       </li>
            <li> She comes to the office all days like a Queen now :)  </li>
            <li> can straighten the top and sides in about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I was completely pleased with.</li>
            <li> I love when items ship quicker than estimated.</li>
            <li> My hair never looked better.</li>
            <li> To be safe I unplug it after I am done.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Babyliss!!  :)</li>
            <li> I love that it has heat control settings.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> i love this iron.</li>
            <li> I could not ask for a better product.</li>
            <li> -Love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made the switch to a 2 &amp;1/2 in iron.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straighten my hair often, maybe once a week at the most</li>
            <li> Love this iron.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> With this iron it is So much faster and looks great.</li>
            <li> Oh well, it&#x27;s probably the user not the machine :)</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and very efficient.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY products, but even after using this (or any iron)</li>
            <li> It works ok...</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE ABOUT TO</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Two thumbs up!  :)</li>
            <li> it is the best flat iron around.</li>
            <li> This the best flat iron on the market.</li>
            <li> This is the best line of Flat irons.</li>
            <li> My stylist and I were puzzled for atleast a year, she looked at this flat iron and said she thought it was a good brand, so I kept using it (and kept having to get my hair chopped every 2 months!!!)</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron.  </li>
            <li> (found it by Googling \\&quot;best flat iron\\&quot;)!</li>
            <li> The best flat iron you can buy at this or any price!  </li>
            <li> My wife has been very pleased with it, and I was happy to get a quality product that will hopefully last awhile.</li>
            <li> But, this iron works quickly and effectively and you won&#x27;t have to pass it through your hair several times to get wonderful results.</li>
            <li> Works great so far!!</li>
            <li> I strongly encourage anyone who has an experience like mine to make sure they put it in writing as I did</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things to use on my hair, its easy to use and works on almost any hair type.</li>
            <li> It left my hair silky smooth and looking great!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how straight and shiny my hair looks now!!!    </li>
            <li> It gets very hot and leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super quick at straightening the hair yet costs lower than the high dollar ones that claim to be the best.</li>
            <li> Porcelain ceramic gives a smooth, healthy silky shine.</li>
            <li> but I am happy so far.</li>
            <li> Using it at this temperature my hair has stayed healthy, no fried ends, and it stays smooth after styling.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for your good service.</li>
            <li> the money.shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li> The porcelain really flattens your hair nicely and the temperature control allows any hair type to be able to use this iron without damaging your hair.  </li>
            <li> and it works as good as new.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 3 weeks ago and it&#x27;s been working fine till now.</li>
            <li> It always leaves my hair flawless and noticeably shinier and it takes much less time to do my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a gift for my wife for mothers day and so far she is very pleased and satisfied.</li>
            <li> this is a very good flat iron and I was very happy with the results this product gave me ,the only thing that I did not like was that the temp on the iron I couldn&#x27;t see if the temp was to high</li>
            <li> My hair is really resistant and frizzy, so having the higher temperature options is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time trying others this is the best!</li>
            <li> I have used cheap brands bought at Target and/or Walmart that do not work that well before</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also light weight and not bulky...</li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> it was a great purchase back then.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-large plates are great for saving time and covering larger amounts of hair</li>
            <li> my hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and glides over hair nicely.  </li>
            <li> This iron is amazing at flattening out all the issues and makes my hair perfectly  straight.  </li>
            <li> and if you can get one get it worth every penny, but you probably won&#x27;t find one as cheap as I did. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The temperature control is great and it heats up and cools down VERY quickly!</li>
            <li> I have purchased many different high-end, highly-priced flat irons, and Babyliss Pro BABP2559 has delievered the most impressive results.</li>
            <li> fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks you again!!!</li>
            <li> With the use of Babyliss Pro BABP2559 2.5 inch plate flat iron, I am able to have beautiful, silky smooth, straight hair without damage to my hair or my pocket.     </li>
            <li> i love the way my hair feels its just that combing takes time and sometimes hurts and after a while my hair gets puffy and very very curly...</li>
            <li> It had good grip and was easy to straighten my hair since it was big.</li>
            <li> The straightener works great for my long curly hair.   </li>
            <li> My wife has purchased a Babyliss Flatiron twice in the past and it seems to be the best brand for straightening her hair without drying it out.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived in a timely manner, and I was excited.</li>
            <li> it gets real hot</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several and this its baby far the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have ever bought .</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> so i suggest buying a glove of some sort other than that its a perfect buy for anyone wanting to het that straight look for your hair.</li>
            <li> I like the cool to the touch outer plates as well.</li>
            <li> Heavy, but does an incredible job of creating sleek runway hair.</li>
            <li> Along with her kids came 3 heads full of lice...reoccurring and reoccurring.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m used to full body hair.</li>
            <li> so I hope thats not a bad thing.</li>
            <li> IT IS A GOOD FLAT IRON THAT I MAY HAVE TO ANOTHER OF JUST AS</li>
            <li> Got our order quickly within a week after purchasing.</li>
            <li> A quick look at my picture tells you...</li>
            <li> She says it heats up quickly and does save her lots of time because of the width.</li>
            <li> It also shipped quicker than quick.</li>
            <li> It makes it smooth and light and straight</li>
            <li> It makes the process reasonably quick.</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t listen and it melted my beautiful little comb...     </li>
            <li> It does get VERY HOT and of course because it is 2 1/2 inches</li>
            <li> -Design of this flat iron makes it more stable on a counter top</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for smooth, silky, board straight hair with no fly-a-ways this is your iron!</li>
            <li> I choose this for the size of the plates as i have long hair and also for the good reviews given by you guys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning it and buying a new one, since I was pleased with the way it worked, and am hoping that the one I got was just defective.  </li>
            <li> A great bargain when compared to the CHI at half the cost.</li>
            <li> I have tried out soooo many flat irons over this years, and this one by far is the best you can get, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very effective and inexpensive ( well not as expensive as the Chi&#x27;s and the FHI&#x27;s) product and it looks more expensive than it costs and more importantly does a superb job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth $90 and Amazon sells for so much less, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have curly long hair and this flat iron works great for me!  </li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair straight, silky and light.  </li>
            <li> it worth $40 and change?</li>
            <li> I had a Sedu flat iron before and this product is much better!</li>
            <li> My stylist indicated that this is more of a professional grade product.  </li>
            <li> (particularly useful while traveling)</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and it straightens my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had the older version of this product which I really loved, so I wanted nothing else but the same thing.</li>
            <li> So I need a flat iron that can do the job on its own and this one does the job.  </li>
            <li> irons my hair super fast and gets very hot.</li>
            <li> Something i want to notice is about the on/off button; it doesn&#x27;t turn on right away after i click it, besides if you use an extension you must unplugged everything and turn off all appliances of your room to see if it will on.</li>
            <li> I plugged it up right away and tried it out.</li>
            <li> I been used this flat iron for 9 years , is the best, I&#x27;m hair stylist i can do hairs faster than other</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with the iron and count on it for beautiful sleek results on my extra coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I   would highly recommend this item to anyone who is trying to reduce straightening   time while still maintaining smooth and shiny hair..</li>
            <li> It straighten and can give a nice bump to long hair.</li>
            <li> Very wide plates at 2.5 inch straightens the hair MUCH faster because it is able to hold more hair.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair and this make my hair pin straight</li>
            <li> I have extremly curly hair, i turned it on the hottest setting (450) and instead of having to go through hours of trying to get what was in the end only wavy hair, it only took me about 30 to 40 minutes, which is great for hair like mine.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, has heat settings up to 450 degrees (and the buttons aren&#x27;t located on the side where you can accidentally change temps without knowing), and makes my hair stick straight in minutes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s porcelain plates glides over ones hair effortlessly and it made my hair super straight, silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> AND IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SUPER DUPER STRAIGHT.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviews that the 2 1/2 inches is perfect for medium to long hair, takes less time.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast, with is a bonus for me because having 3 kids I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on putting myself together.</li>
            <li> heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> It still worked great but was larger and heavier than the flat irons they make now</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li> very fast and stays hot</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> but it seemed to get extremely hot to the point that it started melting the plastic (or whatever material that is) that holds the plates in place.</li>
            <li> you can get through more hair faster and not have to continually go over the same hair because it does get so hot.</li>
            <li> she can blow that hot steam away.      </li>
            <li> i look like i got a big cotton on top of my head  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> But I figured babybliss is a well known brand, and I&#x27;d most likely hae no problems.</li>
            <li> and it never failed me</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> the handle does get hot but not to the point of burning your hand.</li>
            <li> The temperature sets up to 450 which it is more than enough</li>
            <li> BUT with this tool my hair stayed straight all day!</li>
            <li> product:&lt;br /&gt;-gets hot</li>
            <li> Okay, so last year I let my friend and her 3 kids move in with us for a while.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my first Babyliss at the recommendation of my hairdresser friend.</li>
            <li> This iron didnot only leave my   hair healthy looking and shiny,but it also reduced the time I use to spend   straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> You can go out in the rain and Texas humidity and it will stay straight!</li>
            <li> This is the first 2.5 inch straightener that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Works like a charm and gets really hot...</li>
            <li> it gose up to 450 and get really hot.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about it getting so hot</li>
            <li> and it was shiny without being greasy looking and it stayed straight until I washed it, no bedtime kinks!  </li>
            <li> it had melting plastic seeping out all sides of the hot iron ....</li>
            <li> Great hair straightener for thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Like many on here, I&#x27;m comparing this flat iron to my 2\\&quot; Chi that I finally dropped one too many times.</li>
            <li> This is the widest flat iron I have ever purchased and it works great on my long hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Ive never been more satisifed with a flat iron than this one.</li>
            <li> DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND IN NEW CONDITION.</li>
            <li> i read all the reviews and waited days before finally buying this one...and it was working just perfect for at least two  months...</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have ever been able to use that keeps my hair straight &amp; with out frizz.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty large also.</li>
            <li> Then, I came across this hair thing, and after seeing the positive reviews, we ordered it.</li>
            <li> It works so fast and it makes my hair look so pretty as though it was salon styled.  </li>
            <li> It also got hot really fast.</li>
            <li> was good but was just too small).  </li>
            <li> These flat irons are perfect for my long hair which takes over an hour to flat iron.</li>
            <li> and back with me, and is still kicking strong.</li>
            <li> A year later the iron is still going strong.</li>
            <li> so I was nervous but purchased it because of the large plate size</li>
            <li> My hair is silky smooth and my first day back in the office after using someone said your hair looks longer and really straight.  </li>
            <li> Just one thing to be careful make sure you pick the right temperature setting on the dial for your grade of hair because you could burn your hair if the setting is 2 high.</li>
            <li> Coarse to thin/ fine hair.</li>
            <li> OVERALL, I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED WITH MY FLAT IRON.</li>
            <li> Size is two large to really style your hair with.</li>
            <li> its very quick..heats up fast and will be ready in a minute..</li>
            <li> this straight.  </li>
            <li> i recomend it highly!</li>
            <li> Hence, no tired arms.  </li>
            <li> It does the job soooo fast.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine/thin hair</li>
            <li> it gives my hair a \\&quot;body\\&quot;, rather than just it being straight...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a flat-iron before, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare this one to...</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hispanic hair.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive compared to others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i hope i was helpful, because you guys were very helpful to me</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> It was actually much cheaper than the lower-rated one she was dying to have.</li>
            <li> I love the wide plates as it makes straightening your hair quicker.</li>
            <li> It really leaves my hair really straight.</li>
            <li> and it made me very self-conscious about myself.  </li>
            <li> was pin straight within 30-45 mins of use.  </li>
            <li> It leaves it shiny and straight with no effort and it lasts through the whole day.</li>
            <li> I have curly wavy hair so getting my hair to go straight was doable</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but I have to recommend this Iron to everyone that wants to straighten thier hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I could count on these reviews since this iron is very low-priced.</li>
            <li> Chi fast but still fast)  </li>
            <li> I decided I needed to find a solution fast inorder to reduce   the straightening time, so I bought this iron..</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s so wide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone two days with utterly straight hair without the need for touch ups.</li>
            <li> When I straighten my hair with this iron it is board straight.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind straight hair with some fullness to it.</li>
            <li> However if I reduce the heat setting my hair does not get completely straight.</li>
            <li> And is very durable...</li>
            <li> taking lot of time to finish whole hair..</li>
            <li> (Although I admit I don&#x27;t use it much since all heat does damage).  </li>
            <li> I WANT THE WHOLE COLLECTION</li>
            <li> and i dont straighten much</li>
            <li> Its very Efficient and helps me get through my hair in no time!&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> but the few times i have  used it was really nice.</li>
            <li> The first one still works, but I wanted a new one since it&#x27;s days might be numbered, but who knows?  </li>
            <li> and it straightened my long, curly hair very quickly</li>
            <li> The shine that it gives me makes me glad my old flat iron broke.</li>
            <li> The plates of the iron do not touch together to give your hair that super straight finish, but if used along with a flat iron that has smaller plates, it works great in helping to straighten out super thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Gets super hot, super fast and cuts the time I used to spend straightening my hair in half.</li>
            <li> The product does indeed get hot and touching your hair can give a little sting</li>
            <li> It does a great job of straightening my hair, but when i FIRST plugged it in, it started making a weird rattling/ticking noise and makes it the whole time the device is plugged in.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my hair tangles even after I comb it, and other straighteners I have owned with a comb have made it look more sleek after straightening.  </li>
            <li> Ater reading all the reviews, I was excited to finaly buy a flat iron that worked for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> After I used it a couple of times it was great but the third time I used it on my niece&#x27;s hair, when I was finishing it burned a small piece of hair off and the plates melted.</li>
            <li> when i set it to the highest setting my hair gets veryyy flat and smooth which is not something i particularly like nor find flattering on ME)&lt;br</li>
            <li> careful when ironing the ends of your hair (this iron is super powerful</li>
            <li> I then used the babyliss pro  1 inch flat iron to reach my hair roots   that I couldn&#x27;t reach with the bigger flat iron, and I had an amazing result!</li>
            <li> one problem for the 400F-450F do not comb until the hair is cool (they actually said that)</li>
            <li> Was looking for an affordable and effective flat iron that was wide and light enough to straighten my 16-18inch hair and this was what the doctor ordered.     </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this flat iron...</li>
            <li> It is very easy and fast to use.tries others in the past did come close.</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference between the two when I flat iron my hair - this one has a more professional feel and professional results.</li>
            <li> After spending half of the evening at the brick &amp; mortar stores looking for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; hair thing, I decided to check out the Amazon reviews to see if there was a better way to figure out which hair thing wouldn&#x27;t break after a year.</li>
            <li> I was replacing an older version of a Babyliss Iron I bought years ago for over $100.  </li>
            <li> older eyes can&#x27;t see it the temp...</li>
            <li> This heats up fast and hot, and I love my other baby bliss (blue one)</li>
            <li> my hair very soft and shiny after i am done straightening  it!</li>
            <li> It gets super hot so be careful.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s had other straightners, but by far, this is her favorite.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first with this product because of the cheap price.  </li>
            <li> and so when i get near the end of my hair i like to curve the iron so that the ends are not stick straight nor blunt and unnatural looking)</li>
            <li> We both have lots of hair- wavy waist length hair that normally takes forever to straighten.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> Holds straightness for longer then normal.</li>
            <li> It helps speed up the normal process of straightening.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and kind of thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard some people say that straightening irons need to be kept flat when not in use, to not wrap the cord around the body, etc, but I have pretty much given this a severe beating since day 1 and have had no</li>
            <li> The reviews were spot on, it works great, heats up in a split second and can tame my very wavy hair after sleeping with it wet overnight.  </li>
            <li> live the hair shine and smoth</li>
            <li> so I decided to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li> Will review again once I&#x27;ve had the new one for a while.</li>
            <li> She loves this new iron.</li>
            <li> Now, I have a new straightener</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing for the price especially, it cut my hair time down to thirty or forty minutes tops!</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Interesting thing is that the RED LIGHT indicator lights up red after straightener has warmed up for a bit.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 different brand   high end flat iron, paying as much as $200.00 for a flat iron, in search for one   that would provide with amazing results and short amount of time straightening   my hair..</li>
            <li> This product tames our hair to a lovely sleek manageable texture in no more than 10 minutes...</li>
            <li> same exact one I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Anyone have any thoughts or experience the same noise upon first use of this product?</li>
            <li> But, it does get hot on the outside as well.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted 6 years with almost daily use.  </li>
            <li> One note: I have fine hair so I can&#x27;t speak for how it works on thick hair or on the higher settings.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot, works quickly for those with thick hair.</li>
            <li> 9 years ago I bought this same model of flat iron, back in the day it cost more</li>
            <li> THIS FLAT IRON IS PERFECT,IT GETS HEATED VERY FAST</li>
            <li> I used the straightener for the first time on freshly washed, air dried hair with a smidgen of heat protestant serum at 375 degrees.  </li>
            <li> The heat does not dry my hair and my hair looks shinny and straight as I like it.</li>
            <li> I am ok with this product but the only compliant is ,i&#x27;m not able to straighten large sections of hair ...</li>
            <li> When I first got this flat iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had mine for years and was lucky enough to spot it at marshalls for $20.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I had problems with it right away, but within 4 months I started noticing my hair was getting extremely dry and fried at the ends.  </li>
            <li> 1-1/4inch flat irons take forever to smooth out long tresses.</li>
            <li> THIS BY FAR OUTWEIGHS THEM ALL.  </li>
            <li> Even at the highest temp my daughters hair still looks soft and not fried.</li>
            <li> I have had my BabylissPro since I was 18 years old...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s old.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the old model but decided to purchase this model based on user&#x27;s reviews.  </li>
            <li> Since I like to have both curly and straight hair, I do not use this daily.  </li>
            <li> This is coming from a Professional stylist that likes to share product/tool knowledge .</li>
            <li> This is a miracle for me because I have chemical sensitivies and can&#x27;t use any hair products near my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I SO missed having straight, silky hair - and this one gave it back to me!  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> (now it takes me 15-20 min to straighten) and give results that would last for more than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was able to straighten all of my thick, almost-elbow-length hair in about 10 minutes, and my daughter&#x27;s waist-length hair in about five.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavey shoulder length hair &amp; was able to straighten my hair in under 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> flat iron is ama zing takes half thr time to flat iron your hair leaving it silky smooth worth the price</li>
            <li> Straight, flat, and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Spanish and have what you consider that thick coarse curly hair but with this product my hair comes out nice and straight!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t connect it with this flat iron right away, in fact it took me over a year to finally be convinced it was the straightener, because my daughter used it as well</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly based on reviews from my teenage nieces and the reviews posted on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I owned a Babyliss iron, same model but an older version</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with coarse and frizzy hair since high school</li>
            <li> Since I have long hair I decided to purchase this product and it really works just like my Chi brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this flat iron for several years now and first learned of it when my stylist used the brand on my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesnt get as hot as I expected.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this model I bought a Revlon Wet to Straight 2 inch (cost about $30, was okay but took forever to straighten my thick hair) and a Chi 1.5 inch (was recommended by my hair stylist, cost $80,</li>
            <li> so it was only the new hair that i had my sis ironed for me...</li>
            <li> It straightens fast and you don&#x27;t have to go over the same area several times like the Chi.</li>
            <li> Has extra wide irons heats quickly very much worth</li>
            <li> I did note other&#x27;s issues that the handle gets hot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The major con to this is it works too well.....</li>
            <li> Got my hair cut too short and couldn&#x27;t use the flat iron very well.</li>
            <li> I have fairly fine textured hair, but it&#x27;s thick.  </li>
            <li> So after I decided I needed a new flat iron, I definitlly knew I would buy a babyliss product, but was thinking about upgrading it to the babyliss nano.</li>
            <li> i got a very thick hair though :)</li>
            <li> If you are buying it for a young person it works well enough.</li>
            <li> i had to get professional help to get back on track.  </li>
            <li> This baby has wide plates making flattening fast.  </li>
            <li> With CHI, my hair instantly turned into a complete frizz against the GA heat.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is true, but she said this product can be too harsh for daily use for some hair textures.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and gets hot so I can straighten my thick hair in minutes.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I ordered my own, just received it 3 days ago</li>
            <li> I love the larger size plates for initially straightening out the thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I had an older flat iron by the same manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> After checking almost every possible cause for my fried hair I finally decided to purchase a new straightener</li>
            <li> Significantly less damaging than my last straightener, this one was definitely worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I can see how it would straighten thick, coarse hair just fine.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why does that happens or is it just an isolated case as the instructions says that it must be connected direct to power supply, uhmm i&#x27;m just a little coward for that.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble adapting to the size of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have waisted 4 yrs of my natural hair life buying popular/expensive flat irons, straightening serums.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used it only once, but that&#x27;s enough to prove itself!</li>
            <li> Also, The iron works really well with hair extensions( silky, wet and wavy and body waves) and all types of coarse hair.     </li>
            <li> because when I initially called they simply said \\&quot;oh, do u want a replacement\\&quot; like it was normal for a flat iron to smoke and the plates to melt.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair (2b hair type) that needs to be flat ironed on the top and sides or I resemble a clown.  </li>
            <li> Hope it lasts as long as my old iron.</li>
            <li> One pass down each section of hair is all is needed to get the job done and the width makes that pass go much faster.  </li>
            <li> My usual setting is 350-375 and that seems to be just right without burning my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used so much sparys &amp; shampoos &amp; other name brand flat iron</li>
            <li> I have super curly, thick hair (think Diana Ross) and not only does this iron leave my hair bone straight and shiny, but it cut my ironing time from an hour and a half to 45 mins</li>
            <li> It takes about 20 minutes for me to flat iron all of my hair with barely any touch ups for about two days.</li>
            <li> The rest of their length was left open by at least a full centimeter.</li>
            <li> A little on the heavy side to hold, yet it is great for my thick hair and straightening my hair (10 minutes) in half the time my old iron took!</li>
            <li> The person needs to KNOW that people with thin or fine hair should use a tension comb to guide the hair while ironing it.</li>
            <li> I have owned several different flat irons over the years</li>
            <li> I researched different flat irons  and decided on this one.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these flat irons, one for me and one for my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li> after styling initially I only have to do minor touch ups the 2nd and 3rd</li>
            <li> It only took me 15-20min to flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is my second BaByliss flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron came in a timely fashion ordered the day after xmas recived the following tues as promised .this</li>
            <li> She had the older model that died after few years.</li>
            <li> I have super thick wavy hair and my hair went to sleek with this product!  </li>
            <li> I put absolutely no lotions in my hair and after having it aired dry overnight</li>
            <li> and then I flat iron it with this iron</li>
            <li> The company said they will send me a refund that the flat iron had malfunctioned by overheating and they believe it was an isolated incident.</li>
            <li> For any type of hair, you should use a hair heat protectant before using any flat iron and use a tension comb.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps you choose your flat iron.</li>
            <li> It would take me two hours to straighten it with a hair dryer and 1 inch flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 3 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the $100 plus flat irons</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement flat iron for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought these Flat Irons for myself.</li>
            <li> With the 3 flat irons that I had, it would literally take 3 hrs to   straighen my hair.</li>
            <li> The performance you get from this flat iron is comparable to one that you&#x27;d get for maybe 200$.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron for my sister years ago and have been searching for it for years.</li>
            <li> It does not do so well if you&#x27;re looking for a flat iron that works just like a Chi flat iron.  </li>
            <li> After much thought, considering that my hair is not that thick and curly rather that wavy and a little bit frizzy, I concluded I would buy this model again, mainly for the money I would be saving.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my husbands and and it last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with with hair like mine, as anyone like me has definitely tried a few and been left with frizz and/or extremely sore arms.</li>
            <li> i like this flat iron so far, i mean im natural with 4b hair</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it has just the basic plug going into the outlet (vice a big block on the end) because it doesn&#x27;t block the other outlets.  </li>
            <li> and when I went back to my stylist she told me of 2 other clients of hers who were having the same issues with their hair and guess what....</li>
            <li> they had a Babyliss Flat Iron as well!!!  </li>
            <li> Has cut down time that it normally takes to flat iron my hair by half.</li>
            <li> and it irons my 30 inch long hair in 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lasted so long.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to get it if you have long hair and cant stand using those itty bitty 1 inch contraptions.</li>
            <li> But my wife does and my long haired teenager does.  </li>
            <li> She has extremely long hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal or if it means I received a somewhat defective piece.</li>
            <li> so it takes a long time to straighten.</li>
            <li> (maybe others can go longer but that is as long as I can go without washing my hair)</li>
            <li> My only advise is to be very careful while holding the flat iron esp if you have it on the highest heat b/c</li>
            <li> The flat iron was smoking!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick-coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It allows me to wash my hair and let it air dry</li>
            <li> I liked my previous BaByliss Pro 2&amp;#34; but this one is heavy and difficult to handle.  </li>
            <li> how big and wide it was but it was not at all what I expected</li>
            <li> I figured it was cheap enough that if it didn&#x27;t work out, I wouldn&#x27;t feel too bad about buying a different one.  </li>
            <li> It does not damage my hair like other flat irons.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it came 2 days later than promised with standard shipping.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t change it for any other flat iron</li>
            <li> Unlike other ones i have owned, this flat iron does NOT pull or pinch my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and thought the big plates would be helpful but it definitely wasn&#x27;t, back to my t3 iron, which I never had a problem with.</li>
            <li> Mind you, we live in an extremely humid climate so frizz and excessive \\&quot;poofiness\\</li>
            <li> After 3 or 4 lice treatments, a coloring and a perm later trying to get rid of this stuff, my hair is a dry, kinky mess.      </li>
            <li> I will never go back to anything less than a 2.5 inch plate.</li>
            <li> At 2.5inches this iron definitely gets the work done in half the time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and with its wide plates it only takes a few minutes to get my hair done.</li>
            <li> This flat iron has cut that time down to about 30-45 minutes.</li>
            <li> My previous flat iron was also a 2.5 inch BaByliss Pro.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve dropped it numerous times (crashed to the floor and tumbled down the stairs!).  </li>
            <li> Before I would constantly have to pull my hair into a messy ponytail, bun or use those claw clips because I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it (even with a hair dryer).  </li>
            <li> so I thought getting a wide iron would save her some time.  </li>
            <li> I have had a chi for years and it finally died, after lots of research and talking to a few friends about hair straightners they had or tried before I decided to try a Baby Bliss.</li>
            <li> And a bit too wide.</li>
            <li> None of them worked quite as I had expected.  </li>
            <li> but I can never find anything that works as well with my hair or anything that has as wide of plates.</li>
            <li> I am of black ethnicity and I have fairly long and relaxed hair.   </li>
            <li> I realize the flat irons came down in price, but I thought they would&#x27;ve come down in quality too at the price I purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that gets wavy when it dries wet or frizzy when blow dried.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and this iron allowed me to flat iron my entire head in less than 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> We even tried other 2 1/2 inch irons from Sallys and returned them because they did not work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> , Doesn&#x27;t harm my hair like other straightners did in the past, I totally recomend this product.</li>
            <li> Any other iron takes hours for the amount of hair</li>
            <li> It heated up almost immediately, though it took a few passes, just routine for my hair especially since I was using a low-ish temperature, but my hair never snagged, the ends didn&#x27;t frazzle, I got a little curl at the end when held at an angle</li>
            <li> That is not a problem for me, but my 11 year old daughter can not use it that well, she has a hard time managing the size of it, paired with the heat!  </li>
            <li> Lasted a long time, and when it died, I went cheap-o for a few years, and was frustrated with my hair starting to frizz at the ends right after I ironed</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair so being 2.5 in was a big plus.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth the pain in the butt of returning it.</li>
            <li> For the price and results I get, it&#x27;s not worth my worry.     </li>
            <li> Especially because return shipping is going to be at least $10, so it&#x27;s like paying $14 just to find out a product doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-very dark brown</li>
            <li> all, its an average product..</li>
            <li> I decided to order another one because slowly its starting to lose heat</li>
            <li> I have, coarse, curly, thick, and puffy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, color treated hair, and this tames the beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!!!</li>
            <li> Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t break down on me or anything.</li>
            <li> Now I can straighten my hair and leave it down and feel like I just walked out of a salon.      </li>
            <li> When &#x27;trying out&#x27; the iron in my hands, I noticed that the plates do not close all the way when you clamp down.</li>
            <li> I have cut my visits down to once a month.</li>
            <li> (I no longer have to worry about it falling when I place it down)  </li>
            <li> Some of us need our hair weighed down, with something that&#x27;s not grease or a chemical relaxer.  </li>
            <li> yes i&#x27;m black...</li>
            <li> I paid much less for this iron than I paid for my 2 inch Chi turbo.  </li>
            <li> and it costs much, much less.  </li>
            <li> I styled my hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> -Does not pull those slightly longer strands of hair when reaching the end  </li>
            <li> (less than the time I use to spend straightening   </li>
            <li> I typically straighten my hair once every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I had not owned a flatiron that could straighten my hair in less than 45 minutes</li>
            <li> The other thing I&#x27;m still on the hunt for is  product that will help tame it, something I can apply before or after straightening.  </li>
            <li> I have long and extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve usually purchased the Chi flat iron, which usually break within a year.</li>
            <li> we were amazed: one minute it was hard to comb my hair, and the next even those small combs went through with no problem...</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed is that when I turn it on it makes some weird little noise which I found strange since the previous one I had didn&#x27;t made that noise.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin but naturally curly, I usually have to go to the hair salon to get my hair</li>
            <li> It does a little bit, but I don&#x27;t even consider it an issue since it&#x27;s not a hazard or inconvenience to me.  </li>
            <li> make me finish ironing my hair in so little time.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a little over a year now.</li>
            <li> It was heavy, It made my hair greasy, it would get caught on little strands of hair.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that it&#x27;s hard to get close to edges or to do bangs</li>
            <li> I have had a few over the years</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its not too heavy and has an extra-long cord.</li>
            <li> but then after a few hours my wavy hair would start to kick in.</li>
            <li> The finger placements are not comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have long, relatively thick hair and it will flatten in no more than 2 swipes.</li>
            <li> and I paid about half!  </li>
            <li> I have thin, frizzy and curly long hair and this weekend I put the iron to the test.  </li>
            <li> my hair had so much dryness, breakage,it was so badly damaged</li>
            <li> I am not sure if mine is just a \\&quot;dud\\</li>
            <li> bought it because i saw the reviews from you guys, skeptically i got it with the understanding that i would send it back to Amazon in case it didn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I can&#x27;t justify paying double.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I bought another one as a spare because this product is hard to find.    </li>
            <li> but this one is hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> The iron is quite heavy and little uncomfortable to manipulate.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick course and wavy.....</li>
            <li> twice thick wavy</li>
            <li> Not to mention a small piece of my nieces hair burned off!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want anyone to experince the same thing or even a worse situation!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, just dont buy it</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I mean &amp;#60;5 minutes!</li>
            <li> Some people complain about the iron not clamping well for thin hair, but it does not affect ironing ability of the product.</li>
            <li> Today it took me approximately an 1 hour and fifteen   minutes to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally tired of hearing of \\&quot;weightless moisturizers\\</li>
            <li> dramatic differences from before..</li>
            <li> I have bra strap length, thick, wavy, frizzy hair that triples in size at the suggestion of moisture and won&#x27;t hold artificial curl if threatened.  </li>
            <li> I just wonder if it&#x27;s because i am doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> sorry amazon, i&#x27;m keeping it...</li>
            <li> , this is just silly.</li>
            <li> sorry folks...</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> so it never tangles nor gets twisted during styling</li>
            <li> The location of the temperature setting is difficult to read.</li>
            <li> But they were wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in an annoying location and is hard to turn off/on.  </li>
            <li> I saw some bad reviews, all products have them.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed...</li>
            <li> but the dial is in a very awkward place...</li>
            <li> Hated this product.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re telling people that this iron doesn&#x27;t fry your hair...than maybe you should look closely at your ends...very very disappointed</li>
            <li> it smelled horrible, and started coming undone.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO!!!</li>
            <li> Gets very hot, works quickly for those with thick hair. Very happy with purchase, highly recommend this, I just hope it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.  I have had a few over the years but this is the best iron ever.  I have really thick hair and this iron allowed me to flat iron my entire head in less than 20 minutes.  It allows me to wash my hair and let it air dry and then I flat iron it with this iron and it leaves my hair straight, silky and light.  I have had so many compliments on how healthy my hair is and how good it looks from using this iron.  This is the best investment you will ever make.  My friend paid over $100 for hers and I got mine for $29.99 and it is the best flat iron around.</li>
            <li> I researched different flat irons  and decided on this one. It&#x27;s worth $90 and Amazon sells for so much less, it&#x27;s great.So far my experience with this product has been wonderful. My hair is thin but naturally curly, I usually have to go to the hair salon to get my hair this straight.  I agree with the reviews that the 2 1/2 inches is perfect for medium to long hair, takes less time. My hair looks glossy and healthy after using it. You may want to use extra products to protect your hair from heat (i.e., leave-in conditioner).   I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Ater reading all the reviews, I was excited to finaly buy a flat iron that worked for a reasonable price. CAUTION!!!!! After I used it a couple of times it was great but the third time I used it on my niece&#x27;s hair, when I was finishing it burned a small piece of hair off and the plates melted. The flat iron was smoking!!!! I had also purchased the babyliss 2000 at the same time and noticed the blow dryer attachement piece had melted also!!! The company said they will send me a refund that the flat iron had malfunctioned by overheating and they believe it was an isolated incident. The blow dryer is still being investigated as to why it melted the attachment piece. I strongly encourage anyone who has an experience like mine to make sure they put it in writing as I did because when I initially called they simply said \\&quot;oh, do u want a replacement\\&quot; like it was normal for a flat iron to smoke and the plates to melt. Not to mention a small piece of my nieces hair burned off! Thank goodness I caught it in time. I don&#x27;t want anyone to experince the same thing or even a worse situation!! SO PLEASE CAUTION!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is spectacular a must buy. I have super curly hair and this make my hair pin straight i recomend it highly!</li>
            <li> I have purchased many different high-end, highly-priced flat irons, and Babyliss Pro BABP2559 has delievered the most impressive results. Here are the reasons why:  1. Adjustable heat temperature up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, so it straightens the hair in a very short time. Hence, no tired arms.  2. Heat buffer, so you don&#x27;t burn your skin.  3. Porcelain ceramic gives a smooth, healthy silky shine. It does not damage my hair like other flat irons.  4. Very wide plates at 2.5 inch straightens the hair MUCH faster because it is able to hold more hair. I will never go back to anything less than a 2.5 inch plate. It does the job soooo fast.  5. It works for all types of hair. Coarse to thin/ fine hair. Some people complain about the iron not clamping well for thin hair, but it does not affect ironing ability of the product. The person needs to KNOW that people with thin or fine hair should use a tension comb to guide the hair while ironing it. The product is not faulty, the user is. I have very fine/thin hair and it irons my 30 inch long hair in 4 to 5 minutes. It works so fast and it makes my hair look so pretty as though it was salon styled.  6. You don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune for it&#x27;s price. I bought another one as a spare because this product is hard to find.    For any type of hair, you should use a hair heat protectant before using any flat iron and use a tension comb. With the use of Babyliss Pro BABP2559 2.5 inch plate flat iron, I am able to have beautiful, silky smooth, straight hair without damage to my hair or my pocket.     Hope this helps you choose your flat iron.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this item after reading the great reviews. I am not sure if mine is just a \\&quot;dud\\&quot; but it broke after 4 uses. I used it on the lowest temperature but it seemed to get extremely hot to the point that it started melting the plastic (or whatever material that is) that holds the plates in place. It cannot be used at all now. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have long and extremely thick hair. It used to take me about an hour and fifteen minutes to straighten my hair. This thing is amazing for the price especially, it cut my hair time down to thirty or forty minutes tops! I like the cool to the touch outer plates as well. I have only used it about four times but I am happy so far. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t break down on me or anything.</li>
            <li> Great iron! So far, I&#x27;ve used it only once, but that&#x27;s enough to prove itself! I have extremly curly hair, i turned it on the hottest setting (450) and instead of having to go through hours of trying to get what was in the end only wavy hair, it only took me about 30 to 40 minutes, which is great for hair like mine. I feel like I have control again. I would strongly suggest this product to anyone! Great buy.</li>
            <li> I had the older version of this product which I really loved, so I wanted nothing else but the same thing. It takes me just a few minutes to do my whole head (my hair is just on the wavy, frizzy side). I like that it gives my hair a \\&quot;body\\&quot;, rather than just it being straight...</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;all very good, recommended 100%&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> WITH THE SERVICE.  DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND IN NEW CONDITION. IT IS A GOOD FLAT IRON THAT I MAY HAVE TO ANOTHER OF JUST AS A SPARE... PERFECT AND I WILL USE THIS SELLER AGAIN. I HAVE USED MANY BUT THIS BY FAR OUTWEIGHS THEM ALL.  THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 3 weeks ago and it&#x27;s been working fine till now. The iron is quite heavy and little uncomfortable to manipulate. I choose this for the size of the plates as i have long hair and also for the good reviews given by you guys. Something i want to notice is about the on/off button; it doesn&#x27;t turn on right away after i click it, besides if you use an extension you must unplugged everything and turn off all appliances of your room to see if it will on. I really don&#x27;t understand why does that happens or is it just an isolated case as the instructions says that it must be connected direct to power supply, uhmm i&#x27;m just a little coward for that. I just wonder if it&#x27;s because i am doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a flat-iron before, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare this one to...but I was able to straighten all of my thick, almost-elbow-length hair in about 10 minutes, and my daughter&#x27;s waist-length hair in about five.  It heats up very fast, with is a bonus for me because having 3 kids I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on putting myself together.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair straightener on the market.  It straightens fast and you don&#x27;t have to go over the same area several times like the Chi.</li>
            <li> Significantly less damaging than my last straightener, this one was definitely worth the price I paid. It always leaves my hair flawless and noticeably shinier and it takes much less time to do my hair. Quality product and phenomenal results. I&#x27;ll never use another straighter!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hispanic hair. It would take me two hours to straighten it with a hair dryer and 1 inch flat iron. This flat iron has cut that time down to about 30-45 minutes. Love it. She can even do it herself. It does get VERY HOT and of course because it is 2 1/2 inches you can get through more hair faster and not have to continually go over the same hair because it does get so hot. Amaziningly enough it does not burn the hair. Even at the highest temp my daughters hair still looks soft and not fried. A hair dresser used it on my daughters hair and thats how we found out about it. Very inexpensive compared to others. We even tried other 2 1/2 inch irons from Sallys and returned them because they did not work as well as this one. Highly recommend! Don&#x27;t waste your time trying others this is the best! Got our order quickly within a week after purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have ever bought . It doesn&#x27;t burn my husbands and and it last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Babybliss flatiron bought for dayghter at Christmas she loves it.Has extra wide irons heats quickly very much worth the money.shipping was very quick.Thank You Amazon</li>
            <li> Very nice. Does a great job ironing my hair quickly and I&#x27;m very happy with what I got for the price. One note: I have fine hair so I can&#x27;t speak for how it works on thick hair or on the higher settings.</li>
            <li> bought it because i saw the reviews from you guys, skeptically i got it with the understanding that i would send it back to Amazon in case it didn&#x27;t work... sorry amazon, i&#x27;m keeping it... but i think its  better to have someone iron your hair for you just so he/she can blow that hot steam away.      i recently decided not to perm my hair anymore, so my hair is back to natural,ie.. very coarse and hairy ha ha ha yes i&#x27;m black... i love the way my hair feels its just that combing takes time and sometimes hurts and after a while my hair gets puffy and very very curly... i look like i got a big cotton on top of my head  i actually dont need a pillow ha!    i received this iron on 4/14/10 used it on the same day, wish i could send the pics to make believers out of you... dramatic differences from before..i started braiding my hair last year and just cut off all the permed hair so it was only the new hair that i had my sis ironed for me... she&#x27;s going to buy one too... we were amazed: one minute it was hard to comb my hair, and the next even those small combs went through with no problem... one problem for the 400F-450F do not comb until the hair is cool (they actually said that) but i didn&#x27;t listen and it melted my beautiful little comb...     okay thats it... i hope i was helpful, because you guys were very helpful to me</li>
            <li> I bought this two years ago, and while it&#x27;s held up great, and is a good product, I was considering buying one just to set aside for the future when this eventually craps out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s doubled in price as of today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it worth $40 and change? Absolutely. But if we&#x27;re going into the $80 range? I&#x27;m going to look into CHI. Sorry, but I can&#x27;t justify paying double. While inflation&#x27;s gone up, and this seemed like a great bargain at the time, this is just silly.</li>
            <li> I love my Babyliss...I have long hair and with its wide plates it only takes a few minutes to get my hair done. I&#x27;ve actually had mine for years and was lucky enough to spot it at marshalls for $20. Back home(England) babyliss is a top brand in hair tools...like everyone here they want a chi, its babyliss back in the UK. so when I found mine for $20 wahooo! and if you can get one get it worth every penny, but you probably won&#x27;t find one as cheap as I did. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I paid much less for this iron than I paid for my 2 inch Chi turbo.  I am so happy I ordered this!  My hair is silky smooth and my first day back in the office after using someone said your hair looks longer and really straight.  I can tell a big difference!</li>
            <li> I have tried out soooo many flat irons over this years, and this one by far is the best you can get, especially for the price!  I think this iron works better than the  chi I had before and it costs much, much less.  It heats up quickly, has heat settings up to 450 degrees (and the buttons aren&#x27;t located on the side where you can accidentally change temps without knowing), and makes my hair stick straight in minutes.  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This does work but does not leave your hair shiny like the Chi. If you are buying it for a young person it works well enough. If your hair is frizzy, colored etc may not be the best choice.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Bought two of these flat irons, one for me and one for my teenage daughter. We both have lots of hair- wavy waist length hair that normally takes forever to straighten. Mind you, we live in an extremely humid climate so frizz and excessive \\&quot;poofiness\\&quot; is a constant problem. This product tames our hair to a lovely sleek manageable texture in no more than 10 minutes...that&#x27;s record time for us! The temperature control is great and it heats up and cools down VERY quickly! Awesome product, awesome price!</li>
            <li> I really love this flat-iron! I have super curly, thick hair (think Diana Ross) and not only does this iron leave my hair bone straight and shiny, but it cut my ironing time from an hour and a half to 45 mins :) I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how straight and shiny my hair looks now!!!    I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I have had my BabylissPro since I was 18 years old...I&#x27;m 29. This thing has gone thru H**L and back with me, and is still kicking strong. I would recommend this brand to ANYONE looking for a ceramic iron. Love it love it love it!!!</li>
            <li> same exact one I was looking for. Love it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. I saw some bad reviews, all products have them. But I figured babybliss is a well known brand, and I&#x27;d most likely hae no problems. I used it ONCE, and the glue that holds the heat-repellent wrap on began to melt! it smelled horrible, and started coming undone. Seriously, just dont buy it it&#x27;s not worth the pain in the butt of returning it.</li>
            <li> I been used this flat iron for 9 years , is the best, I&#x27;m hair stylist i can do hairs faster than other live the hair shine and smoth</li>
            <li> After spending half of the evening at the brick &amp; mortar stores looking for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; hair thing, I decided to check out the Amazon reviews to see if there was a better way to figure out which hair thing wouldn&#x27;t break after a year. All of the ones that we found in the physical stores had low ratings. Then, I came across this hair thing, and after seeing the positive reviews, we ordered it. My wife has been very pleased with it, and I was happy to get a quality product that will hopefully last awhile. It was actually much cheaper than the lower-rated one she was dying to have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Spanish and have what you consider that thick coarse curly hair but with this product my hair comes out nice and straight!!! The product does indeed get hot and touching your hair can give a little sting so i suggest buying a glove of some sort other than that its a perfect buy for anyone wanting to het that straight look for your hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister in law and she is thrilled!  She had a 1 inch iron that she paid $100 for and she says this one is WAAAY better and I paid about half!  SCORE!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 3 years and it never failed me and it&#x27;s me, my sister, and mom who use it and it&#x27;s lasted so long. I decided to order another one because slowly its starting to lose heat and it&#x27;s old. Very pleased with this flat iron. Never use anything but this. I have a lot of hair and kind of thick and it works amazing. Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Prompt shipment. It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Bought this iron based on the reviews I read on Amazon and my hairstylist&#x27;s recommendation.  The reviews were spot on, it works great, heats up in a split second and can tame my very wavy hair after sleeping with it wet overnight.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this flat iron for several years now and first learned of it when my stylist used the brand on my hair. I have never had a problem with the iron and count on it for beautiful sleek results on my extra coarse hair. I&#x27;ve never tried the $100 plus flat irons so I can&#x27;t compare here. But, this iron works quickly and effectively and you won&#x27;t have to pass it through your hair several times to get wonderful results.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I have thick wavey shoulder length hair &amp; was able to straighten my hair in under 5 minutes.  I had a Sedu flat iron before and this product is much better! I love the wide plates as it makes straightening your hair quicker. Would def purchase again.</li>
            <li> The straightener works great for my long curly hair.   Also, the estimated delivery was acurate and the straightener came nicely packed.</li>
            <li> Was looking for an affordable and effective flat iron that was wide and light enough to straighten my 16-18inch hair and this was what the doctor ordered.     Smaller 1inch and 1-1/4inch flat irons take forever to smooth out long tresses. At 2.5inches this iron definitely gets the work done in half the time. It    It&#x27;s porcelain plates glides over ones hair effortlessly and it made my hair super straight, silky and shiny. It has different settings, so don&#x27;t worry about frying your hair.     Also, The iron works really well with hair extensions( silky, wet and wavy and body waves) and all types of coarse hair.     It&#x27;s a very effective and inexpensive ( well not as expensive as the Chi&#x27;s and the FHI&#x27;s) product and it looks more expensive than it costs and more importantly does a superb job. Don&#x27;t hesitate to get it if you have long hair and cant stand using those itty bitty 1 inch contraptions.</li>
            <li> Got my hair cut too short and couldn&#x27;t use the flat iron very well. But, the customer service was awesome. Great communication, fast shipment, etc.   Great quality product.</li>
            <li> I had an older flat iron by the same manufacturer.  I couldn&#x27;t find the old model but decided to purchase this model based on user&#x27;s reviews.  For the price I paid, the product more than met my expectations.      My stylist indicated that this is more of a professional grade product.  I don&#x27;t know if that is true, but she said this product can be too harsh for daily use for some hair textures.  I have fairly fine textured hair, but it&#x27;s thick.  Since I like to have both curly and straight hair, I do not use this daily.  I probably use it about 3-4 days a week.  I do not use the highest heat setting, but I am still able to get sleek, shiny hair.       I did note other&#x27;s issues that the handle gets hot.  It does a little bit, but I don&#x27;t even consider it an issue since it&#x27;s not a hazard or inconvenience to me.  For the price and results I get, it&#x27;s not worth my worry.     My only complaint is that it came 2 days later than promised with standard shipping.  Obviously, that isn&#x27;t the manufacturer&#x27;s fault, but it is something I wanted to note in terms of the supplier. I wasn&#x27;t in a rush to get it, but I do like the items to come within the stated time frame.</li>
            <li> This is a great iron for the price. It straighten and can give a nice bump to long hair. It also create great bounce and body. This is coming from a Professional stylist that likes to share product/tool knowledge . Thank you</li>
            <li> Ive never been more satisifed with a flat iron than this one. It really leaves my hair really straight. I just have to stroke it once through my hair. My sister in law who works at at hair salon recommended it. And it is wayyy cheaper online than at the stores. All the stores i went to were selling it over 60$$ but i got mine for 30$.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this flat iron...i read all the reviews and waited days before finally buying this one...and it was working just perfect for at least two  months...then my hair started to get fried...my hair had so much dryness, breakage,it was so badly damaged i wanted to hide... i had to get professional help to get back on track.  I am so disappointed...please don&#x27;t buy this one...mine is in the trash...sorry folks...but if you&#x27;re telling people that this iron doesn&#x27;t fry your hair...than maybe you should look closely at your ends...very very disappointed</li>
            <li> A quick look at my picture tells you...I don&#x27;t use this devise.  But my wife does and my long haired teenager does.  They swear to me it is the best on the market and through AMAZON the price is very very good.  When the teen asks for it for Christmas...that says a lot.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> strongest straightening ever i have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with coarse and frizzy hair since high school and it made me very self-conscious about myself.  Let me just say that this product could have changed my life if I had found it sooner (found it by Googling \\&quot;best flat iron\\&quot;)! It heats up very fast and it straightens my hair quickly.  I have used cheap brands bought at Target and/or Walmart that do not work that well before so I thought I was just out of luck.  Before I would constantly have to pull my hair into a messy ponytail, bun or use those claw clips because I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it (even with a hair dryer).  Now I can straighten my hair and leave it down and feel like I just walked out of a salon.      My usual setting is 350-375 and that seems to be just right without burning my hair.  One pass down each section of hair is all is needed to get the job done and the width makes that pass go much faster.  Thank you for this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this Iron for a friend and she loves it.  What else can I add.  She comes to the office all days like a Queen now :)  Her hair looks so beatiful with the use of this</li>
            <li> Gets super hot, super fast and cuts the time I used to spend straightening my hair in half. Its not too heavy and has an extra-long cord. It even leaves my hair noticeably shinier!</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly based on reviews from my teenage nieces and the reviews posted on Amazon.  I have thin, frizzy and curly long hair and this weekend I put the iron to the test.  I put absolutely no lotions in my hair and after having it aired dry overnight I used the product and my hair was pin straight within 30-45 mins of use.  My only advise is to be very careful while holding the flat iron esp if you have it on the highest heat b/c the handle does get hot but not to the point of burning your hand.</li>
            <li> My wife has purchased a Babyliss Flatiron twice in the past and it seems to be the best brand for straightening her hair without drying it out.  She particularly likes this model because of the black porcelain and ceramic panels, which don&#x27;t show hair coloring stains.  I also like the fact that it has just the basic plug going into the outlet (vice a big block on the end) because it doesn&#x27;t block the other outlets.  (particularly useful while traveling)</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair (2b hair type) that needs to be flat ironed on the top and sides or I resemble a clown.  No wash and go waves for me.  My previous flat iron was also a 2.5 inch BaByliss Pro.  I don&#x27;t know the model number but I had it for about 12 years!  It still worked great but was larger and heavier than the flat irons they make now so I decided to purchase a new one.  Before purchasing this model I bought a Revlon Wet to Straight 2 inch (cost about $30, was okay but took forever to straighten my thick hair) and a Chi 1.5 inch (was recommended by my hair stylist, cost $80, was good but was just too small).  I didn&#x27;t see any Chi irons in the store larger than 1.5 inch so this brand wasn&#x27;t a go for me although I liked the look and feel of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BaByliss Pro 2559 works like a gem.  It straightens my hair in no time...can straighten the top and sides in about 20 minutes.  This is a miracle for me because I have chemical sensitivies and can&#x27;t use any hair products near my scalp.  No serum, mousse, gel...nothing.  So I need a flat iron that can do the job on its own and this one does the job.  It&#x27;s also light weight and not bulky...I  even use it to straighten the pieces around my face no problem.  I can set it at any temperature although for my hair type I keep it around 375 degrees.  Using it at this temperature my hair has stayed healthy, no fried ends, and it stays smooth after styling.  I wash my hair every 3 days and after styling initially I only have to do minor touch ups the 2nd and 3rd day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY drawback is the off/on switch.  It&#x27;s in an annoying location and is hard to turn off/on.  Sometimes I think I&#x27;ve turned it off only to see when I return home from work that it&#x27;s still on.  Also, for this price point, it should have automatic shut off but it doesn&#x27;t.  I still wouldn&#x27;t use anything else though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter after dropping her straightener.  She has extremely long hair so I thought getting a wide iron would save her some time.  She says it heats up quickly and does save her lots of time because of the width. She recommends it. It also shipped quicker than quick. Enjoy</li>
            <li> 9 years ago I bought this same model of flat iron, back in the day it cost more but I was so happy with the product until it eventually  died (I had it for almost 5 years) it was a great purchase back then. So after I decided I needed a new flat iron, I definitlly knew I would buy a babyliss product, but was thinking about upgrading it to the babyliss nano. After much thought, considering that my hair is not that thick and curly rather that wavy and a little bit frizzy, I concluded I would buy this model again, mainly for the money I would be saving. It is still a great product!!! I have lots of volume and the size of the plates make me finish ironing my hair in so little time. It leaves it shiny and straight with no effort and it lasts through the whole day. The temperature sets up to 450 which it is more than enough and I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning my hair. The only thing I noticed is that when I turn it on it makes some weird little noise which I found strange since the previous one I had didn&#x27;t made that noise. I have been using it for 4 months and besides the noise I hadn&#x27;t had any problems with it. In conclusion I&#x27;m really happy I bought this iron, great price, for great product.</li>
            <li> I have had a chi for years and it finally died, after lots of research and talking to a few friends about hair straightners they had or tried before I decided to try a Baby Bliss. I have very thick long hair so being 2.5 in was a big plus. With my 1 in Chi it would take me 35-40 min to straighten my hair, well when i received my baby bliss in the mail i immediately opened it and gave it a try! AWESOME is all i can say. I did my hair in a total of 12 minutes, yes that&#x27;s right 12 minutes!!!!!!! It left my hair silky smooth and looking great!!!!!!! I am so glad I chose a baby bliss!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after the Sedu I had for almost two years finally died on me.  I figured it was cheap enough that if it didn&#x27;t work out, I wouldn&#x27;t feel too bad about buying a different one.  I used it once and it straightened my long, curly hair very quickly and my hair stayed straight all day; I was very very happy with the results.  A couple days later I tried to use it again and it simply won&#x27;t turn on.  I&#x27;m completely dumbfounded, as it just sat on my desk for a couple days, there was absolutely no discernible reason for it to break.  I&#x27;m returning it and buying a new one, since I was pleased with the way it worked, and am hoping that the one I got was just defective.  Will review again once I&#x27;ve had the new one for a while.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement flat iron for my daughter. She had a BaByliss that was finally worn out. She loves this new iron. This time we purchased a wider iron for quicker finishes.</li>
            <li> So, after reading all of the excellent reviews on this iron, I purchased it. The item arrived in a timely manner, and I was excited. I opened the box and took the iron out of its packaging. When &#x27;trying out&#x27; the iron in my hands, I noticed that the plates do not close all the way when you clamp down. :/ The front end was the only spot the plates touched together. The rest of their length was left open by at least a full centimeter. I can see how it would straighten thick, coarse hair just fine. But for my own fine/thin strands, there is just no way this iron could get the job done. So sad. Especially because return shipping is going to be at least $10, so it&#x27;s like paying $14 just to find out a product doesn&#x27;t work for you. Ridiculous. I&#x27;m entirely bummed.</li>
            <li> I have went through a lot of straighteners and never had one I was completely pleased with. I have curly wavy hair so getting my hair to go straight was doable but then after a few hours my wavy hair would start to kick in. BUT with this tool my hair stayed straight all day! I am very pleased with this straightener. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> product:&lt;br /&gt;-gets hot very fast and stays hot&lt;br /&gt;-large plates are great for saving time and covering larger amounts of hair&lt;br /&gt;-smooth plates glide through hair&lt;br /&gt;-durable&lt;br /&gt;-cord swivels 360 degrees so it never tangles nor gets twisted during styling&lt;br /&gt;-plates are about the size of the entire palm of my hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair type:&lt;br /&gt;-very dark brown&lt;br /&gt;-not color treated&lt;br /&gt;-thick&lt;br /&gt;-wavy&lt;br /&gt;-oily roots&lt;br /&gt;-medium long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tips:&lt;br /&gt;-because the plates are large, i would not recommend it for those with shorter hair because it is not that great for detailing&lt;br /&gt;-pay attention to the temperature setting (when i set it to the highest setting my hair gets veryyy flat and smooth which is not something i particularly like nor find flattering on ME)&lt;br /&gt;-be careful when ironing the ends of your hair (this iron is super powerful and so when i get near the end of my hair i like to curve the iron so that the ends are not stick straight nor blunt and unnatural looking)</li>
            <li> Works fine for me! Loved the product! Makes my hair look great, Doesn&#x27;t harm my hair like other straightners did in the past, I totally recomend this product.</li>
            <li> This baby has wide plates making flattening fast.  I have long, relatively thick hair and it will flatten in no more than 2 swipes.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I don&#x27;t take very good care of my hair appliances. That said, this device has put up with years of abuse and is still working perfectly. It takes about a minute or 2 to fully heat up and then glides effortlessly through hair to produce the shiniest, silkiest mane ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard some people say that straightening irons need to be kept flat when not in use, to not wrap the cord around the body, etc, but I have pretty much given this a severe beating since day 1 and have had no trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I&#x27;m still using this iron regularly and it&#x27;s been 2 years since my last review. That&#x27;s six years this has been my go-to hairstyling appliance.</li>
            <li> So i got my straightener yesterday afternoon. It arrived in 3 days, which was great. I love when items ship quicker than estimated. I plugged it up right away and tried it out. It does a great job of straightening my hair, but when i FIRST plugged it in, it started making a weird rattling/ticking noise and makes it the whole time the device is plugged in. I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal or if it means I received a somewhat defective piece. Anyone have any thoughts or experience the same noise upon first use of this product?</li>
            <li> best iron i have ever had! get it. irons my hair super fast and gets very hot. i recommend the 2.5 inch one over the thinner hair irons. it works faster</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I had no trouble adapting to the size of the flat iron. I styled my hair in half the time. Would definitely recommend purchasing this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li> VERY HOT!!!  That is the best part.  But, it does get hot on the outside as well.  That is not a problem for me, but my 11 year old daughter can not use it that well, she has a hard time managing the size of it, paired with the heat!  I would order this same one again though for myself if it went out!</li>
            <li> This heats up fast and hot, and I love my other baby bliss (blue one) but this one is hard to handle.  The finger placements are not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Heavy, but does an incredible job of creating sleek runway hair. You will not need any additional straightening or shining serums of any kind.</li>
            <li> My hair never looked better. Really great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Interesting thing is that the RED LIGHT indicator lights up red after straightener has warmed up for a bit. To be safe I unplug it after I am done.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a gift for my wife for mothers day and so far she is very pleased and satisfied. Very good product as she tells me.</li>
            <li> I have owned several different flat irons over the years but this is the best straightening iron on the market! My best friend loves to use it when she comes over.</li>
            <li> This the best flat iron on the market. For the price, I am so very pleased iwth my purchase. Would recommend to Everyone!!!!</li>
            <li> THIS FLAT IRON IS PERFECT,IT GETS HEATED VERY FAST AND IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SUPER DUPER STRAIGHT. I CAN RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYBODY THAT HAVE A LOT OF HAIR.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new flat iron.  The heat does not dry my hair and my hair looks shinny and straight as I like it.</li>
            <li> Okay, so last year I let my friend and her 3 kids move in with us for a while.  Along with her kids came 3 heads full of lice...reoccurring and reoccurring.  UGH!!  So I got it over and over and over.  After 3 or 4 lice treatments, a coloring and a perm later trying to get rid of this stuff, my hair is a dry, kinky mess.      I bought this miracle of a straightener, and I will never go back!  I SO missed having straight, silky hair - and this one gave it back to me!  Thank you, Babyliss!!  :)</li>
            <li> My hair is thick course and wavy.....this straightening iron is awesome.  It makes it smooth and light and straight</li>
            <li> This is the best line of Flat irons. This is the only product that I have ever been able to use that keeps my hair straight &amp; with out frizz. I have used so much sparys &amp; shampoos &amp; other name brand flat iron but I have to recommend this Iron to everyone that wants to straighten thier hair. it&#x27;s awesome. I love that it has heat control settings.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Babyliss at the recommendation of my hairdresser friend. I am glad I did. It has been the best product ever. It has worked amazing for me. It takes about 20 minutes for me to flat iron all of my hair with barely any touch ups for about two days.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve dropped it numerous times (crashed to the floor and tumbled down the stairs!).  Still works perfectly!  A great bargain when compared to the CHI at half the cost.</li>
            <li> i love this iron. it makes my hair soft and silky. heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> this is a very good flat iron and I was very happy with the results this product gave me ,the only thing that I did not like was that the temp on the iron I couldn&#x27;t see if the temp was to high it gets real hot yes I would buy this product again</li>
            <li> I bought these Flat Irons for myself. I could not ask for a better product. I don&#x27;t use them daily but they work as if I just got my hair done at the shop. I have cut my visits down to once a month. Just one thing to be careful make sure you pick the right temperature setting on the dial for your grade of hair because you could burn your hair if the setting is 2 high. Very good product have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Like many on here, I&#x27;m comparing this flat iron to my 2\\&quot; Chi that I finally dropped one too many times. I was hoping I could count on these reviews since this iron is very low-priced. I am of black ethnicity and I have fairly long and relaxed hair.   MY PROS:   -Leaves my hair silky smooth.  -Love the wider plates. I&#x27;m glad I made the switch to a 2 &amp;1/2 in iron.  -Design of this flat iron makes it more stable on a counter top (I no longer have to worry about it falling when I place it down)  -Heats up fast(not Chi fast but still fast)  -Does not pull those slightly longer strands of hair when reaching the end  MY CONS:  -Does not open as wide as my old Chi. It takes some getting used to when initially grabbing the hair.  OVERALL, I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED WITH MY FLAT IRON. This is a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Size is two large to really style your hair with. I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> Wife is happy with the product. She had the older model that died after few years. I will recommended to others.</li>
            <li> I liked my previous BaByliss Pro 2&amp;#34; but this one is heavy and difficult to handle.  The location of the temperature setting is difficult to read.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many flatirons and have never been happy. This one is GREAT!!! The on and off and heat setting dials or placed perfect. Your fingers can&#x27;t switch it off while in the process of doing your hair. I would buy this product again if mine wears out. I bought one for my sister and am considering buying a back up for myself.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews but I felt this product deserved one after seeing   the results..I have very long thick-coarse hair. I have bought 3 different brand   high end flat iron, paying as much as $200.00 for a flat iron, in search for one   that would provide with amazing results and short amount of time straightening   my hair..With the 3 flat irons that I had, it would literally take 3 hrs to   straighen my hair. I decided I needed to find a solution fast inorder to reduce   the straightening time, so I bought this iron..This iron didnot only leave my   hair healthy looking and shiny,but it also reduced the time I use to spend   straightening my hair. Today it took me approximately an 1 hour and fifteen   minutes to straighten my hair (less than the time I use to spend straightening   my hair)..I then used the babyliss pro  1 inch flat iron to reach my hair roots   that I couldn&#x27;t reach with the bigger flat iron, and I had an amazing result! I   would highly recommend this item to anyone who is trying to reduce straightening   time while still maintaining smooth and shiny hair..</li>
            <li> These flat irons are perfect for my long hair which takes over an hour to flat iron. It only took me 15-20min to flat iron. It gets very hot and leaves a nice shine. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> For the price of this item, it works great. I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year now and it works as good as new. The performance you get from this flat iron is comparable to one that you&#x27;d get for maybe 200$. Hope this review is helpful for those who question it&#x27;s abilities.</li>
            <li> Was delivered in great time and works amazingly well !!!</li>
            <li> Hated this product. Was told it was the greatest straightener. But they were wrong. It was heavy, It made my hair greasy, it would get caught on little strands of hair. It&#x27;s just too bulky. I have thick curly hair and thought the big plates would be helpful but it definitely wasn&#x27;t, back to my t3 iron, which I never had a problem with.</li>
            <li> A little on the heavy side to hold, yet it is great for my thick hair and straightening my hair (10 minutes) in half the time my old iron took!</li>
            <li> Best straightner I have ever owned!  I have super thick wavy hair and my hair went to sleek with this product!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair straightener for over 3 years! It is working perfectly. The temperature dial allows you to adjust the temperature to your comfort level. The width of the product enables you to straighten all your hair in a matter of minutes! I mean &amp;#60;5 minutes! I&#x27;ll never purchase or use a Chi again. This is the best straightener on the market by far!</li>
            <li> I think I bought this 4 years ago and it still impresses me every time! Good investment!</li>
            <li> When I first got this flat iron I was super excited, it did a great job of straightening my hair.  I don&#x27;t think I had problems with it right away, but within 4 months I started noticing my hair was getting extremely dry and fried at the ends.  I didn&#x27;t connect it with this flat iron right away, in fact it took me over a year to finally be convinced it was the straightener, because my daughter used it as well and it didn&#x27;t burn her hair (but we have different textures of hair).  I don&#x27;t straighten my hair often, maybe once a week at the most and I always use salon recommended products.  My stylist and I were puzzled for atleast a year, she looked at this flat iron and said she thought it was a good brand, so I kept using it (and kept having to get my hair chopped every 2 months!!!) After checking almost every possible cause for my fried hair I finally decided to purchase a new straightener and when I went back to my stylist she told me of 2 other clients of hers who were having the same issues with their hair and guess what....they had a Babyliss Flat Iron as well!!!  Now, I have a new straightener and I can finally do what I&#x27;ve been wanting to do for 2 years, grow out my hair.  I definately would NOT recommend this straightener!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second BaByliss flat iron.  The first one lasted 6 years with almost daily use.  The first one still works, but I wanted a new one since it&#x27;s days might be numbered, but who knows?  I have tried Chi and FHI and would recommend the BaByliss over both of them. It heats up fast and glides over hair nicely.  No need to cover the same hair again and again. I would have given it 5 stars if it had an automatic shut off.</li>
            <li> excellent product works very well in Venezuela</li>
            <li> Love this iron. It gets super hot so be careful.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron you can buy at this or any price!  I owned a Babyliss iron, same model but an older version and it lasted me a good 5 years before I lost it.  It was still in perfect condition.  The porcelain really flattens your hair nicely and the temperature control allows any hair type to be able to use this iron without damaging your hair.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron.  We&#x27;ve usually purchased the Chi flat iron, which usually break within a year. Our hair dresser turned us on to this one and it&#x27;s been great. It&#x27;s super quick at straightening the hair yet costs lower than the high dollar ones that claim to be the best.</li>
            <li> Great straightener. I use this to do the keratin treatments on myself because it gets up to 450 degrees. It straightens beautifully and easily and I love that it&#x27;s so wide. It makes the process reasonably quick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron for my sister years ago and have been searching for it for years. I have a lot of hair so it takes a long time to straighten. With this iron it is So much faster and looks great. I have tried several and this its baby far the best. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Makes a buzzing noise so I hope thats not a bad thing. Works great so far!! Great price.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first with this product because of the cheap price.  I was replacing an older version of a Babyliss Iron I bought years ago for over $100.  I realize the flat irons came down in price, but I thought they would&#x27;ve come down in quality too at the price I purchased this one.  It heats up fast and gets hot so I can straighten my thick hair in minutes.  I have had it for a little over a year now.</li>
            <li> I bought this flatiron in the fall of 2011. A year later the iron is still going strong. Granted I do not straighten my hair every day. I typically straighten my hair once every couple of weeks. You can go out in the rain and Texas humidity and it will stay straight! I&#x27;ve gone two days with utterly straight hair without the need for touch ups. (maybe others can go longer but that is as long as I can go without washing my hair) This was a very good purchase that I do not regret. Up until this flatiron I had not owned a flatiron that could straighten my hair in less than 45 minutes (now it takes me 15-20 min to straighten) and give results that would last for more than a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major con to this is it works too well..... I have long (mid-back), you can barely wrap a hair band around it twice thick wavy (bordering curly) hair so I&#x27;m used to full body hair. When I straighten my hair with this iron it is board straight. I wouldn&#x27;t mind straight hair with some fullness to it. However if I reduce the heat setting my hair does not get completely straight. Oh well, it&#x27;s probably the user not the machine :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for smooth, silky, board straight hair with no fly-a-ways this is your iron!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have ever purchased. I have always bought store brand and have even tried a friend&#x27;s CHI, but this one was by far the best I have ever used. This is going to be the brand that I use from here on out.</li>
            <li> Has cut down time that it normally takes to flat iron my hair by half. Gives hair great shine and smooth. Holds straightness for longer then normal. Only negative is that it&#x27;s hard to get close to edges or to do bangs</li>
            <li> Doesnt get as hot as I expected. And a bit too wide. I shouldve gotten the 1.5 inch</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my daughter... works great! And is very durable... those of you who have teenager know they take a beating. 6 moths and still going lol</li>
            <li> This is the widest flat iron I have ever purchased and it works great on my long hair. The shine that it gives me makes me glad my old flat iron broke. I can feel the difference between the two when I flat iron my hair - this one has a more professional feel and professional results. Great price! Hope it lasts as long as my old iron.</li>
            <li> I am ok with this product but the only compliant is ,i&#x27;m not able to straighten large sections of hair ...&lt;br /&gt;its taking lot of time to finish whole hair..i got a very thick hair though :)&lt;br /&gt;but its very quick..heats up fast and will be ready in a minute..&lt;br /&gt;over all, its an average product..</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s the same one my hair dresser use! I wouldn&#x27;t change it for any other flat iron it&#x27;s yet the best!</li>
            <li> The straighter broke in a year but it was good while it lasted. It had good grip and was easy to straighten my hair since it was big. It also got hot really fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and very efficient. Definitely would and will order from here again. Thank you for the great service provided as well.</li>
            <li> I have, coarse, curly, thick, and puffy hair.  This is the first 2.5 inch straightener that I have tried.  It now takes me 30-35 minutes instead of 1 hr+. I purchased this in July of 2012, the price has jumped since then.  My hair is really resistant and frizzy, so having the higher temperature options is amazing!  (Although I admit I don&#x27;t use it much since all heat does damage).  I highly recommend this to anyone with with hair like mine, as anyone like me has definitely tried a few and been left with frizz and/or extremely sore arms. Unlike other ones i have owned, this flat iron does NOT pull or pinch my hair. The only thing I wish this straightener had was a comb with it.  Sometimes my hair tangles even after I comb it, and other straighteners I have owned with a comb have made it look more sleek after straightening.  The other thing I&#x27;m still on the hunt for is  product that will help tame it, something I can apply before or after straightening.  I have tried MANY products, but even after using this (or any iron) my hair still is prone to puffing and frizz.I&#x27;m personally tired of hearing of \\&quot;weightless moisturizers\\&quot; or \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; products.  Some of us need our hair weighed down, with something that&#x27;s not grease or a chemical relaxer.  And I digress...</li>
            <li> It works ok...but the dial is in a very awkward place...older eyes can&#x27;t see it the temp...it&#x27;s pretty large also.</li>
            <li> Its the best thing. Any other iron takes hours for the amount of hair I&#x27;ve got this gets the job done in no time.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and gets really hot...</li>
            <li> IF I HAVE READ BEFORE BUYING I WOULD BE IN HEAVEN HOWEVER I USED IT ON MY GIRLS AND I LOVE ABOUT TO BUT A SMALLER ONE! I WANT THE WHOLE COLLECTION</li>
            <li> i like this flat iron so far, i mean im natural with 4b hair and i dont straighten much but the few times i have  used it was really nice. it dosent pull the hair or snag it. the hair just glides through. it gose up to 450 and get really hot.</li>
            <li> Its very Efficient and helps me get through my hair in no time!&lt;br /&gt;makes my hair very soft and shiny after i am done straightening  it!</li>
            <li> I have waisted 4 yrs of my natural hair life buying popular/expensive flat irons, straightening serums. None of them worked quite as I had expected.  With CHI, my hair instantly turned into a complete frizz against the GA heat.  My best girlfriend (is also chemical free... But she looks like she has a relaxer) came to visit for the weekend.  Since I just washed my hair, I gave her Babyliss Pro a try. I was completely impressed by the results!!!  Needless to say, I ordered my own, just received it 3 days ago and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
            <li> The flat iron came in a timely fashion ordered the day after xmas recived the following tues as promised .this flat iron is ama zing takes half thr time to flat iron your hair leaving it silky smooth worth the price</li>
            <li> I am happy with the sender, product arrived on time and it was exactly what I had ordered. I LOVE this hair straightener! It&#x27;s discontinued now but I can never find anything that works as well with my hair or anything that has as wide of plates.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working fine. I will purchase again if I need. Thanks for your good service. Thanks you again!!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about it getting so hot it melted itself so I was nervous but purchased it because of the large plate size and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I have bra strap length, thick, wavy, frizzy hair that triples in size at the suggestion of moisture and won&#x27;t hold artificial curl if threatened.  I used the straightener for the first time on freshly washed, air dried hair with a smidgen of heat protestant serum at 375 degrees.  I was amazed.  It heated up almost immediately, though it took a few passes, just routine for my hair especially since I was using a low-ish temperature, but my hair never snagged, the ends didn&#x27;t frazzle, I got a little curl at the end when held at an angle and it was shiny without being greasy looking and it stayed straight until I washed it, no bedtime kinks!  From detangling to finish shake, it took me 23 minutes to straighten my hair, record time!  I would totally recommend this iron to my friend&#x27;s and family!</li>
            <li> It is very easy and fast to use.tries others in the past did come close. Expensive but very well worth it</li>
            <li> it had melting plastic seeping out all sides of the hot iron ....I did like how big and wide it was but it was not at all what I expected</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things to use on my hair, its easy to use and works on almost any hair type.</li>
            <li> Accoriding to my wife, this is a great product...she&#x27;s had other straightners, but by far, this is her favorite.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Good product. It met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have curly long hair and this flat iron works great for me!  I used the MaxiGlide for many years but decided to give this one a try because of the lower price and great reviews.  I am very glad I did.  Two thumbs up!  :)</li>
            <li> Great hair straightener for thick curly hair.  It does not do so well if you&#x27;re looking for a flat iron that works just like a Chi flat iron.  The plates of the iron do not touch together to give your hair that super straight finish, but if used along with a flat iron that has smaller plates, it works great in helping to straighten out super thick curly hair.  I love the larger size plates for initially straightening out the thick hair.  It helps speed up the normal process of straightening.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that gets wavy when it dries wet or frizzy when blow dried.  This iron is amazing at flattening out all the issues and makes my hair perfectly  straight.  Highly recommend it!  Its the perfect size for someone with medium to full hair.</li>
            <li> Since I have long hair I decided to purchase this product and it really works just like my Chi brand but because of it&#x27;s width it takes me shorter time to straighten my hair!</li>
            <li> I had this iron before, and it worked wonders.  Lasted a long time, and when it died, I went cheap-o for a few years, and was frustrated with my hair starting to frizz at the ends right after I ironed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Repurchased and used this morning, and LOVE!!!  Straight, flat, and shiny. WHY did I ever stray????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use with Tresemme heat protecting spray, lasts all day and night. I have thick, coarse, color treated hair, and this tames the beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!!!</li>
