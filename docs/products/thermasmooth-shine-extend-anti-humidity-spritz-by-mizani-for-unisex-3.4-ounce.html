            <li>It made her flat ironed hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This product really gets my hair super straight after flat ironing with my Chi.</li>
            <li>a quick note to you potential buyers</li>
            <li>Planning on using it again shortly, so I will if it turns out better on the second try.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft it felt like a wig!!</li>
            <li>Made my natural hair silky straight.</li>
            <li>With this product I was able to maintain a stick straight bob in gummy Wash DC weather, with out excessive use of heat.</li>
            <li>It not only gets my hair straight but keeps it smooth and straight for almost two weeks as long</li>
            <li>I live in Florida where it&#x27;s humid all year.</li>
            <li>It is extremely light and does not weigh down the hair at all.  </li>

            <li>My stylist used this on my natural hair</li>
            <li>I used this on my hair recently and it was raining my hair stayed straight</li>

            <li>Soft sicky hold.</li>
            <li>I used this on my natural hair a day before 2 day of not stop raining.</li>
            <li>i have tried many products before to help prevent frizziness and nothing has worked for me, i mean nothing has come close to what this product does for my hair.</li>
            <li>This spray really works for flat ironing hair.  </li>
            <li>, it gets a little frizzy but its better than any other anti humidity product iv ever used.</li>
            <li>but if I spray it section by section and then do one pass with my flat iron its like my natural hair is relaxed.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, it never gave me the long lasting straightness I needed or shine like other customers hair</li>
            <li>it really works i use it when i flat iron my hair and wrap it the next day when i take my wrap down</li>

            <li> it really works i use it when i flat iron my hair and wrap it the next day when i take my wrap down</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning from a perm &amp; I use this when I flat iron my hair &amp; it prevents my hair from frizzing.  </li>
            <li> When I went outside, it puffed up a little but not bad enough where I was not able to rock a bob.</li>
            <li> I like this oil and it works well with any flat iron or blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it doesnt require alot of spraying so there for i feel the bottle will last a long time, which is definately a pro.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is a very thick combination of curls/waves and is very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m currently using some other hair products by Mizani</li>
            <li> My hair feels dry like I&#x27;ve used a spritz.</li>
            <li> I found less expensive products that worked well against frizz (garnier smoothing milk) but the Mizani product felt significantly lighter and did not cause product build-up.  </li>
            <li> but also i didnt use a lot either not enought to make my hair wet</li>
            <li> but this  product has absolutely no affect on my hair</li>
            <li> you need to use a few other products to use this lastly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i noticed she used a lot of other Mizani products to go along with this</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is the same salon formula found in retail stores.</li>
            <li> It cut down on the friz factor and the appearance of breakage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American and it&#x27;s been about a year and a half since I relaxed my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few products I&#x27;ve used that does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> cause it can make your hair heavy</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few years ago when my stylist straightened my hair with it.  </li>
            <li> Not oily to the touch if you use small amounts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but it actually works.</li>
            <li> A little expensive for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> WOW, what a difference it makes and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad!</li>
            <li> My hair still frizzed like crazy in humidity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that Mizani could never make terrible products.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love, love this product.  My hair is fine and frizzes and when I use this it gives me shine as well as anti-frizz effects.</li>
            <li> it is what it is and it works!  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> A beautician used this on me about a year ago. I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  This is a great product to help extend your relaxer. Spray a small amount on each section of hair when blow drying or hot curling. Great sheen.  Not oily to the touch if you use small amounts.  The price on Amazon is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure if Mizani would work in my hair. I used it finally last night. My hair was so soft it felt like a wig!! Loved it. I look forward to washing my hair again.</li>
            <li> I love the thermasmooth 4 step system! Made my natural hair silky straight. My hair stayed straight for 2 weeks, it would&#x27;ve lasted longer, I just wanted to wash my hair :-)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It made my hair silky, smooth, and bouncy.  Using this all the time now.  Follow the package directions and make sure you don&#x27;t use too much or it will make your hair brittle.</li>
            <li> When I first used this it stung. Afer another use it didn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s one of the few products I&#x27;ve used that does what it says it will. All of the Mizani line is good as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> This product is great for fighting frizz and guarding against humidity. I started using it last summer when I decided to grow-out my relaxer. My natural hair is a very thick combination of curls/waves and is very prone to frizz. With this product I was able to maintain a stick straight bob in gummy Wash DC weather, with out excessive use of heat.I found less expensive products that worked well against frizz (garnier smoothing milk) but the Mizani product felt significantly lighter and did not cause product build-up.  It&#x27;s expensive but it actually works. I purchased it because a friend  flat-ironed my hair using this product and my hair remained sleek even after several days of 90 plus degree weather. In my opinion it is the star product of the Thermasmooth line.</li>
            <li> The Mizani Anti-Humidity Spritz is the best product on the market for thermal straightening of hair.  At the price I purchased it at I was able to even get additional bottles.  Five stars from me.</li>
            <li> I am very glad that I discovered this product. It is light on the hair, smells great, and very effective at reducing/eliminating effects of humididty and giving amazing shine. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This does leave my hair shiny but it has alcohol in it. I really dont see how this protects my hair from heat. My hair feels dry like I&#x27;ve used a spritz. It holds pretty well but left my hair kind of crunchy which I do not like.</li>
            <li> This worked for my hiar, I like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that Mizani could never make terrible products.</li>
            <li> The service from the vendor was great. I&#x27;ve found the product to contain too much alcohol. It hardens and dries out the hair. For me, it didn&#x27;t  ward off the effects of humidity at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help any at all whatsoever. My hair still frizzed like crazy in humidity.</li>
            <li> I literally cannot live without this stuff - I own Argan Oil, Moroccan Oil, Coconut Oil, lots of cheap shine-your-hair products ... But this is my FAVORITE. I freak out whenever I run out.</li>
            <li> i have use these product but it did not do what it advertised it would&lt;br /&gt;BUT my hairdresser uses this product on my hair&lt;br /&gt;(which is originally how i find out about this product &amp; the reason why i went out and bought it)&lt;br /&gt;and it does EXACTLY what it advertises it would&lt;br /&gt;but i noticed she used a lot of other Mizani products to go along with this so&lt;br /&gt;perhaps you need to use a few other products to use this lastly&lt;br /&gt;just a quick note to you potential buyers</li>
            <li> I like this oil and it works well with any flat iron or blow dryer.  Don&#x27;t us too much cause it can make your hair heavy but I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few years ago when my stylist straightened my hair with it.  I haven&#x27;t considered using anything else since.  No frizz, and super straight hair.  It&#x27;s MUCH cheaper on Amazon than it is in my salon.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where it&#x27;s humid all year. I have to say it works pretty well for me. I&#x27;m an African-American and it&#x27;s been about a year and a half since I relaxed my hair. When I first used this along with the serum my hair looked like I just got a perm. I was able to wrap it easily. When I went outside, it puffed up a little but not bad enough where I was not able to rock a bob. It was still straight, the puffiness actually gave it some body. If u live in a colder state,it would do an even better job for u. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product did NOT keep my hair from frizzing. Sadly, it never gave me the long lasting straightness I needed or shine like other customers hair I&#x27;d seen on YOUTUBE videos who used this product.  Planning on using it again shortly, so I will if it turns out better on the second try.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This spray really works for flat ironing hair.  I am currently transitioning from a perm &amp; I use this when I flat iron my hair &amp; it prevents my hair from frizzing.  It is extremely light and does not weigh down the hair at all.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product &amp; best prices on here! This is the only thing that work to straighten my wavy hair, love it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell &amp; the shine!</li>
            <li> i jave enjoyed using this product and i feel it has helped my hair so much with fighting humid conditions and preventing frizz. i am a lover of using straightening irons and love to keep my hair straight as i have naturally curly hair. this stuff works. it keeps my hair straight for a few days until i wash it.  i have tried many products before to help prevent frizziness and nothing has worked for me, i mean nothing has come close to what this product does for my hair. i had to buy another just in case its ever discontinued, that would just be my luck.&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt require alot of spraying so there for i feel the bottle will last a long time, which is definately a pro. i would recommend this product  to try and fight frizziness in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> i did not buy my Mizani on here but i love this product i stay in New Olreans so you know the humidity is 93 every summer so i need this it really works i use it when i flat iron my hair and wrap it the next day when i take my wrap down i spary some in my hand and put some more in the hair just to make sure it did not make my hair hard but also i didnt use a lot either not enought to make my hair wet just a lil on each part i flat ironed its amazing my hair doesnt frizz im so glad i got this because also i am natural too hopes this help you guess</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought.</li>
            <li> This product really gets my hair super straight after flat ironing with my Chi. It not only gets my hair straight but keeps it smooth and straight for almost two weeks as long I wrap my hair at night. I may never get another cream relaxer to straighten my hair again!</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m growing  my perm out but still flat ironing my hair and needed a good anti-humidity hair spray.  Iâ€™m currently using some other hair products by Mizani and they work well; but this  product has absolutely no affect on my hair the $2.99 generic can hair spray works better.</li>
            <li> Amazing, my new go to for frizz free hair</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My stylist used this on my natural hair and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. I used this on my hair recently and it was raining my hair stayed straight and my curls didn&#x27;t fall.</li>
            <li> Really love this. The only thing now is me getting from my daughter. I used it on her hair one day and haven&#x27;t seen since. She loves it. Really makes your hair light and silky. And your hair won&#x27;t frizz at all</li>
            <li> I have been STRUGGLING to keep my hair straight in this hot weather! I can&#x27;t give this product all the credit but it has helped a lot to keep my hair straight throughout the day, sometimes longer</li>
            <li> This works as well as any of the heat styling products.  A little expensive for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is the same salon formula found in retail stores. The formula per the ingrediants look different from the one I purchased from a Salon store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of Mizani products, but after I discovered my hairdresser was using this on me I decided to give it a try in my quest to recreate my salon look.  Wow.  I didn&#x27;t see that great of results using it as directed (applying it to your whole head after styling) but if I spray it section by section and then do one pass with my flat iron its like my natural hair is relaxed.  Not only that, It stays straight through my shower and that East Coast never ending rain and humidity.  It&#x27;s also extremely light, and as others have stated, has no product build up.  It&#x27;s great too if you just want to touch up your roots here and there. I waste so much money on products that don&#x27;t work, but this was a great investment.  Even better is Amazon&#x27;s great price. This will definitely be a staple for me from now on.</li>
            <li> I use the Shine Extend Anti Humidity Spritz after styling my daughter&#x27;s hair. It makes her hair shiny, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> This product was used on my hair at the salon I go to.  WOW, what a difference it makes and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad!</li>
            <li> Fiance bought this product because her stylist uses it. It cut down on the friz factor and the appearance of breakage.  She sprays onto her hand and smooth over hair. It&#x27;s pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz up they way it used to in humidity, it gets a little frizzy but its better than any other anti humidity product iv ever used.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product at a retail store originally and it works very well. Leaves hair smooth and very shiny. Got much better price from this vendor and product is as described. Will buy again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  It did help somewhat during our last humidity spell.  Don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use Mizani products all the time.  All products made by this manufacturer work for me.  I will continue to use the products because they are high quality and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I loe all of mizani products and it helps when I can find a bargain. Will continue to look for others on this site</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. No frizz with this. Soft sicky hold.</li>
            <li> As described! Great product</li>
            <li> This is one Mizani product (along with the Rose Water) that I really, really like.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time last night and I absolutely love it! My hair looks beautiful, shiny and healthy. I wish I had discovered this product sooner!!</li>
            <li> Very helpful when straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this on my natural hair a day before 2 day of not stop raining. OMG it really works. I have just tried it on my daughters permed hair and awaiting her results she goes to the gym. It made her flat ironed hair smooth and shiny.  People comments on the web about how good this is and I agree. A bit pricey but I will definitely be getting more.&lt;br /&gt;Check out the web on this product for yourself.</li>
