            <li>favorite hair product,</li>
            <li>My hair is still so smooth and lovely.</li>
            <li>It works great for straightening hair just by drying it, and I also added HSI PROFESSIONAL RATED #1 ARGAN OIL ANTI FRIZZ, ELIXIR, LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li>The best thing I&#x27;ve ever used hands down</li>
            <li>great with deep condtioning argan product.</li>
            <li>I like that it is formyldehyde free.</li>
            <li>Now it is smooth and stays that way tnanks to this product.</li>
            <li>Straightens my hair in half the time, plus leaves a beautiful shine (on &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; hair).</li>
            <li>But I read the other reviews and agree: It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>This works great and keeps my hair straight for multiple days.</li>
            <li>INSTANTLY LEAVES HAIR SILKY AND SOFT, HEAT &amp; COLOR PROTECTANT which is pure Argan oil and an excellent heat protector.</li>
            <li>this by far works the best, I wash with miracle shampoo from sally&#x27;s and condition with organix coconut milk mixed with some argan magic conditioner, than I out like a drop of this stuff in, blow dry</li>
            <li>I love this product really keep my hair straight</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I am always on the hunt for something that will last more than one day...</li>
            <li>Today its hot and humid as I reside in South Texas.</li>
            <li>Cuts my drying time, and my hair is pretty straight.</li>
            <li>It really does work, and I am sitting here after 3 days of Florida summer humidity, and my hair is still straight!</li>
            <li>Her hair is very curly</li>
            <li>She has used many other products that were supposed to the job</li>
            <li>I run a straightening iron over it just to smooth out the under layer (my hair is very fine and very thick)</li>
            <li>My hair has a natural wave and when its humid I can not make it stay straight!</li>
            <li>I live in a humid state and my &amp;#34;mostly&amp;#34; straight hair tends to get frizzy in the slightest humidity.</li>
            <li>can use and blowdry the night before and wake up to decent hair (never could w/o product).  </li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and  It keeps my hair so soft and straight.</li>
            <li>When I want to wair it straight, I use matrix sleek look shampoo and conditioner, use Argan Magic blow dry (just a little more than the directions say) and blow dry all the way.</li>
            <li>I only used about a 50cent piece worth of product on my entire head, so I will probably only get about 6-8 uses on hair shoulder length fine hair.</li>
            <li>Oh-I live in the South-this product keeps the frizzies away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest I did use a flat iron a little bit to get the shine, and desired straightness.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>it has left my hair super straight long after the keritan treatment was out of my hair</li>
            <li>I will try a heated round blow-dryer brush the next time I use this product, but I am really happy that I finally found something that actually works!</li>
            <li>I just like it extra straight.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and my naturally wavy hair tends to frizz up if I don&#x27;t apply product especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>I have medium/short hair and use a large round brush pulled straight out.when drying my hair.</li>
            <li>and it really cuts drying time down.</li>

            <li> I am an African American women with transitioning hair, so half of my hair has about 3 inches of relaxer and 6 inches of new growth.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I already have probably 30 other professional hair products stuffed in and around my bathroom.</li>
            <li> , then flat iron cause</li>
            <li> but i still have to use the flat iron.</li>
            <li> One of these rating is an African American Woman and in my opinion there is no way this will temporarily straighten coarse hair when it wont even work with my slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I usually just end up pulling my hair back in a ponytail because it&#x27;s not worth the effort of blow drying it straight.</li>
            <li> The only problem is there is not much product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toss up to how long the product would last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your hair is shorter then you would probably need a quart size, but if it&#x27;s thick you may need as much as I used.</li>
            <li> It is just a detangler to use before the blow dry.</li>
            <li> I am going to throw out every other straightening product that is filling up my shelves.</li>
            <li> I now read the other reviews and it has 3 reviews and they are 5 star.</li>
            <li> but she likes her bangs less curly &amp; this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying Infiniti by Conair SD8NP Tourmaline Ceramic Styler, Black on Amazon.</li>
            <li> the round brush may not work.</li>
            <li> helps keep frizzy wurly (that&#x27;s a messy stage b/w wavy and curly!)</li>
            <li> The product is expensive and you only get  2 oz.</li>
            <li> but they all failed.</li>

            <li> It is just a detangler to use before the blow dry. I thought the product will give me the sleek hair without using any keratin Straightener</li>
            <li> Loved this product.  I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> Awesome.  I have had keritan treatments done to my hair and using this product it has left my hair super straight long after the keritan treatment was out of my hair</li>
            <li> What a magical product! Straightens my hair in half the time, plus leaves a beautiful shine (on &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; hair). Very happy, bought two to keep at home and at the lake. I have medium/short hair and use a large round brush pulled straight out.when drying my hair. Maybe with &amp;#34;curly or wavy&amp;#34; hair the round brush may not work. But I read the other reviews and agree: It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I am an African American women with transitioning hair, so half of my hair has about 3 inches of relaxer and 6 inches of new growth. I haven&#x27;t had a relaxer in 3 years.

You guys I&#x27;m telling you I always look like I stepped out of the salon..try out y&#x27;all you&#x27;ll love it. I promise !!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year. I have naturally curly hair. When I want to wair it straight, I use matrix sleek look shampoo and conditioner, use Argan Magic blow dry (just a little more than the directions say) and blow dry all the way. Cuts my drying time, and my hair is pretty straight. I run a straightening iron over it just to smooth out the under layer (my hair is very fine and very thick) and it looks great! Oh-I live in the South-this product keeps the frizzies away. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love love this product. I have wavy hair and  It keeps my hair so soft and straight.</li>

I live in Florida and my naturally wavy hair tends to frizz up if I don&#x27;t apply product especially in the summer. I usually just end up pulling my hair back in a ponytail because it&#x27;s not worth the effort of blow drying it straight. I am always on the hunt for something that will last more than one day...this product is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I found this product. It really does work, and I am sitting here after 3 days of Florida summer humidity, and my hair is still straight! I am so happy. I am going to throw out every other straightening product that is filling up my shelves. The only problem is there is not much product.

            <li> helps keep frizzy wurly (that&#x27;s a messy stage b/w wavy and curly!) hair straight(er) and shiny.  can use and blowdry the night before and wake up to decent hair (never could w/o product).  great with deep condtioning argan product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product elsewhere and looked on Amazon to replace my supply. I really am impressed with the results of Argan Magic. It is healthier for my hair and not as drastic as keratin. I like that it is formyldehyde free. Mostly I like that is works! I have coarse curly hair that was unmanageable in the humid summers. Now it is smooth and stays that way tnanks to this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I tried it for the first time last night. I have 4b and 4c hair. Today its hot and humid as I reside in South Texas. My hair is still so smooth and lovely. I love it.</li>
            <li> Bought this item based on someone&#x27;s Amazon review. I am a caucasian male with wavy short hair. This product did NOTHING to temporarily straighten my hair. The product is expensive and you only get  2 oz. I now read the other reviews and it has 3 reviews and they are 5 star. I don&#x27;t understand these ratings. One of these rating is an African American Woman and in my opinion there is no way this will temporarily straighten coarse hair when it wont even work with my slightly wavy hair. I ended up buying Infiniti by Conair SD8NP Tourmaline Ceramic Styler, Black on Amazon. It works great for straightening hair just by drying it, and I also added HSI PROFESSIONAL RATED #1 ARGAN OIL ANTI FRIZZ, ELIXIR, LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER. INSTANTLY LEAVES HAIR SILKY AND SOFT, HEAT &amp; COLOR PROTECTANT which is pure Argan oil and an excellent heat protector. Its your money, so you have to make a decision, I am just telling you my experience.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. Will definitely order again and again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - my hair has never looked so beautiful.</li>
            <li> favorite hair product, but i still have to use the flat iron.</li>
