            <li> I love patchouli. .and am very particular about the scent. .. I know it can smell different depending on the product, and how it mixes with the individuals body chemistry.  unfortunately I did not like the smell of this one and gave me a headache. I will still be on my search for a good patchouli perfume :-(</li>

            <li> very nice scent.. . this is my twice purchase but the cap of the bottle is always opened when i got it. so I can use only 7~8ml  without 2~3m l;(</li>
            <li> Love the roll on. I also own the lotion. Will order again when I get low. This is the best Patcholi I have found so far.</li>

            <li> Beautiful smell , stays in for a long time</li>
            <li> The worst &amp;#34;patchouli&amp;#34; smell ever. My bottle smells like chemicals!!! Its such a hard to describe smell... I have never smelled patchouli like this... its so gross and such a waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed, did not last a good thirty minutes. It smells pretty good when you first apply it, but  even after adding the lotion it didn&#x27;t last past thirty minutes. Don&#x27;t waste your money !</li>
            <li> Love the patchouli.  Would buy this product again. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Patchouli is patchouli! The ease of application makes this product a cut above.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this thing for over a year and still have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> This does not have a pleasing aroma, but an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; smell.  I was hoping for a nice patchouli scent, but the scent is almost rancid.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like it but smells like cannabis to me, I apply then add some Patchouli Rose to soften the leaf smell.</li>
            <li> First, this takes the prize for one of the best product names I have ever seen! This is real patchouli, no chemical junk, and practically wears for says. If you&#x27;re a patchouli lover, you need this!</li>
            <li> When I told this company that their &amp;#34;patchouli&amp;#34; oil smelled like burnt plastic (instead of patchouli) and that I wasn&#x27;t interested in paying return shipping for a defective product, they suggested that I (a lifelong hippie) did not know what patchouli actually smelled like.</li>
            <li> It has the Patchouli scent that I love but it doesn&#x27;t last past walking out of your front door. Patchouli Gardens has a roll on that I&#x27;ll definitely go back to.</li>
            <li> The scent brought me back to late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s. to the good old days of my youth. Love it!</li>
            <li> it was ok, did not last long enough</li>
            <li> The smell was not what I expected, not patchouli as I know it.</li>
            <li> Wow, this Patchouli is the real deal.  Just like I remember it.  Smells SOOO GOOD!  Scent seems to last a long time, so don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li> Wrote I&#x27;m back in 1969 . the smell brings back so many memories. Smells better then before</li>
