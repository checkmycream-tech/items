            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t bought one of their products I didn&#x27;t love including this one....</li>
            <li>My Wife&#x27;s favorite shampoo and conditioner ever.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Needed packed better.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>just love it.</li>
            <li>All my friends love it now, too.</li>
            <li>Even better is the price.  </li>
            <li>WORKS BETTER THAN THIS</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>It feels healthier and look a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and gives me tons of volume!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel and look beautiful and soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had fine hair that just hung there and tried many volume shampoos.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for fine hair I have used for years and was so glad I could buy from Amazon as the loctions I had been buing have closed.</li>
            <li>Makes my fine hair look and feel thicker.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot it</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite formula, it contains a lot of wax and if not all of the conditioner is removed, you will notice in the morning because your hair will be really greasy!</li>
            <li>Make my hair smell so clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, it leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Came fast and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT BAD</li>
            <li>and I love ordering the salon sizes because they last me forever :)</li>
            <li>I have tried many of Joico&#x27;s shampoos &amp; conditioners and have been a fan of them all, so I like to buy a new one each time.  </li>
            <li>I switched to using Aveeno Nourish &amp; Moisturize shampoo &amp; conditioner which has calmed my skin down and honestly performed better.</li>
            <li>The experience of using Joico isn&#x27;t as good as other products, mostly because it doesn&#x27;t sud up very much, it doesn&#x27;t smell great, and it does not de-tangle my straight hair (perhaps I&#x27;m using too little?).</li>
            <li>After a while the shampoo will start building up and you have to swap shampoos for a week, but its worth it for an inexpensive salon look the rest of the time.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for anyone who has fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>My hair still isn&#x27;t growing as fast or long as I was hoping for, but it looks so much better than before!</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo and conditioner with various volumizing foams and my hair kept the Brillo Pad quality, but now I use Sebastion Thickefy after towel drying, and I love the condition of my hair with the combination of Joico Thickening shampoo and conditioner and Sebastion Thickefy foam.</li>
            <li>This product delivered pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Joico is a really good brand that does wonders for my fine hair, what this seller is trying to pass off should be illegal.</li>
            <li>After searching for reasonably priced yet salon quality shampoo/conditioner, I took a chance on Joico.</li>
            <li>The product works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is an authentic product!  </li>
            <li>It promised volume and thickness, but all I got was clean hair with a different smell.</li>
            <li>These bottles may very well last me and my shoulder-length hair a full year.</li>
            <li>I noticed that after long time use my hair has less static, is more shiny, and has a little more volume.</li>
            <li>It is very reasonable and the shampoo is far better than the more expensive brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell how much had leaked out - maybe it would have been worth it to just duct tape the hole, but then again if a significant amount of shampoo was wasted</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this particular brand of shampoo &amp; conditioner for about 2 years now</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>The shampoo completely stripped my hair and made my scalp really itchy.</li>
            <li>I live in a desert environment and this kept it hydrated without making it greasy.</li>
            <li>Made my scalp itchy and super dry.</li>
            <li>I definitely did not like it at first</li>
            <li>I bought the same product with a third of the volume by weight in the bottles and paid more for the smaller bottles at the salon.  </li>
            <li>At first, this stuff really worried me because it made my hair so rough and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I like the daily care line just a little better.</li>
            <li>I was, was is the key word coming out in fistfuls after using this shampoo &amp; conditioner it has really helped replenish my hair and make it stronger.</li>
            <li>and so far, my hair does feel softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to say it feels thicker and volumous and seems like it is so far</li>
            <li>My hair is very brittle and doesn&#x27;t seem to ever grow past my shoulders, so I decided it would be worth a try.</li>
            <li>When they changed their bottle and presumably changed their ingredients, I had major skin reactions causing breakouts all along my forehead, hairline and scalp.</li>
            <li>Ive only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I love the product,  but it was poorly packaged for shipping and the shampoo bottle cracked in transit, there was shampoo everywhere.</li>
            <li>It actually did increase the fullness if my hair and left it so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>and it made my fine hair so thick!</li>
            <li>I have very thick and fine hair</li>
            <li>I always seem to run out of conditioner faster, so I find it a little ironic.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall I really like it and plan to empty the bottles, but I&#x27;m not certain I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used these products for years and since I have baby fine hair it has been hard to find a product that truly does give body without weighting hair down.</li>
            <li> Only use a little bit, and these large bottles will last a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> , the texture of felt different in my hands, my hair didn&#x27;t feel quite how I like it, and the smell was strange.  </li>
            <li> and it definitely helps give me a little extra body.</li>
            <li> However, after using them for a few months now (these bottles last forever) they have definitely grown on me.  </li>
            <li> My hair - thin hair but LOTS of it - responded very well!</li>
            <li> It was just a big gooey mess when I got it.</li>
            <li> As for the benefits promised, I think my hair has felt thicker since starting with Joico Body Luxe a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Joico in green bottle was the only conditioner that gave me the ability to comb my hair without loosing any of</li>
            <li> As for volume, this product hasn&#x27;t made me put down the mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you can see the tops of the bottles are squished down into the bottle.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s money down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel thicker and gives volume without weighing down.</li>
            <li> so I ordered it through this seller because it was half the cost of buying in store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried different things because my hair has become very thin after six months of chemo last year.  </li>
            <li> it arrived the shampoo and conditioner were tightly bound in plastic wrap</li>
            <li> The scent is not fantastic....</li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> It was too small and the bottles got skewished.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have listened to the other review that says this product is a fake.</li>
            <li> Made my hair thin and fall out.</li>
            <li> and it is very difficult to comb it.</li>
            <li> The box this was shipped in was horrible.</li>

            <li> I usually really like Joico products, but I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with this shampoo. It promised volume and thickness, but all I got was clean hair with a different smell. The scent is not fantastic....</li>

The experience of using Joico isn&#x27;t as good as other products, mostly because it doesn&#x27;t sud up very much, it doesn&#x27;t smell great, and it does not de-tangle my straight hair (perhaps I&#x27;m using too little?). I&#x27;ll try and remember to edit this review when I finally run out and let the internet know my decision.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. It actually did increase the fullness if my hair and left it so soft and manageable.</li>

            <li> Nice product and good price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Joico. I have tried just about every product they have except this one. I ordered it, and when I opened it... I had TWO CONDITIONERS instead of a shampoo and conditioner. I always seem to run out of conditioner faster, so I find it a little ironic. Still going to have to order the shampoo again separately but that&#x27;s no judgment on the product itself. Just someone in the packaging facility not paying attention.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast. Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have used these products for years and since I have baby fine hair it has been hard to find a product that truly does give body without weighting hair down.</li>
            <li> Picture and description says 1x Shampoo and 1x Conditioner. Received 2x shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and like it so I ordered it through this seller because it was half the cost of buying in store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived the shampoo and conditioner were tightly bound in plastic wrap and you can see the tops of the bottles are squished down into the bottle. The shampoo bottle had a hole in it so there was shampoo all over. I couldn&#x27;t tell how much had leaked out - maybe it would have been worth it to just duct tape the hole, but then again if a significant amount of shampoo was wasted that&#x27;s money down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 4 stars for the product itself as I do like it, but the package it arrived would get zero stars if it were an option. I am returning the item.</li>
            <li> This product delivered pretty fast. It came as described, a set with shampoo and conditioner. Ive only used it once so far and it made my fine hair so thick! I look forward to continued use of this product. I took photos of this product I just need to figure out how to upload it...</li>
            <li> Just started using this shampoo and conditioner combo after I ran out of Bumble&amp;Bumble creme de coco. I love Joico. The smell is nice, it leaves my hair soft and silky. The price on here is amazing btw. You do get both the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular brand of shampoo &amp; conditioner for about 2 years now and I absolutely love it. I have fine hair but a lot it and it definitely helps give me a little extra body. It smells amazing and I love ordering the salon sizes because they last me forever :)</li>
            <li> I have tried many of Joico&#x27;s shampoos &amp; conditioners and have been a fan of them all, so I like to buy a new one each time.  I definitely did not like it at first, the texture of felt different in my hands, my hair didn&#x27;t feel quite how I like it, and the smell was strange.  However, after using them for a few months now (these bottles last forever) they have definitely grown on me.  Although they are at the bottom of my Joico list, I do still like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Just what I was needing. The shampoo and conditioner smell great</li>
            <li> I am hooked on Joico hair products. Haven&#x27;t bought one of their products I didn&#x27;t love including this one....</li>
            <li> At first, this stuff really worried me because it made my hair so rough and frizzy. I use this because I am a woman with very fine, thinning hair and need the volume boost. I tried this shampoo and conditioner with various volumizing foams and my hair kept the Brillo Pad quality, but now I use Sebastion Thickefy after towel drying, and I love the condition of my hair with the combination of Joico Thickening shampoo and conditioner and Sebastion Thickefy foam. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for anyone who has fine and thin hair.  It creates a lot of volume to your hair.  Only use a little bit, and these large bottles will last a long, long time.  Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used</li>
            <li> They best shampoo!!!!</li>
            <li> My Wife&#x27;s favorite shampoo and conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Used it for years. But this was leaking when it arrived. Needed packed better.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  Joico is not longer making it so I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  It does make my hair feel and look fuller.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to buy others, but keep coming back to this one. I have thin, straight hair. I noticed that after long time use my hair has less static, is more shiny, and has a little more volume. But everyone seems to notice the shine. I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this. Makes your hair feel thicker and gives volume without weighing down. No frizz either. This was a really good deal too.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and fine hair and it is very difficult to comb it. I only do it in the shower. Joico in green bottle was the only conditioner that gave me the ability to comb my hair without loosing any of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love it. All my friends love it now, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine hair that just hung there and tried many volume shampoos.  This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It really does what it says and my hair feels and looks great!  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Great shampoo and conditioner! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is really nice shampoo.  I have tried different things because my hair has become very thin after six months of chemo last year.  I have tried a lot of different shampoos to improve the thickness and I am very happy with this shampoo.  It makes my hair feel and look beautiful and soft and healthy.  I love it!  Even better is the price.  It is very reasonable and the shampoo is far better than the more expensive brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is insanely good shampoo and conditioner. After a while the shampoo will start building up and you have to swap shampoos for a week, but its worth it for an inexpensive salon look the rest of the time. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner for years now.</li>
            <li> After searching for reasonably priced yet salon quality shampoo/conditioner, I took a chance on Joico. My hair - thin hair but LOTS of it - responded very well! I live in a desert environment and this kept it hydrated without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite formula, it contains a lot of wax and if not all of the conditioner is removed, you will notice in the morning because your hair will be really greasy!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT BAD BUT I&#x27;LL GO BACK TO USING WHAT I KNOW WORKS BETTER THAN THIS...THANK YOU, ELENA</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner. Make my hair smell so clean. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have been using Joico products for some time since a relative was sending them to me as a gift. When they changed their bottle and presumably changed their ingredients, I had major skin reactions causing breakouts all along my forehead, hairline and scalp. I switched to using Aveeno Nourish &amp; Moisturize shampoo &amp; conditioner which has calmed my skin down and honestly performed better.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have listened to the other review that says this product is a fake. The shampoo completely stripped my hair and made my scalp really itchy. Joico is a really good brand that does wonders for my fine hair, what this seller is trying to pass off should be illegal. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is an authentic product!  It doesn&#x27;t smell the same nor does it work the same! Maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for about two weeks and so far, my hair does feel softer. I&#x27;d like to say it feels thicker and volumous and seems like it is so far but I may be speaking too soon. I will update my review if it changes.</li>
            <li> I use Joico Luxe. This is a knock off. Made my scalp itchy and super dry. Made my hair thin and fall out. Don&#x27;t buy this one...</li>
            <li> Came fast and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year. I love it and my hair has never been longer or healthier!!!!</li>
            <li> I was told by my hair dresser to start using this product to make my hair grow longer and stronger. My hair is very brittle and doesn&#x27;t seem to ever grow past my shoulders, so I decided it would be worth a try. I have been using it for over a year now and I can definitely see a difference in my hair. It feels healthier and look a lot better. My hair still isn&#x27;t growing as fast or long as I was hoping for, but it looks so much better than before!</li>
            <li> I love the product,  but it was poorly packaged for shipping and the shampoo bottle cracked in transit, there was shampoo everywhere. What a mess!</li>
            <li> This is a great value.  I bought the same product with a third of the volume by weight in the bottles and paid more for the smaller bottles at the salon.  Very very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Ordered this shampoo and conditioner as recommended by my hair stylist.  I love it.  It&#x27;s light and gives me tons of volume!</li>
            <li> The product works very well. I like the daily care line just a little better. (just my preference). The box this was shipped in was horrible. It was too small and the bottles got skewished. It was just a big gooey mess when I got it.</li>
