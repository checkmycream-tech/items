            <li>and since I can adjust the heat, that makes it better!</li>
            <li>I thought it was some kind of bait and switch deal</li>
            <li>in all this is a nice product.</li>
            <li>It worked okay for touch ups</li>
            <li>Love it.....</li>
            <li>Look for a better product.</li>
            <li>This has many settings to adjust to that you should never burn your hair.</li>
            <li>Wife is most satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>Works well and cleans easily.</li>
            <li>I like the easy use of it and it holding the heat just like I need and like;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it was easy to use</li>
            <li>I thought that since her hair is already straight that maybe it would work better on her hair and get rid of the frizzys and make it nice and sleek.</li>
            <li>I love my electric hot comb, it&#x27;s gets extremely hot, which is good...</li>
            <li>My comb still looks new, because i have gotten any good use out of it.  </li>
            <li>it works fine</li>
            <li>I set it to 30 (the maximum) and click on Turbo, I can do a light touch up.</li>
            <li>The metal on the comb was cheap and light weight.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how cheap it feels and it shows in the results.</li>
            <li>I like that it is light in weight and size.</li>
            <li>an the comb is too light to press anything.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about it at all!</li>
            <li>I love my hot comb.</li>
            <li>Its ok, it get really hot.</li>
            <li>My mom, really loves these hair-straightening combs, they are like no others, do a great job of keeping hair shiny and straight, thanks very much, from myself and my mom Amazon,&amp; seller.</li>
            <li>The iron gets very hot.</li>
            <li>The comb is not too large so it&#x27;s easy to handle and use.</li>
            <li>Deliver on time first time I will be using it so excited to save time and money on salon cost</li>
            <li>It does not even get hot!</li>
            <li>Within months of having it, it stopped working and even when it was &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; it didn&#x27;t do that great of a job smoothing my hair and my hair isn&#x27;t hard to smooth, but this piece of junk is just that, junk.  </li>
            <li>Yet again it simply combs through the hair, leaving the hair warm to the touch and no straighter than what it was to begin with.</li>
            <li>since i use it it is worth the price..</li>
            <li>Saving me money right now.</li>
            <li>My hair is generally very easy to straighten as it is not coarse.</li>
            <li>Great product - only need to straighten your hair once and it will remain an entire week or until you need to wash it.</li>
            <li>but NO- the whole thing gets really hot!</li>
            <li>I purchased this comb to compare to the Gold N Hot Pressing Comb.</li>
            <li>Heat up fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a hot comb before-</li>
            <li>This hot comb is just what it says.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly(takes about a minute) and can get really hot.</li>
            <li>Like I said, this comb gets really hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hot hair tools all my life.</li>
            <li>Low-end hot comb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as hot</li>
            <li>I guess it did an ok job on my roots, but overall I would have never bought it if I would&#x27;ve known that it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it should.</li>
            <li>You should really get an add bless on this hot hair.</li>
            <li>I have used hot combs all my life and you have to know the ins and outs of using such a product in order to make it user friendly - this is not.</li>
            <li>My edges are very curly and my stylist has no issue getting them straight with a stove straightening comb; there is a turbo option but still just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.     </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for my hair..</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>i really like it.</li>
            <li>I have very thick/curly Puerto Rican hair and this \\&quot;hot\\&quot; comb did not do the job.</li>
            <li>This help on the days when she wants her hair straight.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really heat up.</li>
            <li>However, if you wash and dry your hair and expect to get a nice press that will not happen because this comb does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>The button and dial placement is good(placed at the top and not at the side) and doesn&#x27;t really get in the way like other heated hair appliances that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My hair is really soft so its not hard to straighten but find that I am better off using a flat iron for my hair.</li>
            <li>it worked very well on my natural afro kinky hair, but when I tried to use it again it would not heat up I,</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to maintain the natural look and would order again</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten it very well.</li>
            <li>The only reason I rated a 4 is; Just be careful not to put your finger on top of comb while styling, there isn&#x27;t any protective plastic to rest/hold your finger.</li>
            <li>Four stars because it does not get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>and I just felt like it didn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>does not get hot enough</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do the job</li>
            <li>It did not straightened my hair at all, didn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough.</li>
            <li>this straightening comb doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>I wish it got as hot as my flat iron (420 degrees F).  </li>
            <li>Instead I gave it away as a gift and bought a real conair straightening comb from a local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>m heartbroken I tried a different brand this time I really would like a refund or exchange for this one it had to be defective,it lights up but doesn,t heat.&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
            <li>Granddaughter decided to go Natural.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>The Gold N Hot is heavier but is more expensive.</li>
            <li>Does not get hot enough to straighten my very coarse hair does not sustain heat.</li>
            <li>But I like the size of it and the low to high setting.</li>
            <li>It simply runs through my hair like a normal comb and doesnt help straighten anything.</li>
            <li>This straightening comb doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected.  </li>
            <li>not hot enough and will not be useful</li>
            <li>At the highest setting I barely straightened my hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/curly hair and after sweating my hair starts to get wavy again after it has been flat ironed.  </li>
            <li>When I first got the comb, I was little put off because it and the packaging said \\&quot;Hype</li>
            <li>but, as long it allows me to complete the job, I am not going to complain.</li>

            <li> I use it to get to the roots and then have to followup with the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Being physically challenged this is a big help as opposed to getting up and down to place it on the stove.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this straghter for long!</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is half processed and half natural</li>
            <li> Have spanish and black hair and it does nothing to my hair</li>
            <li> From the round Curling Irons, Curling Brushes and recently added the Comb.</li>
            <li> This product was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> There is certainly no risk of burning your hair with this comb.</li>
            <li> My grandma came down for Thanksgiving and asked me to straighten her hair.</li>
            <li> This is not a product for Black women&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never post reviews, I just simply live with stuff, good or bad, but this piece of crap has really been disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I usually have the comb at the 18-20 range because I have really thick, course hair but anything higher than that would be dangerous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sometimes hard to judge these things with online ordering.</li>
            <li> This straightener is not good.</li>
            <li> The worst part is how hot it get</li>
            <li> The humidity is horrible where I live.  </li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> the buttons are also in the wrong place</li>
            <li> So maybe I had the wrong idea about it!</li>
            <li> I plan on buying another one to keep in my car for a bad hair flip/flare-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!</li>

            <li> I purchased this comb to compare to the Gold N Hot Pressing Comb. I see no difference in performance but in the production. The Gold N Hot is heavier but is more expensive. I bought mine from Sally&#x27;s for $35 and I plan on returning it. The Concair does the job and saves me money.</li>
            <li> Although I have only used the item once, this product works well on African American hair.  I would recommend the purchase.</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough to straighten my very coarse hair does not sustain heat. It worked okay for touch ups</li>
            <li> Four stars because it does not get hot enough.  It I set it to 30 (the maximum) and click on Turbo, I can do a light touch up. However, if you wash and dry your hair and expect to get a nice press that will not happen because this comb does not get hot enough. This is not a product for Black women&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the comb is excellent and if all you need is a light touch up you will be happy with this comb.</li>

            <li> Horrible!!! It didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.. The worst part is how hot it get but there&#x27;s no room for error! I&#x27;ve never used a hot comb before- So maybe I had the wrong idea about it! I thought it would be like a flat iron with some type of barrier between the heat and the hair but NO- the whole thing gets really hot! Not crazy about it at all!</li>
            <li> This hot comb is just what it says. It has 30 notches of heat intensity with a turbo button for extra heat when you need it.</li>
            <li> The Conair 2013HCS Hype Hair Straightening Comb is a very good product. When I first got the comb, I was little put off because it and the packaging said \\&quot;Hype Hair\\&quot; and Conair wasn&#x27;t on it at all. I thought it was some kind of bait and switch deal and I was going to send it back. However, upon further investigation(looked at the tags and labels) I saw that the comb was indeed made by Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the comb does a really good job of straightening. It heats up quickly(takes about a minute) and can get really hot. FYI, the settings go from 1-25. I usually have the comb at the 18-20 range because I have really thick, course hair but anything higher than that would be dangerous. Like I said, this comb gets really hot. The comb is not too large so it&#x27;s easy to handle and use. The button and dial placement is good(placed at the top and not at the side) and doesn&#x27;t really get in the way like other heated hair appliances that I&#x27;ve used. The cord could be a tad bit longer though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a nice product.</li>
            <li> it worked very well on my natural afro kinky hair, but when I tried to use it again it would not heat up I,m heartbroken I tried a different brand this time I really would like a refund or exchange for this one it had to be defective,it lights up but doesn,t heat.&lt;br /&gt;buy with caution and expect it to die</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hot hair tools all my life. From the round Curling Irons, Curling Brushes and recently added the Comb. I like this comb for in-between maintenance for when humidity problem occur or parts of my hair act up. The iron gets very hot. The controls are located properly. It has a stand so you won&#x27;t burn the counter. The only reason I rated a 4 is; Just be careful not to put your finger on top of comb while styling, there isn&#x27;t any protective plastic to rest/hold your finger. And you will get a burn. I plan on buying another one to keep in my car for a bad hair flip/flare-up.</li>
            <li> Being physically challenged this is a big help as opposed to getting up and down to place it on the stove.  Now I can sit and press my hair without having to go back and for.  I like the easy use of it and it holding the heat just like I need and like;&lt;br /&gt;I do not regret the purchase and the price was fair.  Sometimes the red like blink but, as long it allows me to complete the job, I am not going to complain.</li>
            <li> The teeth weren&#x27;t long enough</li>
            <li> This straightener is not good. I have really curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten it very well. I bought it so I could straighten closer to my scalp and get the frizzys towards my hairline. DOES NOT do either. It simply runs through my hair like a normal comb and doesnt help straighten anything. My grandma came down for Thanksgiving and asked me to straighten her hair. I thought that since her hair is already straight that maybe it would work better on her hair and get rid of the frizzys and make it nice and sleek. WRONG. Yet again it simply combs through the hair, leaving the hair warm to the touch and no straighter than what it was to begin with.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in a timely manner.  The gift recipient has received it yet, so I hope that it will work well for her.  I have a feeling it may not be as sturdy as we had hoped that it would be.  It&#x27;s sometimes hard to judge these things with online ordering.</li>
            <li> Love it.....Thank you</li>
            <li> does not get hot enough</li>
            <li> Great, as great as I thought it would be. You should really get an add bless on this hot hair.</li>
            <li> This comb was a piece of junk. It does not even get hot! The metal on the comb was cheap and light weight. Dont buy it</li>
            <li> it is very good my daughter hair is more manageable now since i use it it is worth the price.. i really like it.</li>
            <li> My mom, really loves these hair-straightening combs, they are like no others, do a great job of keeping hair shiny and straight, thanks very much, from myself and my mom Amazon,&amp; seller.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do the job</li>
            <li> This straightening comb doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I expected.  I just wanted to use it in between hair do&#x27;s.  The humidity is horrible where I live.  I have naturally wavy/curly hair and after sweating my hair starts to get wavy again after it has been flat ironed.  I wanted to use this as a means just to touch my hair up.  It did not straightened my hair at all, didn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I love my hot comb. It works great. I&#x27;ve been using it for months and haven&#x27;t had any issues. I have extensions and it helps blend my hair with my extensions.</li>
            <li> Low-end hot comb. I don&#x27;t like how cheap it feels and it shows in the results. Look for a better product.</li>
            <li> I have used hot combs all my life and you have to know the ins and outs of using such a product in order to make it user friendly - this is not. The controls are in the wrong place where you cannot avoid turning the product off when gripping and using, try again.</li>
            <li> this straightening comb doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  I wish it got as hot as my flat iron (420 degrees F).  I use it to get to the roots and then have to followup with the flat iron.  Why can&#x27;t someone make a straightening comb that actually straightens African American hair!</li>
            <li> Great product - only need to straighten your hair once and it will remain an entire week or until you need to wash it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Saving me money right now. I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair appointments or spending money at a salon.</li>
            <li> It is a great comb and I use it often. I would recommend this comb for anyone with short hair.</li>
            <li> This has many settings to adjust to that you should never burn your hair. It works just as good as the one I have for the stove and since I can adjust the heat, that makes it better!</li>
            <li> not hot enough and will not be useful</li>
            <li> Very good investment. Wife is most satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as hot I would like it to get.. it works fine thou..</li>
            <li> I love my electric hot comb, it&#x27;s gets extremely hot, which is good... Thank you</li>
            <li> I never post reviews, I just simply live with stuff, good or bad, but this piece of crap has really been disappointing.  Within months of having it, it stopped working and even when it was &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; it didn&#x27;t do that great of a job smoothing my hair and my hair isn&#x27;t hard to smooth, but this piece of junk is just that, junk.  My comb still looks new, because i have gotten any good use out of it.  I wished that i could return it, but couldn&#x27;t find my receipt.</li>
            <li> I have very thick/curly Puerto Rican hair and this \\&quot;hot\\&quot; comb did not do the job. I guess it did an ok job on my roots, but overall I would have never bought it if I would&#x27;ve known that it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it should. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it if you have ethnic hair; get a hotter comb.</li>
            <li> Purchase this awhile back. Granddaughter decided to go Natural. This help on the days when she wants her hair straight.</li>
            <li> This comb burned my scalp and it did nothing for my wavy hair.  the buttons are also in the wrong place and I kept turning them off while I was using it. I do not recommend it.  It might work on some type of hairs but for me it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m Hispanic/latina with wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have not used the comb yet. But I like the size of it and the low to high setting. I like that it is light in weight and size. When I use it I will update.</li>
            <li> I wish this product got hotter....</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants to maintain the natural look and would order again it was easy to use</li>
            <li> Avoid this one. It does not heat well an the comb is too light to press anything. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> There is certainly no risk of burning your hair with this comb. At the highest setting I barely straightened my hair. My hair is generally very easy to straighten as it is not coarse. This product was a total waste of money. I&#x27;m highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its ok, it get really hot.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really heat up. Have spanish and black hair and it does nothing to my hair</li>
